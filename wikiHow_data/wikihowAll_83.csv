A composite number is a number that has more than two factors.Recall that a factor is a number that evenly divides into another number.

For example, 7 is a prime number, since the only numbers that evenly divide into 7 are 1 and 7. The number 12 is composite, since it has six factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
;
, To  create a factor tree, write the number at the top of a piece of paper. Draw a split branch coming down from the number. Write two factors on either side of the branch. Draw another split branch off any factor that is not prime, and write two factors for it on either side of the branch. Continue this process until all of the factors are prime.

For example, to factor 12, you would write 12 at the top of the paper, and draw a split branch underneath it. On either side of the branch, write the factors 2 and 6. Since 2 is prime, you do not need to factor this number any further. The number 6 can be further divided into the factors 3 and 2. Now you have three prime factors: 2, 3, and 2. These are all prime factors, so your factor tree is done.


, By looking at your factor tree, you should be able to clearly see whether the original number has more than 2 factors. If it does, it is a composite number.

For example, 12 has more factors than just 12 and 1, so it is a composite number.


, To do this, begin by dividing the number by 2. Then, divide the number by 3. Continue dividing until you find all the numbers that evenly divide into the composite number.

The divisor and quotient are each factors of the composite number (which is always the dividend in this instance).For example, to find all the factors of the number 16, you would calculate:16÷2=8{\displaystyle 16\div 2=8}16÷4=4{\displaystyle 16\div 4=4}16÷8=2{\displaystyle 16\div 8=2}The numbers 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 do not divide evenly into 16, so you are done finding your factors.


, It is helpful to list them from smallest to greatest. Remember that factors are all the numbers you evenly divided into the composite number, as well as the quotients of each of those divisions.

For the purposes of creating a divisibility rule, you can exclude the factor of 1, since every integer is divisible by 1. You can also exclude the number, since we are creating a divisibility rule for it. You also do not need to list repeated factors.

For example, the factors of 16 are 2, 4, and 8.


, The rule states that a number is divisible by any composite number if it is divisible by each of its factors.For example, the divisibility rule for 16 is that any number is divisible by 16 if it is also divisible by 2, 4, and 8.


, Every digit has a  simple test you can perform to determine whether a larger number is divisible by it.The tests for 2, 4, and 8 are interrelated.

A number is divisible by 2 if the number is even.

For example, 8 is divisible by 2 because it is an even number.



A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4.

For example, 112 is divisible by 4, since 12 is divisible by 4.



A number is divisible by 8 if the number is divisible by 4 and 2.

For example, 112 is divisible by 8, since it passed the divisibility tests for 4 and 2. (Its last two digits are divisible by 4, and it is an even number.)




, These digits have similar rules for testing their divisibility.

A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.

For example, 18 is divisible by 3, because 1+8=9{\displaystyle 1+8=9}, and 9 is divisible by 3.



A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by 2 and 3.

For example, 18 is divisible by 2 and 3, since it passed both divisibility tests for 2 and 3. (It is even, and the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.)



A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 9.

For example, 27 is divisible by 9, since 2+7=9{\displaystyle 2+7=9}, and 9 is divisible by 9. 




, Note that any number divisible by 10 is also divisible by 5.

A number is divisible by 5 if the last digit is 0 or 5.

For example, 25 is divisible by 5, because the last digit is 5.



A number is divisible by 10 if the number ends in 0.

For example, 30 is divisible by 10, since it ends in 0.




, This rule is a little more complicated than the rules for other digits, but it is helpful to know.

A number is divisible by 7 if the number you derive by doubling the last digit, and subtracting from the number made by the other digits, is divisible by 7.

For example, 91 is divisible by 7, since 1 doubled is 2, and 9−2=7{\displaystyle 9-2=7}, and 7 is divisible by 7.




, Use the divisibility tests to do this quickly. You can also manually complete the calculations using the standard division algorithm.

For example, to determine whether 486 is divisible by 16, you need to test whether 486 is divisible by 2, 4, and 8.

486 is an even number, and therefore divisible by 2.

486 is not divisible by 4, since 4 does not divide evenly into 86.

486 is not divisible by 8, since it does not pass the divisibility tests for 4 and 2.




, If the larger number is divisible by all factors, it is divisible by the composite number. If any one of the factors does not divide evenly into the larger number, it is not divisible by the composite number.

For example, since neither 4 nor 8 divides evenly into 486, you can tell that 486 is not divisible by 16.


, Determine whether 525 is divisible by 15 using this rule.

The factors of 15 are 3 and 5. Therefore, a number that is divisible by 15 is also divisible by 3 and 5.

525 is divisible by 3, since the sum of its digits is divisible by 3: 5+2+5=12{\displaystyle 5+2+5=12}; 12÷3=4{\displaystyle 12\div 3=4}.

525 is divisible by 5, since it ends in 5.

Since 525 passes the divisibility test for each factor of 15, you know that 525 is divisible by 15.


, Determine whether 162 is divisible by 18 using this rule.

The factors of 18 are 2, 3, 6, and 9. Therefore, a number that is divisible by 18 is also divisible by 2, 3, 6, and 9.

162 is divisible by 2, since it is an even number.

162 is divisible by 3, since the sum of its digits is divisible by 3: 1+6+2=9{\displaystyle 1+6+2=9}; 9÷3=3{\displaystyle 9\div 3=3}.

162 is divisible by 6, since it passes the divisibility tests for 2 and 3.

162 is divisible by 9, since the sum of its digits is divisible by 9: 1+6+2=9{\displaystyle 1+6+2=9}; 9÷9=1{\displaystyle 9\div 9=1}.

Since 162 passes the divisibility test for each factor of 18, you know that 162 is divisible by 18.


, Determine whether 261 is divisible by 21 using this rule.

The factors of 21 are 3 and 7. Therefore, a number that is divisible by 21 is also divisible by 3 and 7.

261 is divisible by 3, since the sum of its digits is divisible by 3: 2+6+1=9{\displaystyle 2+6+1=9}; 9÷3=3{\displaystyle 9\div 3=3}.

261 is not divisible by 7. The last digit (1) doubled is 2. When you subtract 2 from the number made from the remaining digits (26), you get 26−2=24{\displaystyle 26-2=24}. Since 24 is not divisible by 7, 261 is not divisible by 7.

Since 261 does not pass divisibility test for each factor of 21, you know that 261 is not divisible by 21.

Divide the difference between the two factors by 2.,
Find the number equidistant from the two factors.,
Plug the equidistant number into the difference of squares formula.,
Square the two numbers.,
Complete the subtraction.,
Check your work.",How to Easily Solve Math Problems Using Difference of Squares1," The difference of squares formula states that (x−y)(x+y)=x2−y2{\displaystyle (x-y)(x+y)=x^{2}-y^{2}}. In the formula, x{\displaystyle x} = the number equidistant from the two factors, and y{\displaystyle y} = half the difference between the two factors., Determine whether their difference is even or odd. If their difference is even, that means they are equidistant from another number, and you can use the difference of squares method.A factor is a number being multiplied by another number.

If the difference between factors is odd, then you can still use the difference of squares method to solve, but you will have to manipulate the problem, as described in Method 2.

For example, if you were multiplying 28×32{\displaystyle 28\times 32}, you could use the difference of squares method, because 28−32=−4{\displaystyle 28-32=-4}, and -4 is an even number.

It doesn’t matter if the difference is positive or negative. A difference of -4 is the same as a difference of 4. Both +/-4 are even. , Plug in this number for y{\displaystyle y} in the difference of squares formula.

For example, you already found that the difference between 28 and 32 is 4. 4÷2=2{\displaystyle 4\div 2=2}. So half the difference between the two factors is 2. Plugging in this number for y{\displaystyle y}, your formula becomes (x−2)(x+2)=x2−22{\displaystyle (x-2)(x+2)=x^{2}-2^{2}}.


, To do this, take the larger factor and subtract it by half the difference between the two factors (y{\displaystyle y} in your difference of squares formula).

For example, if the larger factor is 32, and half the difference between factors (y{\displaystyle y}) is 2, then you would find the equidistant number by subtracting 2 from 32. 32−2=30{\displaystyle 32-2=30}, so the equidistant number is 30.

You could also find the equidistant number by taking the smaller factor and adding half the difference. 


, To do this, replace all the x{\displaystyle x}s in the formula with the equidistant number.

For example, if your equidistant number is 30, your difference of squares formula will look like this: (30−2)(30+2)=302−22{\displaystyle (30-2)(30+2)=30^{2}-2^{2}}.

Note that (30−2)(30+2){\displaystyle (30-2)(30+2)} is the same as (28)(32){\displaystyle (28)(32)}, which was your original problem.


, Plug these squares into the equation. Remember, to square something means to multiply it by itself.

For example:302−22{\displaystyle 30^{2}-2^{2}}=900−4{\displaystyle 900-4}


, The result will equal the answer to your original multiplication problem.

For example, 900−4=896{\displaystyle 900-4=896}, so 28×32=896{\displaystyle 28\times 32=896}.


, You can verify your answer by using a calculator, or by solving using the standard multiplication algorithm.

Understand the concepts.,
Practice your time table daily.,
Study with friends.,
Read, recite, and review.,
Test yourself.",How to Improve Multiplication Skills1," Before you can begin improving your skill set in any area, you need to understand the underlying concept. If you simply memorize multiplication tables without understanding the math behind them, you'll have more trouble remembering your multiplication tables longterm.


Multiplication is essentially addition repeated. For example, take 8 multiplied by 3. This equation is basically 8 plus 8 plus 8, which equals 24. Therefore, 8 times 3 is 24.In addition to multiplying by whole numbers, you can multiply numbers by fractions or decimals. If you take 8 times 3.5, you're taking 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus half of 8, which is 4. This comes out to 28. Therefore, 8 times 3.5 is 28.;
, Studies show that daily practice is the best means for recall. If you want to improve your multiplication skills, practice your time table on a daily basis.Decide how high you want to be able to multiply in your head. Some people want to be able to multiply numbers only up to 10. Some people go as high as 12 to 15 and some people go even higher. Make a decision based on your own personal goals as well as your current skill level in mathematics. Then, write up a time table for yourself on a piece of scrap paper. You can also find time tables online.Each day, practice your time table. It's best to memorize tables in chunks. For example, start with the twos. Write down all the 2's from 1 to 10 every day. 2 X 1 is 2, 2 X 2 is 4, 2 X 3 is 6 and so on. The best means to memorization is repetition. The act of simply writing down your times tables each day can greatly improve your multiplication skills. Try writing down one set 10 times each day. Once you have mastered that set, move on to the next set., Studying with friends is a great way to improve any skill set including multiplication. Effective study partners can help you stay on task and give you guidance if you're struggling with a particular problem.


Choose friends who are hard workers. If you study with friends that tend to have difficulty concentrating, you're likely to distract one another. Choose study partners whose work ethic you admire.Strive to work with people who are skilled at mathematics. This way, if you're stuck or confused on a problem you can ask for their assistance., Reading, reciting, and then reviewing the material is a solid way to improve any skill set. When trying to improve multiplication skills, practice the read, recite, review method.


Read actively. Go over your multiplication tables and read each answer out loud. Try to think about the underlying concept behind the tables. For example, when reading 3 X 5 is 15, think of how 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15.When reading through your multiplication tables, pause and recite what you've just read. For example, after reading 3 X 5 equals 15 stop, look up, and say to yourself, ""Three times five is fifteen.""Review your material when you are finished. Remember, you're reviewing what you ultimately want to accomplish and not what you have already committed to memory. After you have finished reading and reciting one grouping of your multiplication table, take a moment to briefly re-read the table., Testing yourself can be an effective way to practice your multiplication skills. You can write up a test yourself of random multiplication equations. You can also find tests online. When you are finished testing yourself, grade your test. See what areas you are strongest in and where you could use improvement."

Start with a division problem inside a logarithm.,
Check for negative numbers.,
Expand the quotient into two logarithms.,
Simplify the logarithms if possible.,
Isolate the variable.,
Use additional properties of logarithms when necessary.,
Continue simplifying until you find the solution.",How to Divide Logarithms2," This section helps you solve problems that include expressions in the form loga⁡(xy){\displaystyle \log _{a}({\frac {x}{y}})}.

For example, start with this problem:""Solve for n if log3⁡(276n)=−6−log3⁡(6){\displaystyle \log _{3}({\frac {27}{6n}})=-6-\log _{3}(6)}.""


, The logarithm of a negative number is undefined. If x or y are a negative numbers, confirm that the problem has a solution before you continue:

If either x or y is negative, there is no solution to the problem.

If both x and y are negative, remove the negative signs using the property −x−y=xy{\displaystyle {\frac {-x}{-y}}={\frac {x}{y}}}

There are no logarithms of negative numbers in the example problem, so you can continue to the next step.


, One useful property of logarithms is described by the formula loga⁡(xy)=loga⁡(x)−loga⁡(y){\displaystyle \log _{a}({\frac {x}{y}})=\log _{a}(x)-\log _{a}(y)}. In other words, the log of a quotient is always equal to the log of the numerator minus the log of the denominator.Use this to expand the left side of the example problem:log3⁡(276n)=log3⁡(27)−log3⁡(6n){\displaystyle \log _{3}({\frac {27}{6n}})=\log _{3}(27)-\log _{3}(6n)}

Substitute this back into the original equation:log3⁡(276n)=−6−log3⁡(6){\displaystyle \log _{3}({\frac {27}{6n}})=-6-\log _{3}(6)}→log3⁡(27)−log3⁡(6n)=−6−log3⁡(6){\displaystyle \log _{3}(27)-\log _{3}(6n)=-6-\log _{3}(6)}


, If any of the new logarithms in the expression have an integer answer, simplify them now.

The example problem has a new term: log3⁡(27){\displaystyle \log _{3}(27)}. Since 33 = 27, simplify log3⁡(27){\displaystyle \log _{3}(27)} to 3.

The full equation is now:3−log3⁡(6n)=−6−log3⁡(6){\displaystyle 3-\log _{3}(6n)=-6-\log _{3}(6)}


, Just like any algebra problem, it helps to isolate the term with the variable on one side of the equation. Combine like terms whenever possible to simplify the equation.


3−log3⁡(6n)=−6−log3⁡(6){\displaystyle 3-\log _{3}(6n)=-6-\log _{3}(6)}9−log3⁡(6n)=−log3⁡(6){\displaystyle 9-\log _{3}(6n)=-\log _{3}(6)}log3⁡(6n)=9+log3⁡(6){\displaystyle \log _{3}(6n)=9+\log _{3}(6)}.


, To isolate the variable from other terms inside the same logarithm, rewrite the term using other logarithm properties.

In the example problem, the n is still trapped inside the term log3⁡(6n){\displaystyle \log _{3}(6n)}.In order to isolate the n, use the product property of logarithms: loga⁡(bc)=loga⁡(b)+loga(c){\displaystyle \log _{a}(bc)=\log _{a}(b)+\log {a}(c)}log3⁡(6n)=log3⁡(6)+log3⁡(n){\displaystyle \log _{3}(6n)=\log _{3}(6)+\log _{3}(n)}

Substitute this back into the full equation:log3⁡(6n)=9+log3⁡(6){\displaystyle \log _{3}(6n)=9+\log _{3}(6)}log3⁡(6)+log3⁡(n)=9+log3⁡(6){\displaystyle \log _{3}(6)+\log _{3}(n)=9+\log _{3}(6)}


, Repeat the same algebra and logarithmic techniques to solve the problem. If there is no integer solution, use a calculator and round to the nearest significant figure.


log3⁡(6)+log3⁡(n)=9+log3⁡(6){\displaystyle \log _{3}(6)+\log _{3}(n)=9+\log _{3}(6)}log3⁡(n)=9{\displaystyle \log _{3}(n)=9}Since 39 = 19683, n =19683

Locate the exponent key on your calculator.,
Type in the first exponential expression.,
Hit the addition key.,
Type in the second exponential expression.,
Hit the equal key (={\displaystyle =}).",How to Add Exponents2," This key will likely look like yx{\displaystyle y^{x}} or EXP{\displaystyle EXP}, or it may look like an x{\displaystyle x} with a blank box as the exponent. If you do not have a scientific calculator, you cannot use this method.
, To do this, hit the base number (large number) first, then hit the exponent.

For example, if your problem is 34+25{\displaystyle 3^{4}+2^{5}}, you would hit the following sequence of keys to solve the first expression:3{\displaystyle 3}yx{\displaystyle y^{x}}4{\displaystyle 4}


, This will show you the value of the first exponential expression. You do not need to hit the equal key (={\displaystyle =}) after typing in the first exponential expression.

For example, after typing in the expression 34{\displaystyle 3^{4}}, you should hit the +{\displaystyle +} symbol to see a value of 81{\displaystyle 81}.


, To do this, hit the base number (large number) first, then hit the exponent.

For example, if your problem is 34+25{\displaystyle 3^{4}+2^{5}}, you would hit the following sequence of keys to solve the second expression:2{\displaystyle 2}yx{\displaystyle y^{x}}5{\displaystyle 5}


, This will show you the final sum of the two exponential expressions.

For example, after hitting the appropriate sequence of keys, 34+25{\displaystyle 3^{4}+2^{5}} adds up to 113{\displaystyle 113}.

Find terms with the same base and the same exponent.,
Add the terms with the same base and exponent.When working with variables, there is no way to add terms that do not have the same base and the same exponent.,
Add the coefficients of the like terms.,
Write out the final, simplified addition sentence.",How to Add Exponents3," The base is the large number (or variable) in the exponential expression, and the exponent is the small number.

The exponent tells you how many times to multiply the base by itself (x3=x×x×x{\displaystyle x^{3}=x\times x\times x}).In the case of variables, an exponential expression will also have a coefficient, which is a number appearing before the variable that tells you how to multiply the variable.Even if a variable has no coefficient, it is understood to have the coefficient of 1{\displaystyle 1}. For example, x4=1x4{\displaystyle x^{4}=1x^{4}}


, The terms must have BOTH of these parts in common.

For example, if the problem is x4+3x6+4x4+2y4{\displaystyle x^{4}+3x^{6}+4x^{4}+2y^{4}}, you should note that x4{\displaystyle x^{4}} and 4x4{\displaystyle 4x^{4}} have the same base (x{\displaystyle x}) and the same exponent (4{\displaystyle 4}). Thus, these two terms can be added together. The term 3x6{\displaystyle 3x^{6}} has a different exponent, so it cannot be added; the term 2y4{\displaystyle 2y^{4}} has a different base, so it cannot be added.


, Remember, if a term has no coefficient shown, a coefficient of 1{\displaystyle 1} is understood. Do NOT add the exponents. The exponent stays the same.

For example, if you are calculating x4+4x4{\displaystyle x^{4}+4x^{4}} you would add together the coefficients, and x4{\displaystyle x^{4}} would stay the same:x4+4x4{\displaystyle x^{4}+4x^{4}}=(1)x4+(4)x4{\displaystyle =(1)x^{4}+(4)x^{4}}=5x4{\displaystyle =5x^{4}}


, Remember, you cannot add exponential expressions that do not have the same base AND exponent, so those will stay the same as they were in the original problem.

For example, x4+3x6+4x4+2y4{\displaystyle x^{4}+3x^{6}+4x^{4}+2y^{4}} simplifies to 5x4+3x6+2y4{\displaystyle 5x^{4}+3x^{6}+2y^{4}}.

Solving the perfect squares by using shapes can help you picture the problem visually and further your understanding. If you struggle with working with numbers on a page, you might find this method is more helpful to train your brain.

, Make a box that goes around several boxes on the graph paper. Just make sure the box is square in shape, with an equal number of grids on each side. Write the number of graph squares of any given side above the box you have traced. This will be the root number you are going to square.


For example, draw a box that is 3 squares long by 3 squares wide.

, Number from right to left, then top to bottom. When you have filled all the squares, you have your answer. The highest number is the square of your root number.Number all the boxes in your 3-by-3 box shape. The highest number will be 9. So, 3²=9.

Set up a difference of squares formula.,

Subtract one factor from the other.,
Divide the difference between the two factors by 2.,
Find the number equidistant from the two factors.,
Plug the equidistant number into the difference of squares formula.,
Square the two numbers.,
Complete the subtraction.,
Add the missing value to the answer.,
Check your work.",How to Easily Solve Math Problems Using Difference of Squares2," The difference of squares formula states that (x−y)(x+y)=x2−y2{\displaystyle (x-y)(x+y)=x^{2}-y^{2}}. In the formula, x{\displaystyle x} = the number equidistant from the two factors, and y{\displaystyle y} = half the difference between the two factors., If the factors are NOT equidistant from another number (that is, the difference is odd), you must follow these instructions to manipulate the difference of squares method.

A factor is a number being multiplied by another number.

For example, if you were multiplying 35×46{\displaystyle 35\times 46}, you would have to manipulate the difference of squares method, because 35−46=−11{\displaystyle 35-46=-11}, and -11 is an odd number.

If the difference between factors is even, use the shortcut described in Method 1.


, Subtracting 1 will give you two factors that are equidistant from another number, or two numbers whose difference is even. You will use this manipulated factor to follow the difference of squares method.

Do NOT subtract 1 from both factors. Only subtract 1 from one factor. It doesn’t matter which one.

For example, for 35×46{\displaystyle 35\times 46} you could subtract 46−1=45{\displaystyle 46-1=45}, so your multiplication problem becomes 35×45{\displaystyle 35\times 45}.


, Make sure you are using the manipulated factor. The difference should now be even.

For example, if your new problem, with the manipulated factor, is 35×45{\displaystyle 35\times 45}, the difference between factors is 10, since 35−45=−10{\displaystyle 35-45=-10}.

It doesn’t matter if the difference is positive or negative. A difference of -10 is the same as a difference of 10. Both +/-10 are even. , Plug in this number for y{\displaystyle y} in the difference of squares formula.

Again, make sure you are using the manipulated factor.

For example, you already found that the difference between 35 and 45 is 10. 10÷2=5{\displaystyle 10\div 2=5}. So half the difference between the two factors is 5. Plugging in this number for y{\displaystyle y}, your formula becomes (x−5)(x+5)=x2−52{\displaystyle (x-5)(x+5)=x^{2}-5^{2}}


, To do this, take the larger factor, and subtract it by half the difference between the two factors (y{\displaystyle y} in your difference of squares formula).

For example, if the larger factor is 45, and half the difference between factors (y{\displaystyle y}) is 5, then you would find the equidistant number by subtracting 5 from 45. 45−5=40{\displaystyle 45-5=40}, so the equidistant number is 40.

You could also find the equidistant number by taking the smaller factor and adding half the difference.


, To do this, replace all the x{\displaystyle x}s in the formula with the equidistant number.

For example, if your equidistant number is 40, your difference of squares formula will look like this: (40−5)(40+5)=402−52{\displaystyle (40-5)(40+5)=40^{2}-5^{2}}.

Note that (40−5)(40+5){\displaystyle (40-5)(40+5)} is the same as (35)(45){\displaystyle (35)(45)}, the multiplication problem created after manipulating one of the factors.


, Plug these squares into the equation. Remember, to square something means to multiply it by itself.

For example:402−52{\displaystyle 40^{2}-5^{2}}=1600−25{\displaystyle 1600-25}


, The result will equal the answer to the multiplication problem with the manipulated factor.

For example, 1600−25=1575{\displaystyle 1600-25=1575}, so 35×45=1575{\displaystyle 35\times 45=1575}.


, Remember, you had to change the initial problem to make the difference of squares method work. To find the answer to the original problem, you must add back in the value you subtracted from the original multiplication problem.

You are NOT adding 1 back into the problem. When you subtracted 1, you were really subtracting 1 group, since you are working with multiplication.

For example, if the original problem was 35×46{\displaystyle 35\times 46}, that means you were trying to find the value of 46 thirty-fives. When you subtracted 1, you subtracted 1 group of thirty-fives, or 35. Now you need to add that group back in. Since 1575+35=1610{\displaystyle 1575+35=1610}, you now know that 35×46=1610{\displaystyle 35\times 46=1610}.


, You can verify your answer by using a calculator, or by solving using the standard multiplication algorithm.

Learn the trick for multiplying powers of five.,
Know how to find multiples of nine easily.,
Double and halve numbers to multiply quickly.",How to Improve Multiplication Skills3," No matter how hard you work to memorize multiplication tables, sometimes memory fails. Also, you can only memorize so high in the multiplication tables. You will probably not be able to commit your multiplication tables through 26 to memory. There are a few tricks you can use to help you recall basic multiplication in a bind. One such trick involves multiplying powers of five.


Remember, 5 is the equivalent of 10/2. This means you can figure out a multiple of five in your head by multiplying that number by 10 and then dividing by 2. Remember, multiplying numbers by 10 is easy because you simply add a zero to the end of the number multiplied to find the solution.For example, take 5 times 26. To figure out the value in your head, remember that 26 times 10 is 260. Divide 260 by 2 to get 130. Therefore, 5 X 26 equals 130., There is also a trick regarding multiples of 9. The trick here is to remember than 9 is the equivalent of 10 minus 1.


Take the equation 9 X 24. As 9 is equal to 10 minus 1, we can rewrite the equation as 24 X (10-1). We can further rewrite the equation as 24 X 10 - 24, using the distributive property of mathematics.It's easy to multiply by powers of 10. We know that 24 X 10 is 240. Then, subtract 24 to get 216. Therefore, 9 X 24 equals 216., If you need to multiply big numbers quickly, doubling and halving numbers can help. By doubling one number in an equation and then halving the other, you can find the answer by hand.


Look at the equation 47 X 24. Double 47 to get 94. Half 24 to get 12. Then, repeat the process to get 188 X 6. Then again to get the problem 3 X 376. This problem is much easier to figure out by hand. The answer comes to 1, 128.If you're in a bind with a problem, simply double and halve numbers until you get an easy equation to solve by hand.

The first step is to set up the problem in the proper format.Write down the number whose cube root you want to find. Write the digits in groups of three, using the decimal point as your starting place. For this example, you will find the cube root of 10. Write this as 10. 000 000. The extra 0s are to allow precision in the solution.

Draw a cube root radical sign over the number. This serves the same purpose as the long division bar line. The only difference is the shape of the symbol.

Place a decimal point above the bar line, directly above the decimal point in the original number.
;
, You will use these in the computations. These cubes are as follows:


13=1∗1∗1=1{\displaystyle 1^{3}=1*1*1=1}


23=2∗2∗2=8{\displaystyle 2^{3}=2*2*2=8}


33=3∗3∗3=27{\displaystyle 3^{3}=3*3*3=27}


43=4∗4∗4=64{\displaystyle 4^{3}=4*4*4=64}


53=5∗5∗5=125{\displaystyle 5^{3}=5*5*5=125}


63=6∗6∗6=216{\displaystyle 6^{3}=6*6*6=216}


73=7∗7∗7=343{\displaystyle 7^{3}=7*7*7=343}


83=8∗8∗8=512{\displaystyle 8^{3}=8*8*8=512}


93=9∗9∗9=729{\displaystyle 9^{3}=9*9*9=729}


103=10∗10∗10=1000{\displaystyle 10^{3}=10*10*10=1000}


, Select a number that, when cubed, gives the largest possible result less than the first set of three numbers.In this example, the first set of three numbers is 10. Find the largest perfect cube that is less than 10. That number is 8, and its cube root is 2. 

Write the number 2 above the radical bar line, over the number 10. Write the value of 23{\displaystyle 2^{3}}, which is 8, underneath the number 10, draw a line and subtract, just as you would in long division. The result is a 2.

After the subtraction, you have the first digit of your solution. You need to decide if this one digit is a precise enough result. In most cases, it will not be. You can check by cubing the single digit and decide if that is close enough to the result you wanted. Here, because 23{\displaystyle 2^{3}} is only 8, not very close to 10, you should continue.


, Copy down the next group of three numbers into the remainder, and draw a small vertical line to the left of the resulting number. This will be the base number for finding the next digit in the solution of your cube root. In this example, this should be the number 2000, which is formed from the remainder 2 of the prior subtraction, with the group of three 0s that you pull down.To the left of the vertical line, you will be solving the next divisor, as the sum of three separate numbers. Draw the spaces for these numbers by making three blank underlines, with plus symbols between them. 


, For the first part of the divisor, write down three hundred times the square of whatever is on top of the radical sign. In this case, the number on top is 2, 2^2 is 4, and 4*300=1200. So write 1200 in the first space. The divisor for this step of the solution will be 1200, plus something that you will find next., Find the next digit of your solution by selecting what you can multiply by the divisor, 1200-something, to then subtract from the remainder of 2000. This can only be 1, since 2 times 1200 would be 2400, which is greater than 2000. Write the number 1 in the next space above the radical sign., The divisor for this step of the solution is made up of three parts. The first part is the 1200 that you already have. You need to add two more terms to that to complete the divisor.Now calculate 3 times 10 times each of the two digits that are in your solution above the radical sign. For this sample problem, that means 3*10*2*1, which is 60. Add this to the 1200 that you already have to make 1260.

Finally, add the square of the last digit. For this example, that is a 1, and 1^2 is still 1. The total divisor is, therefore 1200+60+1, or 1261. Write this to the left of the vertical line.


, Complete this round of the solution by multiplying the last digit of your solution - in this case, the number 1 - times the divisor you just calculated, 1261. 1*1261 =1261. Write this under the 2000, and subtract, to give 739.
, After you complete the subtraction portion of each step, you need to consider whether your answer is precise enough. For the cube root of 10, after the first subtraction, your cube root was just 2, which is not very precise. Now, after a second round, the solution is 2.1.You can check the precision of this result by cubing 2.1*2.1*2.1. The result is 9.261. 

If you believe your result is precise enough, you can quit. If you want a more precise answer, then you need to proceed with another round.


, In this case, for more practice and a more precise answer, repeat the steps for another round, as follows:Drop down the next group of three digits. In this case, these are three 0s, which will follow the 739 remainder to give 739,000.

Begin the divisor with 300 times the square of the number currently above the radical line. This is 300∗212{\displaystyle 300*21^{2}}, which is 132,300.

Select the next digit of your solution so that you can multiply it by 132,300 and have less than the 739,000 of your remainder. A good choice would be 5, since 5*132,300=661,500. Write the digit 5 in the next space above the radical line.

Find 3 times the prior number above the radical line, 21, times the last digit you just wrote, 5, times 10. This gives 3∗21∗5∗10=3,150{\displaystyle 3*21*5*10=3,150}.

Finally, square the last digit. This is 52=25.{\displaystyle 5^{2}=25.}

Add the parts of your divisor to get 132,300+3,150+25=135,475.


, After you have calculated the divisor for this next round and you have expanded your solution by one more digit, proceed as follows:

Multiply the divisor by the last digit of your solution. 135475*5=677,375.

Subtract. 739,000-677,375=61,625.

Consider whether the solution of 2.15 is precise enough. Cube it to get 2.15∗2.15∗2.15=9.94{\displaystyle 2.15*2.15*2.15=9.94}.


, The result above the radical is the cube root, accurate at this point to three significant figures. In this example, the cube root of 10 is 2.15. Verify that by calculating 2.15^3=9.94, which approximates 10. If you need greater accuracy, simply continue the process as long as you desire.
, If you are asked for a cube root of nearly any number, begin by selecting a perfect cube that is as near as possible, without exceeding your target number.

For example, if you want to find the cube root of 600, recall (or use a table of cube numbers) that 83=512{\displaystyle 8^{3}=512} and 93=729{\displaystyle 9^{3}=729}. Therefore, the solution for the cube root of 600 must be something between 8 and 9. You will use the numbers 512 and 729 as upper and lower boundaries for your solution.


, The first digit came from your knowledge of certain cube numbers. For the next digit, estimate some number between 0 and 9 based on where your target number falls between the two boundary numbers.

In the working example, the target of 600 falls about halfway between the boundary numbers of 512 and 729. So, select 5 for your next digit.


, Try multiplying out the estimate that you are currently working with to see how close you get to the target number.

In this example, multiply 8.5∗8.5∗8.5=614.1.{\displaystyle 8.5*8.5*8.5=614.1.}


, After cubing your last estimate, check where the result falls in comparison to your target number. If the result is over the target, you will need to drop your estimate by one or more. If the result is below the target, you may need to adjust upward until you exceed the target.

For example, in this problem, 8.53{\displaystyle 8.5^{3}} is greater than the target of 600. So you should reduce the estimate to 8.4. Cube this number and compare to your target. You will find that 8.4∗8.4∗8.4=592.7{\displaystyle 8.4*8.4*8.4=592.7}. This is now lower than your target. Therefore, you know that the cube root of 600 must be at least 8.4 but less than 8.5.


, You will continue this process of estimating digits from 0 to 9 until your answer is as precise as you want it to be. For each round of estimating, begin by noting how where your latest calculation falls between the boundary numbers.

In this working example, your last round of calculations shows that 8.43=592.7{\displaystyle 8.4^{3}=592.7}, while 8.53=614.1{\displaystyle 8.5^{3}=614.1}. The target of 600 is slightly closer to 592 than it is to 614. So for your next guess, begin by choosing a number slightly less than halfway between 0 and 9. A good guess would be 4, for a cube root estimate of 8.44.


, As many times as necessary, cube your estimate and see how it compares to your target. You want to find the numbers that are just below and just above the target number.

For this working example, begin by finding that 8.44∗8.44∗8.44=601.2{\displaystyle 8.44*8.44*8.44=601.2}. This is just barely above the target, so drop down and test 8.43. This will give you 8.43∗8.43∗8.43=599.07{\displaystyle 8.43*8.43*8.43=599.07}. Therefore, you know that the cube root of 600 is something more than 8.43 and less than 8.44.


, Continue the steps of estimating, comparing and re-estimating as long as necessary, until your solution is as precise as you desire. Notice that with each decimal place, your target numbers will be getting closer and closer to the actual number.

For the example of the cube root of 600, when you used two decimal places, 8.43, you were away from the target by less than 1. If you continue to a third decimal place, you would find that 8.4343=599.93{\displaystyle 8.434^{3}=599.93}, less than 0.1 from the true answer.


, To understand why this algorithm works for finding cube roots, you first need to recall what the cubic expansion looks like for a binomial. You probably learned this in Algebra or Algebra II in high school (and, if you’re like most people, probably forgot it soon after). Select two variables A{\displaystyle A} and B{\displaystyle B} to represent single digit numbers. Then create the binomial of (10A+B){\displaystyle (10A+B)} to represent a two digit number.Using the term 10A{\displaystyle 10A} is what creates a two digit number. Whatever digit you select for A{\displaystyle A}, 10A{\displaystyle 10A} will put that digit into the tens column. For example, if A{\displaystyle A} is 2 and B{\displaystyle B} is 6, then (10A+B){\displaystyle (10A+B)} becomes 26., We are working backward here, by creating the cube first, to then see why the solution for cube roots works. We need to find the value of (10A+B)3{\displaystyle (10A+B)^{3}}. You do this by multiplying out (10A+B)∗(10A+B)∗(10A+B){\displaystyle (10A+B)*(10A+B)*(10A+B)}. This is too lengthy to show right here, but the end result is 1000A3+300A2B+30AB2+B3{\displaystyle 1000A^{3}+300A^{2}B+30AB^{2}+B^{3}}.For more about expanding the binomial to get this result, you can see Multiply Binomials. For a more advanced, shortcut version, read Calculate (x+y)^n with Pascal's Triangle.


, Notice that the method for calculating the cube root works like long division. In long division, you find two factors that multiply together to give the product of the number you begin with. In the calculation here, the number you are solving for (the number that winds up on top of the radical sign) is the cube root. That means that it represents the (10A+B) term. The actual A and B are irrelevant for now, as long as you just recognize the relationship to the answer., When you look at the expanded polynomial, you can see why the cube root algorithm works. Recognize that the divisor of each step of the algorithm is the sum of four terms that you need to calculate and add together. These terms come about as follows:The first term contains a multiple of 1000. You first a number that could be cubed and stay within the range for the long division for the first digit. This provides the term 1000A^3 in the binomial expansion.

The second term of the binomial expansion has the coefficient of 300. (This actually comes from 3∗102{\displaystyle 3*10^{2}}.) Recall that in the cube root calculation, the first digit in each step is multiplied by 300.

The second digit in each step of the cube root calculation comes from the third term of the binomial expansion. In the binomial expansion, you can see the term 30AB^2.

The final digit of each step is the term B^3.


, As you perform the long division algorithm, each step that you complete provides more precision for your answer. For example, the sample problem worked in this article is to find the cube root of 10. In the first step, the solution is just 2, because 23{\displaystyle 2^{3}} is close, but less than 10. In fact, 23=8{\displaystyle 2^{3}=8}. After a second round, you get the solution of 2.1. When you work this out, 2.13=9.261{\displaystyle 2.1^{3}=9.261}, which is much closer to the desired value of 10. After a third round, you have 2.15, which gives 2.153=9.94{\displaystyle 2.15^{3}=9.94}. You can keep working in groups of three digits to get as precise an answer as you need."

Know the difference between logarithmic and exponential equations.,
Know the parts of a logarithm.,
Know the difference between a common log and a natural log.,
Know and apply the properties of logarithms.,
Practice using the properties.",How to Understand Logarithms," This is a very simple first step. If it contains a logarithm (for example: logax = y) it is logarithmic problem. A logarithm is denoted by the letters ""log"". If the equation contains an exponent (that is, a variable raised to a power) it is an exponential equation. An exponent is a superscript number placed after a number.


Logarithmic: logax = y
Exponential: ay = x;
, The base is the subscript number found after the letters ""log""--2 in this example. The argument or number is the number following the subscript number--8 in this example. Lastly, the answer is the number that the logarithmic expression is set equal to--3 in this equation.,



Common logs have a base of 10. (for example, log10x). If a log is written without a base (as log x), then it is assumed to have a base of 10.

Natural logs: These are logs with a base of e. e is a mathematical constant that is equal to the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity, approximately 2.718281828. (It has many more digits than those written here.) logex is often written as ln x.

Other Logs: Other logs have the base other than that of the common log and the E mathematical base constant. Binary logs have a base of 2 (for the example, log2x). Hexadecimal logs have the base of 16 (for the example log16x (or log#0fx in the notation of hexadecimal). Logs that have the 64th base are indeed quite complex, and therefore are usually restricted to the Advanced Computer Geometry (ACG) domain.

, The properties of logarithms allow you to solve logarithmic and exponential equations that would be otherwise impossible. These only work if the base a and the argument are positive. Also the base a cannot be 1 or 0. The properties of logarithms are listed below with a separate example for each one with numbers instead of variables. These properties are for use when solving equations.


loga(xy) = logax + logay
A log of two numbers, x and y, that are being multiplied by each other can be split into two separate logs: a log of each of the factors being added together. (This also works in reverse.)
Example:
log216 =
log28*2 =
log28 + log22
loga(x/y) = logax - logay
A log of a two numbers being divided by each other, x and y, can be split into two logs: the log of the dividend x minus the log of the divisor y.
Example:
log2(5/3) =
log25 - log23
loga(xr) = r*logax
If the argument x of the log has an exponent r, the exponent can be moved to the front of the logarithm.
Example:
log2(65)
5*log26
loga(1/x) = -logax
Think about the argument. (1/x) is equal to x-1. Basically this is another version of the previous property.
Example:
log2(1/3) = -log23
logaa = 1
If the base a equals the argument a the answer is 1. This is very easy to remember if one thinks about the logarithm in exponential form. How many times should one multiply a by itself to get a? Once.
Example:
log22 = 1
loga1 = 0
If the argument is one the answer is always zero. This property holds true because any number with an exponent of zero is equal to one.
Example:
log31 =0
(logbx/logba) = logax
This is known as ""Change of Base"".One log divided by another, both with the same base b, is equal to a single log. The argument a of the denominator becomes the new base, and the argument x of the numerator becomes the new argument. This is easy to remember if you think about the base as the bottom of an object and the denominator as the bottom of a fraction.
Example:
log25 = (log 5/log 2)

, These properties are best memorized by repeated use when solving equations. Here's an example of an equation that is best solved with one of the properties:
4x*log2 = log8 Divide both sides by log2.
4x = (log8/log2) Use Change of Base.
4x = log28 Compute the value of the log.
4x = 3 Divide both sides by 4.
x = 3/4 Solved. This is very helpful. I now understand logs.

Find the value of the exponent.,
Subtract 1 from the value of the exponent.,
Write this many zeroes after ""10"" and you're all done.,
Understand that the exponent is the amount of times that you multiply 10 by itself.,
Know that any number to the power of 0 is 1.",How to Figure out 10 to the Power of Any Positive Integer," Let's say that you're working with trying to find 102. In this case, the positive integer you're working with is 2., In this case, 2-1 = 1, so you're left with 1.

, You can also just think of 10x to simply be equal to the number 1 followed by x zeroes.


In this case, you can see that 102 = 100. This is because you've found the exponent, 2, subtracted 1 from it to get 1, and then added just 1 0 after ""10"" to get 100, your answer.

, To have a better understanding of how to figure out 10 to the power of any positive integer, or even to take a shortcut, all you have to know is that the exponent just shows the amount of times you'll have to multiply 10 by itself. You can also do this to find your answer.


For example: 103 = 1000 because 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000.
104 = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 or 10,000.
105 = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 100,000.
106 = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 1,000,000
107 = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10,000,000

, Though 0 is neither positive or negative, this can be an important rule to learn as you become more knowledgeable about exponents. This is as true for 100 as it is for 5,3560.


Therefore, 100 = 1, 50 = 1, 210 = 1, and so on.
You can also think of it this way: 10 to the power of 0 is 1 because 0 is the amount of zeros that go after 1 and if zero zeros are after 1, that makes the answer 1.

Add a zero in the quotient if the divisor does not go into the dividend.,
Practice with some more examples.",How to Do Short Division," To write the problem correctly, place the divisor, the number that you're dividing into another number, outside the long division bar. Place the dividend, the number that you'll be dividing by the divisor, inside the long division bar. The quotient, or your result, will go on top of the division bar. Remember that for short division to work, your divisor has to be less than 10.


For example: In 847/5, 5 is the divisor, so write it outside the division bar. 847 is the dividend, so place it inside the division bar.
The quotient is blank because you haven't started dividing yet.;
, When you divide, you are stating how many times one number can fit into another number. For example, 2 can fit into 6 three times (2 + 2 + 2 =6). Continuing with our example, 5 goes into 8 just one time, but it doesn’t evenly divide into 8. We have 3 left over. Write the number 1, the first number of the quotient, on top of the division bar. This leftover number is called the remainder.


If you were using long division, you would write out 8 minus 5 equals 3 and then bring down the 4 from the dividend. Short division simplifies this written process.

, Write a small 3 to the top right of the number 8. This will remind you that there was a remainder of 3 when you divided 8 by 5. The next number you will divide into is the combination of the remainder and the second number.


In our example, the next number is 34.

, The remainder is 3 and the second number of the dividend is 4, so the new number you'll be working with is 34.


Now, divide 34 by 5. 5 goes into 34 six times (5 x 6 =30) with a remainder of 4.
Write your quotient, 6, on the division bar to the right of the 1.
Again, keep in mind you are doing most of the math mentally.

, Just as you did the first time, simply write a small 4 above and to the right of the number 4. The next number you will be dividing by is 47.


Now, divide 47 by 5. 5 goes into 47 nine times (5 x 9 = 45) with a remainder of 2.
Write your quotient, 9, on the division bar to the right of the 6.

, Write ""r 2"" to the right of the quotient on the division bar. The final answer of 847/5 is 169 with a remainder 2.

, In some cases, the divisor will be larger than the first number of the dividend and you will not be able to divide. In this case, you will divide into the first two numbers of the dividend.


For example, 567/7. In this case, 7 doesn’t go into 5, but it does go into 56 eight times. When solving this problem, write the first number of the quotient over the 6 instead of the 5 and continue solving. The final answer is 81.

, This is similar to the first special case, except this time, you will put a zero in the middle of the quotient. If you encounter a problem like this, simply write a zero in the quotient, and try dividing with the next two numbers in the dividend until the number can be divided.For example, 3208/8, 8 goes into 32 four times, but does not go into 0. You would add a 0 and then divide into the next number. 8 goes into 8 one time, therefore, the solution would be 401.

, The best way to understand short division is practicing with many different types of problems. Below are a few more examples for you to try out.


Divide 748 by 2. How many times can 2 go into 7? Three with a remainder of 1. Write 1 next to the 4. How many times can 2 go into 14? Seven times, evenly. Two goes into 8 four times, evenly; therefore, the final answer is 374.
Divide 368 by 8. Eight doesn’t fit into 3, but it does divide into 36. Eight fits into 36 four times with a remainder of 4 (8 x 4 = 32, 36 - 32 = 4). Write the 4 next to the 9. Eight can go into 48 six times, evenly; therefore, the final answer is 46.
Divide 1228 by 4. Four doesn’t fit into 1, but it does fit into 12 three times, evenly. Four does not fit into 2, so you must add a zero in the quotient and divide four into 28. Four fits into 28 seven times; therefore, the final answer is 307.

Divide your number into perfect square factors.,
Take the square roots of your perfect square factors.,
If your number doesn't factor perfectly, reduce your answer to simplest terms.,
If needed, estimate.,
Alternatively, reduce your number to its lowest common factors as your first step.",How to Calculate a Square Root by Hand2," This method uses a number's factors to find a number's square root (depending on the number, this can be an exact numerical answer or a close estimate). A number's factors are any set of other numbers that multiply together to make it.For instance, you could say that the factors of 8 are 2 and 4 because 2 × 4 = 8. Perfect squares, on the other hand, are whole numbers that are the product of other whole numbers. For instance, 25, 36, and 49 are perfect squares because they are 52, 62, and 72, respectively. Perfect square factors are, as you may have guessed, factors that are also perfect squares. To start finding a square root via prime factorization, first, try to reduce your number into its perfect square factors.


Let's use an example. We want to find the square root of 400 by hand. To begin, we would divide the number into perfect square factors. Since 400 is a multiple of 100, we know that it's evenly divisible by 25 - a perfect square. Quick mental division lets us know that 25 goes into 400 16 times. 16, coincidentally, is also a perfect square. Thus, the perfect square factors of 400 are 25 and 16 because 25 × 16 = 400.
We would write this as: Sqrt(400) = Sqrt(25 × 16)

, The product property of square roots states that for any given numbers a and b, Sqrt(a × b) = Sqrt(a) × Sqrt(b).Because of this property, we can now take the square roots of our perfect square factors and multiply them together to get our answer.


In our example, we would take the square roots of 25 and 16. See below:

Sqrt(25 × 16)
Sqrt(25) × Sqrt(16)
5 × 4 = 20




, In real life, more often than not, the numbers you'll need to find square roots for won't be be nice round numbers with obvious perfect square factors like 400. In these cases, it may not be possible to find the exact answer as an integer. Instead, by finding any perfect square factors that you can, you can find the answer in terms of a smaller, simpler, easier-to-manage square root. To do this, reduce your number to a combination of perfect square factors and non-perfect square factors, then simplify.


Let's use the square root of 147 as an example. 147 isn't the product of two perfect squares, so we can't get an exact integer value as above. However, it is the product of one perfect square and another number - 49 and 3. We can use this information to write our answer in simplest terms as follows:

Sqrt(147)
= Sqrt(49 × 3)
= Sqrt(49) × Sqrt(3)
= 7 × Sqrt(3)




, With your square root in simplest terms, it's usually fairly easy to get a rough estimate of a numerical answer by guessing the value of any remaining square roots and multiplying through. One way to guide your estimates is to find the perfect squares on either side of the number in your square root. You'll know that the decimal value of the number in your square root is somewhere between these two numbers, so you'll be able to guess in between them.


Let's return to our example. Since 22 = 4 and 12 = 1, we know that Sqrt(3) is between 1 and 2 - probably closer to 2 than to 1. We'll estimate 1.7. 7 × 1.7 = 11.9 If we check our work in a calculator, we can see that we're fairly close to the actual answer of 12.13.

This works for larger numbers as well. For example, Sqrt(35) can be estimated to be between 5 and 6 (probably very close to 6). 52 = 25 and 62 = 36. 35 is between 25 and 36, so its square root must be between 5 and 6. Since 35 is just one away from 36, we can say with confidence that its square root is just lower than 6. Checking with a calculator gives us an answer of about 5.92 - we were right.



, Finding perfect square factors isn't necessary if you can easily determine a number's prime factors (factors that are also prime numbers). Write your number out in terms of its lowest common factors. Then, look for matching pairs of prime numbers among your factors. When you find two prime factors that match, remove both these numbers from the square root and place one of these numbers outside the square root.


As an example, let's find the square root of 45 using this method. We know that 45 = 9 × 5 and we know that 9 = 3 × 3. Thus, we can write our square root in terms of its factors like this: Sqrt(3 × 3 × 5). Simply remove the 3's and put one 3 outside the square root to get your square root in simplest terms: (3)Sqrt(5). From here, it's simple to estimate.
As one final example problem, let's try to find the square root of 88:

Sqrt(88)
= Sqrt(2 × 44)
= Sqrt(2 × 4 × 11)
= Sqrt(2 × 2 × 2 × 11). We have several 2's in our square root. Since 2 is a prime number, we can remove a pair and put one outside the square root.
= Our square root in simplest terms is (2) Sqrt(2 × 11) or (2) Sqrt(2) Sqrt(11). From here, we can estimate Sqrt(2) and Sqrt(11) and find an approximate answer if we wish.

To calculate the next digit C, repeat the process.",How to Calculate a Square Root by Hand3," This method uses a process similar to long division to find an exact square root digit-by-digit. Though it's not essential, you may find that it's easiest to perform this process if you visually organize your workspace and your number into workable chunks. First, draw a vertical line separating your work area into two sections, then draw a shorter horizontal line near the top of the right section to divide the right section into a small upper section and a larger lower section. Next, separate your number's digits into pairs, starting from the decimal point. For instance, following this rule, 79,520,789,182.47897 becomes ""7 95 20 78 91 82. 47 89 70"". Write your number at the top of the left space.


As an example, let's try calculating the square root of 780.14. Draw two lines to divide your workspace as above and write ""7 80. 14"" at the top of the left space. It's O.K. that the leftmost chunk is a lone number, rather than a pair of numbers. You will write your answer (the square root of 780.14.) in the top right space.

, Start with the leftmost ""chunk"" of your number, whether this is a pair or a single number. Find the largest perfect square that's less than or equal to this chunk, then take the square root of this perfect square. This number is n. Write n in the top right space and write the square of n in the bottom right quadrant.


In our example, the leftmost ""chunk"" is the number 7. Since we know that 22 = 4 ≤ 7 < 32 = 9, we can say that n = 2 because it's the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to 7. Write 2 in the top right quadrant. This is the first digit of our answer. Write 4 (the square of 2) in the bottom right quadrant. This number will be important in the next step.

, As with long division, the next step is to subtract the square we just found from the chunk we just analyzed. Write this number underneath the first chunk and subtract, writing your answer underneath.


In our example, we would write 4 below 7, then subtract. This gives us an answer of 3.

, Move the next ""chunk"" in the number whose square root you're solving for down next to the subtracted value you just found. Next multiply the number in the top right quadrant by two and write it in the bottom right quadrant. Next to the number you just wrote down, set aside space for a multiplication problem you'll do in the next step by writing '""_×_=""'.


In our example, the next pair in our number is ""80"". Write ""80"" next to the 3 in the left quadrant. Next, multiply the number in the top right by two. This number is 2, so 2 × 2 = 4. Write ""'4""' in the bottom right quadrant, followed by _×_=.

, You must fill each blank space you've just written in the right quadrant with the same integer. This integer must be the largest integer that allows the result of the multiplication problem in the right quadrant to be lower than or equal to the current number on the left.


In our example, filling in the blank spaces with 8, gives us 4(8) × 8 = 48 × 8 = 384. This is greater than 380. Therefore, 8 is too big, but 7 will probably work. Write 7 in the blank spaces and solve: 4(7) × 7 = 329. 7 checks out because 329 is less than 380. Write 7 in the top right quadrant. This is the second digit in the square root of 780.14.

, Continue with the long-division style chain of subtraction. Take the result of the multiplication problem in the right quadrant and subtract it from the current number on the left, writing your answer below.


In our example, we would subtract 329 from 380, which gives us 51.

, Drop the next chunk of the number you're finding the square root of down. When you reach the decimal point in your number, write a decimal point in your answer in the top right quadrant. Then, multiply the number in the top right by 2 and write it next to the blank multiplication problem (""_ × _"") as above.


In our example, since we are now encountering the decimal point in 780.14, write a decimal point after our current answer the top right. Next, drop the next pair (14) down in the left quadrant. Two times the number on the top right (27) is 54, so write ""54 _×_="" in the bottom right quadrant.

, Find the biggest digit to fill in the blanks on the right that gives an answer lesser than or equal to the current number on the left. Then, solve the problem.


In our example, 549 × 9 = 4941, which is lower than or equal to the number on the left (5114). 549 × 10 = 5490, which is too high, so 9 is our answer. Write 9 as the next digit in the top right quadrant and subtract the result of the multiplication from the number on the left: 5114 minus 4941 is 173.

, For added accuracy, continue repeating this process to find the hundredth, thousandth, etc. places in your answer. Proceed through this cycle until you find your answer to the desired decimal place.

, Because a square's area is L2 where L is the length of one of its sides, therefore, by trying to find the square root of your number, you are trying to calculate the length L of the side of that square.

, Assign the variable A as the first digit of L (the square root we are trying to calculate). B will be its second digit, C its third, and so on.

, Assign the variable Sato the first pair of digits in S (your starting value), Sb the second pair of digits, etc.

, This method of finding a square root is essentially a long division problem that divides your starting number by its square root, thus giving its square root as an answer. Just like in a long division problem, in which you are only interested by the next one digit at a time, here, you are interested by the next two digits at a time (which correspond to the next digit at a time for the square root).

, The first digit A in our answer is then the biggest integer where the square does not exceed Sa (meaning A so that A² ≤ Sa < (A+1)²). In our example, Sa = 7, and 2² ≤ 7 < 3², so A = 2.


Note that, for instance, if you wanted to divide 88962 by 7 via long division, the first step would be similar: you would be looking at the first digit of 88962 (8) and you would want the biggest digit that, when multiplied by 7, is lower than or equal to 8. Essentially, you're finding d so that 7×d ≤ 8 < 7×(d+1). In this case, d would be equal to 1.

, Your answer, the square root of your starting number, is L, which describes the length of a square with area S (your starting number). Your values for A,B,C, represent the digits in the the value L. Another way of saying this is that, for a two-digit answer, 10A + B = L, while for a three-digit answer, 100A +10B + C = L, and so on.


In our example, (10A+B)² = L2 = S = 100A² + 2×10A×B + B². Remember that 10A+B represents our answer L with B in the units position and A in the tens position. For instance, with A=1 and B=2, 10A+B is simply the number 12. (10A+B)² is the area of the whole square, while 100A² the area of the biggest square inside, B² is the area of the smallest square, and 10A×B is the area of each of the two remaining rectangles. By performing this long, convoluted process, we find the area of the entire square by adding up the areas of the squares and rectangles inside it.

, Drop one pair (Sb) of digits from S. Sa Sb is nearly the total area of the square, which you just subtracted the area of the bigger internal square from. The remainder is can be though of as the number N1, which we obtained in step 4 (N1 =380 in our example). N1 is equal to 2×10A×B + B² (area of the two rectangles plus area of the small square).

, In our example, you already know N1 (380) and A (2), so you need to find B. B is most likely not going to be an integer, so you must actually find the biggest integer B so that (2×10A + B) × B ≤ N1. So, you have: N1 < (2×10A + (B+1)) × (B+1).)

, To solve this equation, multiply A by 2, shift it in the position of the tens (which is equivalent to multiplying by 10), place B in the position of the units, and multiply the resulting number by B. In other words, solve (2×10A + B) × B. This is exactly what you do when you write ""N_×_="" (with N=2×A) in the bottom right quadrant in step 4. In step 5, you find the biggest integer B that fits on the underscore so that (2×10A + B) × B ≤ N1.

, This gives you the area S-(10A+B)² not yet accounted for (and which will be used to calculate the next digits in a similar fashion).

, Drop the next pair (Sc) from S to obtain N2 on the left, and look for the biggest C so you have (2×10×(10A+B)+C) × C ≤ N2 (equivalent to writing two times the two-digit number ""A B"" followed by ""_×_="" . Look for the biggest digit that fits in the blanks that gives an answer that is less than or equal to N2, as before.

Write down the problem.,
Multiply the number in the ones place of the bottom number by both digits of the top number.,
Write a ""0"" in the units column below the first product.,
Multiply the number in the tens place of the bottom number by both digits of the top number.,
Add up the two products.",How to Do Double Digit Multiplication," Just write one number above the other, with a little multiplication (x) sign to the left of the bottom number. Let's say you're working with the following problem: 22 x 43. Write ""22"" above 43 with a line below the 43. You can also place the other number on top -- it makes no difference when you're multiplying two two-digit numbers.;
, The ""3"" is the number in the ones place in the number 43. First, multiply 3 by the number in the ones place of the top number 22, 2, to get 6. (3 x 2 = 6.) Write a ""6"" below the 3. Then, do the same with the number in the tens place of 22, which also happens to be 2. You'll get six again. This time, write the ""6"" below the 4 to get ""66"" in the row below the multiplication bar.


Let's say you were multiplying 52 x 43 instead. Then, you would still multiply 3 by 2 to get 6, but then you would multiply the 3 by 5 to get 15. You'd get 156 in the row below the multiplication bar.
It's not always this easy. If you multiply the number in the ones place of the bottom number by the number in the ones place of the top number and get a number greater than 9, then you'll have to carry the number in the ones place of the product over to the tens place of the number in the top row.

For example, if you were multiplying 26 x 43, you would multiply 3 by 6 to get 18. You'd write the 8 below the 3, but you'd carry the 1 (the number in the tens place of the product) above the 2 in 26. Then, you'd multiply 3 by 2 to get 6, but you'd also add that extra one to get 7 in the ones place of the product. 26 x 3 = 78, so you'd write 78 underneath the multiplication bar before you move on.



, Now, place a ""0"" below the first 6 in 66. This accounts for the fact that you'll be multiplying numbers in the tens column of both the numbers 22 and 43.

, Do the same thing you did with the ""3"" of 43 with the ""4"" of 43. First, multiply the 4 by the second 2 of 22 to get 8 (4 x 2 = 8). Write the 8 down below the first 6 in 66, to the left of the zero. Then, multiply the 4 by the first 2 in 22 to get 8 again. Write the 8 to the left of the first 8 you wrote down. You'll get 66 in the top row and 880 in the row below it.


Remember that the same rules of carrying numbers apply here. If you multiplied the 4 by a number larger than 2 in the ones place, you'd get an answer larger than 9 and would have to carry the number in the tens place of the result over the number in the tens place of the top number.

, This means you'll have to add up the numbers in the two rows below the multiplication bars. You're left with 66 on top and 880 on the bottom. Just add them up to get the answer. 66 + 880 = 946, your answer. You can use your calculator or do this manually.


If you do it manually, you first add the 6 in the ones place of the first number and the 0 in the ones place of the second number to get 6 in the ones place of the final answer. Then, you add the 6 in the tens place of the top number and the 8 in the tens place of the bottom number to get 14, writing down 4 to the left of the 6 and carrying the 1 over the stand-alone 8. Then, you add 1 and 8 to get 9, which also gives you 946, your final answer.

Write 756 above 32, making sure that the ones and tens columns of both numbers line up, so that the 6 from 756 is above the 2 in 32 and the 5 in 756 is above the 3 in 32, and so on. This will make it easier for you to visualize the long multiplication process.


You will essentially begin by multiplying the 2 in 32 by each of the numbers in 756, and then multiplying the 3 in 32 by each of the numbers in 756. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.;
, Take the 2 from 32 and multiply it by the 6 in 756. The product of 6 times 2 is 12. Write the units digit, 2, under the units, and carry the 1 over the 5. Basically, you write down whatever number is in the ones digit, and if there is a number in the tens digit, you will have to carry it over the number to the left of the top number you just multiplied. You'll have a 2 directly below the 6 and the 2.

, Now, multiply 2 times 5 to equal 10. Add the 1 you carried over above the 5 to 10 to equal 11, and then write a 1 next to the 2 in the bottom row. You'll have to carry the extra 1 in the tens place over the 7.

, Now, just multiply 2 by 7 to equal 14. Then add the 1 that you carried over to 14 to equal 15. Don't carry the tens over this time, as there are no more numbers to multiply on this row. Just write the 15 on the bottom line.

, Now, you'll be multiplying the number in the tens place of 32, 3, by each digit in 756, so draw a zero below the 2 in 1512 before you begin so you are already starting in the tens place. If you were going to keep going and multiply a number in the hundreds place by the top number, then you'd need to draw two zeroes, and so on.

, Now, multiply 3 by 6 to equal 18. Again, put the 8 on the line, and carry the 1 over above the 5.

, Multiply 3 times 5. This makes 15, but you must add on the carried 1, so it equals 16. Write the 6 on the line, and carry the 1 over above the 7.

, Multiply 3 times 7 to equal 21. Add the 1 you carried to equal 22. You don't need to carry the 2 in 22, as there are no more numbers to multiply on this line, so you can just write it down next to the 6.

, Now, you'll have to simply add up 1512 and 22680. First, add 2 plus 0 to equal 2. Write the result in the ones column.

, Now, add up 1 and 8 to equal 9. Write 9 to the left of the 2.

, The sum of 5 and 6 is 11. Write down the 1 in the units place and carry the 1 in the tens place over 1 at the very left of the first product.

, Add up 1 plus 2 to equal 3 and then add on the 1 you carried over to equal 4. Write it down.

, The first number has nothing in the ten thousands place, and the second has 2 there. So, add 0 plus 2 to equal 2 and write it down. This gives you 24,192, your final answer.

, If you want to double check your work, type in the problem into a calculator to see if you've done it correctly. You should get 756 times 32 equals 24,192. You're all done!

Ex: 136 ÷ 3;
, In this case, you can't divide 3 into 1, so you need to place a 0 on the top of the division bar and keep going. Subtract 0 from 1 by placing it below the 1 and place a 1 below it since 1-0 = 0.








, Since you couldn't divide 3 into 1, 1 remains. You'll have to carry the 3 down. Now, divide 3 into 13. 3 goes into 13 4 times to make 12 with a remainder of 1, so write a 4 on top of the long division bar, to the right of the 0. Then, subtract 12 from 13 and write 1 below it, since 1 is your remainder.








, Carry the 6 down to join the 1, creating 16. Now, divide 3 into 16. You'll get 5 with another remainder of 1, because 3 x 5 = 15, and 16-15 is one.








, Your final answer is 45 with a remainder of 1, or 45 R1.

Draw a table with a x b number of columns and rows, respectively.,
Align the digits of the multiplicand with the columns and place it on top of the table.,
Create a diagonal path for the tables.,
Multiply the numbers using the distributive method.,
Start adding the numbers on the same diagonal paths.,
Combine the digits of the answer.",How to Do Lattice Multiplication," The number a corresponds ot the number of digits of the multiplicand (number being multiplied) and b to the digits of the multiplier (number doing the multiplying).


The multiplicand is the first number in a multiplication operation while the multiplier is the last number.
For the sake of formality, number the cells from the left to the right, then from the top to the bottom.
So the first cell is located on the first row and first column, the second cell is located on the first row but on the second column, and so on and so forth.
For a clearer understanding, let’s try an example. Suppose you want to multiply 789 with 461.
Since they both have three digits, your table will be a 3 x 3.;
, Also, align the digits of the multiplier with the rows and place them on the right side of the table.


For example:

, For the first cell, draw a line from the top most right corner going down to the left.


For the second cell, also draw a line from the top most right side going to the left until it reaches the last cell on its left.
Repeat this process for the remaining cells. Your table should be full of right triangles by now.
Following Step 2 and Step 3, you now place the digits on their respective sides and create the diagonal paths as well.

, Multiply the first number of the multiplicand, and the first number of the multiplier.


If the answer is less than 10, write the answer on the lower triangle and write 0 on the upper triangle.
If the answer is more than 10, write the first digit of the answer on the upper triangle of the cell, and the second digit on the lower triangle.
Then, multiply the first digit of the multiplicand to the succeeding digits of the multiplier. Repeat the same step for the next digits of the multiplicand.
Following the example, you multiply the digits of the multiplicand and the multiplier.

, Start from the last triangle of the last cell, then go up the table.


Place the answer on the left side of the diagonal paths.
If the answer exceeds ten, write the last number of the answer on the same left side while “carrying over” the second digit to the next diagonal path.
Following your example, look at the last cell. Since it contains only the number 9, you just copy that and it will serve as one of the digits of your final answer.
Now, look at the second diagonal path from the bottom. To get a digit for the final answer, let’s add them: 8+0+4=12.
Since the answer of that diagonal path is greater than ten, you ought to retain the last digit, 2, and carry over the first digit, 1, to the next diagonal path.
Then, repeat the procedure for all remaining diagonal paths.

, Go from the top to the bottom, then from left to right.


Simply combine the numbers side by side.
To get the final answer, just combine the numbers going from top to bottom, then left to right. Therefore: 789 x 461 = 363,729

Write down the problem.,
Split up the smaller number into tens and ones.,
Multiply the larger number by the number in the tens digit.,
Multiply the larger number by the number in the ones digit.,
Add up the two products.",How to Do Long Multiplication2," Let's say you're multiplying 325 times 12. Write it down. One number should be right next to the other, not below it.

, Keep 325 and split up 12 into 10 and 2. The 1 is in the tens digit, so you should add a 0 afterward to keep its place, and since the 2 is in the ones place, you can just write down 2.

, Now, multiply 325 times 10. All you have to do is add a zero to the end to equal 3250.

, Now, just multiply 325 by 2. You can eyeball it and see that the answer is 650, since 300 times 2 is 600 and 25 times 2 is 50. Add up 600 and 50 to equal 650.

, Now, just add up 3250 and 650. You can do this using the good old fashioned addition method. Just write 3250 over 650 and do all the work. You'll get 3,900. Really, this is similar to doing the standard long multiplication, but splitting up a number into ones and tens allows you to do a bit more of the math in your head and to avoid multiplying and carrying too much. Either method will yield the same results, and it all depends on which one works more quickly for you.

518 ÷ 4

, 5 ÷ 4 = 1 R1. Place the quotient, 1, above the long division bar. Write the remainder above the first number of the dividend. Place a small 1 above the 5, to remind yourself that you had a remainder of 1 when you divided 5 by 4. 518 should now look like this: 5118








, The next number is 11, using the remainder of 1 and the second number of the dividend. 11 ÷ 4 = 2 R 3, because 4 x 2 = 8 with 3 left over. Write the next remainder above the second number of the dividend. Place the 3 above the 1. The original dividend, 518, should now look like this: 51138








, The remaining number is 38 -- the remainder 3 from the previous step and the number 8 as the last term of the dividend. 38 ÷ 4 = 9 R2, because 4 x 9 = 36, which is 2 short of 38. Write ""R2"" at the top of the division bar.








, You can find your final answer, the quotient, at the top of the division bar. It's 518 ÷ 4 = 129 R2.

Ex: 3/4 ÷ 5/8

, The second fraction becomes its own reciprocal.









Ex: 3/4 ÷ 8/5

, To divide fractions, you're essentially multiplying the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.









Ex: 3/4 x 8/5

, Just do exactly what you would do to multiply two fractions.









Ex: 3 x 8 = 24

, Finish the process of multiplying the two fractions.









Ex: 4 x 5 = 20

, Now that you've multiplied the numerators and denominators of both fractions, you can form the product of the two fractions.









Ex: 3/4 x 8/5 = 24/20

, To reduce the fraction, find the greatest common factor, or the largest number that divides evenly into both numbers, and then divide both numbers by that number. In the case of 24 and 20, 4 is the largest number that goes evenly into both numbers. You can confirm this by writing out all of the factors of both numbers and circling the largest number that is a factor of both:









24: 1, 2, 3, 4,6, 8, 12, 24
20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20

Since 4 is the GCF of 24 and 20, just divide both numbers by 4 to reduce the fraction.
24/4 = 6
20/4 = 5
24/20 = 6/5



, To do this, simply divide the denominator into the numerator and write the answer as your whole number. The remainder, or the number that is left over, will be the numerator of the new fraction. The denominator of the fraction will remain the same. Since 5 goes into 6 one time with a remainder of 1, the new whole number is 1 and the new numerator is 1, creating a mixed number of 1 1/5.









Ex: 6/5 = 1 1/5

Write the problem.,
Change the divisor to a whole number.,
Change the dividend by moving its decimal point by the same amount.,
Place a decimal point on the long division bar directly above the decimal in the dividend.,
Solve the problem by doing simple long division.",How to Do Division5," Place the divisor, the number you'll be dividing, outside the long division bar, and the dividend, the number that you'll be dividing it into, inside the long division bar. To divide decimals, your goal will be to first convert the decimals into whole numbers.









Ex: 65.5 ÷ .5

, Simply move the decimal point over one unit to change .5 into 5, or 5.0.








, Since you moved the decimal point from .5 over one unit to the right to make it a whole number, move the decimal point from 65.5 over one unit to the right to make it 655.









If you move the decimal point of a dividend over past all of its digits, then you need to write an extra zero for every space that the point moves. For example, if you move the decimal point of 7.2 over three spaces, then 7.2 becomes 7200 because you've moved the decimal point over two empty spaces.

, Since you moved the decimal point over just one unit to make .5 a whole number, you should place the decimal on top of the long division bar in the place where you moved the decimal point, just after the last 5 in 655.








, To long divide 5 into 655 do the following:









Divide 5 into the hundredths digit, 6. You get 1 with a remainder of 1. Place 1 in the hundredths place on top of the long division bar, and subtract 5 from 6 below the number six.
Your remainder, 1, is left over. Carry the first five in 655 down to create the number 15. Divide 5 into 15 to get 3. Place the three above the long division bar, next to the 1.
Carry down the last 5. Divide 5 into 5 to get 1, and place the 1 on top of the long division bar. There is no remainder since 5 goes into 5 evenly.
The answer is the number above the long division bar. 655 ÷ 5 = 131. Note that this is also the answer to the original division problem, 65.5 ÷ .5.

Determine the dividend and the divisor.,
Place the dividend under a long division symbol.,
Divide the dividend by 2.,
Multiply the number on top of the long division symbol by the divisor.,
Convert the remainder to a fraction.",How to Divide Odd Numbers by 21," The dividend is the number you are dividing, the divisor is the number you are dividing by.In this instance, the odd number will be the dividend, and the divisor will be 2.

For example, if you are calculating 17÷2{\displaystyle 17\div 2}, the dividend is 17, and the divisor is 2.
;
, A long division symbol looks like the left and top side of a box. Place the divisor on the outside of the long division symbol, to the left of the box.

For example: 2)17¯{\displaystyle 2{\overline {)17}}}.


, Since you can’t divide an odd number by 2, you need to find the greatest number of times 2 will divide evenly into the dividend. Use the multiples of 2 to help you determine what this number is. Place this number on top of the division symbol.

For example, the greatest number of times 2 can divide evenly into 17 is 8, since 2×8=16{\displaystyle 2\times 8=16}. So you should place 8 on top of the long division symbol.


, Place this number below the dividend and subtract. The difference is your remainder. When you divide an odd number by 2, you will always have a remainder of 1.For example, 2×8=16{\displaystyle 2\times 8=16} and 17−16=1{\displaystyle 17-16=1}, So 17÷2=8r1{\displaystyle 17\div 2=8r1}.


, To do this, change the remainder into the numerator of a fraction. The denominator of the fraction will be the divisor, in this case, 2.You can change this fraction to a decimal as well. The fraction 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} always converts to 0.5{\displaystyle 0.5}.

For example, 17÷2=8r1{\displaystyle 17\div 2=8r1}.By turning the remainder into a fraction, you get 17÷2=812{\displaystyle 17\div 2=8{\frac {1}{2}}}.By turning the fraction into a decimal, you get 17÷2=8.5{\displaystyle 17\div 2=8.5}

Set up a fraction.,
Use one radical sign.,
Divide the radicands.,
 Simplify, if necessary.",How to Divide Square Roots1," If your expression is not already set up like a fraction, rewrite it this way. This makes it easier to follow all the necessary steps when dividing by a square root. Remember that a fraction bar is also a division bar.For example, if you are calculating 144÷36{\displaystyle {\sqrt {144}}\div {\sqrt {36}}}, rewrite the problem like this: 14436{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {144}}{\sqrt {36}}}}.
;
, If your problem has a square root in the numerator and denominator, you can place both radicands under one radical sign.(A radicand is a number under a radical, or square root, sign.) This will simplify the simplifying process.

For example, 14436{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {144}}{\sqrt {36}}}} can be rewritten as 14436{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {144}{36}}}}.


, Divide the numbers as you would any whole number. Make sure to place their quotient under a new radical sign.

For example, 14436=4{\displaystyle {\frac {144}{36}}=4}, so 14436=4{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {144}{36}}}={\sqrt {4}}}.


, If the radicand is a perfect square, or if one of its factors is a perfect square, you need to simplify the expression. A perfect square is the product of a whole number multiplied by itself.For example, 25 is a perfect square, since 5×5=25{\displaystyle 5\times 5=25}.

For example, 4 is a perfect square, since 2×2=4{\displaystyle 2\times 2=4}. Thus:4{\displaystyle {\sqrt {4}}}=2×2{\displaystyle ={\sqrt {2\times 2}}}=2{\displaystyle =2}So, 14436=4=2{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {144}}{\sqrt {36}}}={\sqrt {4}}=2}.

Write down the problem.,
Subtract the second exponent from the first.,
State your final answer.,
Make sure that each expression has the same base.,
Divide expressions with multiple variables.,
Divide expressions with coefficients.,
Divide expressions with negative exponents.",How to Divide Exponents," The most simple version of this problem will be in the form of ma ÷ mb. In this case, you're working with the problem m8 ÷ m2. Write it down.;
, The second exponent is 2 and the first is 8. So, you can rewrite the problem as m8-2., Since 8 - 2 = 6, your final answer is m6. It's that simple. If you're not working with a variable and have an actual number in the base, such as 2, then you would have to do the math (26 = 64) to finish solving the problem.

, If you're working with different bases, then you cannot divide the exponents. Here's what you need to know:


If you're working with a problem with variables, such as m6 ÷ x4, then there's nothing more you can do to simplify it.
However, if the bases are numbers and not variables, you may be able to manipulate them so you end up with the same base. For example, in the problem, 23 ÷ 41, you first have to make both bases be ""2."" All you do is rewrite 4 as 22 and do the math: 23 ÷ 22 = 21, or 2.

You can only do this, however, if you can turn the larger base into an expression of squared numbers to make it have the same base as the first.



, If you have an expression with multiple variables, then you just have to divide the exponents from each identical base to get your final answer. Here's how you do it:x6y3z2 ÷ x4y3z =
x6-4y3-3z2-1 =
x2z

, As long as you're working with the same base, it's no problem if each expression has a different coefficient. Just divide the exponents as you normally would and divide the first coefficient by the second. Here's how:


6x4 ÷ 3x2 =
6/3x4-2 =
2x2


, To divide expressions with negative exponents, all you have to do is move the base to the other side of the fraction line. So, if you have 3-4 in the numerator of a fraction, you'll have to move it to the denominator. Here are two examples:Example 1:

x-3/x-7 =
x7/x3 =
x7-3 =
x4




Example 2:

3x-2y/xy =
3y/(x2 * xy) =
3y/x3y =
3/x3

Write the problem with a division box.,
Move the divisor's decimal point the amount of spaces that it would take to make the number whole.,
Move the decimal of the dividend the same amount of spaces as the divisor.,
Move the decimal point directly up above the division bar.,
Divide as usual.,
Check your work.",How to Divide Decimals," The first thing you should do is to write the problem with a division box, so that the dividend, or the number that you're dividing by another number, is inside the division bar, and that the divisor, or the number that you're dividing the number by, is outside the division bar. In this case, the problem is ""4.5 ÷ 0.05"" so you can write ""0.05"" outside the division bar and ""4.5"" inside the division bar.;
, For the number 0.05, you'd need to move the decimal point two spaces to the right, so the number becomes 5.

, Now, move the decimal point in the number 4.5 over to the right two times, so the number becomes 450. You'll need to add an extra zero to make up for the empty space. This doesn't happen every time -- for example, if you needed to move the decimal point in the number 4.25 over two times, it would simply become 425.

, Move the decimal point that remained after the number 450, so it's directly above the place after the 0.

, Just finish the division process while taking the decimal point above the division bar into effect. First, since you can't divide 5 by 4, you'll need to move on to divide 5 into the first two digits, 45. 5 happens to go into 45 nine times, so write the number 9 on the division bar, leaving a space for the next number before the decimal point. Then, since you're left with 00 and five goes into those numbers 0 times, write another 0 to the right of the 9 on the division bar. You have your answer -- 90.0, or just 90.

, Now that you know that the quotient, or answer, is 90.0. You can check your work by using your calculator to divide 4.5 by .05, which should give you 90 as an answer if the answer is correct (it is). You can also multiply the quotient by the divisor to make sure that you get the dividend, and you do. 90 x .05 =4.5

Let's say you're solving 3472 ÷ 15. Ask ""Does 15 fit into 3?"" Since 15 is definitely larger than 3, the answer is ""no"" and we move on to the next step.;
, Since you can't fit a two-digit number into a one-digit number, we'll look at the first two digits instead, just like we would in a regular division problem. If you still have an impossible division problem, you'll need to look at the first three digits instead, but we don't need to for our example:


Does 15 fit into 34? Yes, it does, so we can start calculating the answer. (The first number doesn't have to fit perfectly, it just needs to be smaller than the second number.)

, Find out exactly how many times the first number fits into the other. You might know the answer already, but if you don't, try making a good guess and checking your answer with multiplication.


We need to solve 34 ÷ 15, or ""how many times does 15 go into 34""? You're looking for a number you can multiply with 15 to get a number less than 34, but pretty close to it:

Does 1 work? 15 x 1 = 15, which is less than 34, but keep guessing.
Does 2 work? 15 x 2 = 30. This is still less than 34, so 2 is a better answer than 1.
Does 3 work? 15 x 3 = 45, which is greater than 34. Too high! The answer must be 2.



, If you set this up like a long division problem, this should feel familiar.


Since you were calculating 34 ÷ 15, write the answer, 2, on the answer line above the ""4.""

, This is the same as a normal long division problem, except we'll be using a two-digit number.


Your answer was 2 and the smaller number in the problem is 15, so we calculate 2 x 15 = 30. Write ""30"" underneath the ""34.""

, The last thing you wrote went underneath the original larger number (or part of it). Treat this as a subtraction problem and write the answer on a new line underneath.


Solve 34 - 30 and write the answer underneath them on a new line. The answer is 4. This 4 is still ""left over"" after we fit 15 into 34 two times, so we'll need to use it in the next step.

, Just like a regular division problem, we're going to keep calculating the next digit of the answer until we've finished.


Leave the 4 where it is and bring down the ""7"" from ""3472"" to make 47.

, To get the next digit, just repeat the same steps you did above for the new problem. You can use guesswork again to find the answer:


We need to solve 47 ÷ 15:

47 is bigger than our last number, so the answer will be higher. Let's try four: 15 x 4 = 60. Nope, too high!
We'll try three instead: 15 x 3 = 45. Smaller than 47 but close to it. Perfect.
The answer is 3, so we'll write that about the ""7"" on the answer line.


(If we ended up with a problem like 13 ÷ 15, with the first number smaller, we would need to bring down a third digit before we could solve it.)

, Repeat the long division steps we used before to multiply our answer by the smaller number, write the result underneath the larger number, and subtract to find the next remainder.


Remember, we just calculated 47 ÷ 15 = 3, and now we want to find what's left over:
3 x 15 = 45, so write ""45"" underneath the 47.
Solve 47 - 45 = 2. Write ""2"" underneath the 45.

, As before, we bring down the next digit from the original problem so we can solve the next division problem. Repeat the steps above until you find every digit in the answer.


We've got 2 ÷ 15 as our next problem, which doesn't make much sense.
Bring down a digit to make 22 ÷ 15 instead.
15 goes into 22 one time, so we write ""1"" at the end of the answer line.
Our answer is now 231.

, One last subtraction problem to find the final remainder, then we'll be done. In fact, if the answer to the subtraction problem is 0, you don't even need to write a remainder at all.


1 x 15 = 15, so write 15 underneath the 22.
Calculate 22 - 15 = 7.
We have no more digits to bring down, so instead of more division we just write ""remainder 7"" or ""R7"" at the end of our answer.
The final answer: 3472 ÷ 15 = 231 remainder 7







, It's not always easy to see how many times a two-digit number goes into a larger one. One useful trick is to round to the nearest multiple of 10 to make guessing easier. This comes in handy for smaller division problems, or for parts of a long division problem.


For example, let's say we're solving 143 ÷ 27, but we don't have a good guess at how many times 27 goes into 143. Let's pretend we're solving 143 ÷ 30 instead.

, In our example, we can count by 30s instead of counting by 27s. Counting by 30 is pretty easy once you get the hang of it: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150.


If you find this difficult, just count by threes and add a 0 to the end.
Count until you get higher than the larger number in the problem (143), then stop.

, We didn't hit 143 exactly, but we got two numbers close to it: 120 and 150. Let's see how many fingers we counted on to get them:


30 (one finger), 60 (two fingers), 90 (three fingers), 120 (four fingers). So 30 x four = 120.
150 (five fingers), so 30 x five = 150.
4 and 5 are the two most likely answers to our problem.

, Now that we have two good guesses, let's try them out on the original problem, which was 143 ÷ 27:


27 x 4 = 108
27 x 5 = 135

, Since both our numbers ended up below 143, let's try getting even closer by trying one more multiplication problem:


27 x 6 = 162. This is higher than 143, so it can't be the right answer.
27 x 5 came closest without going over, so 143 ÷ 27 = 5 (plus a remainder of 8, since 143 - 135 = 8.)

For example, if you want to know many divisors, or factors, the number 24 has, write 24{\displaystyle 24} at the top of the page.
;
, These are two divisors, or factors, of the number. Draw a split branch coming down from the original number, and write the two factors below it.

For example, 12 and 2 are factors of 24, so draw a split branch coming down from 24{\displaystyle 24}, and write the numbers 12{\displaystyle 12} and 2{\displaystyle 2} below it.


, A prime factor is a number that is only evenly divisible by 1 and itself.For example, 7 is a prime number, because the only numbers that evenly divide into 7 are 1 and 7. Circle any prime factors so that you can keep track of them.

For example, 2 is a prime number, so you would circle the 2{\displaystyle 2} on your factor tree.


, Keep drawing branches down from the non-prime factors until all of your factors are prime. Circle the prime numbers to keep track of them.

For example, 12 can be factored into 6{\displaystyle 6} and 2{\displaystyle 2}. Since 2{\displaystyle 2} is a prime number, you would circle it. Next, 6{\displaystyle 6} can be factored into 3{\displaystyle 3} and 2{\displaystyle 2}. Since 3{\displaystyle 3} and 2{\displaystyle 2} are prime numbers, you would circle them.


, To do this, look for multiples of each prime factor in your factor tree. The number of times the factor appears equals the exponent of the factor in your exponential expression.For example, the prime factor 2{\displaystyle 2} appears three times in your factor tree, so the exponential expression is 23{\displaystyle 2^{3}}. The prime factor 3{\displaystyle 3} appears 1 time in your factor tree, so the exponential expression is 31{\displaystyle 3^{1}}.


, The original number you are working with is equal to the product of the exponential expressions.

For example 24=23×31{\displaystyle 24=2^{3}\times 3^{1}}.


, The equation is d(n)=(a+1)(b+1)(c+1){\displaystyle d(n)=(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)}, where d(n){\displaystyle d(n)} is equal to the number of divisors in the number n{\displaystyle n}, and a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c} are the exponents in the prime factorization equation for the number.You might have less than three or more than three exponents. The formula simply states to multiply together whatever number of exponents you are working with.


, Be careful to use the exponents, not the prime factors.

For example, since 24=23×31{\displaystyle 24=2^{3}\times 3^{1}}, you would plug in the exponents 3{\displaystyle 3} and 1{\displaystyle 1} into the equation. Thus the equation will look like this: d(24)=(3+1)(1+1){\displaystyle d(24)=(3+1)(1+1)}.


, You are simply adding 1 to each exponent.

For example:d(24)=(3+1)(1+1){\displaystyle d(24)=(3+1)(1+1)}d(24)=(4)(2){\displaystyle d(24)=(4)(2)}


, The product will equal the number of divisors, or factors, in the number n{\displaystyle n}.

For example:d(24)=(4)(2){\displaystyle d(24)=(4)(2)}d(24)=8{\displaystyle d(24)=8}So, the number of divisors, or factors, in the number 24 is 8.

The dividend is divided by the divisor, and the answer is the quotient.
Compare the divisor to the first digit in the dividend. If the divisor is the larger number, keep adding digits to the dividend until the divisor is the smaller number. (For example, if calculating 172 ÷ 4, we would compare 4 and 1, note that 4 > 1, and compare 4 to 17 instead.)
Write the first digit of the quotient above the last dividend digit you were using in the comparison. Comparing 4 and 17, we see that 4 goes into 17 four times, so we write 4 as the first digit of our quotient, above the 7.
Multiply and subtract to find the remainder. Multiply the quotient digit with the divisor, in this case 4 x 4 = 16. Write the 16 underneath the 17, then subtract 17 - 16 to find the remainder, 1.
Repeat. Once again, we compare the divisor 4 with the next digit, 1, note that 4 > 1, and ""bring down"" the next digit of the dividend, to compare 4 with 12 instead. 4 goes into 12 three times with no remainder, so we write 3 as the next digit of the quotient. The answer is 43.;
, Let's use the example 10101 ÷ 11. Write this as a long division problem, with the 10101 as the dividend and the 11 as the divisor. Leave space above to write the quotient, and below to write your calculations.

, This works just like a decimal long division problem, but it's actually quite a bit easier in binary. Either you can't divide the number by the divisor (0) or the divisor can go in one time (1):


11 > 1, so 11 can't ""go into"" 1. Write a 0 as the first digit of the quotient (above the first digit of the dividend).

, Here are the next couple steps to our example:


Bring down the next digit of the dividend. 11 > 10. Write a 0 in the quotient.
Bring down the next digit. 11 < 101. Write a 1 in the quotient.

, As in decimal long division, we multiply the digit we just found (1) with the divisor (11), and write the result underneath our dividend aligned with the digit we just calculated. In binary, we can shortcut this, since 1 x the divisor always equals the divisor:


Write the divisor underneath the dividend. Here, we write 11 aligned underneath the first three digits (101) of the dividend.
Calculate 101 - 11 to get the remainder, 10. See how to subtract binary numbers if you need a review.

, Bring down the next digit of the divisor to the remainder to make 100. Since 11 < 100, write a 1 as the next digit of the quotient. Continue the problem as before:


Write 11 underneath the 100 and subtract to get 1.
Bring down the final digit of the dividend to make 11.
11 = 11, so write a 1 as the final digit of the quotient (the answer).
There is no remainder, so the problem is complete. The answer is 00111, or simply 111.

, Sometimes, the result is not an integer. If you still have a remainder after using the final digit, add a "".0"" to the dividend and a ""."" to your quotient, so you can bring down another digit and continue. Repeat until you reach the desired specificity, then round the answer. On paper you can round down by chopping off the last 0, or if the last digit is a 1, drop it and add 1 to the new last digit. In programming, follow one of the standard algorithms for rounding to avoid errors when converting between binary and decimal numbers.Binary division problems often end up with repeating fractional portions, more often than they occur in decimal notation.This is referred to with the more general term ""radix point,"" which applies in any base, since the ""decimal point"" is only used in the decimal system."

Turn the number you are dividing into an even number +1.An odd number will always have a remainder of 1 when dividing by 2.,
Divide the even number by 2.,
Add 0.5 to the quotient.",How to Divide Odd Numbers by 22," So breaking up the number in this way helps you divide the number quickly, since an even number will have no remainder when dividing by 2. To break up the number into an even number +1, subtract 1 from the number.

For example, if you are calculating 75÷2{\displaystyle 75\div 2}, break up 75{\displaystyle 75} into 74+1{\displaystyle 74+1}.


, You will likely be able to do this in your head, since it will divide evenly. The easiest way to do it is to take half of the tens and half of the ones, then add them together.

For example, half of 70 is 35, and half of 4 is 2, so 74÷2=35+2=37{\displaystyle 74\div 2=35+2=37}.


, Since 1÷2=0.5{\displaystyle 1\div 2=0.5} to reach your final answer, you need to add the two parts together: the even number divided by 2, and 1 divided by 2.

For example, 37+0.5=37.5{\displaystyle 37+0.5=37.5}. So, 75÷2=37.5{\displaystyle 75\div 2=37.5}.

Write the number in expanded notation.,
Divide the hundreds place by 2.,
Divide the tens place by 2.,
Break up the number in the ones place into an even number +1.,
Add the quotients for for all the place values.,
Add 0.5 to the sum.",How to Divide Odd Numbers by 23," Expanded notation is breaking up the number to show the value of each digit, according to its place value.For example, 655=600+50+5{\displaystyle 655=600+50+5}.


, Or, if you have a larger number, begin with the largest place value, such as thousands or ten thousands. You will likely be able to complete this division in your head. If not, you can calculate it quickly by hand. Since the number ends in 0, it is even and will be evenly divisible by 2. Set this quotient aside for now.

For example, 600÷2=300{\displaystyle 600\div 2=300}.


, You will likely be able to do this in your head, but you can also do it by hand if need be. Since the number is a multiple of 10 it will be evenly divisible by 2. Set this quotient aside for now.

For example, 50÷2=25{\displaystyle 50\div 2=25}.  


, Then, divide the even number by 2. You should have no remainder; the remainder is the +1 you removed when you broke up the number.

For example, 5=4+1{\displaystyle 5=4+1}. Now, dividing the even number, you should calculate 4÷2=2{\displaystyle 4\div 2=2}.


, Since you expanded the number into place values, and divided each place value individually by 2, now you have to add them back together again.

For example, 300+25+2=327{\displaystyle 300+25+2=327}.


, Since you removed the remainder of 1 from the ones place before dividing by 2, you now have to take half of that 1 and add it back into your final answer.

For example, 327+0.5=327.5{\displaystyle 327+0.5=327.5}.

Express the problem as a fraction.,
 Factor each radicand.,
Simplify the numerator and denominator of the fraction.,
Rationalize the denominator, if necessary.,
Simplify further, if necessary.",How to Divide Square Roots2," You will likely already see the expression written this way. If not, change it. Solving the problem as a fraction makes it easier to follow all the necessary steps, especially when factoring the square roots. Recall that a fraction bar is also a division bar.For example, if you are calculating 8÷36{\displaystyle {\sqrt {8}}\div {\sqrt {36}}}, rewrite the problem like this: 836{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {8}}{\sqrt {36}}}}.


, Factor the number as you would any whole number. Keep the factors under the radical signs.For example:836=2×2×26×6{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {8}}{\sqrt {36}}}={\frac {\sqrt {2\times 2\times 2}}{\sqrt {6\times 6}}}}


, To  simplify a square root, pull out any factors that make a perfect square. A perfect square is the result of a whole number multiplied by itself.The factor will now become a coefficient outside of the square root.

For example: 2×2×26×6{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {{\cancel {2\times 2\times }}2}}{\sqrt {\cancel {6\times 6}}}}} 226{\displaystyle {\frac {2{\sqrt {2}}}{6}}}So, 836=226{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {8}}{\sqrt {36}}}={\frac {2{\sqrt {2}}}{6}}} 


, As a rule, an expression cannot have a square root in the denominator. If your fraction has a square root in the denominator, you need to rationalize it. This means to cancel out the square root in the denominator. To do this, multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the square root you need to cancel.For example, if your expression is 623{\displaystyle {\frac {6{\sqrt {2}}}{\sqrt {3}}}}, you need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}} to cancel the square root in the denominator:623×33{\displaystyle {\frac {6{\sqrt {2}}}{\sqrt {3}}}\times {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{\sqrt {3}}}}=62×33×3{\displaystyle ={\frac {6{\sqrt {2}}\times {\sqrt {3}}}{{\sqrt {3}}\times {\sqrt {3}}}}}=669{\displaystyle ={\frac {6{\sqrt {6}}}{\sqrt {9}}}}=663{\displaystyle ={\frac {6{\sqrt {6}}}{3}}}.


, Sometimes you will be left with coefficients that can be simplified, or  reduced. Simplify the whole numbers in the numerator and denominator as you would simplify any fraction.

For example, 26{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}} reduces to 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}}, so 226{\displaystyle {\frac {2{\sqrt {2}}}{6}}} reduces to 123{\displaystyle {\frac {1{\sqrt {2}}}{3}}}, or simply 23{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {2}}{3}}}.

Simplify the coefficients.,
 Simplify the square roots.,
Multiply the simplified coefficient(s) by the simplified square root.,
Cancel the square root in the denominator, if necessary.",How to Divide Square Roots3," These are the numbers outside of the radical sign. To simplify them, divide or  reduce, ignoring the square roots for now.For example, if you are calculating 432616{\displaystyle {\frac {4{\sqrt {32}}}{6{\sqrt {16}}}}}, you would first simplify 46{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{6}}}. The numerator and denominator can both be divided by a factor of 2. So, you can reduce: 46=23{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{6}}={\frac {2}{3}}}.


, If the numerator is evenly divisible by the denominator, simply divide the radicands. If not, simplify each square root as you would any square root.For example, since 32 is evenly divisible by 16, you can divide the square roots:3216=2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {32}{16}}}={\sqrt {2}}}.


, Remember that you cannot have a square root in a denominator, so when multiplying a fraction by a square root, place the square root in the numerator.For example, 23×2=223{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}\times {\sqrt {2}}={\frac {2{\sqrt {2}}}{3}}}.


, This is called rationalizing the denominator. As a rule, an expression cannot have a square root in the denominator. To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the square root you need to cancel.For example, if your expression is 4327{\displaystyle {\frac {4{\sqrt {3}}}{2{\sqrt {7}}}}}, you need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 7{\displaystyle {\sqrt {7}}} to cancel the square root in the denominator:437×77{\displaystyle {\frac {4{\sqrt {3}}}{\sqrt {7}}}\times {\frac {\sqrt {7}}{\sqrt {7}}}}=43×77×7{\displaystyle ={\frac {4{\sqrt {3}}\times {\sqrt {7}}}{{\sqrt {7}}\times {\sqrt {7}}}}}=42149{\displaystyle ={\frac {4{\sqrt {21}}}{\sqrt {49}}}}=4217{\displaystyle ={\frac {4{\sqrt {21}}}{7}}}


"
"
Determine that you have a binomial in the denominator.,
Find the conjugate of the binomial.,
Multiply the numerator and denominator by the denominator’s conjugate.",How to Divide Square Roots4," The denominator will be the number in the problem you are dividing by. A binomial is a two-termed polynomial.This method only applies to division of square roots involving a binomial.

For example, if you are calculating 15+2{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5+{\sqrt {2}}}}}, you have a binomial in the denominator, since 5+2{\displaystyle 5+{\sqrt {2}}} is a two-termed polynomial.


, Conjugate pairs are binomials that have the same terms, but opposite operations.Using a conjugate pair will allow you to cancel the square root in the denominator.

For example, 5+2{\displaystyle 5+{\sqrt {2}}} and 5−2{\displaystyle 5-{\sqrt {2}}} are conjugate pairs, since they have the same terms but opposite operations.


, Doing this will allow you to cancel the square root, because the product of a conjugate pair is the difference of the square of each term in the binomial.That is, (a−b)(a+b)=a2−b2{\displaystyle (a-b)(a+b)=a^{2}-b^{2}}.

For example:15+2{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5+{\sqrt {2}}}}}=1(5−2)(5+2)(5−2){\displaystyle ={\frac {1(5-{\sqrt {2}})}{(5+{\sqrt {2}})(5-{\sqrt {2}})}}}=5−2(52−(2)2{\displaystyle ={\frac {5-{\sqrt {2}}}{(5^{2}-({\sqrt {2}})^{2}}}}=5+225−2{\displaystyle ={\frac {5+{\sqrt {2}}}{25-2}}}=5+223{\displaystyle ={\frac {5+{\sqrt {2}}}{23}}}Thus, 15+2=5+223{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5+{\sqrt {2}}}}={\frac {5+{\sqrt {2}}}{23}}}.

Understand the basic concept.,
Learn to subtract by complements.,
Combine the two concepts above.,
Subtract the divisor from the dividend, by adding twos' complement.,
Add one to the quotient.,
Repeat by subtracting the divisor from the remainder.",How to Divide Binary Numbers2," One way to solve division problems – in any base – is to keep subtracting the divisor from the dividend, then the remainder, while tallying up the number of times you can do so before getting a negative number. Here's an example in base ten, solving the problem 26 ÷ 7:


26 - 7 = 19 (subtracted 1 time)
19 - 7 = 12 (2)
12 - 7 = 5 (3)
5 - 7 = -2. Negative number, so back up. The answer is 3 with a remainder of 5. Note that this method does not calculate any non-integer portion of the answer.

, While you can easily use the method above in binary, we can subtract by a more efficient method as well, which saves time when programming computers to divide binary numbers. This is the subtraction by complements method in binary. Here are the basics, calculating 111 - 011 (make sure both numbers are the same length):


Find the ones' complement of the second term, subtracting each digit from 1. This is easily done in binary by switching each 1 to 0 and each 0 to 1.In our example, 011 becomes 100.
Add one to the result: 100 + 1 = 101. This is called the twos complement, and lets us perform subtraction as an addition problem.Essentially, the result is as though we added a negative number instead of subtracting a positive one, once we finish the process.
Add the result to the first term. Write and solve the addition problem: 111 + 101 = 1100.
Discard the carry digit. Discard the first digit of your answer to get the final result. 1100 → 100.

, Now you know the subtraction method of solving division problems, and the twos' complement method of solving subtraction problems. You can combine this into one method for solving division problems, using the steps below.If you like, you can try to figure it yourself before you continue.

, Let's go through the problem 100011 ÷ 000101. The first step is solving 100011 - 000101, using the twos' complement method to turn it into an addition problem:


Twos' complement of 000101 = 111010 + 1 = 111011
100011 + 111011 = 1011110
Discard carry bit → 011110

, In a computer program, this is the point where you increment the quotient by one. On paper, make a note somewhere in a corner where it won't get confused with your other work. We've successfully subtracted one time, so the quotient so far is 1.

, The result of our last calculation is the remainder left over after the divisor ""went in"" once. Continue adding the twos' complement of the divisor each time and discarding the carry bit. Add one to the quotient each time, repeating until you get a remainder that's equal to or smaller than your divisor:011110 + 111011 = 1011001 → 011001 (quotient 1+1=10)
011001 + 111011 = 1010100 → 010100 (quotient 10+1=11)
010100 + 111011 = 1001111 → 001111 (11+1=100)
001111 + 111011 = 1001010 → 001010 (100+1=101)
001010 + 111011 = 10000101 → 0000101 (101+1=110)
0000101 + 111011 = 1000000 → 000000 (110+1=111)
0 is smaller than 101, so we stop here. The quotient 111 is the answer to the division problem. The remainder is the final result of our subtraction problem, in this case 0 (no remainder).

You can think of this as repeated addition, where the number four will be repeated 3 times. But you are adding the number the amount of times you want to multiply it by.;
, Knowing that each of the four groups have three objects, add 4 three times. 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Example: What is 3 ÷ 1.2?;
, Write a decimal point after the whole number, than write zeroes after the decimal point. Do this until both numbers have the same number of places to the right of the decimal point. This does not change the value of the whole number.



Example: In the problem 3 ÷ 1.2, our whole number is 3. Since 1.2 has one place to the right of the decimal point, rewrite 3 as 3.0, so it also has one place after the decimal. Now our problem is 3.0 ÷ 1.2.
Warning: do not add zeros to the left of the decimal point! 3 is the same as 3.0 or 3.00, but it is not the same as 30 or 300.

, In division problems, you're allowed to move the decimal points, but only if you move them by the same amount for each number. This lets you turn the problem into whole numbers.



Example: To turn 3.0 ÷ 1.2 into whole numbers, move the decimal points one space to the right. 3.0 becomes 30, and 1.2 becomes 12. Now our problem is 30 ÷ 12.

, Put the dividend (usually the larger number) under the long division symbol. Write the divisor outside it. Now you have an ordinary long division problem using whole numbers. If you want a reminder of how to do long division, read the next section.

, Start solving this just as you would normally, by comparing the divisor to the first digit of the dividend. Calculate the number of times the divisor goes into this digit, then write this number above that digit.



Example: We're trying to fit 12 into 30. Compare 12 to the first digit of the divisor, 3. Since 12 is larger than 3, it goes into it 0 times. Write 0 above the 3, on the answer line.

, Write the product (the answer to the multiplication problem) down below the dividend. Write it directly below the first digit of the dividend, since this is the digit you just looked at.



Example: Since 0 x 12 = 0, write 0 underneath the 3.

, Subtract the product you just found from the digit directly above it. Write the answer on a new line below.



Example: 3 - 0 = 3, so write 3 directly below the 0.

, Bring the next digit of the dividend down next to the number you just wrote.



Example: Our dividend is 30. We've already looked at the 3, so the next digit to bring down is 0. Bring this down next to your 3 to make 30.

, Now repeat the first step of this section to find the second digit of your answer. This time, compare the divisor to the number you just wrote down on the lowest line.



Example:' How many times does 12 fit into 30? The closest we can get is 2, since 12 x 2 = 24. Write 2 in the second spot of the answer line.
If you're not sure what the answer is, try some multiplication problems until you find the largest answer that fits. For example, if it seems like 3 is about write, multiply out 12 x 3 and you'll get 36. This is too big, since we're trying to fit within 30. Try the next one down, 12 x 2 = 24. This does fit, so 2 is the correct answer.

, This is the same long division process used above, and for any long division problem:


Multiply the new digit on your answer line by the divisor: 2 x 12 = 24.
Write the product on a new line below your dividend: Write 24 directly underneath 30.
Subtract the lowest line from the one above it: 30 - 24 = 6, so write 6 on a new line underneath.

, If there's still another digit left in your dividend, bring it down and continue solving the problem the same way. If you've reached the end of the answer line, go to the next step.



Example: We just wrote 2 at the end of the answer line. Go to the next step.

, If the numbers divided evenly, your last subtraction problem has ""0"" as the answer. That means you're done, and you have a whole number as the answer to your problem. But if you've reached the end of the answer line and there's still something left to divide, you'll need to extend the dividend by adding a decimal point followed by a 0. Remember, this does not change the value of the number.



Example: We're at the end of the answer line but the answer to our last subtraction problem is ""6."" Extend the ""30"" under the long division symbol by adding "".0"" to the end. Write a decimal point at the same spot on the answer line as well, but don't write anything after it yet.

, The only difference here is that you must bring the decimal point up to the same spot on the answer line. Once you've done that, finding the remaining digits of the answer is exactly the same.



Example: Bring down the new 0 down to the last line to make ""60."" Since 12 goes into 60 exactly 5 times, write 5 as the last digit on our answer line. Don't forget that we put a decimal on our answer line, so 2.5 is the final answer to our problem.

Calculate actual slope with the formula (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). You have just created an {x, y} Cartesian Graph. Select cell AA1 and type Y, which pertains to all those columnar values. Format Cells Font Bold. Select cell B26 and type X, which pertains to those vertical values. Now the rightmost Y is actually point Y25 and the bottom X is point X25.
You will learn to adjust the slope formula to the endpoints when you first study slope of lines, so we're going to change the formula to (Y25 - Y1)/(X25 - X1). Filling in the values of those data point references, we have Y25=50, Y1=2, X25 = 25 and X1=2. The formula thus becomes (50-2)/(25-2) or 48/23 = 2.087, which is slope m1, the slope of the red series line. For the black series line, Y25=625, Y1=25, X25=25 and X1=2, so the formula's values become (625-25)/(25-2), or 620/23 which equals 26.957 or slope m25. You can perform this division right in Excel by preceding it with an equals sign, somewhere off to the side.
A slope m of 1 is a straight 45º diagonal from {X1, Y1} = {0, 0} through each pair of similar matching numbers, like {4, 4} or {25, 25). Then the formula become (25-0)/(25-0) = 1/1 and slope m=1. You can see that the product of a and n for the first 25 numbers produces a range of slopes from 2.087 up to 26.957, which is fairly steep. Your chart probably does not show how truly steep it is because it is not a square of 625 x 625 but is cut off so that it's only got a width of 30. If we were to change the horizontal axis by double-clicking on it and setting the Max to 625, you'd see how very steep a slope of nearly 27 actually is, and the lines would be all crowded together. That is why the lines ""fan out"" as they do, because their slopes m are different and the chart is foreshortened. In school, you may learn one formula for a line is y= mx + b or you may learn it as y= ax +b; m and a stand for the slope in either case. The slope is determined by (Y2 - Y1)/(X2 - 1 ), not by x*y or a*n. The true slopes of the topmost and bottom lines are accurately calculated.

Leave yourself plenty of space below the equation to carry out multiple subtraction operations.
Here's an example: if there are six mushrooms in a 250 gram pack, how much does each mushroom weigh on average? In this case, we must divide 250 by 6. The 6 goes on the outside, and the 250 on the inside.;
, Working from left to right, determine how many times the divisor can go into the first digit of the dividend without exceeding it.


In our example, you'd want to determine how many times 6 goes into 2. Since six is larger than two, the answer is zero. If you wish, may write a 0 directly above the 2 as a place-holder, and erase it later. Alternatively, you can leave that space blank and move on to the next step.

, If the divisor is a larger number than the first digit, determine how many times the divisor goes into the first two digits of the dividend without exceeding it.


If your answer to the previous step was 0, as in the example, expand the number by one digit. In this case, we'd ask how many times 6 can go into 25.
If your divisor has more than two digits, you'll have to expand out even further, to the third or maybe even fourth digit of the dividend in order to get a number that the divisor goes into.
Work in terms of whole numbers. If you use a calculator, you'll discover that 6 goes into 25 a total of 4.167 times. In long division, you always round down to the nearest whole number, so in this case, our answer would be 4.

, Put the number of times the divisor goes into the first digit (or digits) of the dividend above the appropriate digit(s).It is important in long division to make sure the columns of numbers remain correctly aligned. Work carefully, otherwise you may make an error that leads you to the wrong answer.
In the example, you would place a 4 above the 5, since we're putting 6 it into 25.

, The divisor should be multiplied by the number you have just written above the dividend. In our example, this is the first digit of the quotient., Put the result of your multiplication in step 1 beneath the dividend.


In the example, 6 times 4 is 24. After you've written a 4 in the quotient, write the number 24 beneath the 25, again being careful to keep the numbers aligned., A line should be placed beneath the product of your multiplication, 24 in the example.

, Subtract the number you just wrote below the dividend from the digits of the dividend directly above it. Write the result beneath the line you just drew.In the example, we'll subtract 24 from 25, getting 1.
Do not subtract from the complete dividend, but only those digits you worked with in Parts One and Two. In the example, you should not subtract 24 from 250.

, Write the next digit of the dividend after result of your subtraction operation.In the example, because 6 can't go into 1 without exceeding it, you need to bring down another digit. In this case, you'll grab the 0 from 250 and place it after the 1, making it 10, which 6 can go into.

, Divide the new number by your divisor, and write the result above the dividend as the next digit of the quotient.In the example, determine out how many times 6 can go into 10. Write that number (1) into the quotient above the dividend. Then multiply 6 by 1, and subtract the result from 10. You should end up with 4.
If your dividend has more than three digits, keep repeating this process until you've worked through all of them. For example, if we we had started with 2506 grams of mushrooms, we'd pull the 6 down next and place it next to the four.

, Depending on what you're using this division for, you may want to finish up with a quotient that's a whole number, with remainder, i.e. an indication of how much is left over after you've completed your division.In the example, the remainder would be 4, because 6 cannot go into four, and there are no more digits to bring down.
Place your remainder after the quotient with a letter ""r"" before it. In the example, the answer would be expressed as ""41 r4.""
You would stop here if you were trying to calculate something that would not make sense to express in partial units, for example, if you were trying to determine how many cars were needed to move a certain number of people. In a case such as this, it would not be useful think about things in terms of partial cars or partial people.
If you plan to calculate a decimal, you can skip this step.

, If you are planning to calculate a precise answer rather than one with a remainder, you'll now need to move beyond whole numbers. When you've reached a point at which you are left with a number smaller than your divisor, add a decimal point to both the quotient and the dividend.


In the example, since 250 is a whole number, every digit after the decimal will be 0, making it 250.000.

, Now you have more digits that can be brought down (all of them zeroes). Bring down a zero and continue as before, determining how many times the divisor can go into the new number.In the example, determine how many times 6 can go into 40. Add that number (6) to the quotient above the dividend and after the decimal point. Then multiply 6 by 6, and subtract the result from 40. You should end up with 4 again.

, In some cases, you will find that when you start to solve for the decimal, the answer repeats over and over. At this point, it's time to stop and round your answer up (if the repeating number is 5 or greater) or down (if it is 4 or less).


In the example, you could keep getting 4 out of 40-36 forever, and add 6's to your quotient indefinitely. Instead of doing this, stop the problem and round the quotient. Because 6 is greater than (or equal to) 5, you would round up to 41.67.
Alternatively, you can indicate a repeating decimal by placing a small horizontal line over the repeating digit. In the example, this would make the quotient 41.6, with a line over the 6., If you are working with units like pounds, gallons, or degrees, once you are done with all your calculations, add the unit to the end of your answer.


If you added a zero as a place-holder at the beginning, you should erase that now as well.
In the example, because you asked how much each mushroom in a 250-gram pack of 6 weighs, you'll need to put your answer into grams. Therefore, your final answer is 41.67 grams.

, For example:+1     0     5     1     6

, Your paper should now look like this:+1   -  0     5     1     6

, Add a + sign in front of the third digit, then a - sign in front of the fourth, and so on until you reach the end:+1   -  0   +  5   -  1   +  6

, Now treat this like any arithmetic problem, adding and subtracting the digits together:
+1   -  0   +  5   -  1   +  6= 11


, These simple rules tell you whether the original number is divisible by 11:


If your answer is divisible by 11 (0, 11, 22, etc.), the original number is also divisible by 11. Keep in mind that 0 is a multiple of 11, since 11 * 0 = 0.
If your answer is not a multiple of 11, the original number is not divisible by 11.

The answer was 11, which is a multiple of 11.
Therefore, the original number 10,516 is divisible by 11.
, Here are a couple practice problems. Try to solve them on your own, then check the answers below.Use the alternate sums method on each number to check whether it's divisible by 11:

B. 142
C. 8,470,803

, Here are the answers to the practice problems:
A. 10032
+1 - 0 + 0 - 3 + 2 = 0
0 is divisible by 11, so yes, 10,032 is also divisible by 11.B. 142
+1 - 4 + 2 = -1.
-1 is not divisible by 11, so no, 142 is not divisible by 11.C. 8470803
+8 - 4 + 7 - 0 + 8 - 0 + 3 = 22
22 is divisible by 11, since 11 * 2 = 22. Yes, 8,470,803 is divisible by 11.

For example, 168,293 is divisible by 1, since 1×168,293=168,293{\displaystyle 1\times 168,293=168,293}.
;
, By definition, an even number is one that is divisible by 2.. So to check if any number, no matter how long, is divisible by 2, look at the last digit. If the last digit is even, the entire number is divisible by 2.Remember that 0 is an even number., To do this, add up all the digits in the number. If the sum of all digits is divisible by 3, the number is divisible by 3.You can repeat the addition of digits if the original sum is too long for you to gauge divisibility by 3.For example, the digits in 3,989,978,579,968,769,877 add up to 141. You can then add again: 1+4+1=6{\displaystyle 1+4+1=6}. Since 6 is divisible by 3, you know the entire number is divisible by 3.


, Look at the last two digits in the number. Is the number made by the last two digits divisible by 4? If so, the entire number is divisible by 4.Note that only even numbers are divisible by 4. Multiples of 100 are always divisible by 4.Another way to check for divisibility by 4 is to divide the number by 2 twice. If the quotient is still a whole number, the original number is divisible by 4.For example, 8762=438{\displaystyle {\frac {876}{2}}=438}, and then 4382=219{\displaystyle {\frac {438}{2}}=219}. Since 219 is a whole number, you know that 876 is divisible by 4.




, Since any number ending in 0 or 5 is a multiple of 5, any number whose last digit is 0 or 5 is divisible by 5., If a number is even, and the sum of its digits are divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 6. In other words, if a number is divisible by 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6., Separate the last digit from the rest of the number. Double the last digit. Then, subtract that product from the number made by the remaining digits. If the difference is divisible by 7, then the whole number is divisible by 7.For example, to find out if 567 is divisible by 7, first separate the last digit from the number. This gives you 56 and 7. Double the last digit, 7: 7×2=14{\displaystyle 7\times 2=14}. Then, subtract 14 from 56: 56−14=42{\displaystyle 56-14=42}. Since 42 is divisible by 7, you know that 567 is divisible by 7.


, Look at the last three digits in the number. If the number they make is divisible by 8, then the entire number is divisible by 8.Another way to do this is to halve the last three digits 3 times. If the final quotient is a whole number, then the entire number is divisible by 8.For example, 1282=64{\displaystyle {\frac {128}{2}}=64}, then 642=32{\displaystyle {\frac {64}{2}}=32}, then 322=16{\displaystyle {\frac {32}{2}}=16}. Since 16 is a whole number, you know that the number 11,128 is divisible by 8.




, A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9..

You can repeat the addition of digits if the original sum is too long for you to gauge divisibility by 9.For example, the digits in 3,989,978,579,968,769,877 add up to 141. You can then add again: 1+4+1=6{\displaystyle 1+4+1=6}. Since 6 is not divisible by 9, you know the entire number is not divisible by 9.


,

The test for determining whether a number is divisible by 6 is twofold.

First determine whether the number is even. 456 is even, since it ends in 6.

Then, determine whether the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. So, you would calculate 4+5+6=15{\displaystyle 4+5+6=15}. The number 15 is divisible by 3.

Since 456 passes both tests, it is divisible by 6.


, Which digits will evenly divide into this number?

1 divides evenly into the number, since any number is divisible by 1.

2 divides evenly into the number, since 1,336 is even.

3 does not divide evenly into the number, since the sum of its digits is 13, and 13 is not divisible by 3.

4 divides evenly into the number, since the last two digits, 36, is divisible by 4.

5 does not divide evenly into the number, since 1,336 does not end in 5 or 0.

6 does not divide evenly into the number. While it is an even number, the sum of its digits is not divisible by 3.

7 does not divide evenly into the number. When you double the last digit (6), and subtract it from the remaining digits, you get 133−12=121{\displaystyle 133-12=121}. Since 121 is not divisible by 7, neither is 1,336.

8 divides evenly into the number, since the last three digits, 336, is divisible by 8.

9 does not divide evenly into the number, since the sum of its digits is 13, and 13 is not divisible by 9.


, Brian is a kindergarten teacher. He has 363 crayons. He divides his class into four groups. Can he evenly divide the crayons among the four groups?

He cannot evenly divide the crayons among the four groups. 363 is not divisible by 4, since it is not an even number, and since the number made from the last two digits, 63, is not divisible by 4.

Try this with other multiples of six, seven, eight and ten.",How to Multiply With Your Hands," Each of your ten fingers represent a number. Moving from your left thumb to your right thumb, count out the numbers from one to ten.;
, For example, if you want to solve (9x3) you will want to hold down your middle finger on your left hand. The middle finger represents the number three because, if you count your fingers from one to ten beginning with your left thumb, your middle finger is the third finger.

, First count the fingers to the left of your bent finger - in this case there should be two. Next count the fingers to the right of your bent finger - in this case there should be seven. The first digit of the answer is 2 and the second digit is 7. The answer is 27!, How would you multiply 9 and 2 with your fingers? What about 9 and 7?

, Again each finger will represent a number. Your pinkies represent the number six, your ring fingers will represent the number seven, your middle fingers will represent the number eight, your index fingers represent nine, and your thumbs represent the number ten., For example, if you want to figure out the problem (7x6) you would touch your left ring finger with your right pinky. Your left fingers represent the number on the left of the problem, and your right fingers represent the numbers on the right of the problem. Again, remember that each finger represents a number and that in this case, your ring finger represents seven and your pinky represents six. Therefore, you need to touch these together to solve this math problem.


You may have to bend your wrist awkwardly to do this!
As another example, if you were trying to calculate 9x7 you would touch your left index finger with your right ring finger.

, The next step is to count the touching fingers as well as the fingers below them. These will represent the 10s. In this case you would count the ring finger on your left hand, the pinky on your left hand and the pinky on your right hand. Each finger that you count will count as 10. In this case, the total is 30.

, The next step is to add together the number of fingers on each hand, not including the fingers that are touching. First count the number of fingers on your left hand that are above the touching fingers - in this case there are 3. Next, count the number of fingers on your right hand above the touching fingers - in this case there are 4. 3x4 = 12.

, In this case you will add 30 to 12 for a total of 42. The answer to 7x6 is 42!

, For example if you want to find the answer to 10x7, begin by touching your left thumb with your right ring finger. Count the number of fingers below the touching fingers, including the fingers that are touching. There should be a total of 7, which remember means 70. Next, count the number of fingers above the touching fingers on your right and left hand. There should be 0 on your left and 3 on your right. Now multiply 3x0 which is 0, and add 70 to 0 for you answer. The answer to 10x7 is 70!

, How would you multiply 8 and 8 with your fingers? What about 7 and 10?

Commit to a time.,
Start with the fact families of 0, 1, 2, and 3.,
Explain how the commutative property makes everything easier.,
Discuss patterns in the whole chart.,
Know the tricks.",How to Teach the Multiplication Tables to Your Child2," Sit down with your child when both of you are ready to make a dent into the subject. If you are preoccupied with work or if your child is too tired or hungry, learning won't occur as quickly as you want it to. Sit down for 30 minutes and don't allow any distractions for either of you.


Energy and enthusiasm are very important for both of you. Turn off your cell phone(s), TV, and sit down at the dinner table with some munchies and attack those numbers.

, When memorizing, it's important to rehearse a small portion of facts before attempting to learn the entire chart. Remember: Your child isn't counting; they are simply memorizing. Presumably, they already know the basic concept of multiplying.


If your child is unfamiliar with multiplying, put it in terms of adding. That is, 4x3 is 4+4+4.
Ask your child to bring you their math book and any resources they've been given. You'll be able to see exactly what they are studying and the teaching method used in their school.
Have a chart or number line handy showing the numbers 0 through 100. A chart will give you the answers by correlating the row with the column. A chart is better for those just starting off as the answers are quicker to find.

A number line is a bit more work. You can have your child circle the multiples of a certain number in pencil or code each number and its multiples with different colors.



, Show your child that each answer repeats, so, technically, they only have to learn half of the chart (score!). 3x7 is the same as 7x3. When they've learned the fact families of 0, 1, 2, and 3, they already know 4 numbers each of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.


After your child has mastered 0-3, move onto 4-7, and then 8-10. If you want to go above and beyond, work with 11 and 12, too. Some teachers will include a few harder problems for a bonus or to gauge where each child is at.

, It doesn't all have to be rote memorization with no clues or hints. The chart will easily point out things to look for.


All the multiples of ten end in zero.
All the multiples of 5 end in either 5 or 0 and are half as large as the multiples of ten. (10x5=50; 5x5=25, or half of 50)
Any number x 0 is still 0. No matter what.

, Luckily, math is full of shortcuts. Teach your child these tricks and they'll be impressed and, hopefully, quite thankful.


To memorize the 9's tables, use your fingers. Spread them all in front of you, palms down. For 9x1, put your left pinky down. What do you have showing? 9. For 9x2, put your second finger down (the left ring finger). What do you have showing? 1 and 8. 18. Put your third finger down--2 and 7. 27. This works all the way up to 9x9 (8 and 1. 81).
If your child can double a number, the x4's will be easy. Just double the number and double it again! Take 6x4. 6 doubled is 12. 12 doubled is 24. 6x4=24. Use this to make the answer become automatic. Again, this is about memorizing.
To multiply anything by 11, just duplicate the number. 3x11=33. Two 3's. 4x11=44. Two 4's. The answer is in the question, just twice.

If your child is a math genius, teach them this trick to multiply 11's by double digit numbers. Take the double digit number and split it up. 11 by 17 is 1_7. Add the double digit number together and put it in the middle: 187.

Do speed drills.,
Make it fun.",How to Teach the Multiplication Tables to Your Child3," Now that your child is familiar with the entire chart, drill them. Drill them over breakfast, during commercials, and for a few minutes before bed. As you progress, get faster and faster and faster.


At the beginning, start in order. As you get more and more convinced that they have it down, start mixing it up. They'll slow down initially but then should spark right back up to where they were.

, By this point, you both may be wondering what those squiggles in each number really are. Spice it up for the both of you with games and contests.


Have your child make a set of flash cards. Write the problem, like 4 x 9, on the front and the answer, 36, on the back. The act of writing out the multiples will provide another repetition/reinforcement. Use a timer to see how many cards they can go through in a minute. Can they beat that score tomorrow?

You could also do this with a blank chart. That's an easy way to monitor which ones they're struggling with.


Grab a deck of cards. This game is similar to War, but with multiplication. You each get half the deck to place face down in front of you--don't look at the cards! Each player flips their first card simultaneously--the first person to say the answer based on the two numbers gets both cards (the object of the game is to win them all). If the two of you flip a 7 and a 5, the answer to shout out is 35. For Jacks, Queens, and Kings, you can use 11, 12, and 13, use them as 0's, or take them out entirely.
Say a number, like 30. Can they list all of the possible combinations that multiply to it? 5 x 6? 3 x 10?
Say a number, then ask for the next multiple. For example, start at 30 and ask for the next multiple of 6. Or start at 18 and ask for the next two multiples of 9. You could even start at 22 and ask for the next multiple of 4, even though 22 is not a multiple of 4. Be tricky once they have it.
Try multiplication bingo. Your child fills in a six-by-six grid with whatever numbers they want. You read off a problem like ""5 x 7."" If they have 35 on their bingo card, then they mark it off. Continue until someone has a ""bingo."" What's the prize they could win?

"
"
Use incentives.,
Praise your child.,
Take breaks.",How to Teach the Multiplication Tables to Your Child4," You don't have to use money or material goods--that may spoil their love of learning. Of course, snacks, drinks and offering things they like to do are always good ideas.


Save the big rewards for school tests. Once they can perform under pressure, you know you've been successful.

, Don't forget to pause and have fun between serious repetitions of the facts. If you're happy with their success, they'll be more likely to want to be successful. Show them how awesome they're doing with verbal recognition.


If they're going slower than you think they should, relax. Negativity may make them shut down. A bad mood can kill any learning ability. Encourage them to press on.

, No child can learn for hours on end. When you sense that they're wearing down, take a break. You probably need one, too.


After a break, quickly review what they've already learned before moving onto new facts.

, First, you multiplied 4 by the number in the ones' place; now, multiply it by the number in the tenths place. Multiply 4 with 8, the digit to the left of 7. 8 x 4 = 32. Remember that you had placed a 2 over the 8. Now, add it to your answer. 32 + 2 = 34.


Place the 4 from the number 34 below the line under the 8, next to the number 8 that you wrote down in the previous step.
Carry the 3 from the number 34 over the 1 in the number 187.

, You just multiplied 4 by the number in the tenths' place; now, multiply it by the number in the hundred's place. 4 x 1 = 4. Now, add the number that you carried above one to your answer. 3 + 4 = 7. Write this number down on the line below the one.


You have used long multiplication to multiply 4 by 187 to get 748.
Note that if the top number had four or more digits, you would just repeat the process until you multiplied the number in the ones' place of the bottom number with all of the numbers in the top number, continuing to move from right to left.

, Place a zero in the ones' place of the new row below the 8 in 748. This is just a placeholder for this method to show that you are moving on to multiply the tenths' place value.

, Multiply 5 times 7 to get 35.


Write down the 5 from 35 to the left of the 0 and carry the 3 from the 35 above the 8 in the top number.

, Multiply 5 by 8 to get 40. Add the 3 above the 8 to 40 to get 43.


Write down the 3 from 43 to the left of the 5, and carry the 4 from the 43 above the 1 in the top number.

, Now, multiply 5 times 1 to get 5. Add the 4 over the 1 to 5 to get 9. Write it down next to the 3.


You have done long multiplication to multiply 5 by 187. Your answer for that portion is 9350, since the 5 was in the tens' place.

, Just do simple addition to add your two products, 748 and 9350, and you're done.


748 + 9350 = 10098

Write down your number.,
Divide the digits in pairs from right to left.,
Add the numbers together.,
Check whether the answer is divisible by 11.",How to Check Divisibility of 112," For example, let's check whether 17952 is divisible by 11.

, Draw a vertical line to separate the two rightmost digits from the rest of the number. Move left two more spaces and draw another line. Repeat until the whole number is divided into pairs of digits. (The last digit on the left might be alone.)


For 17952, start at the right (the ones place) and count two digits to the left, then draw a line: 179 | 52.
Count left two more digits and draw another line: 1 | 79 | 52.

, Treat each separate section as its own number. Add them together:


1 + 79 + 52 = 132.

, If it is, then the original number is divisible by 11 as well. If your answer is not divisible by 11, your original number is not either. If you're not sure whether the answer is divisible by 11, repeat these same steps to test it:


Divide 132 into 1 | 32.
Add these together to get 1 + 32 = 33.
Since 33 is divisible by 11, then 132 is as well.
Since 132 is divisible by 11, your original number 17952 is also divisible by 11.

Utilize online materials.,
Ask about their scores.",How to Teach the Multiplication Tables to Your Child5," Once the paper and pens are put back and the initial hurdles are over, go online for quizzes and games to see how much your child has retained.


Of course, it's possible to write out quizzes yourself and you're more than welcome to do this--but simply being on a computer may make your child feel like it's less of a test and more of a fun challenge.

, You've done all this work at home--now how has it gone at school? If your child isn't volunteering this information, just ask! They should be proud of good grades; if they're grades aren't so stellar, you can review with them more to have better results next time.


It's always an option to call the teacher and inquire about the curriculum. An involved parent is always appreciated.

Buy your materials.,
Measure and cut your materials.,
Fold and glue the pieces.,
Finish the folder.,
Pick your materials.,
Choose your style.,
Cut out materials.,
Glue the materials.,
Add decorative elements.",How to Make a File Folder," There are many different types of materials you can use to make your folder. You can use paper, paper stock, cardstock, or cardboard. You can find many different patterns and designs of these materials in craft and hobby stores. Most documents stored in file folders are 8 1/2 by 11 inches, so make sure you buy pieces that are at least two inches larger on each side.


If you can find materials that are larger than 18 inches by 12 inches, you only have to buy one sheet per folder. You will be able to fold it in half. If the paper you find is less than 18 inches, you will need to buy two pieces per folder.
Paper isn't the most durable material, so if you are going to be using your file folders a lot, you might want to use the more durable materials like cardstock or cardboard.
If you are making the folders for work, think about what type of pattern or look would be most appropriate for the office. If they are just going to be in your desk at home, the type of pattern or design doesn't matter as much.Making your own file folder is a great way to save money, have a little fun, and show your creative side, so feel free to be as creative and crazy as you want to be.;
, Once you've bought the materials you want to use, measure your materials. Cut one rectangle that is 10 by 12 inches and one that is 9 by 12 inches. If you have one sheet of paper, you need to cut it to 18 1/2 by 12 inches.









If you want slightly sturdier edges, expand the width of each rectangle from 12 inches to 13 inches. This extra inch will make folded edges on each side of the folder.If you want your folder to be the exact shape and size of a traditional file folder, trace the shape of a file folder on the underside of the material you are using, matching up the smaller file folder side to the smaller rectangle and the larger folder side to the larger rectangle. Cut around the shape you made to create your two pieces., Measure and mark a 1








If you are using sturdier material than paper, you might want to score along the 1/2 inch mark so your material doesn't crack when you fold it. To score the material, place your ruler along the line you just drew. Using a hard object such as a letter opener, gently press along the line you drew, leaving an indention along the line. This will make it easier to fold and your material will not buckle or crack.For sturdier edges, you need to glue the sides before you glue the bottom. Make a 1/2 inch mark on each of the short edges on both rectangles you cut, folding them along the mark. Put glue on the inside flap of each and fold the edges in. This creates a sturdier outside edge for your folder., Once the glue has dried, you can fold the folder closed. There should be about an inch of the larger rectangle showing underneath the smaller rectangle. You can leave the edge at the top the way it is, with the uniform tab across the entire folder, or you can cut the back edge to look like a traditional file folder. To do this, pick where you want the tab, marking out the place you want to tab to be. Cut along the top of the folder, evening out the folder flaps in all the areas except where your designated tab is. Then you can add a label to your folder, add some files, and you're folder is done.









The tabs on traditional file folders vary in placement and can be on the right side, left side, or the center. If you are making multiple, you might want to make some of each so you can stagger where the tabs are.
If you picked a stronger cardstock that didn't come in the pattern you wanted, you can always add patterned paper on the front of the file folder to add more flare to the folder. To do this, once your folder is created, cut the pattered paper about a half inch smaller than the size of your folder on all sides. Glue the paper to the outside of the folder, centering the paper in the middle of the folder. The color of the cardstock folder will show along the edges and the pattern will make your folder pop., You need to have the file folders you want to decorate as well as the materials you want to use to decorate them. You need materials large enough to cover the outside of one or both sides of the folder such as wrapping paper, decorative paper, contact paper, or fabric. You can also buy small cut outs, stickers, colorful tape, or other decorative elements that you'd like to add to the outside of your folder to add something extra., There are many different ways you can decorate your file folder. You need to decide where you want to add which elements to your folders. You can cut your materials to cover the inside, where the pop of color is on the larger side of the folder with the tab. You can cover the front of your folder, with a large area of design showing on the outside. You can also cover the entire thing front and back, making it look like a completely different folder than the one you started with. If you are decorating the folders at work, you might want to think about what type of pattern or look would be most appropriate for the office. If your folders are just going to be in your desk at home, the type of pattern or design doesn't matter as much as long as you like it., No matter what material you choose, you are going to have to cut down the material to fit the file folder. Roll or lay out your material design side down on the table. Place your file folder on top of it. Trace the outside of the file folder onto the material. Once you've drawn the whole area you are going to cover, cut around the outline you made.








If you don't feel confident in your cutting skills, try the next step, gluing your material to your file folder, first and then cut around the edge of the folder. This will give you a more firm area to cut around and will ensure that it is precise.If you are adding your paper to the inside of the file folder, you don't have to make the entire shape of the file folder if you don't want to waste the material. Just cut around the visible edge and cut off the bottom once it is no longer visible from the outside., You need to use a glue stick, super glue, or other thin adhesive so the material won't stick up from the file folder. Focusing on the area you want to cover on the file folder, gently apply a thin, generous coat of glue to the surface of the file folder. Before the glue has time to dry, adhere your material to the folder, making sure to line up the edges. Gently press down on the surface of the material, making sure each area sticks to the file folder underneath.








You may want to run a ruler flat across the surface of the material to get out any air bubbles that might have gathered when you attached the material.
If you use fabric to cover your folders, make sure you use a type of adhesive that won't bleed through the fabric and that will hold the fabric onto the folder, such as a spray adhesive, instead of super glue.If you decided to use contact paper, you just need to pull off the sheet covering the adhesive side after you cut the paper and attach it to the file folder. Contact paper is also great for covering the entire folder, so try covering the whole folder in the contact paper of your choice. Not only does this give your folder a new look, it also makes it more durable and waterproof., Once the glue has dried on your file folder, add your decorative elements. There is no one way to add decorations to your folders, so just have fun and make them as festive as the situation allows.









You can add stickers or decorative tape to the front of the folder. Try crisscrossing tape to make designs or using the tape as the backing to your labels.
You can glue cut outs along the folder to add more designs to your material. You can also add objects such as buttons or bows to the cover to add extra flare.You can also use ink pads and stamps to cover areas with more decorative and personal touches. This adds decoration without adding additional bulk or elements that might fall off with extended use."

Use heavy paper or cardstock.,
Measure and cut your label size.,
Design a label by hand or on the computer.",How to Insert a Label Into a Binder Spine1," Print or write your spine label on paper or cardstock that is sturdy. This will make it much easier to insert into your binder than a thin piece of paper.


If you design your label on the computer, make sure the printer you use can print on heavier paper. Check the manual or do a test run with thicker paper first.
If you can’t print or write on heavy paper, you can always glue down thinner paper onto another piece of paper or cardstock to make it thicker. Just make sure the edges and corners are glued well and lay flat.
Note that a very thick label will actually take up too much space in the plastic cover on the binder spine, so it can be even more difficult. Aim for a material that is sturdy but still thin.;
, Measure the exact length and width of the spine of your binder, but just the space within the plastic covering. Subtract a few millimeters from the width to make it easier to insert the label later.


Note that it’s best to cut out the paper before you design your label so that you don’t accidentally make your writing or decorations too large.
Use an existing label as a guide for size, if you have one. A new binder will typically come with a paper insert that describes the size, brand, and other details of the binder. You can copy the exact size of this insert for the new label.
If you’re typing your label, make a box that has the exact dimensions of your binder spine in the word processor program you’re using, then fill the box with your text and decorations. When printed, you can then cut it out exactly along the lines of the box.

, Type up or write out any text and decoration you want on your binder spine label. Make sure you've already cut out or know the size of your label so you don’t create a design that is too large.


Use pens, pencils, markers, crayons, etc. to design a label by hand. Just note that any material that is still wet or is prone to smudging will get ruined when inserted into a binder.
In Microsoft Word, select File > New From Template…. If you search for “binder” in the top right search bar of this window you will find several templates for binder inserts, which include spine labels for a variety of different sized binders. Customize these however you wish for an easy way to create a typed label of exactly the right size."

Decide on the purpose for your notebook.,
Choose a notebook that is right for you.,
Write in it.,
Organize your notes, at least a little bit.,
Keep it legible.,
Write often.",How to Keep a Notebook," Will you write down your inventions? Will you write ideas for a screenplay, or novel, or poem you will someday write? Will you write down thoughts and ideas related to a particular project? Or do you simply want to have a place to jot your to-do list or shopping list? Some people don't write any thoughts or family information in it, just things from their job or meetings they have attended. Others use their notebooks as a catch-all for the many ideas popping through their heads.;
, There is a wide variety of notebooks available, so take the time to look for a good one and don't be afraid to spend a little extra money. After all, your greatest work may be produced in this book! Here are some things to consider:


Portability and size. Notebooks work best when they are at hand when you need them. Choose something large enough to contain your writing and sketches and small enough to stow away. Would you like this notebook go in a purse or briefcase, in a pocket, in a binder or backpack?
The writing environment. Do you need to write standing up, or on the go? Then you should choose something stiff-backed that you can hold with one hand while you write with the other. Does this notebook need to function in a special environment, such as a laboratory, a cleanroom, a kitchen, a factory, or a boat?
Purpose. A blank book with a colorful, flowery cover may inspire you to write a journal, but it won't fit at a business meeting. A spiral notebook can open fully and fold back and it won't push itself closed while you try to write. Do you need ruled lines for writing or would you prefer blank pages or a grid to aid in sketching? Some notebooks even come printed with a musical staff.
Divisions and markers. Do you want it to be divided into different categories, say, Homework, Ideas, Reflections, and To-Do Lists, or be more random or free-form, like a journal? You can buy pre-divided notebooks, or divide them yourself with stick-on dividers, flags, ribbons, or bookmarks.
Legality. If this notebook will contain information that you may someday wish to get a patent, look for a bound book with pre-numbered pages. Understand the rules about keeping a notebook for such purposes.

, Find your own style to make the most of your notebook. Use it the way that works best for you.
There are many scenarios when it is a good idea to write something down in your notebook:


When you are given a task.
When you think of a new invention or idea.
When you are given a compliment, recommendation, or piece of good advice.
When you hear something funny or out of the ordinary
When you want to remember something.

, Even if you don't think it matters, spending a little time now to organize your notes now can save you a lot of time later, when you're trying to find a piece of information, or can provide valuable later.


Date each entry.
Number the pages.
Possibly title your entries.
Write down background information, e.g. who attended a meeting.

, Write at least well enough that you can read your notes. You want to be able to read your own handwriting. If you're keeping a notebook for official purposes, then make sure your handwriting is legible enough for others to read as well.

,


Write consistently. Write at the same time every day, if possible. If you are a ""lark"", early morning can offer a productive time to write because your brain is fresh and most flexible and the activity can help shape the upcoming day. ""Owls"" may find evenings a better time to update their notes; it can be helpful to allot a few minutes before you go home from work or school to jot down today's important points and plan activities for tomorrow. Either way, writing at the same time every day can help to make keeping a notebook a habit - resulting in writing in it often.
Write in the little times between things, while you are standing in line or waiting for the next thing to happen, for instance.
Write whenever the feeling strikes you. Ideas come and go, and unless you jot them down, you may forget. Remember the historian's mindset: If it's not written down, it didn't happen.

It may help you to just babble on paper - to write whatever is going through your head until you think of something 'useful' to write. Your 'babbling' could turn out to be something important!

Turn the binder inside out and upright.,
Use a ruler to lightly open the plastic.,
Guide the label with a pencil or ruler.",How to Insert a Label Into a Binder Spine2," Open up your binder and bend back the front and back covers until they are completely in the other direction. Then stand the binder up so that the spine is vertical.Opening up your binder like this creates more space in the plastic covering for you to insert your label. Standing it upright makes it so that gravity can assist in getting the label inside.
If you have an older binder and you are concerned about it cracking or breaking by turning it inside out, you can just open up the binder until it is flat, which will still create more room in the plastic than when it is closed.

, Take a thin ruler and slide it inside the plastic on the spine where your label will go. This will open up the pocket and unstick it from the binder, which may happen after some disuse.


Move the ruler gently from side to side in the plastic if your binder is wider, making sure the whole pocket is open and unstuck.
Note that this may not work for smaller binders that are only 1 inch wide or less, as a common ruler is typically wider than this.
Take care not to over-stretch or tear the plastic on the spine by inserting a ruler that is too big or has very sharp corners.

, Use something hard and sturdy to help hold open the spine plastic and help ease your label inside. Try placing a ruler behind your label to guide it into the pocket.


If it will fit, try using the eraser end of a pencil to gently push your label in from the opening of the plastic. The eraser may help “grab” your label to better push it in.
You can also guide your label in with a piece of cardstock of the same size. Just insert it behind your label at the same time. Once you have both about halfway into the plastic, gently pull the cardstock out while you hold the label in place and then guide it the rest of the way down."
"
Turn the binder inside out and upside down.,
Use a post-it note to grab the label.,
Make a pull tab for a label before you insert it.",How to Insert a Label Into a Binder Spine3," Open up your binder or turn it all the way inside out when you want to pull out an existing spine label. Then turn the binder upside down so that the opening of the plastic is on the bottom.


If your spine label is small, thin, and loose enough, it may easily fall right out when the binder is turned upside down.
You can also use a ruler in the same way as you did to open up the plastic before inserting. Do this if you find that the existing label is stuck to the plastic or to the inside surface of the binder.

, Slide a thin post-it note between your label and the binder, with the sticky side facing the label. Press firmly to make sure it sticks, then pull the label out using the post-it as a pull tab.If you don’t have a thin sized post-it note, just cut a strip off of a larger one, making sure that the strip has one sticky end.
Pull very gently on the post-it, as you don’t want it to simply come off your label instead of bring it out. If it seems like the label is stuck in the plastic, make sure you have your binder open or inside out, and slide in a ruler if you can to loosen it.

, Avoid the problem of not being able to get a spine label out by making a pull tab for any new one you put in. Just fold over a small piece of tape and attach it to the top of the label before you put it in.Use clear tape to create the pull tab. Fold a piece over so that only part of the sticky side stays uncovered. Stick this part to the top and back of the label so that the tab sits just outside of the plastic cover on the spine.
To remove your label, just pull on the tab and the whole label will slide right out.

Obtain the mathematical system table you need to interpret.,
Look down the length of the downward sloping diagonal.,
Find the reflective objects across each of the table's diagonals.,
Look for symmetry in the table.",How to Determine if a Mathematical System is Commutative (Table Method)," It'll work for all mathematical systems, but for you to understand, think about a set of multiplication tables from your childhood. Organize the table so that a*b is the value in a's row and b's column. Also make sure that the numbers written down the leftmost column appear in the same order as the ones reading across the top row.;
, These don't matter for commutativity because a*a always equals a*a (in the reverse order).

, For every entry not on the main diagonal, find its reflection across that diagonal. This pair of entries correspond to a*b and b*a for some arguments a and b. If the operation is commutative, these must be equal. Equivalently, the table entries must be symmetric under reflection across the main diagonal., If the table is the required symmetry, then it describes a commutative operation. If any entry does not match its opposite across the diagonal, than those table entries represent a counterexample where a*b does not equal b*a and the operation is not commutative."

Find the length of the circle’s radius.,
Set up the formula for Archimedes’ Theorem.,
Plug the length of the radius into the formula.,
Calculate the area of the circle.,
Calculate the circumference of the circle.,
Check your work.",How to Determine a Triangle and Circle of Equal Area1," This information should be given, or else you should be able to measure it. If you do not know the radius of the circle, you cannot use this method.

For example, you might have a circle with a radius of 4 cm.
;
, This theorem states that the area of any circle is equal to the area of a right triangle whose base is equal to the radius of the circle, and whose height is equal to the circumference of the circle. Mathematically, this is shown by the formula π(r2)=12r(2π(r)){\displaystyle \pi (r^{2})={\frac {1}{2}}r(2\pi (r))}, where r{\displaystyle r} is the radius of the circle.Note that π(r2){\displaystyle \pi (r^{2})} is the formula for the area of a circle, and 12base×height{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}{\text{base}}\times {\text{height}}} is the formula for the area of a triangle.The formula is set up to show that the triangle will have a base equal to the radius (r{\displaystyle r}), and a height equal to the circumference of a circle (2π(r){\displaystyle 2\pi (r)})., Make sure you substitute for all three instances of r{\displaystyle r}.

For example, if the radius is 4 cm, the equation will look like this: π(42)=124(2π(4)){\displaystyle \pi (4^{2})={\frac {1}{2}}4(2\pi (4))}.


, This will also be the area of the triangle. This is shown in the formula by π(r2){\displaystyle \pi (r^{2})}. If you are not using a scientific calculator, use 3.14 as the value of π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example:π(r4)=124(2π(4)){\displaystyle \pi (r^{4})={\frac {1}{2}}4(2\pi (4))}π(42)=124(2π(4)){\displaystyle \pi (4^{2})={\frac {1}{2}}4(2\pi (4))}16π=124(2π(4)){\displaystyle 16\pi ={\frac {1}{2}}4(2\pi (4))}16(3.14)=124(2(3.14)(4))=50.24{\displaystyle 16(3.14)={\frac {1}{2}}4(2(3.14)(4))=50.24}

 So, the area of the circle and the triangle is about 50.24 square centimeters.


, This will give you the height of your triangle. (Remember that the base of the triangle is equal to the radius of the circle). The circumference is shown in the formula by 2π(r){\displaystyle 2\pi (r)}.  If you are not using a scientific calculator, use 3.14 as the value of π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example: 50.24=124(2(3.14)(4)){\displaystyle 50.24={\frac {1}{2}}4(2(3.14)(4))}50.24=124(25.12){\displaystyle 50.24={\frac {1}{2}}4(25.12)}

 So, the height of the triangle is about 25.12 cm.


, Complete the calculations in the equation to make sure that both sides are equal. Note that if you rounded to 3.14 when using π{\displaystyle \pi } the equation might be a few decimal points off.

For example:50.24=124(25.12){\displaystyle 50.24={\frac {1}{2}}4(25.12)}50.24=12(100.56){\displaystyle 50.24={\frac {1}{2}}(100.56)}50.24=50.28{\displaystyle 50.24=50.28}

 Since you rounded to 3.14, and the equation is only off by 2 hundredths, you can assume that the areas are equal, and thus your calculations are correct. Thus, the area of a circle with a radius of 4 cm is equal to the area of a right triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 25.12 cm.

Multiply by π{\displaystyle \pi }.,
Set up the formula for the area of a triangle.,
Plug the area into the triangle formula.,
Plug the height of the triangle into the formula.,
Multiply the height of the triangle by 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.",How to Determine a Triangle and Circle of Equal Area2," The formula is A=π(r2){\displaystyle A=\pi (r^{2})}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the circle and r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius of the circle., Remember to substitute for variable r{\displaystyle r}.

For example, if the circle has a radius of 4 cm, your formula will look like this:A=π(42){\displaystyle A=\pi (4^{2})}A=π(16){\displaystyle A=\pi (16)}.


, If you are not using a calculator, use 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }. This will give you the area of the circle.

For example:A=π(16){\displaystyle A=\pi (16)}A=3.14(16){\displaystyle A=3.14(16)}A=50.24{\displaystyle A=50.24}

 So, the area of the circle is about 50.24 cm.


, The formula is A=12bh{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}bh}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the triangle, b{\displaystyle b} equals the length of the triangle’s base, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the triangle., Since you want the area of each figure to be the same, use the area you previously calculated for the circle.

For example, if you found the area of the circle to be 50.24 cm, your formula will look like this: 50.24=12bh{\displaystyle 50.24={\frac {1}{2}}bh}.


, You can also use this method if you are given the length of the base (b{\displaystyle b}). Just plug the appropriate value in for the corresponding variable.

For example, if the height of the triangle is 10 cm, your formula will look like this: 50.24=12b(10){\displaystyle 50.24={\frac {1}{2}}b(10)}.


, Then, divide each side of the equation by this product. This will give you the length of the base of your triangle.

For example:50.24=5b{\displaystyle 50.24=5b}50.245=5b5{\displaystyle {\frac {50.24}{5}}={\frac {5b}{5}}}10.05=b{\displaystyle 10.05=b}

 So, the area of a circle with a radius of 4 cm is equal to the area of a triangle with a height of 10 cm and a base of about 10 cm.


"
"
Set up the formula for the area of a triangle.,
Plug the length of the base and height into the formula.,
Multiply the base and height, then multiply the product by 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.,
Set up the formula for the area of a circle.,
Plug the area into the circle formula.,
Divide each side of the equation by π{\displaystyle \pi }.,
Take the square root of each side of the equation.",How to Determine a Triangle and Circle of Equal Area3," The formula is A=12bh{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}bh}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the triangle, b{\displaystyle b} equals the length of the triangle’s base, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the triangle., These values should be given to you, or you should be able to measure them.

For example, if the base of the triangle is 5 cm, and the height of the triangle is 20 cm, then your equation will look like this: A=12(5)(20){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(5)(20)}.


, This will give you the area of the triangle.

For example:A=12(5)(20){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(5)(20)}A=12(100){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(100)}A=50{\displaystyle A=50}

 So, the area of the triangle is 50 square centimeters.


, The formula is A=π(r2){\displaystyle A=\pi (r^{2})}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the circle and r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius of the circle., Since you want the area of each figure to be the same, use the area you previously calculated for the triangle.

For example, if you found the area of the triangle to be 50 cm, your formula will look like this: 50=π(r2){\displaystyle 50=\pi (r^{2})}.


, If you are not using a scientific calculator, you can round π{\displaystyle \pi } to 3.14.

For example:50=π(r2){\displaystyle 50=\pi (r^{2})}50=3.14(r2){\displaystyle 50=3.14(r^{2})}503.14=3.14(r2)3.14{\displaystyle {\frac {50}{3.14}}={\frac {3.14(r^{2})}{3.14}}}15.92=r2{\displaystyle 15.92=r^{2}}


, This will give you the length of the radius of a circle with an area equal to that of the triangle.

For example:15.92=r2{\displaystyle 15.92=r^{2}}15.92=r2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {15.92}}={\sqrt {r^{2}}}}3.99=r{\displaystyle 3.99=r}.

 So, the area of a circle with a radius of about 4 cm is equal to the area of a triangle with a base of 5 cm and a height of 20 cm.

,, Both top and bottom, with straight lines will form two equilateral triangles, one atop the other, the bottom one an inverted mirror image of the top triangle. All the radii are equal and all sides being equal, these are proven equilateral triangles.

, The length of this line equals the square root of 3.

, Where the perpendicular cuts the original given unit line to the line's left (or right) endpoint is a distance of .5 -- let us call this distance a. a^2 = .25. The hypotenuse has a length of 1; let us call the hypotenuse c and c^2 = 1. c^2 - a^2 = b^2 = 1 - .25 = 3/4 and the square root of this is sqrt(3)/2 and equals 1/2 the dropped perpendicular between the intersection points, top and bottom, of the two circles. Therefore twice this distance, or the measure of the full perpendicular between the circle's intersection points, equals sqrt(3)/2 * 2 which = the square root of 3 ... the very distance which was sought to be determined geometrically.

, Sqrt(3) = 1.73205080756888 and we can see the black line is about 2*.85 or 1.7 units in length, roughly.

Understand the difference between ""tens"" and ""ones."",
Break apart a two digit number.,
Introduce the ""hundreds"" place.,
Break apart a three digit number.,
Apply this pattern to infinitely larger numbers.,
Understand how decimals work.,
Break apart a decimal number.",How to Decompose Numbers1," When you look at a number with two digits and no decimal point, the two digits represent a “tens” place and a “ones” place. The “tens” place is on the left, and the “ones” place is on the right.


The number in the “ones” place can be read exactly as it appears. The only numbers that belong in the “ones” place are all the numbers from 0 through 9 (zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine).
The number in the “tens” place only looks like the number in the “ones” place. When viewed separately, however, this number actually has a 0 after it, making the number larger than a number in the “ones” place. The numbers that belong in the “tens” place include: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 (ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety).;
, When you are given a number with two digits, the number has a “ones” place piece and a “tens” place piece. To decompose this number, you will need to separate it into its separate pieces.



Example: Decompose the number 82.

The 8 is in the “tens” place, so this part of the number can be separated and written as 80.
The 2 is in the “ones” place, so this part of the number can be separated and written as 2.
When writing out your answer, you would write: 82 = 80 + 2


Also note that a number written in a normal way is written in its ""standard form,"" but a decomposed number is written in ""expanded form.""

Based on the previous example, ""82"" is the standard form and ""80 + 2"" is the expanded form.



, When a number has three digits and no decimal point, that number has a “ones” place, “tens” place, and “hundreds” place. The “hundreds” place is on the left side of the number. The “tens” place is in the middle, and the “ones” place is still on the right.


The “ones” place and “tens” place numbers work exactly as they do when you have a two digit number.
The number in the “hundreds” place will look like a “ones” place number, but when viewed separately, a number in the “hundreds” place actually has two zeroes after it. The numbers that belong in the “hundreds” place position are: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 (one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred, and nine hundred).

, When you are given a number with three digits, the number has a “ones” place piece, “tens” place piece, and “hundreds” place piece. To decompose a number of this size, you need to separate it into all three of its pieces.



Example: Decompose the number 394.

The 3 is in the “hundreds” place, so this part of the number can be separated and written as 300.
The 9 is in the “tens” place, so this part of the number can be separated and written as 90.
The 4 is in the “ones” place, so this part of the number can be separated and written as 4.
Your final written answer should look like: 394 = 300 + 90 + 4
When written as 394, the number is in its standard form. When written as 300 + 90 + 4, the number is in its expanded form.



, You can decompose larger numbers using the same principle.


A digit in any place-position can be separated out into its separate piece by substituting the numbers to the right of the digit with zeroes. This is true no matter how large the number is.

Example: 5,394,128 = 5,000,000 + 300,000 + 90,000 + 4,000 + 100 + 20 + 8

, You can decompose decimal numbers, but every number placed past the decimal point must be decomposed into a position piece that is also written with a decimal point.


The “tenths” position is used for a single digit that comes after (to the right of) the decimal point.
The “hundredths” position is used when there are two digits to the right of the decimal point.
The “thousandths” position is used when there are three digits to the right of the decimal point.

, When you have a number that includes digits to both the left and right of the decimal point, you must decompose it by breaking apart both sides.


Note that all numbers that appear to the left of the decimal point can still be decomposed in the same manner they would be when no decimal point is present.

Example: Decompose the number 431.58

The 4 is in the “hundreds” place, so it should be separated and written as: 400
The 3 is in the “tens” place, so it should be separated and written as: 30
The 1 is in the “ones” place, so it should be separated and written as: 1
The 5 is in the “tenths” place, so it should be separated and written as: 0.5
The 8 is in the hundredths place, so it should be separated and written as: 0.08
The final answer can be written as: 431.58 = 400 + 30 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.08

Understand the concept.,
Practice with a small number.,
Work through all the different addend combinations.,
Use visuals, if necessary.",How to Decompose Numbers2," When you decompose a number into its various addends, you are breaking that number apart into different sets of other numbers (addends) that can be added together to get the original value.


When one addend is subtracted from the original number, the second addend should be the answer you get.
When both addends are added together, the original number should be the sum you calculate.

, This practice is easiest to do when you have a single digit number (a number that only has a “ones” place).


You can combine the principles learned here with those learned in the “Decomposing into Hundreds, Tens, and Ones” section when you need to decompose larger numbers, but since there are so many possible addend combinations for larger numbers as a whole, this method would be impractical to use alone when working with large numbers.

, To decompose a number into its addends, all you need to do is write down all of the different possible ways of creating the original problem number using smaller numbers and addition.



Example: Decompose the number 7 into its different addends.

7 = 0 + 7
7 = 1 + 6
7 = 2 + 5
7 = 3 + 4
7 = 4 + 3
7 = 5 + 2
7 = 6 + 1
7 = 7 + 0



, For someone trying to learn this concept for the first time, it might be helpful to use visuals that demonstrate the process in practical, hands-on terms.


Start with the original number of something. For instance, if the number is seven, you could start with seven jellybeans.

Separate the pile into two different piles by pulling one jellybean to the side. Count the remaining jellybeans in the second pile and explain that the original seven have been decomposed into “one” and “six.”
Continue separating jellybeans into two different piles by gradually taking away from the original pile and adding to the second pile. Count the number of jellybeans in both piles with each move.


This can be done with a number of different materials, including small candies, paper squares, colored clothespins, blocks, or buttons.

Look at a simple addition equation.,
Decompose the numbers in the equation.,
Manipulate and rewrite the equation into an easier form.,
Solve the equation.",How to Decompose Numbers3," You can combine both decomposition methods to break these types of equations apart into different forms.


This is easiest when used for simple addition equations, but it becomes less practical when used for long equations.

, Look at the equation and separate the numbers into separate ""tens"" and ""ones"" places. If necessary, you can further separate the ""ones"" by decomposing them into smaller chunks.



Example: Decompose and solve the equation: 31 + 84

You can decompose 31 into: 30 + 1
You can decompose 84 into: 80 + 4



, The equation can be rewritten so that each decomposed component stands separately, or you can combine certain decomposed components to help you make better sense of the equation as a whole.



Example: 31 + 84 = 30 + 1 + 80 + 4 = 30 + 80 + 5 = 100 + 10 + 5

, After rewriting the equation into a form that makes more sense to you, all you need to do is add up the numbers and find the sum.



Example: 100 + 10 + 5 = 115

Set V(c) = V(s) via r1^3 = 4/3πr2^3;
,
r1^3/r2^3 = 4/3π by dividing both sides by r2^3 and simplifying.

,r1/r2 = (4/3π)^(1/3) = 1.61199195401647 by taking the cube root of both sides and evaluating the right side in Excel as ""=(4/3*PI())^(1/3)""

,
Now we can find either r1 or r2 given the other one, for r1 = r2 * 1.61199195401647 and r2 = r1 / 1.61199195401647, where r2 is the radius of the sphere and r1 is the side of the cube.

,
We now have also learned that (4/3π)^(1/3) MEANS the constant of proportion of the volume of a cube equal in volume to a sphere of different basis length r.

In the picture, the primes are depicted in red on a white background and certain rows, columns and diagonals stand out right away as being probable candidates for producing more primes.,
Knowing (or further discovering) the formulas for certain primes-rich rows and columns and diagonals you want to investigate, select first the left side of the line returning 10 primes and extended the series from 8 to 32 results.,
To investigate the right side of the line, follow the same procedure of analyzing the formula underlying the series 3, 2, 11, 28, 53, etc.,
Investigate further.,
Investigate the last line.,
Check against the Known Primes List.,
It may be that by some keen usage of Continued Fractions, in combination with the Spirallic Dataset, for primes vs. Non-Primes, a key discovery might be made, since almost every number (AEN) is susceptible to cogent representation by continued fractions.,
Expect a big decrease.,See the article How to Create a Spirallic Numbers Dataset for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.,For more art charts and graphs, you might also want to click on Category:Microsoft Excel Imagery, Category:Mathematics, Category:Spreadsheets or Category:Graphics to view many Excel worksheets and charts where Trigonometry, Geometry and Calculus have been turned into Art, or simply click on the category as appears in the upper right white portion of this page, or at the bottom left of the page.",How to Datamine for Primes Using a Spirallic Dataset," But do they? Time to investigate further!

Along the bottom of the diagram and right side in black font is the numeric count of primes in that column or row; the variance going from a low of 1 to a high of 10 (in the middle of the right side). This was accomplished via a sample eyeball count with double-check at the bottom right to ensure that the crossfoot totals agreed.
Further, in black font on a blue background, the diagram has been split into halves, left and right and top and bottom, with subtotals and on the right one may view the percentage results of these, as well as the percentage that the high count of 10 bears in relation to all the primes -- it's 10/66 or about 15% of the 66 primes found in the 324 numbers (including 0), a ratio of 66/324 = 20% roughly.
On the file containing the primes up to 821,603 there are 65,535 of them, a ratio of about 8%, so you know right off that prime numbers get rarer the further up you go on the number line.
In another wikiHow, the analytical method for discovering the formulas that create the series of the datasheet is described more fully––see the Related wikiHows at the bottom of this article.;
, You'll find 11 primes in all, including the original 4 of 17,47,149 and 268, which is a result of 50% of 8. You thus obtain a new result of 11/32, or about 34%., (which you had basically already done).

Extend this series by incrementing a and b by 2 each time of ((a*b)+c)+d=Sum and decrementing c by -5 while leaving d constant at 8.
Try extending the series to 32 members from the 9 original ones, counting 3 as well, though it won't fit the formula. You'll arrive at 12 primes in all, including the original 6 of 9, bringing the 2/3 result down to 12/33 or about 36%. In all, for both sides of the 10 line then, you'll find 23/65 primes, or about 35%.

, Repeat the process for other lines which show promise of containing primes. One such line is the series 3, 5, 19, 41, 71, 109, 155, 209, 271 (all are prime except 155 and 209 for a ratio of 7/9 or about 78%) as runs from the center to the upper left corner. You'll notice that, except for the beginning 3, it is one unit away from the diagonal of 2*3, 4*5, 6*7, etc. -- all that is needed is to add a decrement of -1 while adding 2 to each integer multiple each time for the extension.

Try extending the series to 32 members; you'll find 20 primes in all, rendering a ratio of 20/32 = about 63%.
Then extend the lower right part of this diagonal to 32 members. Its series is 3, 13, 31, 57, 91, 133, etc. and its formula is 1*2+1, 3*4+1, etc. So by adding 2 to each of the integer multiples each time and carrying the 1 and Formula, you will quickly be able to extend the series to 32 members. You'll find 11 primes and 11/32 = 34%. For the entire diagonal then, you should obtain (20+11)/(32+32) = 48%.

, This is the series running 5, 17, 37, 65, 101, 145, 197, 257 and 7, 22, 47, 79, 119, 167, 223, 287 -- both returning a figure of 75% primes for 8 numbers invested each time. Extend both of these and summarizing, you should get (13+19)/(32+32) = about 50%.

Therefore, these diagonals and rows proved particularly rich in primes, even as primes became more rare. If they are not ""Predictors"" of primes per se, they are at least good indicators.

, So far this article has not mentioned the rather tedious task involved hereby of having to check each extended number against a Known Primes List. There is also nothing inherently valuable in the process as to establishing whether a number is prime or not, except that it might shortcut that process somewhat. It could, by a thorough approach, investigate all integers but that would be the long way around. To do so, you merely need to build a generating formula for each column and/or row and keep extending it, while doing so in a methodical sweep that takes in every integer. Else, approach the matter as a series of (split?) diagonals. The initial author of this article has not tried this yet, so it is not confirmed whether outlying diagonals need be split at the axis or not as to their formulas but it may well be so, per quadrant entertaining the diagonal., it's worth investigating., All in all, then, you might expect to experience about a 40% loss in the number of primes found as you move from the range of 400 to 4000, approximately, when following the most probable lines of inquiry indicated by a spirallic dataset. The primes page here shows that there exist 586 primes at 4271, or a ratio of 13.72%, versus 76 at 384 or 19.79%. Of the 586 primes at 4271, the initial dataset and thrust along probable lines, reduced for double-counting, captured 131 of them, or 22.4% (the initial 66 being 20% of 384 and 131-66= 65 of the remaining 586-66-520 so 66/520 = 12.7% were captured by the 6 probes along 3 split lines). You might easily improve upon these results as there are more than several strong columns, rows and diagonals indicated which were not pursued in this article. That said, it was not all that long ago that the world's largest prime was found, containing over 17 million digits!,,"

,, For example, take the following regarding elementary catastrophes: Catastrophe theory analyses degenerate critical points of the potential function — points where not just the first derivative, but one or more higher derivatives of the potential function are also zero. These are called the germs of the catastrophe geometries. When the degenerate points are not merely accidental, but are structurally stable, the degenerate points exist as organizing centers for particular geometric structures of lower degeneracy, with critical features in the parameter space around them. If the potential function depends on two or fewer active variables, and 5 or fewer active parameters, then there are only 11 generic structures for these bifurcation geometries, with corresponding standard forms into which the Taylor series around the catastrophe germs can be transformed.,

Figure out what objectives your graphic could help you accomplish.,
Choose the type of graph that is most appropriate for your data.,
Sketch out the foundation for your graphic.,
Set yourself deadlines.,
Think about the amount and complexity of your graphic's data.,
Graph and check your data.,
Label your important necessary content.,
Title your graph.,
Integrate color into your graphic.,
Make your graphic organized using arrows and keys.,
Use explanations if necessary.,
Cite your sources.,
Proofread your graphic.",How to Create a Technical Graphic," This step can help you figure out where and when to integrate your graphic in a text or presentation, and how many graphics you need to create in order to easily get your point across to your targeted audience. For example, you can use graphics to show trends and relationships, explain processes, or show readers how something looks. Hypothetically, if you are presenting all three of these aspects, you now know that your presentation or text will need to contain multiple graphics.;
, Your graph will be much more effective if you think about what you want your audience to learn from the graphic. For example, let's say you want to compare the profits of three different companies over a set amount of time, where one company has a large volume of sales compared to the other two, which have a lower, and also similar amount of sales A line chart works best to show trends in continuous data. In other words, a line chart would effectively show the trend of increasing sales of the company with large profits, because our time variable is at a constant, fixed increase, and we can accurately determine the amount of increase from month to month. If you wanted to categorize the companies, and compare elements of the categories, a bar graph would work best, but is less effective in showing the difference in sales between the two companies with similar volumes of profit than a line chart. Using another example in the graphic above, the line shows a trend in batting average effectively, whereas the bars of the graphic don't really illustrate an up and down trend in innings played clearly. Rather, the bars do a better job in categorizing two different factors in innings played. In addition, if you wanted to find and use data or facts, you would use a table, whereas if you wanted to see the relative size comparison of different variables, you would use a pie chart.

, Here, you only need a rough draft of things to come before you start the major editing. For example, simply decide what variables will go on the X and Y axes, and draw a rough sketch of your data values. Make notes on what you would like to include in your graphic, and how you would want to illustrate that information.This step will help you get an initial idea of what your graphic will look like before you start making major changes.

, Now that you have a plan on what your graphic will look like and illustrate, set yourself some deadlines. Creating a technical graphic that can convey information easily and effectively can be a long process, but also a complex one. Setting yourself goals to get tasks done will help you organize yourself when creating your graphic, and will make your graphic more organized in the long run.

, It is important to consider your reader's knowledge and understanding of the material. You can have the most clear and eye-catching graph out there, but if it includes data that is hard for your audience to understand, that will render your graphic completely ineffective. Be sure to simplify your graphic as much as possible. Use as little material as possible to get to the point, and make sure your data is not too complex for your reader's to understand. This will also help you to utilize white space, which will make your graphic look open, neat, and spacious, like in the image above. While the graphic above does not hold the most information, almost anyone could look at it and easily comprehend it because of its simplicity.

, Graphing your actual data values onto a graph is pretty simple. However, make sure your data is correct after you have graphed it. This is the foundation of your graphic, and it tells your audience your story, so it needs to be on point. Look for strange data values or outliers. If you find some, verify them, or correct them if necessary.

, These labels will allow your audience to navigate your graphic quickly, and will increase their understanding of your information. Label your axes, and label your rows, columns, lines, or slices. Label only the info that the readers absolutely need to obtain to understand the graph. Keep text and numbering as minimal as possible. The less unnecessary detail you have in your graphic, the clearer and less cluttered your graphic will be.

, The last thing you should do is include an informative title. Because you have already verified your data and labeled your graphic, you can now tailor your title to fit the information that shows on the graphic. It is important to do this after you included all other necessary text and values so you can relate your title to the data you provided as much as possible. Be sure to keep the title short an professional. Many graphics actually skip titles entirely. Make sure you actually include a title, because it tells the reader what to expect from your graphic, and allows them to prepare for the information to come, making the presentation of your graphic more effective. In addition, it is less professional not to include a title. For example, while the graphic above is clear and concise, there is no title, which means that we as readers have no idea what this graphic is supposed to represent, which makes this relatively simple graph very difficult to comprehend.

, Now that you have a basic graphic down, you can add color as one of your final touches. Utilizing color can help you highlight important points in your graphic, group related items, and make your graphic more attractive. Try not to use black or gray; bright colors such as yellow, orange, or green will focus your audience more effectively. Color things such as the bars in a bar graph or the lines in a line chart. Keep the background white in order to create a contrast. While we can't see what the variables are in the graphic above, the graphic utilizes color to differentiate these unknown variables.

, If your text and labels seem cluttered within the graphic, try keeping them outside the graphic to keep things more organized. Try using  a color key to represent text, or arrows to point text and labels to their corresponding parts of the graphic. For example, imagine trying to fit all the labels of the graphic above into the graphic itself. It would be an absolute mess! The graphic avoids this by creating a color key and utilizing the colors to represent the different variables.

, Explanations can help your audience understand the material in your graphic better, and can elaborate on the information. Use this step only if the material is complex enough to call for an explanation.

, Whatever data you used for your graphic needs to be cited to avoid plagiarism.

, Check if your graphic is up to par. Check the spelling of your text, labels, and title. Check your data again to see if it's correct. Make sure your graphic utilizes white space and is not cluttered.

Make the dataset by opening a new Excel worksheet and choosing a cell inwards and downwards about 10 rows and columns to start inputting the numbers into.,
Proceed sequentially outwards in a spiral.,After you have built the data set up to 100 or 324 (as in the example), you're good to go!,
You will notice right away that the prime numbers are fairly evenly distributed in the 4 quadrants at this point.,Notice there are a number of sequences to the columns and numbers which follow Summation Notation.,
Notice also that the first sequence is easy -- it's the diagonal from the center to the bottom right.,
Notice the horizontal pattern is a bit trickier to discover.,
Notice that the diagonals take the form of ((a*b)+c)+d = Sum wherein b_sub_0 is 1 greater than a_sub_zero, a_sub_1 was 2 greater than a_sub_0 and b_sub_1 was 2 greater than b_sub_0, i.e.,
There are resolved 2 more sequences: 5=((2*3)-9)+8, 18=((4*5)-10)+8, 39=((6*7)-11)+8, etc.,
Review the spirallic dataset again to see if you can spot any other sequences in it -- how about the Fibonacci Series?,
Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

See the article How to Datamine for Primes Using a Spirallic Dataset for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Create a Spirallic Numbers Dataset,", You may start with 0 or 1 or any number; 1 is recommended., If you want to save a little time, use a formula like ""=J15+1"" and copy it up, across or down off as many cells as need be. You may then find a like formula nearby as you go outwards, which will speed things up greatly. This will also allow you to use any originating number in the center, should you so choose..,, You might try blocking in non-primes in groups in patterns to see if you can predict primes!,, Its pattern to produce the sequence 1,3,13,31,57,91,133,183,241,307, ... is -1*0+1=1, 1*2+1=3, 3*4+1 =13, 5*6+1 = 31, etc. You will find a similar pattern extending to the upper left.

Notice that the second pattern is trickier: the vertical pattern that produces the sequence 1,4,15,34,61,96,139,190,249,316 is more involved. If one takes the difference of those numbers and then the differences of the differences, one gets 8's, so one knows that a constant value of 8 is being added in the sequence. Knowing that, a typical rate of change is produced by ((a*b)+c)+8 = result, with a being constant. Such is the case here as it turns out, for the sequence is produced by ((4*-2)+4+8)=4, ((4*1)+3+8)=15, ((4*6)+2+8)=34, ((4*13)+1+8) = 61, etc. with the increment to b being 3,5,7,... and the increment to c being -1, while a=4 and 8 are constants. There's an elegant way to write that in Summation Notation with N's and K's and i's and all but it's beyond the text capacity we're operating under. Actually, I just found another way to resolve the series: 1==((-1*0)-7)+8, 4=((1*2)-6)+8, 15=((3*4)-5)+8, 34=((5*6)-4)+8, 61=((7*8)-3)+8, 96=((9*10)-2)+8, etc.

, 8's were again a constant difference of the differences but it took me awhile to find the rest of the formula. The sequence of 11,28,53,86,127,176,233,298, ... is generated as far as I know by ((4*-5)+23)+8=11, ((4*-1)+24)+8 = 28, ((4*5)+25)+8 = 53, ((4*13)+26)+8 = 86, etc., with a=4 and 8 remaining constant while b increments by 4, 6, 8,... and c incrementing by 1. Again, there's a more elegant way to state that. If anyone happening to read this can help out, great. There's another way to resolve this sequence also: 2=((2*3)-12)+8, 11=((4*5)-17)+8, 28=((6*7)-22)+8, 53=((8*9)-27)+8, 86=((10*11)-32)+8, 127=((12*13)-37)+8, 176=((14*15)-42)+8, 233=((16*17)-47)+8, and 298 =((18*19)-52)+8, etc. with element c decrementing by -5 each time., (1*2) changed next to (3*4). This might be the general pattern instead of working with 4's as had been, The role of d=8, the difference of the differences, was still present, so then you just need to figure out which a and b pair best approximated the answer and adjust with c accordingly, by trial and error. It did not take long to hit upon the solutions., and also 8==((2*3)-6)+8, 23=((4*5)-5)+8, 46=((6*7)-4)+8, 77=((8*9)-3)+8, 116=((10*11)-2)+8,163=((12*13)-1)+8, 218=((14*15)-0)+8 and 281=((16*17)+1)+8. These were done by the analytical method described above in Step 9, though it's a good hunch the problem will only yield to greater finesse than the lazy mathematician possesses., Has anyone hi-lited that yet? Might be interesting!

, Draw HG and construct a line through F parallel to HG. Let it intersect DG at E., Then DE will have length x^2., For example, to obtain x^3, use the relation DE/DH = DC/DF which becomes DE/1 = DC/DF, which becomes DE*DF = DC, and since DE = x^2 and DF = x, then DC = x^3. See Diagram below. This works because the lines EH and CF are parallel and so the triangles are similar and Euclid's theorem holds.,, Use relation DC/DH = DB/DF; DC/1 = DB/DF; DC*DF = DB; thus x^3 * x = x^4.,

Collect your study materials.,
Have lots of examples on hand.,
Avoid distractions.,
Cram with your classmates.,
Practice breathing deeply.,
Avoid cramming for exams when possible.",How to Cram for Math2," Having all your course materials on hand will help save you time and energy. Be sure to have your textbooks, study notes, study guides, and your course notes readily available so you won’t waste time searching for them in the middle of solving an equation.Be sure to have a calculator, fresh pencils, and lots of paper handy, too.

, Be sure to collect notes and worksheets that have examples of the equations and formulas you are studying in class.The more examples you have, the more you will be able to understand the steps for solving the problem. In addition, you will be able to recognize patterns, identify incorrect information, or spot common mistakes.

, Make sure that the television is turned off or that your phone is put away before you begin studying. These distractions shift your focus from studying, and they make it more difficult to absorb the information quickly.


If you work better in a quiet environment, visit your local library or study hall at school to avoid interruptions and cram in peace., Studying with others can be an effective way to absorb material and learn new skills. Your friends or classmates may help you understand certain methods for solving math problems, or they may share some tips and tricks of their own for solving the equations.If you study well with others, consider asking some of your classmates to join you in a study session at the library or a nearby coffee shop.

, Cramming for an exam can be stressful, so make sure you are taking breaks and allowing yourself to relax by taking deep breaths. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose and hold for ten counts. Exhale slowly through your mouth, and wait a few seconds before taking another deep breath.Practicing deep breathing can help increase optimism and help you control your emotions, which is helpful during a stressful cramming session., Cramming for an exam can cause stress and prevent you from adequately retaining the information.Make plans to study for your math tests over several weeks instead of waiting until a day or two before an exam. Having scheduled, regular study sessions will help you understand the material more thoroughly, and it will give you time to you to talk to your instructor if you don’t understand something fully.Create a math study schedule. If you make and follow a study schedule, it will become a part of your regular routine. Decide how many days per week you should study and find free time in your schedule. If you are a morning person, plan to review your notes during breakfast. If you work best in the evening, set aside time to practice sample problems after dinner.

Have a light, protein-filled breakfast. Enjoy some yogurt with fruit or some scrambled eggs and toast. Avoid eating a large, heavy meal, which might make you feel tired and sluggish during the exam., Before you begin solving problems, read through all the instructions and be sure you understand what is required. You do not want to misinterpret the problem and miss a crucial step., To make the most of your time, scan through the entire exam first and find the problems that you are most comfortable solving. If you are struggling with a particular problem, skip it and return to it later. Working through the easier or shorter problems will not only save you time, but it will help get you warmed up to tackle the more difficult, longer, or more complicated problems.Make sure your handwriting is clear and legible so that your instructor can fairly and accurately assess your efforts., After you have completed the math problems that you are comfortable solving, switch your focus toward the most difficult problems. You will be able to use your remaining time to concentrate solely on these more difficult, complicated equations.


If you are solving the problems on a separate sheet of paper, be sure you have written down the equation correctly., If you cannot complete a problem or you get stuck, don’t erase the work you have done and leave it blank. You may be able to get partial credit for some of the work you have completed. Write a note that explains what your thought process was for that particular problem, or briefly explain what you were trying to do and why you got stuck. Your instructor may award you a few points for your attempts, and they will be able to help you understand where you went wrong after the exams have been graded., Even if you finish the exam early, stick around and wait until the end of the allotted time before you submit the test. You may remember an important concept, or you might review a completed problem and realize you worked through it incorrectly.Be sure to review each problem before submitting the exam.

Learn what binary means.,
Add one by changing the last 0 into a 1.,
Write another digit if all the numbers are one.,
Use these rules to count to five.,
Count to six.,
Count to ten.,
Notice when new digits get added.,
Practice with higher numbers.",How to Count in Binary1," Our normal counting system is called decimal, or ""base ten."" We have ten different symbols for writing numbers, ranging from 0 to 9. Binary is a ""base two"" system, using only the symbols 0 and 1.;
, If a binary number ends in 0, you can count one higher by changing this to a 1. We can use this to count the first two numbers just as you would expect:


0 = zero
1 = one
For higher numbers, you can ignore the earlier digits of the number. 1010 + 1 = 1011.

, Now we have ""1"" for one, but we've already run out of symbols! In order to count to two, we need to write another digit. Add a ""1"" to the front of the number, and ""reset"" all the other digits to 0.


0 = zero
1 = one
10 = two
This is the same rule we use in decimal when we run out of symbols (9 + 1 = 10). It just happens a lot more often in binary because we run out of symbols sooner.

, These rules will get you as far as the number five. See if you can do it yourself, then check your work:


0 = zero
1 = one
10 = two
11 = three
100 = four
101 = five

, Now we need to solve five + one in decimal, or 101 + 1. The key here is to ignore the first digit. Just add the 1 + 1 at the end to get 10. (Remember, this is how you write ""two"".) Now restore the first digit and you get:


110 = six

, There are no new rules you need to learn. Try it yourself, then check your work with this list:


110 = six
111 = seven
1000 = eight
1001 = nine
1010 = ten

, Do you see that ten (1010) doesn't look like a ""special"" number in binary? Eight (1000) is much more important now, because it equals 2 x 2 x 2. Keep multiplying by two to find other important numbers like sixteen (10000) and thirty-two (100000).

, Now you know everything you need to count in binary. If you're ever confused about what comes next, just work out what happens to the last digits. Here are a few examples to help you out:


twelve plus one = 1100 + 1 = 1101 (0 + 1 = 1, and the other digits stay the same.)
fifteen plus one = 1111 + 1 = 10000 = sixteen (We've run out of symbols, so we reset to 0 and write a 1 at the start.)
forty-five plus one = 101101 + 1 = 101110 = forty-six (We know 01 + 1 = 10, and the other digits stay the same.)

In the previous article on Continued Fractions, How to Start Working with Continued Fractions, some generalized continued fraction expansions (""cfe"") were shown for pi, which make much more sense than the seemingly random string of digits in the decimal representation of π.
,The cfe for one of phi's roots was also shown and partially explained.,The beginnings of the tutorial for this article were also started but not thoroughly explained.,It would be a good idea to review and work that article first before this one.",How to Create an XL Worksheet for Continued Fractions1,",,,"

Write down the value of each binary place.,
Multiply each digit by its place value.,
Add all the products together.",How to Count in Binary2," When you learned decimal counting, you learned about the ""place values"": the ones place, tens place, and so on. Since binary has two symbols, the place values multiply by two each time you move to the left:



1 is the ones place

10 is the twos place

100 is the fours place

1000 is the eights place

, Start with the ones place on the far right, and multiply that digit (0 or 1) by one. On a separate line, move to the twos place, and multiply that digit by two. Repeat this pattern until you've multiplied each digit by its place value. Here's an example:


What is the binary number 10011 in decimal?
The rightmost digit is 1. This is in the ones place, so multiply by one: 1 x 1 = 1.
The next digit is also 1. Multiply this by two: 1 x 2 = 2.
The next digit is 0. Multiply this by four: 0 x 4 = 0.
The next digit is also 0. Multiply this by eight: 0 x 8 = 0.
The leftmost digit is 1. Multiply this by sixteen (eight times two): 1 x 16 = 16.

, Now you've converted each digit into its decimal value. To find the value of the full number, just add all the decimal values together. Here's the rest of your example:


1 + 2 + 16 = 19.
The binary number 10011 is the same as the decimal number 19.

Figure out the Answer for the second root of Phi.,
Check your final Answer: Question your work: Is the Continued Fraction just calculated for -.618 033 989 000 000 going to be the same as that for -0.618 033 988 749 895 ?

,
Use the means devised in the previous article, ""How to Start Working with Continued Fractions"", the long column -- or see worksheet Approach 1.",How to Create an XL Worksheet for Continued Fractions3," Phi as two roots, since quadratically its roots are determined by (1±sqrt(5))/2. In the previous article, ""How to Start Working with Continued Fractions"", we looked at the Continued Fraction for one root, 1.61803398874989, namely and found out it is the most irrational of all the irrational numbers, in that it converges the most slowly, due to the 1's in its Continued Fraction being the least possible divisors. Now you'll derive the Continued Fraction for the other root, -0.618033988749895, i.e. (1-(sqrt(5))/2.

Copy the mostly-outlined cell range A2:P23 and paste it to P28;
Select cell range H30:H47 and do Edit Clear Contents;
Enter to cell B30 the formula, '=""-618033989/1 000 000 000""', omitting the external semi-quotes and spaces between the zeroes but keeping the internal quote marks;
Adjust column width for column B and any other columns that need adjusting;
Do the Tricky Part for cells G30:G47 to H30:H47. Here are your check values:

Choose a staple remover.,
Place paper upside-down and examine the staple.,
Use the staple remover to lift the prongs.,
Flip over the paper and remove the staple.,
Discard old staples.",How to Remove Staples1," There are lots of different mechanisms that you can use to loosen staples and remove them from paper, some super-simple and some a bit more complex. Depending on how much paper you've got to remove, you might find one or the other more useful.


Spring-activated staple removers are the most simple and cheap mechanisms for removing staples. Basically, these are little claws that you can use to pinch open the back clasps of the staple to free it up and remove it. You can get these at most office supply stores for a dollar or less.
""Office-style"" staple removers are more complex, but just as simple to use and more ergonomic. Featuring a scissors-like design, these staple removers allow you to position the end over the staple claps, then pull the trigger to activate and loosen the staple. Couldn't be easier.
Your fingers are also perfectly effective at getting a few staples out of paper. If you've got a big stack, though, it might not be worth the aggravation, and would be better to get a staple remover. Use a small penny, nail clippers, the end of a pen, or some other object to help lift the tabs of the staples if you just want to use your fingers.;
, The back of the staples should form two prongs that will need to be straightened out to remove them without tearing the paper too much. Expose the side of the staple with the prongs and position it facing up on the table.


If you notice that the prongs are broken, or already loose, it may be quicker and more simple to just pull it loose, rather than fiddling with the remover.

, Position the staple remover over the prongs of the staple and pinch the staple open. This won't remove it entirely, but it should help to straighten the two prongs that were holding it in place. Doing this should allow you to pull the staple free.


If you're using the spring-style staple remover, make sure the little teeth are positioned accurately, so you'll pinch them open cleanly, without damaging the paper. You usually can do this on either side of the paper, if you're using a real staple remover.

, After you've loosened the teeth, you should be able to wiggle the staple free. You can use your fingers, or use the teeth of the staple remover to grab the staple and pull it free.


If it catches some, be careful not to rip the paper. Wiggle your wrist back and forth gently to help coax the staple through. Bent, old, or rusty staples will be more difficult to get loose than newer staples, so it might take some work. Just slow down and give it time.

, Keep your staples in a clean pile while you're working, especially if you've got a big pile of papers to go through, and then dispose of them properly. Stepping on a loose staple, or getting one caught on your finger can be a painful experience, so it's good to start cleaning up as you work, rather than waiting for later.


Keep a trash can right beside your desk, so you can sweep the loose staples directly into it if necessary. Do this regularly to avoid building up too much clutter in your work area.

Open MATLAB.,
Clear data.,
Create a new function file.,
Name your function file.,
Prepare the function file for use.,
Assign input arguments.,
Assign output argument.,
Create an empty table.,
Create the outer ""for"" loop.,
Create the inner ""for"" loop.,
Multiply the columns and rows together.,
Fill in the empty table with the multiplied values.,
Complete the two ""for"" loops.,
Check to see if MATLAB has detected any errors.,
Name and save your function file.,
Test your function.",How to Create a Multiplication Table in MATLAB Using Nested Loops," Start the MATLAB software, and check that the software is functioning correctly. If the software is ready to be used, it will display a ""Ready"" message in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen (highlighted in red).


If the message displays ""busy"", then MATLAB is still running a function from a previous instance. To safely stop any MATLAB function, press Ctrl+C at the same time. This will cancel any currently running calculations, allowing MATLAB to be used again.;
, If there are any variables in the Workspace, type clear and press ↵ Enter. This will clear any past data from the Workspace, the toolbox on the left of the screen. If the Workspace is empty, you may skip this step.


This command only clears variable data, so any past files that you saved will remain stored in MATLAB.

, To create a new function file, select ""Function"" under the ""New"" tab in the top left hand corner. Function files are user-created lines of code that perform specific actions. Function files allow users to run multiple complex calculations with a single line of code.

, Replace the text Untitled with a name for your function file that you can choose. You can choose any name that is not already in use by MATLAB, but there are some restrictions.


The name must start with a letter
No foreign or special characters
Underscores must be used in place of spaces

, Delete the green text to clear up space for your code. The spacing between the header line and the end does not matter.

, Delete the input_args and in the brackets put a variable n. Variables in Matlab are letters or words that represent a numeric value and are used to simplify calculations. This variable will be the dimensions of the multiplication table. When the function file is run, the user will input a value for the variable to be used in the function file.


Function files can have more than one input, or they can have none at all.

, Delete the output_args and in the parentheses put a variable named Table. This variable will be the completed multiplication table that will be displayed at the end of the function file.

, On the next line, type the same variable as the output variable from the previous step and set it equal to zeros(n);. This will create an n x n table of zeros that will serve as a template when the function is executed.


The semi-colon prevents MATLAB from displaying every calculation from this line, which would clutter the screen with irrelevant data.

, The first line of the ""for"" loop will be for Column = 1:1:n. This outer loop will serve as column header for the multiplication table.


The ""for"" tells MATLAB that this is a for loop and will be highlighted in blue. ""Column"" is the variable that will tell MATLAB how many times it will run and the value the variable will have when it is run. In this example, the for loop will run from ""1"" to ""n"", with the middle ""1"" adding 1 to the variable each time. With normal ""for"" loops, you would have to write a code that would tell the loop what to do each time it runs beneath the ""for"" line. However, with certain nested loops such as this one, the code that will run will only be in the inner loop.

, This line will be for Row = 1:1:n, which is the same as the previous step but for the rows of the table.

, Underneath the previous step, type Entry = Row*Column;.


This will multiply each row with each column to produce the entries of the multiplication table. Alignment of the lines will not mess up the code, but MATLAB will automatically format the lines in a loop together anyways. Once again the semi-colon is used to prevent MATLAB from displaying every single calculation, as only the completed table is important.

, For the final line of the inner ""for"" loop, type Table(Column, Row) = Entry;.


This will take each value multiplied by the row and column, and replace the zeros from the empty table in step 8. ""(Column, Row)"" acts as a coordinate point for the multiplication table which tells MATLAB where the location of the value is.

, Every loop needs an ""end"" statement when the code is finished. To complete the nested loop or function file, add an end under the previous step. Then press ↵ Enter and add another end on a separate line. There should be nothing else on the a line that has an ""end"" statement.


There should be a third end statement at the very end that was automatically added by MATLAB to complete the function. The amount of space between a loop and its ""end"" statement does not matter.
As a general rule, there should be an ""end"" statement somewhere underneath for every blue highlighted word.
To check if there are enough ""end"" statements, click on a blue highlighted word. It will highlight the other blue word that is connected to it.

, Check the right bar of the function file to see if MATLAB has found any errors in your code. The color of the box will indicate whether there are any problems with the code. If there are any problems, MATLAB will place a colored line next to where the error is.


Green - There are no problems with the code. You may proceed to the next step.
Orange/Yellow - Missing a semi-colon. This means the function will still work, but it will be slower and show unnecessary information.
Red - There is a serious problem that will prevent the function from running. Hovering the mouse over a red line under the box will tell you what kind of error is found on that line. Clicking on Details will give you an explanation and suggest possible ways of fixing the error.

, To save your function file, press the Save as option under the ""Save"" tab. When naming a function file, always use the same name as the name you chose for your function file, to avoid any confusion.


By default, MATLAB files are saved to C:\Users\\Documents\MATLAB.

, To test your function file, run it by typing the name of the function file and add input arguments in parentheses. To make a 6x6 multiplication table for example, type MultiplicationTable(6) into the command window at the bottom of the screen, replacing ""MultiplicationTable"" with the name that you saved the function file under. You have now completed a function file to produce a multiplication table.

Choose a staple remover.,
Pull as many up with carpeting as you can.,
Pry up the staples using the staple remover.,
Sweep up loose staples thoroughly.",How to Remove Staples2," After removing carpeting, it's a common sight to find many leftover staples stuck in the subfloor. It can be aggravating, but necessary, to take the time to go around and remove them quickly to make your new install as clean and secure as possible. A few tools are helpful at getting this done as quickly as possible:


Flathead screwdriver and pliers make a good tandem if you want to go primitive. You can use the screwdriver to pry up or separate the screws and the pliers to pull them loose. If you'd rather, you can just go for the pliers.
Office-style staple removers can be effective at removing certain varieties of staples. If the staples are small enough to work in a trigger-style staple remover like you might use to remove staples from paper, feel free to give it a shot. Better yet would be a flat prybar-style staple remover, which are common at office supply stores.
Knee pads are extremely valuable while you're undertaking this project. After fifteen minutes crawling around on your knees on a hard floor covered in carpet adhesive and staples, you'll be wishing you had some.

, If you’re removing carpet, lots of floor staples will come up with the carpet as you remove it. Discarding the staples will mostly be a matter of sweeping them up from the floor. Many, however, will remain stuck and will need to be removed, but getting as many as you can while you’re removing the carpet in the first place will make it a lot easier.


Go slowly, using your pry bar underneath to loose the carpet as you're pulling it loose to help bring up as many staples with the carpet as possible. Don’t take too much carpet at once, or go too quickly. You'll make the job much easier on yourself if you leave fewer staples.

, Whether you want to use your staple remover or go primitive with a screwdriver, there's little science to the job. Just get down there and start prying them loose. If you've got a partner, it can be effective to have one person doing the loosening and another pinching them loose with pliers. Get coordinating to see what works best for you and the tools you've got at hand.

, It's important that you don't leave any staples laying around. Sweep them up, or use a Shop-Vac to suck them up from the floor when you're done, especially if you're going to be installing new carpet relatively soon. Try to get all of them.

Open up the standard or mini stapler.,
Insert the fresh staples.,
Close the stapler.,
Check that the stapler operates correctly by doing a test staple.",How to Refill a Stapler1," On most staplers, you lift the top. There may be some latches on the side that need to slide to unlock it. In some cases, the stapler doesn't open upward; instead, a large push button on the top rear ejects the tray out the front. Examine the stapler you're refilling to work out which method will open the stapler tray.
Your product manual will also be able to help you determine which method of staple loading your particular standard staple will use.;
, This is done by placing a stick or row of joined staples in the tray. Align the stick so the edges go inside the tray's slots on each side. If your stapler opens on the top, you can pop it open and drop in a strop of staples. It may also load from the front, in which case you'll have to pop out a magazine from the front of the stapler; or it may load from the back and you can slide out a tray into which you'll drop the staples.Staples are held together gently in a stick or row by force or glue. This is to make their addition much easier.
You may need tweezers to remove fresh staples from the stapler package if you find it hard to get your fingers in.
If you have partial rows, you may add these as long as they slide into place easily.
While it is possible to add single staples, this is not recommended.

, This may require pushing the top of the stapler down, or sliding the tray back in. Usually, you will notice a small click as the magazine slides into the correct position.


If you’re not sure whether or not your stapler is completely closed, check and see if a staple is released when you press the magazine to the base.
If the stapler wasn’t completely closed before, this might close it.

, Place a small stack (2-3 pages) of scrap papers between the magazine and the staple base. If it works, you've added the staples correctly.


If your staples emerge bent, or they remain stuck inside your stapler, you’ll need to reopen the stapler.
Usually, the alignment of the staples will be at fault. Remove the staples, and reinsert, making adjustments so that the staples are properly aligned with the magazine edges.
Avoid stapling too many papers at once with a mini-stapler, as this can cause jamming or even break the stapler. Stick to the amount recommended by the manufacturer.

,,,,, derive the Quadratic Formula. Try that now if you please.,,,



x+b-b = xb-b
x = b*(x-1)
x/(x-1) = b and b/(b-1) = x, by commutation. We have isolated and defined b in terms of x and 1, where x may not equal 1, and b may not equal 1. Given x then, we may determine b.
Let us now substitute x/(x-1) for b in the original equation:
x+ x/(x-1) = x * x/(x-1), and the right becomes x^2/(x-1) = c, or b^2/(b-1) = c.
Distribute the left's denominator to c by multiplying both sides by it, to get:
x^2 = cx - c, or stated in ax^2 + bx + c = y = 0 form, you get 1x^2 - cx + c = 0. a=1, b=c.
Stated in roots form, you should arrive at:
{x1, x2} = ( -(-c) ± sqrt(c^2 - 4*1*c))/(2*1)
Let c = 1 and the result is imaginary. More interesting to this editor is c = 5, like the 5 fingers on your hand -- exactly like the 5 fingers on your hand let's say.
{x1} = (5 + sqrt(25 - 20))/2 = 3.618033989, and Phi is clearly visible!
{x2} = (5 - sqrt(25 - 20))/2 = 1.381966011, which is Phi^2 +1 !!
Each finger on your hand is proportioned according to Phi, please realize. Not by what was just proved here, but it is a known scientific fact. That is some Sacred Geometry, note well.
Lastly, what was true on the one hand for x, is equally true on the other hand for b, due to Symmetry by Commutation.



, It is one's belief that, etymologically, the word ""five"" and ""Phi"" are related at root, probably at the morphemic level, ""phi"" being of Greek meaning for you to research on your own at this point. Excitedly, one hopes!

Understand the relationship between micrometers and nanometers.,
Determine the number of micrometers you are converting.,
Multiply the number of micrometers by 1,000.",How to Convert Micrometers to Nanometers1," Micrometers and nanometers are both units of measurement in the metric system. Nanometers are smaller than micrometers.There are 1,000 nanometers in 1 micrometer., This information should be given to you. Make sure you are supposed to convert micrometers to nanometers. If you are converting nanometers to micrometers, or between units of measurements other than these two units, you cannot use this method, as  your calculations will be different. 

The micrometers might be listed as a whole number, or as a decimal. For example, you might need to convert 7.8 micrometers to nanometers.


, Since you are converting a larger unit into a smaller unit, you will end up with more units than you started with.Since there are 1,000 nanometers per 1 micrometer, to find the number of nanometers, multiply by 1,000.

For example, 7.8×1,000=7,800{\displaystyle 7.8\times 1,000=7,800}.So, 7.8micrometers=7,800nanometers{\displaystyle 7.8\,{\text{micrometers}}=7,800\,{\text{nanometers}}}.

Learn the most common metric prefixes.,
List the prefixes on a line.,
Determine whether the units you want are larger or smaller than the units you have.,
Determine the numerical relationship between the units you have and the units you want.,
For ""large to small"" conversions, multiply by the appropriate power of ten.,
For ""small to large"" conversions, divide by the appropriate power of ten.",How to Convert Within Metric Measurements2," The metric system has a variety of units of measurement - you have probably heard of meters (which measure distance) and grams (which measure mass), etc. These base units are sometimes either too small or too large to make practical measurements. In these cases, it's necessary to use units that differ from the base units by a power of 10 - in other words, measurements that are 10 times larger or smaller, 100 times larger or smaller, and so on. In these cases, we add prefixes to the name of the unit to signify how much bigger or smaller it is than the base unit. The most common of these prefixes, from ""1,000 times larger"" to ""1,000 times smaller,"" are:


Kilo - 1,000 times larger
Hecto - 100 times larger
Deca - 10 times larger
Deci - 10 times smaller
Centi - 100 times smaller
Milli - 1,000 times smaller
A handy trick for remembering the basic metric prefixes is the mnemonic ""King Henry Died Until Drinking Chocolate Milk,"" (or, if you prefer, ""King Henry Doesn't Usually Drink Chocolate Milk""). The first letter of each word corresponds to a basic metric prefix, in order of largest to smallest, except for the ""U"" in ""Until"", which corresponds to ""unit,"" or the metric base units (meter, liter, etc.)

, If you're unfamiliar with metric units, it can be helpful to list the metric prefixes on a line in order of largest to smallest. Put ""Kilo"" at the far left end of the line and ""Milli"" at the far right end. In the middle of the scale, between ""Deca"" and ""Deci,"" put the base unit of the dimension you're measuring. In other words, if you're measuring distance, write ""meter,"" if you're measuring volume, write ""liter,"" and so on. This line gives you a simple visual reference for how your units relate - whether the units you want are larger or smaller than the units you have, and how much larger or smaller they are.

, Look at your line of prefixes. Find the prefix that corresponds with the units you took your initial measurement in. Next, find your desired units. Are they to the right or to the left of your initial units? If they are to the right, you are converting from a larger unit into a smaller one. If they are to the left, you are going from a smaller unit to a larger one.


For example, let's say that we want to know how long a 10-kilometer race is in centimeters. On our line of prefixes, we would see that ""centi"" is to the right of ""kilo"". Since our desired units are to the right of our initial units, we know we're converting from a large unit into a smaller unit.

, Metric units of measurement differ by powers of 10 - 10, 100, 1,000, and so on. Thus, converting from one metric unit to another is always accomplished by multiplying or dividing your initial measurement by the appropriate power of ten. Look at the arrow you've drawn from the units you have - the units your measurement has been taken in - to the units you want to convert to. The number of spaces under your arrow gives the power of ten by which your two units are related.


For instance, in our 10-kilometer race example, we see that our arrow from ""kilo"" to ""centi"" jumps over five spaces. This means that kilometers and centimeters differ by a conversion factor of five powers of ten, also written as ten to the fifth power, 105, or 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 100,000. In other words, centimeters are 100,000 times (or 105, etc.) times smaller than kilometers. Thus, you know that there are 100,000 centimeters in 1 kilometer.

, Converting from a large unit to a smaller unit means you should multiply your original measurement by the amount that its units differ from the desired final units. Remember that this number should be a power of ten given by the number of spaces under the arrow you drew in the steps above.


Sometimes, especially in schoolwork, it's not enough to simply give the correct number. You'll also be asked to show how you converted your initial unit label to its final form. In simple conversions like we're dealing with here, just label the units of your initial measurement as you normally would, then label your conversion factor with the fraction (desired units)/(units of your initial measurement). The units in the denominator will cancel with the units of your initial measurement, leaving your answer in terms of your desired units.
In our 10-kilometer race example, we would simply multiply 10 (our initial measurement in kilometers) by 105 (or 100,000 - the number of centimeters in a kilometer). See below:

10 km × 105 cm/km =
10 km × 100,000 cm/km =
= 1,000,000 cm. There are 1,000,000 centimeters in our 10 kilometer race.



, Converting from a small unit to a larger unit is essentially the opposite process as the reverse - instead of multiplying, you'll need to divide. Take your initial measurement and divide it by the amount that its units differ from the desired final units - again, this should be a power of ten.


Alternatively, you can multiply by the inverse power of ten to get the same results. For example, rather than dividing your measurement by 103, you would multiply it by 10-3. Both operations are valid and will give the same answer.
Let's do an example problem. Let's say we want to covert 360 centimeters to decameters. Since ""centi"" and ""deca"" are three spaces apart on the line of prefixes, we know that decameters are 103 times larger than centimeters. We would convert by dividing as follows:

360 cm / (103 cm/dam) =
360 cm / (1,000 cm/dam) =
= 0.36 dam. 360 centimeters make 0.36 decameters.

Determine the direction and size of the conversion.,
Move the decimal point in your measurement.,
Add zeroes as necessary.",How to Convert Within Metric Measurements3," This quick method will allow you to simply and easily convert between metric units without having to perform any multiplication or division. To begin, all you need to know is whether you're converting from a small unit to a larger unit or vice versa, as well as the size of the conversion you're making - in other words, whether your desired units differ from your initial units by 101, 102, etc.


Both of these can be determined by counting spaces and/or drawing an arrow on a line of the metric prefixes. For example, if we want to convert from kilometers to decameters, we know that we're converting from a large unit to a small unit because we have to travel to the right along the line to get from ""kilo"" to ""deca,"" and we know that decameters are 102 times smaller than kilometers because ""kilo"" and ""deca"" are separated by two spaces.

, Since two metric units always differ from each other by some multiple of ten, it's possible to make metric conversions simply by shifting your initial number's decimal point. When converting from a large unit to a smaller unit, shift the decimal point one digit to the right for each power of ten that your desired units differ from your initial units. When converting from a small unit to a larger unit, move the decimal place to the left. Remember that the power of ten by which your desired units differ from your initial units is given by the number of spaces apart the two units are on the line of prefixes.


For example, let's say that we want to convert 1 kilometer into centimeters. Since we can tell from the line of prefixes that centimeters are 105 times smaller than kilometers, we move the decimal point in ""1"" five spaces to the right. See below:

1.0
10.0
100.0
1,000.0
10,000.0
100,000.0. There are 100,000.0. centimeters in 1 kilometer.


You may also do the reverse - move a number's decimal to the left to convert to a larger unit.

, When you move a number's decimal point, be sure to add zeroes for each space that you move the decimal point beyond the available digits. For instance, when converting 1 kilometer to centimeters, the decimal point is initially to the right of the number 1, as so: 1. Moving the decimal place to the right means you must insert a zero so that the number becomes 10.


The same principal applies when moving a decimal point to the left - begin inserting zeroes when you move the decimal beyond the number's available digits. For instance, let's say we want to convert 1 millimeter into meters. Since meters are 103 times larger than millimeters, we would simply move the decimal three spaces to the left as below:

1.0
0.10
0.010. Notice that we add a zero to the left of the 1.
0.0010. We add another zero to get our final answer. There are 0.001 meters in 1 millimeter.


Only add zeroes if you run out of digits when moving the decimal point. Inserting superfluous zeroes into the middle of a number can make your answer incorrect.

Find the release button.,
Press the release.,
Turn the staple gun over.,
Place the staples into the staple gun.,
Close the staple gun.,
Test your staple gun.",How to Refill a Stapler2," Manual and electric staplers have a release button, usually located at the rear of the staple gun. Sometimes it is easily identified as a gripped area covered in rubber. It is often at the end of the handle.


Medium and heavy wire staple guns generally load from the top, while most fine wire staplers are bottom load.
You’ll want to make sure that the stapler is locked. If it's an electric staple gun, make sure that it is unplugged. This is the easiest way to insure that you're safe while using a staple gun.

, Squeeze the release button until the slide pops out or drops down and the spot for staples is visible.This should allow you to remove the pusher rod from the stapler.


If there are any staples remaining in the stapler, throw them away.
Take this opportunity to clear your stapler of any dust or debris.

, Make sure the staple gun is being held upside down to easily load the staples. Insert the staples upside down into the slide.They should go in with the flat side of the staple being loaded first, and the sharp edges of the staple sticking up.


Make sure that the staples you are using are the right size. If they are too big or too small they can jam the staple gun.

, They should fit snugly, but do not force additional staples into the slide if there is no room. All staples should be straight and consistent with each other.Your staples should slide easily back and forth along the staple rail. No staples should be sticking up or leaning to one side.
Mistakes are usually made in this step, when people try to load the staples facing the wrong way.

, Push the slide holding the staples back into place. Listen for a click to indicate it is in place and secure.Be careful not to place your finger beneath the staple dispenser as you close it, or you may accidentally injure yourself.
If your staple gun is electric, don’t plug it back in until you’ve completely closed it.

, Making sure that no one is is standing near you, place several pieces of paper between the magazine and the stapler base. Then slowly squeeze the trigger under the handle of the staple gun to make sure the staples come out properly. If it jams or does not work, release the slide again to double check the staples and make any necessary adjustments.


A manual staple gun takes a lot more pressure to activate than does an electric staple gun, so make sure that you account for that when you test it.
If you squeeze the trigger too quickly the staple gun may move out of place.

Purchase a refill cartridge.,
Locate the finisher.,
Remove the top layer of staples if necessary.,
Replace the staple cartridge if necessary.",How to Refill a Stapler3," Your printer or copier will have a specific stapler cartridge that will need to be replaced, rather than replacing staples in individual rows. Usually these cartridges include thousands of staples.


The refill cartridge should be matched to the particular model of printer or copier you use.
While the staples may be of similar size to each other, the cartridges are designed uniquely for your office equipment.

, The printer staples will be found within the finishing unit of your printer or copier. You will usually be able to release the stapler cartridge by lowering it from its location within the finisher.Look for any necessary tabs that you may need to press to release the cartridge.
Refer to your product manual for more details on how to locate the finisher.

, You may not need to replace your entire cartridge. If your stapler cartridge is jammed, you’ll only need to remove the upper layer of staples. You’ll be able to do this by lowering the guide, while holding onto the knob on the cartridge.


Slide the upper layer of staples out of the cartridge.
Holding onto the knob, raise the guide again and return it to its original position.

, If you need to replace your staple cartridge, the steps will be similar to the above. Lower the guide, while holding onto the knob of the cartridge.You can usually recycle your used staple cartridge at an office supply store.
Finish by holding onto the knob, raising the guide and sliding the fresh staple cartridge into position.

The right hand side 7x7 square illustrates the rule using alphabets.,
Give specific values to A’s and a’s.,
To put it differently, you can start with the center square in the last column and get this 7x7 square:

, De La Loubere, Envoy of Louis X1V to Siam learnt of this method here.



, Giving A’s one of the values from 0,7,14,28,35,42, and a’s one of the values from 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 – with the provision that ‘D’ has to be given the value 21, you will be able to cover all numbers from 1 to 49 and get the magic sum of 175. It gives (7!x6!)/4 clear solutions.

, Of course, no value should be repeated; this automatically ensures that all the numbers are used. You will then be able to generate (7!x6!)/4 squares at one go by this method too. (Please note 7! Stands for 1x2x3x4x5x6x7 and 6! Is 1x2x3x4x5x6)

, The method is very general. The next line in this square starts with A’s from the 3rd column and a’s from the 4th column in the earlier line. One gets the basic square shown below:


Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk
Cd De Ef Fg Gh Hi Ij Jk Ka Ab Bc
Eg Fh Gi Hj Ik Ja Kb Ac Bd Ce Df

Hf Ig Jh Ki Aj Bk Ca Db Ec Fd Ge
Ji Kj Ak Ba Cb Dc Ed Fe Gf Hg Ih

Of course Aa is to be read as A+a, and so on. A’s are to be chosen from 1 to 11 and a’s from 0, 11, 22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99,110, (i.e. multiples of 11). You thus automatically get all numbers from 1 to 121 and the number of solutions is (11!x11!)/4, with a total of 671 for each row, column and the 2 diagonals.



, In case of 9x9 square it will be seen that A,D,G repeat in one diagonal and a,d,g; b,e,h and c,f,i repeat in the columns. Therefore ensure that A,D,G are so selected that they total 15, and a,d,g; b,e,h: c,f,i so that they each total 108, i.e 1/3rd of 324, which is the total of 0,9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72..

Understand how nanometers are related to micrometers.,
Ensure you are converting nanometers to micrometers.,
Divide the number of nanometers by 1,000.",How to Convert Micrometers to Nanometers2," Both are units of measurement in the metric system. 1 micrometer equals 1,000 nanometers., You should be given the number of nanometers you need to convert. If you are using measurements other than nanometers or micrometers, you would use different calculations and thus could not use this method.

For example, you might need to convert 14,500 nanometers to micrometers.


, When converting a smaller unit into a larger unit, you end up with less units than you started with. Thus, you need to divide.Since there is 1 micrometer per 1,000 nanometers, to find the number of micrometers, divide by 1,000.

For example, 14,500÷1,000=14.5{\displaystyle 14,500\div 1,000=14.5}. So, 14,500nanometers=14.5micrometers{\displaystyle 14,500\,{\text{nanometers}}=14.5\,{\text{micrometers}}}.

There are 1,000 nanometers in 1 micrometer.


18×1,000=18,000{\displaystyle 18\times 1,000=18,000}


18micrometers=18,000nanometers{\displaystyle 18\,{\text{micrometers}}=18,000\,{\text{nanometers}}}.


, 300 nanometers = ___ micrometers.

Since you are converting a smaller unit (nanometers) into a larger unit (micrometer), you should divide.

There is 1 micrometer per 1,000 nanometers.


300÷1,000=0.3{\displaystyle 300\div 1,000=0.3}


300nanometers=0.3micrometers{\displaystyle 300\,{\text{nanometers}}=0.3\,{\text{micrometers}}}.


, Determine which value is stated in micrometers, and which value is stated in nanometers.

There are 1,000 nanometers in 1 micrometer.

Micrometers are larger than nanometers. This means a smaller number of micrometers will equal a larger number of nanometers.


3.8×1,000=3,800{\displaystyle 3.8\times 1,000=3,800} 


3.8micrometers=3,800nanometers{\displaystyle 3.8\,{\text{micrometers}}=3,800\,{\text{nanometers}}}

The disjunction p OR q is true, when any part of the compound sentence is true.
The conditional if p then q or p implies q is false, when a true hypothesis p, leads to a false conclusion q.

,,,
The Law of Detachment states that when two given premises are true, one a conditional and the other the hypothesis of the conditional, it follows that the conclusion of the conditional is true.






This law is about the most simplest law that can be used in a proof.
This law is sometimes called the Law of Modus Ponens.


The Law of the Contrapositive states that when a conditional premise is proved to be true, it's contrapositive of the premise is also true.






Contrapositives can be formed by taking any conditional statement, negating it's premises AND negating it's conclusion then reversing the roles of the negated statements.


The Law of Modus Tollens state that when two premises are true (on conditional and the other a negation of the conclusion of the conditional), what follows will be the negation of the hypothesis of the conditional being true.






Applying this law, is equivalent to applying both the Law of the Contrapositive and the Law of Detachment as a set of premises.


The Law of Syllogism (or sometimes called the Chain Rule/Law) states that when two given premises are true, conditionals where one is the consequent of the other, it follows that a conclusion is formed being a conditional using the antecedent of the first and the consequent of the second premise.






Get used to this premise. You'll use it a lot in life, without even second-guessing yourself.


The Law of Disjunctive Inference states that when 2 given premises are true, one a disjunction and the other the negation of one of the items, it follows that the other disjunct is true.






The Law of Double Negation states that the negation of a negation rules a positive statement, and that these are logically-equivalent statements.






In most books and on most tests, this is not a required step/reason. It can be deduced. But for simplicity, most places want you to deduce this fact quietly without showing this step in the proof.



De-Morgans Laws have two following statements that can be deduced.






The negation of a conjunction of two statements is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of each of the two statements.
The negation of a disjunction of two statements is equivalent to the conjunction of the negation of each of the two statements.


The Law of Simplification states that when a single conjunctive premise is true, it follows that each of the individual conjuncts must be true.






The Law of Conjunction states that when two premises are true, it follows that the conjunction of these premises is true.






The Law of Disjunctive Addition states that when a simple premise is true, it follows that any disjunction that has this premise as one of its disjuncts must be true.







, One column will be called ""Statements"" and the other should be called ""Reasons"".

,, If there are more than two given statements, you'll need to fill in all remaining Reasons in the proof.

, Therefore, both lines should be represented as ""Given"". This a mandated step to prove that you can later deduce others and that you understand what could follow.


Sometimes, three dots in a triangular pattern signify the conclusion you want to prove.

, Sometimes, proofs of high school nature shouldn't require more than two to three laws, however, if needed, know your laws.

List the fractions you are ordering in one column.,
Convert each fraction to a decimal.,
Compare and order the decimals, beginning with the tenths place.,
Compare and order the fractions, depending on the order of their corresponding decimals.",How to Compare and Order Fractions1," Next to each fraction, write an equal sign. It doesn’t matter in what order you list the fractions.

For example, if you are comparing 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}}, 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}, and 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}}, you could list the fractions like this:58={\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}=}24={\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}=}37={\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}=}
;
, To do this, divide the numerator of each fraction by its denominator. Place each decimal to the right of its fraction, after the equal sign.

The numerator is the number above the fraction bar; the denominator is the number below the fraction bar.

You can complete the division using a calculator or by hand using the standard division algorithm. Either way, round to at least two or three decimal places.

For example:5÷8=.625{\displaystyle 5\div 8=.625}, so 58=.625{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}=.625}2÷4=.500{\displaystyle 2\div 4=.500}, so 24=.500{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}=.500}3÷7=.429{\displaystyle 3\div 7=.429}, so 37=.429{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}=.429}.


, The tenths place is the first number to the right of the decimal point. The bigger the number in the tenths place, the bigger the decimal.

For example, since 6>5>4{\displaystyle 6>5>4}, you know that .625>.500>.429{\displaystyle .625>.500>.429}.

If all the numbers in the tenths place are the same, then compare the numbers in the hundredths place (the second number to the right of the decimal point).


, The order of the fractions will be the same as the order of the decimals, since fractions and decimals are different ways to express the same value. For example, since .625>.500>.429{\displaystyle .625>.500>.429}, you know that58>24>37{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}>{\frac {2}{4}}>{\frac {3}{7}}}.

State uncertainty in its proper form.,
Always round the experimental measurement to the same decimal place as the uncertainty.,
Calculate uncertainty from a single measurement.,
Calculate uncertainty of a single measurement of multiple objects.,
Take your measurements multiple times.",How to Calculate Uncertainty1," Let's say you're measuring a stick that falls near 4.2 cm, give or take one millimeter. This means that you know the stick falls almost on 4.2 cm, but that it could actually be just a bit smaller or larger than that measurement, with the error of one millimeter.


State the uncertainty like this: 4.2 cm ± 0.1 cm. You can also rewrite this as 4.2 cm ± 1 mm, since 0.1 cm = 1 mm.;
, Measurements that involve a calculation of uncertainty are typically rounded to one or two significant digits. The most important point is that you should round your experimental measurement to the same decimal place as the uncertainty to keep your measurements consistent.


If your experimental measurement is 60 cm, then your uncertainty calculation should be rounded to a whole number as well. For example, the uncertainty for this measurement can be 60 cm ± 2 cm, but not 60 cm ± 2.2 cm.
If your experimental measurement is 3.4 cm, then your uncertainty calculation should be rounded to .1 cm. For example, the uncertainty for this measurement can be 3.4 cm ± .1 cm, but not 3.4 cm ± 1 cm.

, Let's say you're measuring the diameter of a round ball with a ruler. This is tricky because it'll be difficult to say exactly where the outer edges of the ball line up with the ruler since they are curved, not straight. Let's say the ruler can find the measurement to the nearest .1 cm -- this does not mean that you can measure the diameter to this level of precision.Study the edges of the ball and the ruler to get a sense of how reliably you can measure its diameter. In a standard ruler, the markings at .5 cm show up clearly -- but let's say you can get a little bit closer than that. If it looks like you can get about within .3 cm of an accurate measurement, then your uncertainty is .3 cm.
Now, measure the diameter of the ball. Let's say you get about 7.6 cm. Just state the estimated measurement along with the uncertainty. The diameter of the ball is 7.6 cm ± .3 cm.

, Let's say you're measuring a stack of 10 CD cases that are all the same length. Let's say you want to find the measurement of the thickness of just one CD case. This measurement will be so small that your percentage of uncertainty will be a bit high. But when you measure 10 CD cases stacked together, you can just divide the result and its uncertainty by the number of CD cases to find the thickness of one CD case.Let's say that you can't get much closer than to .2 cm of measurements by using a ruler. So, your uncertainty is ± .2 cm.
Let's say you measured that all of the CD cases stacked together are of a thickness of 22 cm.
Now, just divide the measurement and uncertainty by 10, the number of CD cases. 22 cm/10 = 2.2 cm and .2 cm/10 = .02 cm. This means that the thickness of one CD case is 2.20 cm ± .02 cm.

, To increase the certainty of your measurements, whether you're measuring the length of on object or the amount of time it takes for an object to cross a certain distance, you'll be increasing your chances of getting an accurate measurement if you take several measurements. Finding the average of your multiple measurements will help you get a more accurate picture of the measurement while calculating the uncertainty.

First you need to look at what you're trying to work out.,
Once you have these you need to introduce slack variables into the inequalities.,
The constraint should be in the form P=x+y(+z) which you need to rearrange to become 0=P-x-y(-z).,
Once you have your data you need to construct the tableau.,
You then need to put your data into the tableau.,
Now the fun bit.,
At this point you need to draw a line in your tableau so you can write in the first iteration.,
You now need to make all the values in the x column (apart from your pivot line) equal to 0.,
If you still have negative numbers on your top row (not including column l) repeat steps 6-8 until all your top row are positive.,
You read the solution of your simplex problem very simply.",How to Carry out the Simplex Algorithm," Do you already have the function you are maximising/minimising and the constraint inequalities?
, Slack variables turn inequalities into equations and usually use the letters s onwards (though you can use any letter you like), for example:

2y+4x<=8 becomes 2y+4x+s=8
6y+2x<=28 becomes 6y+2x+t=28

, for example:

P=2x+2y becomes 0=P-2x-2y

, This is constructed as follows:, Your first row will be what you are maximising, the rows below the constraints. If you have that letter in wat goes in that row the number goes into that column. If the letter is not there put a 0., Pick a column, any column, so long as the top number is negative (please note that you can't use l) For the sake of the example I'm going to use x, but if you're bored you can use y just to be different (if you have a lot of columns to choose from I'd recommend starting at the left, makes life easier).

For each row (for which the number in your chosen column is positive) divide the number in the l column by the number in your chosen column.
For the row which gave the smallest value, ring the number in your chosen column. (In my example it would be 4) This number is called the pivot.

, Leave a line for equation 4 and divide (2) by the pivot (in this case 4) then write that into the space for (5), You do this by combining appropriate multiples of the pivot with the original equation for each line. For example (4)=(1)+0.5(2) Once you have done this your tableau should look like this:, Once this is the case you have completed your simplex problem., Ignore the slack variables. The last (l) column (of the final iteration) contains the values for the function (P) and non-zero variables."
"
List the fractions you are ordering in one column.,
Multiply the three denominators together.,
Determine what factor you needed to multiply each original denominator by to arrive at the new denominator.,
Calculate the new numerator for each fraction.,
Order the fractions by the size of their new numerators.",How to Compare and Order Fractions2," To the right of each fraction, draw a blank fraction bar (a bar without any numbers above or below). It doesn’t matter what order you list the fractions.

If you have any mixed fractions, you will need to convert them to improper fractions before comparing and ordering. A mixed fraction is a fraction that contains a whole number and a fraction. For instructions on how to do this, read Change Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions.

For example, if you are comparing 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}}, 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}, and 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}}, you could list the fractions like this:58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}}24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}}


, This will be your new denominator for all three fractions, so place this product underneath all three blank fraction bars.

You can complete the multiplication by using a calculator or by using the standard multiplication algorithm.

For example, if you are comparing and 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}}, 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}, and 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}}, you would calculate 8×4×7=224{\displaystyle 8\times 4\times 7=224}. Your fractions will then be listed like this:58x224{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}\;{\frac {x}{224}}}24x224{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}\;{\frac {x}{224}}}37x224{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}\;{\frac {x}{224}}}


, To figure this out, divide the new denominator by the original denominator. Draw a line from each original denominator to each new denominator. Write the missing factor on the line.

For example:You must multiply 8 by 28 to arrive at 224, so on the line next to 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}}, write ×28{\displaystyle \times 28}. You must multiply 4 by 56 to arrive at 224, so on the line next to 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}, write ×56{\displaystyle \times 56}. You must multiply 7 by 32 to arrive at 224, so on the line next to 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}}, write ×32{\displaystyle \times 32}.


, To do this, multiply each original numerator by the same factor you multiplied its denominator by. Fill in the new numerators above the fraction bars.

For example:You multiplied the denominator of 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}} by 28, so you must multiply the numerator by 28. 5×28=140{\displaystyle 5\times 28=140}, so the fraction 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}} becomes 140224{\displaystyle {\frac {140}{224}}}. You multiplied the denominator of 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} by 56, so you must multiply the numerator by 56. 2×56=112{\displaystyle 2\times 56=112}, so the fraction 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} becomes 112224{\displaystyle {\frac {112}{224}}}.You multiplied the denominator of 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}} by 32, so you must multiply the numerator by 32. 3×32=96{\displaystyle 3\times 32=96}, so the fraction 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}} becomes 96224{\displaystyle {\frac {96}{224}}}.


, The larger the numerator, the larger the fraction. You can now order them this way because you found a common denominator and are working with same-sized pieces.

For example, to compare 140224{\displaystyle {\frac {140}{224}}}, 112224{\displaystyle {\frac {112}{224}}}, and 96224{\displaystyle {\frac {96}{224}}}, look at their numerators.Since, 140>112>96,{\displaystyle 140>112>96,} you know that 140224>112224>96224{\displaystyle {\frac {140}{224}}>{\frac {112}{224}}>{\frac {96}{224}}}. If you reduce the fractions, your final answer will be 58>24>37{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}>{\frac {2}{4}}>{\frac {3}{7}}}.

Compare and order unit fractions.,
Compare and order fractions with the same denominator.,
Compare and order fractions with the same numerator.,
Use benchmark fractions.",How to Compare and Order Fractions3," Unit fractions are fractions that have 1 as the numerator. The bigger the denominator is in a unit fraction, the smaller the fraction is.

The numerator is the number above the fraction bar. It tells you how many pieces you have.

The denominator is the number below the fraction bar. It tells you how many pieces the whole is divided into. The more pieces the whole is divided into, the smaller one piece is.

For example, to compare 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}, 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}} and 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, look at the denominators, 4, 3, and 6. Since 6>4>3{\displaystyle 6>4>3}, 13>14>16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}>{\frac {1}{4}}>{\frac {1}{6}}}.


, Because these fractions have the same denominator, that means you are working with same-sized pieces of a whole. All you need to do then is compare how many pieces you have, which is given in the numerator.

For example, to compare 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}}, and 36{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{6}}}, look at the numerators, 1, 5, and 3. You have one piece, five pieces, and 3 pieces. Since 5>3>1{\displaystyle 5>3>1}, 56>36>16{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}>{\frac {3}{6}}>{\frac {1}{6}}}.


, Remember, the bigger the denominator, the more pieces the whole is divided into, and therefore the smaller each piece will be.So if you have the same number of pieces, by comparing the size of the pieces, you should be able to compare and order.

For example, to compare 47{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{7}}}, 45{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}}, and 49{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{9}}}, look at the denominators, 7, 5, and 9. A whole cut into 9 pieces has smaller pieces than a whole cut into 7 pieces, and a whole cut into 7 pieces has smaller pieces than a whole cut into 5 pieces. So 45>47>49{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}>{\frac {4}{7}}>{\frac {4}{9}}}.


, A benchmark fractions is one you can easily visualize, such as 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.By comparing the fractions you are working with to a benchmark fraction, you may be able to use reasoning to determine their order.

For example, to compare 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}}, 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}, and 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}}, compare all of these fractions to 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}. You should see that 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}} is a little more than 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}, because 48=12{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{8}}={\frac {1}{2}}}. On the other hand, 37{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{7}}} is a little less than 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}, because 3 is less than half of 7. (3.5 is half of seven.) 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} is exactly equal to 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} So, you can reason that 58>24>37{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}>{\frac {2}{4}}>{\frac {3}{7}}}.

Take several measurements.,
Find the average of the measurements.,
Find the variance of these measurements.,
Find the standard deviation.,
State the final measurement.",How to Calculate Uncertainty2," Let's say you want to calculate how long it takes a ball to drop to the floor from the height of a table. To get the best results, you'll have to measure the ball falling off the table top at least a few times -- let's say five. Then, you'll have to find the average of the five measured times and then add or subtract the standard deviation from that number to get the best results.Let's say you measured the five following times: 0.43 s, 0.52 s, 0.35 s, 0.29 s, and 0.49 s.

, Now, find the average by adding up the five different measurements and dividing the result by 5, the amount of measurements. 0.43 s + 0.52 s + 0.35 s + 0.29 s + 0.49 s = 2.08 s. Now, divide 2.08 by 5. 2.08/5 = 0.42 s. The average time is 0.42 s.

, To do this, first, find the difference between each of the five measurements and the average. To do this, just subtract the measurement from 0.42 s. Here are the five differences:0.43 s - .42 s = 0.01 s

0.52 s - 0.42 s = 0.1 s
0.35 s - 0.42 s = -0.07 s
0.29 s - 0.42 s = -0.13 s
0.49 s - 0.42 s = 0.07 s
Now, add up the squares of these differences: (0.01 s)2 + (0.1 s)2 + (-0.07 s)2 + (-0.13 s)2 + (0.07 s)2 = 0.037 s.
Find the average of these added squares by dividing the result by 5. 0.037 s/5 = 0.0074 s.



, To find the standard deviation, simply find the square root of the variance. The square root of 0.0074 s = 0.09 s, so the standard deviation is 0.09 s., To do this, simply state the average of the measurements along with the added and subtracted standard deviation. Since the average of the measurements is .42 s and the standard deviation is .09 s, the final measurement is .42 s ± .09 s.

Add uncertain measurements.,
Subtract uncertain measurements.,
Multiply uncertain measurements.,
Divide uncertain measurements.,
Increase an uncertain measurement exponentially.",How to Calculate Uncertainty3," To add uncertain measurements, simply add the measurements and add their uncertainties:(5 cm ± .2 cm) + (3 cm ± .1 cm) =
(5 cm + 3 cm) ± (.2 cm +. 1 cm) =
8 cm ± .3 cm

, To subtract uncertain measurements, simply subtract the measurements while still adding their uncertainties:(10 cm ± .4 cm) - (3 cm ± .2 cm) =
(10 cm - 3 cm) ± (.4 cm +. 2 cm) =
7 cm ± .6 cm

,
To multiply uncertain measurements, simply multiply the measurements while adding their RELATIVE uncertainties (as a percentage):Calculating uncertainties with multiplication does not work with absolute values (like we had in addition and subtraction), but with relative ones. You get the relative uncertainty by dividing the absolute uncertainty with a measured value and multiplying by 100 to get percentage.
For example:


(6 cm ± .2 cm) = (.2 / 6) x 100 and add a % sign. That is 3.3 %
Therefore:
(6 cm ± .2 cm) x (4 cm ± .3 cm) = (6 cm ± 3.3% ) x (4 cm ± 7.5%)
(6 cm x 4 cm) ± (3.3 + 7.5) =
24 cm ± 10.8 % = 24 cm ± 2.6 cm

,
To divide uncertain measurements, simply divide the measurements while adding their RELATIVE uncertainties:The process is the same as in multiplication!


(10 cm ± .6 cm) ÷ (5 cm ± .2 cm) = (10 cm ± 6%) ÷ (5 cm ± 4%)
(10 cm ÷ 5 cm) ± (6% + 4%) =
2 cm ± 10% = 2 cm ± 0.2 cm

, To increase an uncertain measurement exponentially, simply raise the measurement to the designated power, and then multiply the uncertainty by that power:(2.0 cm ± 1.0 cm)3 =
(2.0 cm)3 ± (1.0 cm) x 3 =
8.0 cm ± 3 cm

, We help the chart fill the space a bit by making the line a little weightier than normal, but not so much as to badly distort the results really.
Edit Go To cell range A2:B362 and using either Chart Wizard or the Charts option on the Ribbon, select Charts, All/Other, Scatter, Smooth Line Scatter. There's probably sufficient space to work with the chart that appears on the Data worksheet, or you can copy or cut it to a separate Charts worksheet.
Go to Paste Text in cell F6 and get the Chart Title; copy it. Select Chart Layout and select Chart Title and wand over the default text and paste in the text you copied previously. You may need to play with it a bit as far as location and font size, etc. to get it just how you prefer. Other than that, the assignment is complete. Ooops. Almost forgot. Do Chart Layout Current Selection Series 1 Format Selection. Make Line Weight 8 pt (or not -- it's up to you; 1 is fine if the increment is right for the range.) -- (it's a matter of whether you're after some artistic effect or the strict mathematical depiction; below in Tips I give the strict mathematical depiction for the example function and derivative).

,, Then again, just below that, make another copy bu this time do Copy Picture and Paste Picture with the shift key held down, or Paste Special Values -- either way, and then a copied and pasted picture of the chart. Be fastidious and methodical about your work and pay attention to details. Save the workbook every so often, just in case. Maintain a good backup system. Do Insert New Comment on original variable values and formulas by copying them from the formula bar so you can easily get back to where you started without having to dump the file and start over completely. This worksheet will be used in the near future by me as a building block to more advanced lessons, so think about a folder system for Calculus work please. That implies that almost all the previous work was either Geometry or Trig, with Algebra applied to both. There will be more of each in the future, God Willing., Time is limited, unfortunately. The basic thrust so far has been to cover turning Math into Art; that is the specialty deserving attention. Why? Because it preserves the creative aspect of mathematics -- it's that simple. When looking at these forms, one can make out a neckline here, a man wearing a tee-shirt in this other one -- they are meant to stimulate the imagination. If math gets taught along the way, it's a great side benefit!

Gather your materials.,
Measure the conductivity of the sample.,
Plug your data into the TDS formula.",How to Calculate Total Dissolved Solids1," Before attempting to measure the TDS of your sample, make sure to prepare a clean, clear space with the appropriate instruments and tools for the task. If you do not have access to the materials necessary for this procedure, they can all be purchased easily online. You will need the following:


A clean, properly sterilized beaker that is free of dust or other particles
A sample of the water you want to analyze, collected into the sterilized beaker. Ideally, the sample should be at 25° C (or 77° F) at the time of analysis.
An electrical conductivity meter — a device used to measure a solution's ability to conduct electricity. It works by releasing a current into a liquid, then measuring the resistance.;
, Make sure your beaker with the water sample in it is placed on a flat, stable surface. Turn on the electrical conductivity meter, then insert the measuring lead into the sample. Wait for the reading on the conductivity meter to become stable before noting the result.


You may have to wait a few seconds before the reading stabilizes, but it's important that you wait until the number on the display stops changing.
The measurement displayed on the electrical conductivity meter is the purity of the water, measured in µS (micro-Siemens). The lower the µS value, the purer the water, with 0 µS being pure, unpolluted H20.

, The basic formula for calculating total dissolved solids looks like the above illustration. In the formula, TDS is measured in mg/L, EC is the conductivity of your sample (the reading from your electrical conductivity meter), and ke is the correlation factor. The correlation factor depends on the liquid being used as the sample, and it may also vary according to atmospheric conditions. It varies between 0.55 and 0.8.


In the example above, say the correlation factor at the current temperature and in the current pressure conditions is 0.67. Plug your values into the formula. The TDS for your sample is therefore 288.1 mg/L.
Water with a TDS of less than 500 mg/L meets the Environmental Protection Agency's standards for drinking water. A high TDS does not necessarily mean that water is unsafe for consumption; it may just suggest that the water will have unpleasant aesthetic qualities in terms of color, taste, smell, etc. If you are concerned about the safety of your drinking water, you should have your water professionally tested.

Divide each side of the equation by the percent of the original price.",How to Calculate the List Price of an Item on Sale1," In order to calculate the list price, or the original price, of an item on sale, you need to know what the sale price is, and what the discount percent is.

For example, you might know that a sweater is on sale for $51.75 after a 25% discount.
;
, Remember that percents are hundredths, so to convert, either divide the percent by 100, or simply place a decimal after the number and move it two places to the left.For example, 25% expressed as a decimal is .25.


, Use the formula S=P−PD{\displaystyle S=P-PD}, where S{\displaystyle S} equals the sale price of the item, P{\displaystyle P} equals the original price of the item, and D{\displaystyle D} equals the discount percent of the item. , Make sure you substitute for the variable S{\displaystyle S}.

For example, if the sales price is $51.75, your formula will look like this: 51.75=P−PD{\displaystyle 51.75=P-PD}.


, Make sure you use the decimal form of the discount, and substitute for the variable D{\displaystyle D}.

For example, if the item is 25% off, your formula will look like this: 51.75=P−P(.25){\displaystyle 51.75=P-P(.25)}.


, To do this, pull out the variable P{\displaystyle P}.For example:51.75=P−P(.25){\displaystyle 51.75=P-P(.25)}51.75=P(1−.25){\displaystyle 51.75=P(1-.25)}


, This will give you the percent of the item’s original price that the sales price represents.For example, 1−.25=.75{\displaystyle 1-.25=.75}. So, if an item is 25% off, you would only pay 75% of the original price to purchase the item on sale. Your formula will look like this: 51.75=P(.75){\displaystyle 51.75=P(.75)}.


, This will give you the value of P{\displaystyle P}, the list price of the item.

For example:51.75=P(.75){\displaystyle 51.75=P(.75)}51.75.75=P(.75).75{\displaystyle {\frac {51.75}{.75}}={\frac {P(.75)}{.75}}}69=P{\displaystyle 69=P}So the original price of a sweater marked $51.75 after a 25% discount is $69.00.

Plug your data into the formula.",How to Calculate Total Dissolved Solids2," Prepare a clean, clear space with the appropriate instruments and tools for the task. If you do not have access to the materials necessary for this procedure, they can all be purchased easily online. You will need the following:


A clean, properly sterilized beaker that is free of dust or other particles
A sample of water, poured into the beaker
Filter paper
An evaporating dish
A stirring stick
A pipette large enough to collect a 50 ml sample
A scale

, Make sure that it is completely dry and completely clean of any extraneous particulate matter.

, Stir vigorously enough to agitate the solution. This ensures that any particulate matter is more or less evenly distributed throughout the sample.

, Make sure you're still stirring the water while collecting the sample — don't let the solution settle before you pipette your smaller sample. If you find this difficult to accomplish, you might ask a friend to pipette the sample while you stir.

, Put the 50 mL water sample from the pipette through the filter paper three times to ensure all particulate matter has been collected in the filter.

, Transfer the filtrate from the previous step to the evaporating dish you weighed in step 2, and wait for the filtrate to dry completely. Once the dish and filtrate are dry, weigh them in milligrams (mg).

, Use the following formula to calculate the TDS of your solution: TDS=/mL sample In this formula, A stands for the weight of the evaporating dish + filtrate, and B stands for the weight of the evaporating dish on its own.
Because you pipetted 50 mL of water, the value of ""mL sample"" in this case would be 50.
The final value of the Total Dissolved Solids is measured in mg/L.
Water with a TDS of less than 500 mg/L meets the Environmental Protectino Agency's standards for drinking water.A high TDS does not necessarily mean that water is unsafe for consumption; it may just suggest that the water will have unpleasant aesthetic qualities in terms of color, taste, smell, etc. If you are concerned about the safety of your drinking water, you should have your water professionally tested.

, This will give you the discount, in dollars, off the original price.

For example, 69×.25=17.25{\displaystyle 69\times .25=17.25}. So, $17.25 is the discount off the original price.


, This will give you the sale price.For example, 69−17.25=51.75{\displaystyle 69-17.25=51.75}. So, the sale price of a $69 sweater that is 25% off is $51.75.

For example, you might know that a sweater’s original price is $69, and that it is on sale for $51.75.


, This will give you the markdown amount, the amount of dollars taken off the original price.

For example, since 69−51.75=17.25{\displaystyle 69-51.75=17.25}, $17.25 was taken off the price of the sweater.


, Use the formula M=PD{\displaystyle M=PD}, where M{\displaystyle M} equals the markdown, in dollars, of the item, P{\displaystyle P} equals the original price of the item, and D{\displaystyle D} equals the discount percent of the item., Be sure to substitute the original price for the variable P{\displaystyle P}, and the markdown for the variable M{\displaystyle M}.

For example, if a sweater, originally $69, has a markdown of $17.25, your formula will look like this: 17.25=69D{\displaystyle 17.25=69D}.


, This will give you the percent of the discount as a decimal. To convert to a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right.

For example:17.25=69D{\displaystyle 17.25=69D}17.2569=69D69{\displaystyle {\frac {17.25}{69}}={\frac {69D}{69}}}.25=D{\displaystyle .25=D}So, a $69 sweater on sale for $51.75 is 25% off.

Identify the density of the liquid of the body of water.,
Multiply volume by density to calculate mass.,
Convert mass to weight in pounds.",How to Calculate the Weight of a Body of Water," You need to calculate the volume of the particular body of water you are interested in. To do this, you need a rough estimation of the total area of the surface of the body which you will then multiply by the depth.If you are looking at a rectangular swimming pool, you will simply use length times width to find the area.
If the body of water is more of a circular lake or pond, you will want to use an equation for the area of a circle.
If you want to estimate the weight of an ocean, it is best to look up the total area of the ocean itself.;
, To calculate the surface area and volume, you will need to either look up some measurements or take them yourself. Use measuring tools such as long tape measures (often used for surveying) for your estimations.


If the body of water is mostly rectangular, you want to measure the approximate length and width of the body.
If the body is circular, you will need to estimate its radius. To find the diameter, simply multiply the radius by 2., Once you have assessed the shape of the body of water and made measurements, you can calculate the approximate area that the surface of the body takes up. The area calculation will be based on the shape that you previously determined when assessing the body of water at the beginning.


For a rectangle shape, simply multiply the length times the width.Let’s say you had a small pond in your yard that was 100 feet by 50 feet. The total area of the pond would be 5000 ft2.
For a circular shape, use the formula A = πr2 where r is the radius of the body of water.Let’s say your pond was more of a circular shape with a radius of about 200 feet. The area of the pond would be π(200)2 = 125,600 ft2.

, To estimate the average depth, take measurements evenly spaced throughout the entire pond from both the shallow and deep areas. Add up all of these measurements and then divide by the total number of measurements. This will give you a good estimation of the average depth of the body.Alternatively, you can try to look up the depth of the body of water if it is well-known lake or ocean.

, The final step in calculating the volume of the body of water is to multiply the total surface area by the average depth. Remember, this is still an approximation because some liberties were taken with the measurements.


For example: Let’s say the rectangular pond had a depth of 150 feet. It had a surface area of 5000 ft2 so multiplying that by 150 feet gives you an approximate volume of 750,000 feet3.

, At this point, the calculation becomes much simpler if you convert from imperial units to metric units. When you are finished with all of the calculations you can convert kilograms back to pounds to get the weight in imperial units.


To convert cubic feet to cubic meters, use the conversion factor 0.0283 m3/ft3.For the rectangular pond, multiply (750,000 ft3)(0.0283) = 2122.5 m3.

, Density is affected by temperature and salinity (salt content) so the density of water in a warm freshwater lake will be different than that of an arctic ocean. If you are doing a rough estimation you can use a density of 1000 kg/m3 (the density of pure water).Ocean water is more dense because of the salt content and is about 1027 kg/m3.
Colder water is more dense than warmer water, but for this type of general calculation the changes due to temperature can be ignored.

, The next step in getting to the weight of your body of water is converting the total volume you calculated into a mass. This is done by multiplying by the density of the liquid.For example: The pond contains fresh water, so use the density of water of 1000 kg/m3. Multiply the volume in m3 by this density: (2122.5)(1000) = 2,122,500 kg. The total mass of the pond in kilograms is 2,122,500.

, The final step is to convert kilograms back to pounds. To do this, you use the conversion factor 2.2 kg/lb. Simply multiply the number of kilograms by 2.2 to get the number of pounds.For example: 2,122,500 x 2.2 = 4,669,500 lbs. The total weight of the pond is 4,669,500 pounds.

If you know the radius of the circle, double it to get the diameter.,
If you know the circumference of the circle, divide it by π to get the diameter.,
If you know the area of the circle, divide the result by π and find its square root to get the radius; then multiply by 2 to get the diameter.",How to Calculate the Diameter of a Circle2," The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge. For example, if the radius of the circle is 4 cm, then the diameter of the circle is 4 cm x 2, or 8 cm.

, π is equal to approximately 3.14 but you should use your calculator to get the most accurate results. For example, if the circumference of the circle is 10 cm, then the diameter is 10 cm/π, or 3.18 cm.

, This goes back to manipulating the formula for finding the area of a circle, A = πr2, to get the diameter. You can transform this into r = √(A/π) cm. For example, if the area of the circle is 25 cm2, divide that by π and find the square root. This equals cm 2.82cm, so the diameter of the circle is 2.82 x 2 = 5.64cm.

, Be careful not to influence the weight of the object with your hand or other objects.

, Slide the weights left and right on the beams until the two white lines at the right line up again. The most efficient way to do this is to make a rough estimate as to what you think the mass will be, and then move the highest value weight you think will still be lower than the mass. Move this weight until the pointer is just under 0. Then move on progressively to the next smallest weights to get closer and closer to the actual mass.

, Add the measurement of each weight together. The total will be the mass of the object.

Write your units in the problem.",How to Calculate Ratios," Ratios are used in both academic settings and in the real world to compare multiple amounts or quantities to each other. The simplest ratios compare only two values, but ratios comparing three or more values are also possible. In any situations in which two or more distinct numbers or quantities are being compared, ratios are applicable. By describing quantities in relation to each other, they explain how chemical formulas can be duplicated or recipes in the kitchen expanded. After you get to understand them, you will use ratios for the rest of your life., As noted above, ratios demonstrate the quantity of at least two items in relation to each other. So, for example, if a cake contains two cups of flour and one cup of sugar, you would say that the the ratio of flour to sugar was 2 to 1.

Ratios can be used to show the relation between any quantities, even if one is not directly tied to the other (as they would be in a recipe). For example, if there are five girls and ten boys in a class, the ratio of girls to boys is 5 to 10. Neither quantity is dependent on or tied to the other, and would change if anyone left or new students came in. The ratio merely compares the quantities.


, Ratios can be written out using words or can be represented using mathematical symbols.You will commonly see ratios represented using words (as above). Because they are used so commonly and in such a variety of ways, if you find yourself working outside of mathematic or scientific fields, this may the most common form of ratio you will see.

Ratios are frequently expressed using a colon. When comparing two numbers in a ratio, you'll use one colon (as in 7 : 13) and that when you're comparing more than two numbers, you'll put a colon between each set of numbers in succession (as in 10 : 2 : 23). In our classroom example, we might compare the number of boys to the number of girls with the ratio 5 girls : 10 boys. We can simply express the ratio as 5 : 10.

Ratios are also sometimes expressed using fractional notation. In the case of the classroom, the 5 girls and 10 boys would be shown simply as 5/10. That said, it shouldn't be read out loud the same as a fraction, and you need to keep in mind that the numbers do not represent a portion of a whole. 


, Ratios can be reduced and simplified like fractions by removing any common factors of the terms in the ratio. To reduce a ratio, divide all the terms in the ratio by the common factors they share until no common factor exists. However, when doing this, it's important not to lose sight of the original quantities that led to the ratio in the first place.In the classroom example above, 5 girls to 10 boys (5 : 10), both sides of the ratio have a factor of 5. Divide both sides by 5 (the greatest common factor) to get  1 girl to 2 boys (or 1 : 2). However, we should keep the original quantities in mind, even when using this reduced ratio. There are not 3 total students in the class, but 15. The reduced ratio just compares the relationship between the number of boys and girls. There are 2 boys for every girl, not exactly 2 boys and 1 girl.

 Some ratios cannot be reduced. For example, 3 : 56 cannot be reduced because the two numbers share no common factors - 3 is a prime number, and 56 is not divisible by 3.


, One common type of problem that employs ratios may involve using ratios to scale up or down the two numbers in proportion to each other. Multiplying or dividing all terms in a ratio by the same number creates a ratio with the same proportions as the original, so, to scale your ratio, multiply or divide through the ratio by the scaling factor.For example, a baker needs to triple the size of a cake recipe. If the normal ratio of flour to sugar is 2 to 1 (2 : 1), then both numbers must be increased by a factor of three. The appropriate quantities for the recipe are now 6 cups of flour to 3 cups of sugar (6 : 3). 

The same process can be reversed. If the baker needed only one-half of the normal recipe, both quantities could be multiplied by 1/2 (or divided by two). The result would be 1 cup of flour to 1/2 (0.5) cup of sugar.


, Another common type of problem that incorporates ratios asks you to find an unknown variable in one ratio, given the other number in that ratio and a second ratio that is equivalent to the first. The principle of cross multiplication makes solving these problems fairly simple. Write each ratio in its fractional form, then set the two ratios equal to each other and cross multiply to solve.For example, let's say we have a small group of students containing 2 boys and 5 girls. If we were to maintain this proportion of boys to girls, how many boys would be in a class that contained 20 girls? To solve, first, let's make two ratios, one with our unknown variables: 2 boys : 5 girls = x boys : 20 girls. If we convert these ratios to their fraction forms, we get 2/5 and x/20. If you cross multiply, you are left with 5x=40, and you can solve by dividing both figures by 5. The final solution is x=8.  


, Many word problems look something like this: ""A recipe calls for 4 potatoes and 5 carrots. If you want to use 8 potatoes instead, how many carrots will you need to keep the ratio the same?"" Many students try to add the same amount of each quantity. You actually need to use multiplication, not addition, to keep the ratio the same. Here's an example of the wrong and right to solve this example:

Wrong method: ""8 - 4 = 4, so I added 4 potatoes to the recipe. That means I should take the 5 carrots and add 4 to that too... wait! That's not how ratios work. I'll try again.""

Right method: ""8 ÷ 4 = 2, so I multiplied the number of potatoes by 2. That means I should multiply the 5 carrots by 2 as well. 5 x 2 = 10, so I want 10 carrots total in the new recipe.""


, Some word problems get tricky by switching to a different unit partway through. Convert to the same unit before finding the ratio. Here's an example problem and solution:

A dragon has 500 grams of gold and 10 kilograms of silver. What is the ratio of gold to silver in the dragon's hoard?

Grams and kilograms are not the same unit, so we'll need to convert. 1 kilogram = 1,000 grams, so 10 kilograms = 10 kilograms x 1,000grams1kilogram{\displaystyle {\frac {1,000grams}{1kilogram}}} = 10 x 1,000 grams = 10,000 grams.

The dragon has 500 grams of gold and 10,000 grams of silver.

The ratio of gold to silver is 500gramsGold10,000gramsSilver=5100=120{\displaystyle {\frac {500gramsGold}{10,000gramsSilver}}={\frac {5}{100}}={\frac {1}{20}}}.


, In ratio word problems, it's much easier to catch mistakes if you write the units after each value. Remember, the same unit on the top and bottom of a fraction cancels out. After you cancel out as much as you can, you should end up with the right units for your answer.

Example problem: If you have six boxes, and in every three boxes there are nine marbles, how many marbles do you have? 

Wrong method: 6boxes∗3boxes9marbles=...{\displaystyle 6boxes*{\frac {3boxes}{9marbles}}=...} Wait, nothing cancels out, so my answer would be ""boxes x boxes / marbles."" That doesn't make sense.

Right method:6boxes∗9marbles3boxes={\displaystyle 6boxes*{\frac {9marbles}{3boxes}}=} 6boxes∗3marbles1box={\displaystyle 6boxes*{\frac {3marbles}{1box}}=}6boxes∗3marbles1box={\displaystyle {\frac {6boxes*3marbles}{1box}}=} 6∗3marbles1={\displaystyle {\frac {6*3marbles}{1}}=} 18 marbles.

Plot it on a graph.",How to Calculate the Break Even Point and Plot It on a Graph," Fixed costs are any costs that don't depend on the volume of production. Rent and utilities would be examples of fixed costs, because you will pay the same amount for them no matter how many units you produce or sell. Categorize all your firm's fixed costs for a given period and add them together.;
, Variable costs are those that will fluctuate along with production volume. For example, a business that sells shirts will have to purchase more shirts if they want to sell more shirts, so the cost of buying shirts is a variable cost.

, Pricing strategies are part of the much more comprehensive marketing strategy, and can be fairly complex. However, you know that your price will be at least as high as your production costs.

, The unit contribution margin represents how much money each unit sold brings in after recovering its own variable costs. It is calculated by subtracting a unit's variable costs from its sales price.


Contribution Margin= (Selling price / unit - Variable cost / unit)

, The break-even point tells you the volume of sales you will have to achieve to cover all of your costs. It is calculated by dividing all your fixed costs by your product's contribution margin.


Break Even Point= Total Fixed Cost / Contribution Margin

,


X-axis is 'number of units' and Y-axis is 'revenue'.
The plot of Fixed cost will be a line parallel to X axis and above the X axis.
The line of Total cost would start from the point where line of fixed cost meets the Y axis. It would have a positive slope.
The line of sales revenues would start from origin (0,0) and move upward with a slope greater than that of the total cost line.
The point where these two lines intersect will be the 'Break Even Point'.

Know the equation.,
Plug your values into the equation.,
Isolate the variable.,
Simplify.",How to Calculate the Mass of an Object2," The set equation relating mass, density, and volume is D=m/v or density equals mass divided by volume.

, If the density of your object is 500 kg/m3 (kilograms per cubic meter), then you put 500 in place of the D for 500=m/v. If your volume is 10 m3 (cubic meters), put 10 in place of the v for 500=m/10.

, As you are trying to calculate mass, the variable in this equation is m. You want this value to end up alone on one side of the equal sign. In this equation, it is involved in division with another value. To isolate it, you must multiply both sides of the equation by this value. This equation becomes (500)10=(m/10)10.


Isolating a variable is always done by performing the opposite mathematical function on both sides of an equation. If the variable is involved in addition, subtract the extra value from both sides, etc.

, On the left side of the equation, 500 times 10 simplifies to 5000. On the right side, the two 10's cancel out, leaving the m alone. Thus the answer is 5000kg=m.


Don't forget your units. The cubic meters have canceled each other out to leave only kilograms.

Odds are that someone else has already measured and surveyed this area. Look for census data, read an encyclopedia, or run a web search.
Find out whether the area has any set boundaries. If not, you'll need to define them yourself. A neighborhood, for instance, may not be listed in the census, so you'll need to draw the borders yourself.;
, Short of counting the population yourself, you'll need to find an up-to-date record of how many people live in this area. Start by running a web search for the population of the place – say, the city of Houston, Texas. Look for the most recent census data for a relatively accurate number. If you are looking for the population of a country, the CIA World Factbook is a good source.If you are calculating the population density for an area that has not already been recorded, you may need to count the population yourself. This might include a colloquially-defined urban neighborhood, for instance, or a population of kangaroos in a section of the Australian Outback. Try to get as accurate a number as possible., If you plan to compare one area against another, make sure that all of your numbers use a common unit of measurement. For instance, if one county is listed in square miles and another is listed in square km, you will need to convert the area of both countries into either square miles or square km.For easy Imperial-to-metric conversions, visit http://www.metric-conversions.org.

, To calculate the population density, you will divide the population by the size of the area. Thus, Population Density = Number of People/Land Area.The unit of land area should be square miles or square kilometers. You can use square feet or meters if you are finding the density of a smallish space. For most professional and academic demographic purposes, though, you'll need to use the standard square miles or kilometers.
The unit of population density is people per unit of area. For instance, 2000 people per square mile.

, You should know the population and the surface area of the region. For example: if there are 145,000 people in the city of Auburn, and the urban area covers 9 square miles, write 145,000/9 square miles.

, Use long division, or just use a calculator. In our example, 145,000 divided by 9 would show that the population density is 16,111 people/square mile.

, Compare data from multiple areas, and use the contrasting population densities to make observations about those areas. For example: if the city of Boonesville includes 60,000 people overs its 8 square miles, then its population density is 7,500/square mile. You can see that the population density of Auburn is far higher than the population density of Boonesville. Consider whether you can use this difference to draw any conclusions about the two cities.Even if you calculate the population density of an area as dense as a large city, the resulting figure will not tell you much about the differences between individual neighborhoods. You may need to find the density for various area scales in order to fully understand a place.

, Calculate the projected population growth for a given area, then compare the current population density with the predicted future density. Look for census data from the past, and try comparing past population densities with the current figure. Try to understand how a place has changed and will change., It is simple and straightforward to calculate population density in this way, but it may not reveal more intricate details about an area. This is highly dependent upon the size and type of the area for which you are calculating population density. The formula sometimes says more about smaller, densely-inhabited areas than it does about larger areas that include both inhabited and uninhabited land.


Say that you calculate the population density of a county that is home to a huge amount of open land and national forest, but also to a very large city. The population density of the county at large will not tell you much about the density of the city: the actual space where people live.
Remember that population density is just an average. It may not correspond exactly to the population count of an area. If not, consider why. Try calculating the density for a smaller area within the original area., Make predictions about an area given when you know about high and low population densities. For instance, areas with high population densities tend to have higher crime rates and higher prices for housing and goods. Low-density areas tend to feature more agriculture, and they often include more wilderness or open space. The conclusions that you draw about a given area or areas will depend upon your purposes. Think about how you can make this data insightful."

Write down the starting value and end value.,
Find the size of the increase.,
Divide the answer by the starting value.,
Multiply the result by 100.",How to Calculate Percentage Increase1," For example, let's say your auto insurance premium just went up. Write down these values:


Your car insurance premium was $400 before the increase. This is the starting value.
After the increase, it costs $450. This is the end value.;
, Subtract the starting value from the end value to find the out how much it increased.We're still working with ordinary numbers at this point, not percentages.


In our example, $450 - $400 = a $50 increase.

, A percentage is just a special kind of fraction. For example, ""5% of doctors"" is quick way to write ""5 out of 100 doctors."" By dividing the answer by the starting value, we turn it into a fraction that compares the two values.


In our example, $50 / $400 = 0.125.

, This converts your last result into a percentage.


The final answer to our example is 0.125 x 100 = 12.5% increase in auto insurance premiums.

A circle is defined as all the points on a plane that are an equal distance from a single center point. The lids of jars are good household objects to use for this exercise.You should be able to calculate pi roughly because in order to get exact results of pi, you will need to have a very thin lead(or whatever you are using). Even the sharpest pencil graphite could be huge to have exact results.;
, The circumference is the length that goes around the entire edge of the circle. Since the circumference is round, it can be difficult to measure (that's why pi is so important).


Lay a string over the circle as closely as you can. Mark the string off where it circles back around, and then measure the string length with a ruler.

, The diameter runs from one side of the circle to the other through the circle's center point.

, The circumference of a circle is found with the formula C= π*d = 2*π*r. Thus pi equals a circle's circumference divided by its diameter. Plug your numbers into a calculator: the result should be roughly 3.14., Your measurements might not be perfect on any given circle, but over time they should average out to a pretty accurate calculation of pi.

Calculate current liabilities.,
Find the quick ratio.",How to Calculate Quick Ratio," Current assets is a term referring to the balance sheet account, which represents assets, convertible into cash within one year (or a business cycle). The examples of current assets are cash and cash equivalents, inventory, marketable securities, accounts receivable etc.;
, Current liabilities include all obligations of a company, which are payable during one year (or a business cycle). The examples of current liabilities are accounts payable, interest payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits etc.

, Inventory is a term referring to those assets that either are used or supposed to be used in the production process, or already exist in a form of product ready for sale. Most commonly inventory is being divided into three categories: raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods.

, Most common formula for calculating quick ratio is current assets (excluding inventory) divided by current liabilities. Inventory is being excluded from calculation in order to get more precise estimation of company’s short-term liquidity, since inventory is not always quick enough to be converted into cash. All the numbers necessary for calculation can be obtained from the company’s balance sheet.

, The first step to calculating quick ratio is finding the company’s current assets. Commonly total current assets are reflect as a separate line of the company’s balance sheet. They can also be calculated by subtraction of the company’s non-current assets from its total assets.


Imagine a company with $600,000 in total assets and $350,000 in non-current assets. By subtracting non-current assets from total assets, you get the amount of the company’s current assets: $600,000 - $350,000 = $250,000.

, This number can be simply obtained from the company’s balance sheet. Let’s say that for the analyzed company the inventory value equals $80,000.

, Once you're done with finding the company's current assets and inventory, you can proceed to the next step - determining its current liabilities. This can be done by reviewing the company’s balance sheet and finding the current liabilities amount there, in case they are reflected on the balance sheet as a separate line. If not, you can calculate it by subtracting the company’s non-current liabilities from its total liabilities.


Imagine a company with $400,000 in total liabilities and $180,000 in non-current liabilities. By subtracting non-current liabilities from total liabilities we get the amount of the company’s current liabilities: $400,000 - $180,000 = $220,000.

, After determining all the necessary figures, use the basic quick ratio formula and calculate the quick ratio for your company.


In the example above quick ratio is calculated as current assets minus inventory, divided by current liabilities: ($250,000 - $80,000) ÷ $220,000 = 0.77, indicating some problems with liquidity of the company analyzed. Quick ratio of 0.77 means that there was $0.77 of highly liquid assets for every $1.00 of current liabilities.

There's a trick to these problems with many zeroes. Instead of counting the zeroes each step of the way, we can rewrite these as 5.3 billion and 7.4 billion.

, This will tell us how much bigger the end result is than the original.7.4 billion ÷ 5.3 billion = about 1.4.
We've rounded to two significant digits because that's how many there were in the original problem.

, This will tell you the percentage comparison between the two values. If the value increased (instead of decreasing), your answer should always be larger than 100.


1.4 x 100 = 140%. This means the world population in 2015 is 140% the size of the population in 1990.

, In this kind of problem, ""100%"" is the size of the starting value. By subtracting this from our answer, we're left with just the percentage size of the increase.


140% - 100% = a 40% increase in population.
This works because starting value + increase = end value. Rearrange the equation and we get increase = end value - starting value.

Use the Gregory-Leibniz series.,
Try the Nilakantha series.",How to Calculate Pi2," Mathematicians have found several different mathematical series that, if carried out infinitely, will accurately calculate pi to a great number of decimal places. Some of these are so complex they require supercomputers to process them. One of the simplest, however, is the Gregory-Leibniz series. Though not very efficient, it will get closer and closer to pi with every iteration, accurately producing pi to five decimal places with 500,000 iterations.Here is the formula to apply.


π = (4/1) - (4/3) + (4/5) - (4/7) + (4/9) - (4/11) + (4/13) - (4/15) ...
Take 4 and subtract 4 divided by 3. Then add 4 divided by 5. Then subtract 4 divided by 7. Continue alternating between adding and subtracting fractions with a numerator of 4 and a denominator of each subsequent odd number. The more times you do this, the closer you will get to pi.

, This is another infinite series to calculate pi that is fairly easy to understand. While somewhat more complicated, it converges on pi much quicker than the Leibniz formula.


π = 3 + 4/(2*3*4) - 4/(4*5*6) + 4/(6*7*8) - 4/(8*9*10) + 4/(10*11*12) - 4/(12*13*14) ...
For this formula, take three and start alternating between adding and subtracting fractions with numerators of 4 and denominators that are the product of three consecutive integers which increase with every new iteration. Each subsequent fraction begins its set of integers with the highest one used in the previous fraction. Carry this out even a few times and the results get fairly close to pi.

Convert the fraction into a decimal.,
Convert the decimal into a percent.",How to Calculate Percentages2," A percentage is a way to express a number as a part of a whole. To calculate a percentage, we look at the whole as equal to 100%. For example, say you have 10 apples (=100%). If you eat 2 apples, then you have eaten 2/10 × 100% = 20% of your apples and you are left with 80% of your original apples.


The term ""percent"" in English comes from the Italian per cento or the French pour cent, which literally mean per hundred.


, For instance, let's say we have a jar containing 1199 red marbles and 485 blue marbles, making it 1684 marbles in total. In this case, 1684 makes up a whole jar of marbles, and will be set equal to 100%.


, Let's say we want to find out the percentage of the jar that is taken up by the 485 blue marbles.


, In our example, we need to find out what percent 485 (number of blue marbles) is of 1684 (total number of marbles). Therefore the fraction in this case is 485/1684.


, To turn 485/1684 into a decimal, divide 485 by 1684. This comes to 0.288.


, Multiply the result obtained in the step above by 100. For this example, 0.288 multiplied by 100 equals 28.8 or 28.8%.


A simple way to multiple a decimal by 100 is to move the decimal to the right two places.

Start with your equation and determine which variables you know.,
Use the lens equation to get di.,
Solve for hi.,
Solve for M. You can solve for your final variable using either -(di/do) or (hi/ho).,
Interpret your M value.,
For diverging lenses, use a negative focal length value.",How to Calculate Magnification1," Like with many other physics problems, a good way to approach magnification problems is to first write the equation you need to find your answer. From here, you can work backwards to find any pieces of the equation that you need.


For example, let's say that a 6 centimeter tall action figure is placed half a meter away from a converging lens with a focal length of 20 centimeters. If we want to find the magnification, image size, and image distance, we can start by writing our equation like this:



M = (hi/ho) = -(di/do)




Right now, we know ho (the height of the action figure) and do (the distance of the action figure from the lens.) We also know the focal length of the lens, which isn't in this equation. We need to find hi, di, and M.;
, If you know the distance of the object you're magnifying from the lens and the focal length of the lens, finding the distance of the image is easy with the lens equation. The lens equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f = the focal length of the lens.


In our example problem, we can use the lens equation to find di. Plug in your values for f and do and solve:



1/f = 1/do + 1/di

1/20 = 1/50 + 1/di

5/100 - 2/100 = 1/di

3/100 = 1/di

100/3 = di = 33.3 centimeters





A lens's focal length is the distance from the center of the lens to the point where the rays of light converge in a focal point. If you've ever focused light through a magnifying glass to burn ants, you've seen this. In academic problems, this is often given to you. In real life, you can sometimes find this information labeled on the lens itself., Once you know do and di, you can find the height of the magnified image and the magnification of the lens. Notice the two equals signs in the magnification equation (M = (hi/ho) = -(di/do)) — this means that all of the terms are equal to each other, so we can find M and hi in whatever order we want.


For our example problem, we can find hi like this:



(hi/ho) = -(di/do)
(hi/6) = -(33.3/50)
hi = -(33.3/50) × 6
hi = -3.996 cm





Note that a negative height indicates that the image we see will be inverted (upside down).

,


In our example, we would finally find M like this:



M = (hi/ho)
M = (-3.996/6) = -0.666





We also get the same answer if we use our d values:



M = -(di/do)
M = -(33.3/50) = -0.666





Note that magnification does not have a unit label.

, Once you have a magnification value, you can predict several things about the image you would view through the lens. These are:



Its size. The bigger the absolute value of the M value, the bigger the object will seem under magnification. M values between 1 and 0 indicate that the object will look smaller.

Its orientation. Negative values indicate that the image of the object will be inverted.
In our example, our M value of -0.666 means that, under the conditions given, the image of the action figure will appear upside down and two-thirds its normal size.


, Even though diverging lenses look very different than converging lenses, you can find their magnification values using the same formulas as above. The one important exception here is that divergent lenses will have negative focal lengths. In a problem like the one above, this will affect the answer you get for di, so be sure to pay close attention.


Let's re-do the example problem above, only this time, we'll say we're using a diverging lens with a focal length of -20 centimeters. All of the other starting values are the same.
First, we'll find di with the lens equation:



1/f = 1/do + 1/di

1/-20 = 1/50 + 1/di

-5/100 - 2/100 = 1/di

-7/100 = 1/di

-100/7 = di = -14.29 centimeters





Now we'll find hi and M with our new di value.



(hi/ho) = -(di/do)
(hi/6) = -(-14.29/50)
hi = -(-14.29/50) × 6
hi = 1.71 centimeters

M = (hi/ho)
M = (1.71/6) = 0.285

Conversely, as the price decreases, demand should increase. Using data from actual sales, a company can determine a supply and demand graph. That data can be used to calculate a price function.For more information on graphing supply and demand data, see Find and Analyze Demand Function Curve.
;
, The price function consists of two primary pieces of information. The first is the intercept. This is the theoretical price if no items are sold. The second detail is a decreasing slope. The slope of the graph represents the drop in price for each item. A sample price function might look like:p=500−150q{\displaystyle p=500-{\frac {1}{50}}q}

p = price

q = demand, in number of units



This function sets the “zero price” at $500. For each unit sold, the price decreases by 1/50th of a dollar (two cents).


, Revenue is the product of price times the number of units sold. Since the price function includes the number of units, this will result in a squared variable. Using the price function from above, the revenue function becomes:R(q)=p∗q{\displaystyle R(q)=p*q}


R(q)=∗q{\displaystyle R(q)=*q}


R(q)=500q−150q2{\displaystyle R(q)=500q-{\frac {1}{50}}q^{2}}


, In calculus, the derivative of any function is used to find the rate of change of that function. The maximum value of a given function occurs when the derivative equals zero. So, to maximize the revenue, find the first derivative of the revenue function.Suppose the revenue function, in terms of number of units sold, is R(q)=500q−150q2{\displaystyle R(q)=500q-{\frac {1}{50}}q^{2}}. The first derivative, therefore, is:


R′(q)=500−250q{\displaystyle R^{\prime }(q)=500-{\frac {2}{50}}q}



For a review of derivatives, see the wikiHow article on how to Take Derivatives.


, When the derivative is zero, the graph of the original function is at either a peak or a trough. This will be either the maximum or minimum value. For some higher level functions, there may be more than one solution to the zero derivative, but not a basic price-demand function.R′(q)=500−250q{\displaystyle R^{\prime }(q)=500-{\frac {2}{50}}q}


0=500−250q{\displaystyle 0=500-{\frac {2}{50}}q}


, Use basic algebra to solve the derivative for the number of items to sell where the derivative is equal to zero. This will give you the number of items that will maximize the revenue.0=500−250q{\displaystyle 0=500-{\frac {2}{50}}q}


250q=500{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{50}}q=500}


150q=250{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{50}}q=250}


q=50∗250{\displaystyle q=50*250}


q=12,500{\displaystyle q=12,500}


, Using the optimal number of sales from the derivative calculation, you can enter that value into the original price formula to find the optimal price.p=500−150q{\displaystyle p=500-{\frac {1}{50}}q}


p=500−15012,500{\displaystyle p=500-{\frac {1}{50}}12,500}


p=500−250{\displaystyle p=500-250}


p=250{\displaystyle p=250}


, After you have found the optimal number of sales and the optimal price, multiply them to find the maximum revenue. Recall that R=p∗q{\displaystyle R=p*q}. The maximum revenue for this example, therefore, is:R=p∗q{\displaystyle R=p*q}


R=(250)(12,500){\displaystyle R=(250)(12,500)}


R=3,125,000{\displaystyle R=3,125,000}


, Based on these calculations, the optimal number of units to sell is 12,500, at the optimal price of $250 each. This will result in a maximum revenue, for this sample problem, of $3,125,000.
, Suppose that another business has collected price and sales data. Using that data, the company has determined that the initial price is $100, and each additional unit sold will cut the price by one cent. Using this data, the following price function is:


p=100−0.01q{\displaystyle p=100-0.01q}


, Recall that revenue is equal to price times quantity. Using the price function above, the revenue function is:


R(q)=∗q{\displaystyle R(q)=*q}


R(q)=100q−0.01q2{\displaystyle R(q)=100q-0.01q^{2}}


, Using basic calculus, find the derivative of the revenue function:


R(q)=100q−0.01q2{\displaystyle R(q)=100q-0.01q^{2}}


R′(q)=100−(2)0.01q{\displaystyle R^{\prime }(q)=100-(2)0.01q}


R′(q)=100−0.02q{\displaystyle R^{\prime }(q)=100-0.02q}


, Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for q{\displaystyle q} to find the optimal number of sales. This calculation is as follows:


R′(q)=100−0.02q{\displaystyle R^{\prime }(q)=100-0.02q}


0=100−0.02q{\displaystyle 0=100-0.02q}


0.02q=100{\displaystyle 0.02q=100}


q=100/0.02{\displaystyle q=100/0.02}


q=5,000{\displaystyle q=5,000}


, Use the optimal sales value in the original price formula to find the optimal sales price. For this example, this works as follows:


p=100−0.01q{\displaystyle p=100-0.01q}


p=100−0.01(5,000){\displaystyle p=100-0.01(5,000)}


p=100−50{\displaystyle p=100-50}


p=50{\displaystyle p=50}


, Using the relationship that revenue equals price times quantity, you can find the maximum revenue as follows:


R(q)=p∗q{\displaystyle R(q)=p*q}


R(q)=50∗5,000{\displaystyle R(q)=50*5,000}


R(q)=250,000{\displaystyle R(q)=250,000}


, Using this data and based on the price function p=100−0.01q{\displaystyle p=100-0.01q}, the company’s maximum revenue is $250,000. This assumes a unit price of $50 and a sale of 5,000 units.

Find the focal length of both lenses.,
Plug your information into M = fo/fe.,
Find the distance between the lenses and the object.,
Find the image distance, height, and magnification for lens one.,
Use the image from the first lens as the object for the second.,
Continue on in this pattern for additional lenses.",How to Calculate Magnification2," When you're dealing with a device that is made up of two lenses lined up with each other (like a telescope or one part of a pair of binoculars), all you need to know is the focal length of both lenses to find the overall magnification of the final image. This is done with the simple equation M = fo/fe.In the equation, fo refers to the focal length of the objective lens and fe to the focal length of the eyepiece lens. The objective lens is the large lens at the end of the device, while the eyepiece lens is, as its name suggests, the small lens you put your eye next to.

, Once you have the focal lengths for both of your lenses, solving is easy — just find the ratio by dividing the objective's focal length by the eyepiece's. The answer you get will be the magnification of the device.


For example, let's say that we have a small telescope. If the focal length of the objective lens is 10 centimeters and the focal length of the eyepiece lens is 5 centimeters, the magnification is simply 10/5 = 2.


, If you have two lenses lined up in front of an object, it's possible to determine the magnification of the final image if you know the distances of the lenses and objects in relation to each other, the size of the object, and the focal lengths of both lenses. Everything else can be derived.


For example, let's say that we have the same setup as in our example problem in Method 1: a six-inch action figure 50 centimeters away from a converging lens with a focal length of 20 centimeters. Now, let's put a second converging lens with a focal length of 5 centimeters 50 centimeters behind the first lens (100 centimeters away from the action figure.) In the next few steps, we'll use this information to find the magnification of the final image.

, The first part of any multi-lens problem is the same as if you were dealing with just the first lens. Starting with the lens closest to the object, use the lens equation to find the distance of the image, then use the magnification equation to find its height and magnification. Click here for a recap of single-lens problems.


From our work in Method 1 above, we know that the first lens produces an image -3.996 centimeters high, 33.3 centimeters behind the lens, and with a magnification of -0.666.


, Now, finding the magnification, height, and so on for the second lens is easy — just use the same techniques that you used for the first lens, only this time, use its image in place of the object. Keep in mind that the image will usually be a different distance from the second lens as the object was from the first one.


In our example, since the image is 33.3 centimeters behind the first lens, it is 50-33.3 = 16.7 centimeters in front of the second one. Let's use this and the new lens's focal length to find the second lens's image.



1/f = 1/do + 1/di

1/5 = 1/16.7 + 1/di

0.2 - 0.0599 = 1/di

0.14 = 1/di

di = 7.14 centimeters





Now, we can find hi and M for the second lens:



(hi/ho) = -(di/do)
(hi/-3.996) = -(7.14/16.7)
hi = -(0.427) × -3.996
hi = 1.71 centimeters

M = (hi/ho)
M = (1.71/-3.996) = -0.428






, This basic approach is the same whether you have three, four, five, or a hundred lenses lined up in front of an object. For each lens, treat the image of the previous lens as its object and use the lens equation and magnification equation to find your answers.


Keep in mind that subsequent lenses can continue to invert your image. For instance, the magnification value we got above (-0.428) indicates that the image we see will be about 4/10 the size of the image from the first lens, but right side up, since the image from the first lens was upside down.

Understand the calculations involved.,
Establish the lottery's rules.,
Input the numbers into the probability equation.,
Calculate your odds of choosing correctly.,
Multiply to include a final number.",How to Calculate Lotto Odds1," The odds of winning any lottery where numbers are chosen from a set, provided order doesn't matter, are defined by the formula n!r!(n−r)!{\displaystyle {\frac {n!}{r!(n-r)!}}}. In the formula, n stands for the total number of possible numbers and r stands for the number of numbers chosen. The ""!"" denotes a factorial, which for any integer n is n*(n-1)*(n-2)...and so on until 0 is reached. For example, 3! represents 3×2×1{\displaystyle 3\times 2\times 1}.

For a simple example, imagine you have to choose two numbers and you can pick numbers from 1 to 5. Your odds of choosing the two ""correct"" numbers (the winning numbers) would be defined as 5!2!×3!{\displaystyle {\frac {5!}{2!\times 3!}}}. 

This would then be solved as 5×4×3×2×12×1×3×2×1{\displaystyle {\frac {5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1}{2\times 1\times 3\times 2\times 1}}}, which is 120÷12{\displaystyle 120\div 12}, or 10. 

So, your odds of winning this game are 1 in 10.Factorial calculations can get unwieldy, especially with large numbers. Most calculators have a factorial function to ease your calculations. Alternately, you can type the factorial into Google (as ""55!"" for example) and it will solve it for you. 
;
, The majority of ""money millions,"" Powerball, and other large lotteries use roughly the same rules. 5 or 6 numbers are chosen from a large pool of numbers in no particular order. Numbers may not be repeated. In some games, a final number is added on the end (the Powerball in Powerball games is an example). Using the standard Powerball rules, we see that 5 numbers (not including the Powerball) are chosen from 69 possible numbers.Other games may have you choose 5 or 6 numbers, or more, from a larger or smaller pool of numbers., The first part of the Powerball odds are calculated as the odds of correctly choosing the first five numbers. This is described handily by the probability formula introduced earlier. So, for these specific rules, the completed equation would be: 69!5!(69−5)!{\displaystyle {\frac {69!}{5!(69-5)!}}}, which simplifies to 69!5!×64!{\displaystyle {\frac {69!}{5!\times 64!}}}., Solving this equation is best done entirely in a search engine or calculator, as the numbers involved are inconvenient to write down between steps. When solved, the equation should give 11,238,513. This means that you have a 1 in 11,238,513 chance of choosing the five numbers correctly., Now, to include the odds you'll choose the Powerball correctly and win the jackpot, you'll simply have to multiple the number from your previous result by the size of the Powerball number pool. For the standard game, there are 26 possible Powerball numbers. So, multiply your previous result, 11,238,513 in this case, by the final number, which is 26, to get your final odds, which are 292,201,338.

So, your odds of choosing the first five numbers and the Powerball correctly are 1 in 292,201,338."

Plug your values into the OBP formula.",How to Calculate On Base Percentage," The field is made up of an infield, an outfield, a pitcher’s mound, 3 bases, and home plate.


The infield is the diamond-shaped part of the field bounded by home plate (where the batter stands to hit) and the three bases (first base, second base, and third base).
The outfield is the part of the playing area located outside the diamond-shaped infield.
The pitcher’s mound is a small hill in the middle of the infield, where the pitcher stands.;
,, When a batter hits the ball into the infield or outfield and reaches a base safely, he earns a hit (H).


When a batter hits the ball outside the foul lines that serve as boundaries for the playing field, this is not a hit – it’s a foul.

, When a batter receives four pitches that are “balls” – that is, they were outside of the strike zone, where the pitcher must aim to get a strike – then he walks to first base. This is known as a “base on balls” (BB).

, If a batter or his equipment is hit by a pitch, then he walks to first base. This is known as a “hit by pitch” (HBP).

, When a batter hits the ball into the air, sacrificing his own at bat in order to give a teammate already on base the opportunity to score, this is called a “sacrifice fly” (SF). A player from the opposing team may catch the ball in the air, meaning that the batter is out, but another player may get to advance or score.

, Recall that a batter earns a hit (H) when he hits the ball into fair territory and safely reaches first base.


As an example, take Charles Cobb Blackmon of the Colorado Rockies. Say that when he played against the San Francisco Giants, he scored 2 hits. In this case, H would equal 2.

, Once you’ve noted the number of hits, note also the number of times the player reached first base because he received four pitches outside the strike zone.


In the example above, Charles Cobb Blackmon was walked just once. In this case, BB would equal 1.

, In addition to hits and bases on balls, you need to know if the player ever reached base because he was hit by a pitch.


In the example above, Charles Cobb Blackmon did not get hit by a pitch. Therefore, HBP would equal 0.

, In order to determine the on base percentage, you need to know how many times the player batted. Most batters will stand to hit 4 or 5 times during a game, but there is tremendous variation here.


In the example above, Blackmon stood to bat 5 times, so AB would be equal to 5.

, If the player hit any sacrifice flies, you need to know that to determine the on base percentage.


In the example above, Blackmon did not hit any sacrifice flies. SF would therefore equal 0.

, To find the on base percentage, you add the players hits, hits by pitch, and bases on balls together; you then divide that number by the sum of the at bats, hits by pitch, bases on balls, and sacrifice flies. The formula looks like this.


In the example above, you would plug Blackmon’s stats into the formula. Here are his relevant stats.
You would add H + BB + HBP to get 3, and AB + BB + HBP + SF to get 6. Then divide 3 by 6. Blackmon’s OBP for this particular game was therefore 0.5.

Start with the jackpot odds.,
Set up your equation.,
Solve for the odds of winning.,
Change your desired number of winning numbers.",How to Calculate Lotto Odds2," In most cases, there are lesser prizes available for choosing some of the numbers correctly. Choosing 3 or 4 of the winning numbers might yield you a payout of several hundred or thousand dollars. In this case, your odds are calculation as the odds of choosing a few right numbers and your odds of choosing an opposing amount of wrong numbers combined. This requires knowing the total number of possible combinations first. These can be described with the odds of choosing all of the winning numbers correctly.You'll need to have first solved for the jackpot odds as described in the method ""Calculating Jackpot Odds."" 

To simplify our calculations, we will just use the odds of correctly choosing the first five Powerball numbers. In the other method, this was found to be 1 in 11,238,513. 


, Your odds of winning ""k"" of the numbers ""r"" from the total pool of numbers ""n"" can be defined as: r!k!(r−k)!×(n−r)!(r−k)!(n−r−k)!n!r!(n−r)!{\displaystyle {\frac {{\frac {r!}{k!(r-k)!}}\times {\frac {(n-r)!}{(r-k)!(n-r-k)!}}}{\frac {n!}{r!(n-r)!}}}}. This formula seems much more complicated, but is really just three copies of the simple probability equation described in the other method. Simply input your numbers for n, r, and k.

For example, your odds of winning 3 of 5 numbers from a pool of 69 would be described by the equation 5!3!×2!×64!2!×61!69!5!×64!{\displaystyle {\frac {{\frac {5!}{3!\times 2!}}\times {\frac {64!}{2!\times 61!}}}{\frac {69!}{5!\times 64!}}}}.


, Just as with the base equation, this equation is best solved by typing the entire thing into a calculator or search engine, as some intermediate numbers involved in the calculation are too large to write down. If solved correctly, the result will be the odds that three of the five Powerball numbers are chosen correctly.

For the example, this would be 579.76. So, your odds of choosing 3 of the 5 correctly are 1 in 579.76. 


, You can edit your calculation by changing the value of k to find the odds of winning different portions of the five numbers. Your odds of winning will decrease as k increases and vice-versa."

Find the expected value of a lottery ticket.,
Compare cost to expected value.,
Determine the increase in odds from playing multiple times.,
Find the number of plays needed for goods odds of winning.",How to Calculate Lotto Odds3," The expected value of a lottery ticket represents the theoretical return from purchasing one lottery ticket. In other words, it is what you can theoretically expect to get back from buying one ticket. It can be calculated by multiplying the odds of a certain payout (jackpot, 4 numbers correct, 3 numbers correct, etc.) by the value of the payout and then adding them up. This number is obviously skewed by the massive jackpot, however.

Most of the time, your payout will be much less than the expected value.

For the standard choose 5+1 of 69 and 26 Powerball, the expected value of a ticket is about $1.78., You can determine the expected benefit of playing the lottery by comparing the expected value of a ticket to the cost of a ticket. Most of the time, it will be much less. In addition, the actual return expected differs greatly from the expected value, despite the name. Most people will only get a fraction of the ideal expected value, if anything at all.

However, some lottery games have better payouts than others.

For example, at one time, the New York lottery's $1 Take Five ticket had an expected value equal to its cost. This meant that by playing this lottery, players could expect to break even., Playing the lottery multiple times can increase your overall odds of winning, however slightly. It's easier to envision this increase as a decrease in your chance of losing. For example, if your overall chances of winning are 1 in 250,000,000, your chances of losing on one play are 249,999,999÷250,000,000{\displaystyle 249,999,999\div 250,000,000}, which is equal to a number very close to 1 (0.99999...). If you play twice, that number is squared ((249,999,999÷250,000,000)2{\displaystyle (249,999,999\div 250,000,000)^{2}}), representing a movement slightly away from 1 (and a better chance of winning)., Most lottery players are convinced that if they play often enough, they will significantly increase their chances of winning. It is true that playing more increases your odds of winning. However, the increase is not significant for a long time. For example, using the odds above (1 in 250 million on one play), it would take roughly 180 million plays to reach 50-50 odds of winning.At this rate, if you bought ten tickets a day for 49,300 years, you would have a 50 percent chance of winning. 

This does not mean, however, that buying two tickets on that day would guarantee a win. Instead, your overall odds of winning would remain at roughly 50 percent.

Check that the growth rate is small enough for this method.,
Multiply the growth rate by 100 to express it as a percentage.,
Divide 70 by the percentage growth rate.,
Convert your answer to the desired unit of time.",How to Calculate Doubling Time1," Doubling time is a concept used for quantities that grow exponentially. Interest rates and the growth of a population are the most common examples used. If the growth rate is less than about 0.15 per time interval, we can use this fast method for a good estimate.If the problem doesn't give you the growth rate, you can find it in decimal form using CurrentQuantity−PastQuantityPastQuantity{\displaystyle {\frac {CurrentQuantity-PastQuantity}{PastQuantity}}}.


Example 1: The population of an island grows at an exponential rate. From 2015 to 2016, the population increases from 20,000 to 22,800. What is the population's growth rate?

22,800 - 20,000 = 2,800 new people. 2,800 ÷ 20,000 = 0.14, so the population is growing by 0.14 per year. This is small enough that the estimate will be fairly accurate.


;
, Most people find this more intuitive than the decimal fraction.


Example 1 (cont): The island had a growth rate of 0.14, written as a decimal fraction. This represents 0.141{\displaystyle {\frac {0.14}{1}}}. Multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to get 0.141x100100=14100={\displaystyle {\frac {0.14}{1}}x{\frac {100}{100}}={\frac {14}{100}}=} 14% per year.


, The answer will be the number of time intervals it takes the quantity to double. Make sure you express the growth rate as a percentage, not a decimal, or your answer will be off. (If you're curious why this ""rule of 70"" works, read the more detailed method below.)


Example 1 (cont): The growth rate was 14%, so the number of time intervals required is 7014=5{\displaystyle {\frac {70}{14}}=5}.


, In most cases, you'll already have the answer in terms of years, seconds, or another convenient measurement. If you measured the growth rate across a larger span of time, however, you may want to multiply to get your answer in terms of single units of time.


Example 1 (cont): In this case, since we measured the growth across one year, each time interval is one year. The island population doubles every 5 years.


Example 2: The second, spider-infested island nearby is much less popular. It also grew from a population of 20,000 to 22,800, but took 20 years to do it. Assuming its growth is exponential, what is this population's doubling time?

This island has a 14% growth rate over 20 years. The ""rule of 70"" tells us it will also take 5 time intervals to double, but in this case each time interval is 20 years. (5 time intervals) x (20 years/time interval) = 100 years for the spider-infested island's population to double.

Note comparisons.,
Look for ""is"" and ""are"" statements.,
Recognize different types of metaphors.,
Know when a comparison is a simile.,
Understand when to use a metaphor.",How to Understand the Concept of a Metaphor1," A metaphor links two ideas through imagery or mental pictures. A metaphor is an analogy, which means it aims to describe an object by comparing it to another one.Examples include:


""It was raining cats and dogs.""""People in glass houses should not throw stones.""""Don't put all your eggs in one basket."";
, Metaphors often say that one thing is something else.Even though these two objects are not actually the same, the author makes a point by equating them. For example, if she writes, ""Hope is the water of life,"" she means that just as we need water to survive, we also need hope. It is that essential. Other examples include:


the age-old ""Time is money.""Shakespeare's ""All the world's a stage."", Authors can use metaphors in many different ways. Although comparisons are often obvious, sometimes an author might use an entire paragraph or a whole story to draw a comparison. The following metaphors exist:


Extended metaphors draw comparisons between objects over several sentences.Implied metaphors relate one object to another object without mentioning the second object explicitly. For example, one might write: ""Molly purred during her massage."" In this case, Molly is being related to a cat.Dead metaphors are comparisons that people use so often, they have lost their impact. For example, ""it's raining cats and dogs"" would be one.

, Similes are textual devices that compare objects directly. Unlike metaphors, similes always use the words ""as"" or ""like."" For example, ""life is like a box of chocolates"" is a simile. ""She's slow as molasses"" would be another one.

, People use metaphors to convey emotions and to say things in more creative and vivid ways. Metaphors ask readers to interpret their own meanings from a writer's words. Writers also can use metaphors to reduce the number of words they need to convey a message.""Her eyes were on fire"" shows deeper emotion than ""She looked really mad.""
For example, instead of saying, ""Mary ran very fast."" One could say ""Mary was a racehorse."" The metaphor gives one a visual image that shows just how fast Mary ran.
One could say, ""her room was so messy, I could not see the floor."" A metaphor could say the same thing more concisely: ""her room was a pigsty.""

Count the number of terms in the series.,
Identify the middle number of a series with an odd number of terms.,
Average the middle numbers of a series with an even number of terms.",How to Calculate Average or Mean of Consecutive Numbers1," This is the number of numbers in the sequence. Determine whether the series has an odd or even number of terms.

For example, the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 has seven terms, an odd amount.

The sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 has six terms, an even amount.
;
, This is the number that has the same amount of terms on either side of it. This middle number will be the average of the series.

For example, in the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the middle number is 6. It has three numbers to the left of it, and three numbers to the right of it. So, in this series of numbers, 6 is both the mean and the median.


, To do this, find the pair of numbers that has the same amount of terms on either side of it. To find the average, add these two numbers together and divide by two. Their average will be the average of the series.For example, in the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, the middle pair is 5 and 6. It has two numbers to the left of it, and two numbers to the right of it. So, to calculate the average of the series, calculate the average of these two numbers:5+62=112=5.5{\displaystyle {\frac {5+6}{2}}={\frac {11}{2}}=5.5}So, in this series of numbers, 5.5 is both the mean and the median.

Understand the exponential growth rate formula.,
Rewrite this formula for continuous growth.,
Plug in values for a doubled population.,
Rearrange to solve for t. If you haven't learned about logarithms yet, you may not know how to get the t out of the exponent.,
Plug in growth rate and solve.",How to Calculate Doubling Time2," If you start with an initial amount A0{\displaystyle A_{0}} that grows exponentially, the final amount Af{\displaystyle A_{f}} is described by the formula Af=A0(1+r)t{\displaystyle A_{f}=A_{0}(1+r)^{t}}. The variable r represents the growth rate per time period (as a decimal), and t is the number of time periods.

To make sense of this formula, picture a $100 investment with a 0.02 annual interest rate. Every time you calculate growth, you multiply the amount you have by 1.02. After one year, that's ($100)(1.02), after two years that's ($100)(1.02)(1.02), and so on. This simplifies to (1.02)t{\displaystyle (1.02)^{t}}, where t is the number of time periods.

Note: If r and t do not use the same time unit, use the formula Af=A0(1+rn)nt{\displaystyle A_{f}=A_{0}(1+{\frac {r}{n}})^{nt}}, where n is the number of times growth is calculated per time period. For example, if r = 0.05 per month and t = 4 years, use n = 12, since there are twelve months in a year.


, In most real-world situations, a quantity grows ""continuously"" instead of increasing only at regular intervals. In this case, the formula for growth is Af=A0(e)rt{\displaystyle A_{f}=A_{0}(e)^{rt}}, using the mathematical constant e.This formula is often used to approximate population growth, and always when calculating continuously compounded interest. In situations where growth is calculated at regular intervals, such as annually compounded interest, the formula above is more accurate.

You can derive this from the formula from the one above using calculus concepts.


, When the population doubles, the final amount Af{\displaystyle A_{f}} will equal twice the initial amount, or 2A0{\displaystyle 2A_{0}}. Plug this into the formula and remove all A terms using algebra:


2A0=A0(e)rt{\displaystyle 2A_{0}=A_{0}(e)^{rt}}

Divide both sides by A0{\displaystyle A_{0}}


2=ert{\displaystyle 2=e^{rt}}


, The term logm(n){\displaystyle log_{m}(n)} means ""the exponent m is raised by to get n."" Because the constant e comes up so often in real world situations, there's a special term ""natural log,"" abbreviated ""ln,"" that means loge{\displaystyle log_{e}}. Use this to isolate t on one side of the equation:


2=ert{\displaystyle 2=e^{rt}}


ln(2)=ln(ert){\displaystyle ln(2)=ln(e^{rt})}


ln(2)=rt{\displaystyle ln(2)=rt}


ln(2)r=t{\displaystyle {\frac {ln(2)}{r}}=t}


, Now you can solve for t by entering the decimal growth rate r into this formula. Notice that ln(2) is approximately equal to 0.69. Once you convert the growth rate from decimal to percentage form, you can round this value to get the ""rule of 70"" formula.

Now that you know this formula, you can adjust it to solve similar problems. For example, find ""tripling time"" with the formula ttriple=ln(3)r{\displaystyle t_{triple}={\frac {ln(3)}{r}}}.

Form metaphors.,
Make metaphors from daily life.,
Form metaphors from art.,
Avoid dead metaphors.",How to Understand the Concept of a Metaphor2," When writing your own stories, think about what comparisons you can make between characters and other nouns. Examine each character separately. What are her qualities? How can you link her to perhaps an inanimate object or another living being? For example, to talk about how popular a classmate is, you could say, ""Jane is the rockstar of her high school."" Or, if you wanted to express that someone has a kind heart but a prickly demeanor, you could say ""Deshawn's a cupcake wrapped in a pineapple.""


See Write a Metaphor for more tips.
You can use metaphors to express emotions, be original in your writing, or to demonstrate your command of a language.

, When comparing your life to another object, could you link it to one word? For example, maybe your life is a bit boring at present. Your life could be a peaceful lake. On the other hand, if you are experiencing turmoil, perhaps your life is a roller coaster.

, If you examine an artwork, see if you can express a metaphor. For example, ""the flames are anger"" or ""the blues are peace."" Try to connect the colors, symbols, and expressions to tangible moods or objects. Sometimes, a piece of art might be drawing a contrast.

, Metaphors are powerful when they can communicate surprise, delight, or some sort of unique meaning. Metaphors become ""dead"" when they have become so overused that they no longer pack a significant punch. For example, ""hit the nail on the head"" has become so frequently used that it no longer communicates the intensity of the comparison -- you may not even visualize a hammer and nail when you hear the phrase."

Set up the formula for finding the average of an evenly spaced set of numbers.,
Plug the appropriate values into the formula.,
Calculate using the order of operations.",How to Calculate Average or Mean of Consecutive Numbers2," The formula is Average=(x1+xn)2{\displaystyle {\text{Average}}={\frac {(x_{1}+x_{n})}{2}}}, where x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} is the first number in the series and xn{\displaystyle x_{n}} is the last number in the series., Remember, for this formula, you are only working with the first number in the sequence (x1{\displaystyle x_{1}}) and the last number in the sequence xn{\displaystyle x_{n}}.

For example, if you were finding the average of sequential numbers beginning with 15 and ending with 45, your formula will look like this: Average=(15+45)2{\displaystyle {\text{Average}}={\frac {(15+45)}{2}}}.


, First you need to add the two values in parentheses. Then divide by 2. The result will be the average of the series of numbers.

For example:(15+45)2=602=30{\displaystyle {\frac {(15+45)}{2}}={\frac {60}{2}}=30}So, the average of the series of consecutive numbers beginning with 15 and ending with 45 is 30.

Set up the formula for calculating the sum of a series of consecutive numbers.,
Count the number of terms in the series.,
Calculate using the order of operations.,
Divide the sum by the number of terms in the series.",How to Calculate Average or Mean of Consecutive Numbers3," The formula is S=n(n+1)2{\displaystyle S={\frac {n(n+1)}{2}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the sum of all the numbers in the series, and n{\displaystyle n} equals the number of terms (numbers) in the series., Since the series begins with 1, the number of terms is equal to the last term in the series. Plug in this value for n{\displaystyle n}.

For example, if you are finding the sum of consecutive numbers 1 through 25, you have 25 numbers in your sequence, so n=25{\displaystyle n=25}, and your formula will look like this: S=25(25+1)2{\displaystyle S={\frac {25(25+1)}{2}}}.


, First add the numbers in parentheses. Then, multiply their sum by n{\displaystyle n}. Finally, divide the product by 2. The result is the sum of the numbers in the series.

For example:S=25(26)2{\displaystyle S={\frac {25(26)}{2}}}S=6502{\displaystyle S={\frac {650}{2}}}S=325{\displaystyle S=325}


, This will give you the average of the series. For example, 32525=13{\displaystyle {\frac {325}{25}}=13}. So, the average of the series 1-25 is 13.

Understand the purpose of action verbs.,
Replace weak verbs with action verbs.,
Note how action verbs can replace the passive voice.,
Apply action verbs to your resume.,
Use skill specific action verbs.,
Adjust passive language with action verbs.",How to Use Action Verbs," An action verb describes something a person does, such as an achievement, in a clear and convincing way. Using action verbs in your resume, your essay, or in business writing will make your sentences more concise and easier to understand.When using action verbs, it’s important that you choose the right verb for the sentence or phrase. Choosing the wrong action verb can actually make your writing very confusing for your reader and leave them with only a vague idea of what you are trying to describe. Make sure you know exactly what the action verb means before you put it in a sentence or phrase.
Some action verbs, like “illustrate”, “reveal”, and “illuminate” are all other ways to say “show”. But other action verbs, like “analyze”, “compare” and “evaluate” all have different meanings and should be used to fit the context of the phrase or sentence.
A list of action verbs for resumes and professional writing can be found here.;
, Often when we compose first drafts in writing, we resort to weak verbs or simple verbs. For example: “show”, “look” “think” “do”. While these are very clear verbs, they may come across as flat or underwhelming, especially when used in a resume to describe your credentials and achievements. Replace weak verbs with action verbs that add punch to your writing and to be as persuasive as possible. Potential employers will appreciate a resume that is concise and showcases your skills in a clear and strong way.For example, rather than state on your resume: “Showed clients how to use security software”, you can use an action verb: “Demonstrated how to use security software to clients.” Instead of stating: “Ran the dining room service”, rephrase this with action verbs: “Organized and supervised the dining room service.” Rather than note you “put together the team’s schedules and timelines”, use action verbs to make the sentence more specific by noting you “coordinated the team’s schedules and timelines” or you “created the team’s schedules and timelines.”

, The passive voice is when the subject in a sentence is not the doer or the actor (as in the active voice) but is being acted upon. Often, the passive voice uses “was” and “had” in front of a weak verb. The subject and object are also flipped in a passive sentence, for example: ""The road was crossed by the chicken"", rather than ""The chicken crossed the road."" Though there is nothing grammatically incorrect about the passive voice, using the active voice, with action verbs, can make your sentences stronger and more direct.For example, a sentence in the passive voice would be: “A poll on how many people use private healthcare in my neighborhood was conducted by me for my year end project.”
If this sentence is adjusted to the active voice, with action verbs, it would be: “For my year end project, I created and prepared a poll of private healthcare use in my neighborhood.”

, Start by making a list of your skills and abilities in simple language, with simple verbs. Read over the list and replace the verbs with action verbs. You can also adjust the phrases so the language is concise and clear.For example, your list of skills and abilities for a customer service position at a retailer might be: “dealt with customers on a daily basis, ran the customer service desk, completed returns and sales transactions, worked with other customer service representatives, talked to my supervisor to keep the customer desk going, counted my till at the end of my shift.”
If you rephrase this list using action verbs, it may look like: “responded to the needs of customers and provided excellent customer service, coordinated the customer service desk with the assistance of my supervisor, processed returns and sales transactions, communicated well with other customer service representatives, and balanced a cash float.”

, If you want to do revise your entire resume so it contains action verbs, you will need to use skill specific verbs to describe different skills. You will describe your communication skills differently than your creative skills and you will need to use different action verbs for each skill set.To describe your communication skills, use action verbs like “interpreted”, “coordinated”, “negotiated”, “clarified”, and “advocated”.
To describe your creative skills, use action verbs like “composed”, “created”, “established”, “presented”, and “introduced”.
To describe your service skills, use action verbs like “trained”, “assisted”, “facilitated”, “performed”, and “volunteered”.
To describe your management and leadership skills, use action verbs like “achieved”, “managed”, “attained”, “implemented”, “motivated”, “organized”, and “supervised”.
To describe your research skills, use action verbs like “identified”, “examined”, “analyzed”, “collected”, “measured”, and “surveyed”.
To describe your technical skills, use action verbs like “designed”, “programmed”, “assembled”, “calculated”, and “engineered”.

, If you are trying to use action verbs in an essay or a piece of professional writing, you will need to shift any passive language and passive verbs to include active language and action verbs. Do this by going through your writing and identifying instances of the passive voice. Then, consider how you can shift the language to the active voice. Pay attention to the use of “was”, “had” and “has been” in your writing. These are often signs of the passive voice and need to be adjusted to the active voice.For example, a paragraph in the passive voice would be: “A poll on how many people use private healthcare in my neighborhood was conducted by me for my year end project. This meant I was interviewing my neighbors in their homes. A spreadsheet was used to keep track of the information collected. The due date for my project was met and I was awarded an A.”
The same paragraph adjusted to the active voice would be: “For my year end project, I created and prepared a poll of private healthcare use in my neighborhood. I interviewed my neighbors in their homes and created a spreadsheet to record and analyze the data. I completed the project by the due date and achieved an A.”
The second version in the active voice is clear and concise. It uses action verbs that are not too complicated or difficult, but still gets the point across to the reader.

Understand what a noun is.,
Realize there are different types of nouns.,
Know that Pronouns (Latin pro, for; nomen, name) take the place of nouns.,
Know that we use personal pronouns all the time.,
Know that possessive pronouns define ownership or show possession.,
Realize that Demonstrative pronouns draw attention.,
Realize that Indefinite pronouns are nonspecific.,
Know that the intensive and reflexive pronouns are the mirror pronouns.,
Know that we use Interrogative pronouns when asking questions.,
See that a relative pronoun defines a relationship.,
Get to know verbs.,
Take on adverbs.,
Understand that Adjectives (Latin adjectum, a thing thrown to) describe nouns.,
Consider prepositions.,
Get to know conjunctions.,
Don't forget interjections.,
Define the articles.",How to Understand Parts of Speech," Nouns (Latin nomen, name) represent people, places, and things. For example, a teacher is a noun, beach is a noun, and a computer is a noun.

, They are common nouns, proper nouns, collective nouns, compound nouns and abstract nouns.


Common nouns are nonspecific. Teacher, beach, and computer are common nouns.

Proper nouns are specific. Mr. Jones, Miami Beach, and Apple Computer are proper nouns. Proper nouns are always capitalized.


Collective nouns represent collections or groups of things. Team, family, and company are collective nouns. Note: American English differentiates between singular and plural collective nouns. For example: The family is on vacation; the families are on vacation. In British English, collective nouns always use the plural form of the verb. For example: The family are on vacation; the families are on vacation.


Abstract nouns represent concepts, feelings, and other intangible objects. Some abstract nouns are honesty, love, and sadness. Abstract nouns also represent activities. Some examples include reading, writing, swimming, painting, and drawing.

Compound nouns consist of two or more words. For example, basketball is a compound noun formed from the two words, basket and ball. Compound nouns may appear in three different forms:

Two separate words, for example, bike trail
A hyphenated word, for example, e-mail
One word, for example, football
Compound nouns usually begin as two separate words, then become a hyphenated word, and then become one word. For example, email was originally called electronic mail, then was shortened to e-mail and eventually lost the hyphen to become email.




, There are many types of pronouns. These include: personal, possessive, object, demonstrative, indefinite, intensive/reflexive, interrogative, and relative.

, The personal pronouns are:




First Person Singular
I
First Person Plural
we


Second Person Singular
you
Second Person Plural
you


Third Person Singular
he, she, it
Third Person Plural
they




Here are some examples:

I am eating pizza.
We are going to the movies.
You study English 6 hours per week.
We are going to El Salvador for vacation.
He is my brother.
She is my sister.
It is big, dark, and dangerous.


First Person means that person is speaking, for example, “I am going to eat the whole pizza.""
Second Person means that person is being spoken to, for example, “You will not eat the whole pizza.""
Third person means that others are talking about that person, for example, “He ate the whole pizza.""

,





First Person Singular
my, mine
First Person Plural
our, ours


Second Person Singular
your, yours
Second Person Plural
your, yours


Third Person Singular
his, her, hers, its
Third Person Plural
their, theirs





Here are some examples:

My car is blue.
That book is mine.
Her desk is the last one on the right.
That book is hers.


An object pronoun is a personal pronoun used as a direct object. Direct object? Stop this grammar speak!
The subject of a sentence is the rock n’ roll star. The direct object is the audience. The subject performs the action; the direct object is the recipient of the action. Here are some examples:

The vocal quartet performed for me.
I gave the book to her.




First Person Singular
me
First Person Plural
us


Second Person Singular
you
Second Person Plural
you


Third Person Singular
him, her, it
Third Person Plural
them





, For example:





This needs more memory.

That is in the historical register.

These are mine and those are yours.


There are 4 demonstrative pronouns. They are:



Singular
Plural


this
these


that
those




This or that? What is the difference? This (and these) are generally used to point to something closer in proximity while that (and those) points to something more distant.

, Here is an example: Someone left the grammar book on my desk.


Who left the grammar book on my desk? I don’t know and you don’t know. It was someone, anyone, and definitely not nobody.
Indefinite pronouns include but are not limited to: one, someone, no one, nobody, anything, something, several, each, most, all, neither, either, another, other, both, many, few, any, some, something, and everyone.

, They point back to or reflect the subject.






First Person Singular
myself
First Person Plural
ourselves


Second Person Singular
yourself
Second Person Plural
yourselves


Third Person Singular
himself, herself, itself
Third Person Plural
themselves




The reflexive and intensive pronouns are the same. The difference lies in their use.

Here are some examples of reflexive pronouns:

I looked in the mirror and saw myself.
She chided herself for not doing better on the exam.


The following examples use same pronouns as intensive pronouns.

I, myself, looked in the mirror.
She, herself, felt bad because she did not do better on the exam.





, The interrogative pronouns are: who, which, what, whom, and whose. Some examples are:



Who wrote this document?

Whose laptop is running Linux?

Note: Do not confuse who’s for whose? Who’s is the contraction for who is.

Who’s leaving early? (is the same as)
Who is leaving early?



, The relative pronoun relates back to a previous statement. For example:


I met a woman who stole my heart.
In this example, who relates back to woman. Who stole my heart? The woman I met.
The relative pronouns are: who, whom, whose, what, which, that, whoever, whatever, and whomever.

, A verb (Latin Verbum, word, so called as it is the principal word in the sentence (in Latin at least)) shows action or state of being and indicates the time of that action or state. For example:


I thought I locked the gate.

, An adverb describes an action, adjective, or another adverb, it shows, when, to what extent, and how. Here are a few examples:


When: Shelly and Kim might run in the marathon.
How: Sam quickly ate his lunch.
To what extent: Jennie did her homework excellently.


, Examples:


You are a great person.
The iguana is a terrible pet.
Your mother is a kind woman.

, A Preposition (Latin praepositum, placed before) is a word joined with, and generally placed before, a noun or its equivalent, so that the proposition together with the noun forms a phrase equivalent to an adverb or adjective.


Examples:

At
With
By
In



, A Conjunction (Latin conjungo, I join) is a word that joins sentences, clauses, or words.


Examples:

And
Or
But
For



, An Interjection (Latin interjicio, I throw in) is a word thrown into a sentence to express a feeling.


Examples:

Wow!
Ouch!
Oh-no!
Yay!



, The Definite Article The and the Indefinite Article A are always joined with nouns, just like adjectives.

, Compare their views, and decide where you stand.

, When people, whether it's a teacher or a peer, ask you about a book that you're reading, explain whether you like the book or not, and why.

, Instead of saying ""Yeah, it's awesome,"" say something like ""I like the way the author creates characters that seem to be polar opposites of each other...""

, What statement is the author making about society? Was he or she describing society at the time the book was written? If so, does the description still apply, and to what extent?

, If you're reading and you come across a piece of text that strikes you in some way, or that really epitomizes the message of the book, mark the text with a temporary stick-on tab. Colored ones like the ‘Post-it’ tape flags that are easily removed. Don’t draw or underline directly in the book. A teacher who sees the colored tabs sticking out of an assigned book will know you are really working on the text. You can also copy the text onto an index card or in a notebook, along with any reactions, insights, or questions you may have.

, Don't dominate the discussion; try to get other students to participate. Share your opinion when you feel it adds to the discussion - don't raise your hand just to mention tiny little facts. The best way to participate is to (1) share your opinion, (2) explain why you feel this way, and (3) pose a related question.

, Read them out loud to yourself to make sure that the text flows smoothly and evenly. Copy-edit your work - poor spelling and grammar are inexcusable for top English students.

, Sure, if your essay is long it can take time but at least you know that it's correct!

, then don't be afraid to ask WHY they've been marking it stricter than they mark the others'. Or just appreciate it, since it shows that they see you as a cut above the others and are expecting a higher standard from you.

, For instance, if you have to write a paper about nature, go right ahead and write about how you don't like it, or make the essay on the top ten things in nature that annoy you.

, Read it to your friends, family or even your dog. Don't rush: Take a good pause after each period (called a 'full stop' in the UK). Mark any parts you find difficult to read out loud, and when finished, go back and simplify that text. Often the easy way to simplify your writing is to break it up into shorter sentences.

, Get them to give you an honest appraisal. The teacher may not have time to do more than scrawl a letter grade on your work, but your classmate can talk with you in depth about your writing and the points you are making.

That way, you can focus on your trouble spots and study accordingly.Take a look at your tests and see what kinds of questions you get wrong. You might find that you keep getting the same questions wrong. That will show you the exact area you should focus your studies on.
You can also ask your teacher if there is an area you're struggling with.;
, It is a bad habit to not participate in class. Participating in class discussion will help you understand the material better. It will also earn you a higher grade if your teacher counts participation as part of your final grade (which many do). If you don't understand something, you should always ask the teacher in class. This way, you can make sure you understand all the material before taking a test. This is a good habit to help improve your grades.If you're worried about looking silly for asking a question, put that out of your mind. Chances are, there are other students who are also confused, but are too afraid to ask the question. By asking it yourself, you're really doing everyone a favor.
If you're shy and don't want to speak in class, you can also approach your teacher after class to get anything clarified.

, Learning how to take notes properly is an indispensable skill if you want to be a good student. Good notes will help organize material into simple and readable points that will help you study. Working on taking good notes will help not only your English grade, but your overall grades.Read Take Notes for instructions and tips on taking good notes.

, Cramming the night before a test is a bad habit. Not only will you not absorb the information effectively, but the time crunch could lead to unnecessary anxiety over the exam, which could hurt your memory. It is good to start studying as soon as the test is scheduled, even if it's over a week in advance.

, Sometimes, smart students who know the material freeze up on tests and do poorly. If you suffer from this sort of anxiety before tests, getting control of it will help improve your grades. Read Deal With Exam Anxiety for tips and techniques to help cut down on your anxiety.


If you're constantly anxious, consider talking to someone you trust, such as a friend, teacher, or counselor.

, A common problem for students is learning how to properly punctuate their writing. Incorrect punctuation hurts your writing and makes it look sloppy. By learning a few common punctuation marks, your grammar and writing will improve a lot.The comma is the most commonly used -- and most commonly misused -- punctuation mark. This is because there are numerous situations where a comma is appropriate. Click here for a full list of the proper times to use a comma.
Remember to avoid the comma splice. This mistake ties two independent clauses together. For example, ""John loves to travel, he goes to France every year,"" is incorrect. These two clauses should either be separate sentences, or be separated by a semicolon.British English does not usually disapprove of the comma splice, but American English does.
A semicolon is used in two situations. One is separating two independent clauses, as seen earlier. The other is separating items in a long list that contains commas as well. For example: ""For this meeting, I am inviting John, University of Michigan; Mike, NYU; Michelle, Columbia; and Susan, Yale.""
The colon is used to introduce a list, an idea, or quoted material. ""You have two choices: run or hide"" is a proper usage of the colon. Remember when separating clauses with a colon that the first clause must be able to stand on its own, or a colon is inappropriate.

, There are a handful of words in English that sound the same, but are spelled differently and have different meanings. These are called homonyms. Learn the following words that are often confused and misused to improve your writing dramatically.

There, their, and they're: there is used when talking about a place (""over there""). Their shows possession of something (""this is their house""). They're is a contraction of ""they are (""they're going to school"").


It's is a contraction of ""it is"" (""It's 34 degrees outside!""). Its is a possessive pronoun form of ""it (""I don't understand its meaning."") To keep this straight, remember that ""his"" and ""hers"" (other possessive pronouns) don't have apostrophes either.

Two, to, and too. Two is the number 2. To indicates moving towards something, and also indicates an infinitive (like to be or to go). Too goes along with adjectives and adverbs (""He is speaking too quickly for me to hear"") or can mean ""also"" or ""as well"" (""I want to go, too"").

Who's is a contraction of ""who is"" (""Who's going with us?""). Whose shows possession (""Whose car is that?"").

Your indicates possession (like ""your turn"" or ""your book""). You're is a contraction of ""you are"" (""You're going to love this."")

, A very common mistake in writing is verb/noun disagreements. Remember that plural nouns need to be paired with plural verbs.For example, ""They is the best singers in the choir,"" is incorrect. ""They are the best singers in the choir"" is correct.
Use care when there's a phrase between the subject and verb, as in the following sentence: ""The zombie, as well as his fellow walkers, was hungry."" In this case, the zombie is a singular noun, meaning the verb needs to be singular too.In this sentence, ""One of the zombies is over there,"" even though the word ""zombies"" is plural, it's actually One of that's the subject, so the verb is singular.

, The antecedent is the noun that a pronoun refers to. For example, in the sentence ""Joan is a great teacher, because she always answers questions,"" Joan is the antecedent, and ""she"" is the pronoun.Common issues of agreement happen when you use ""they/them/their"" as a singular pronoun.

, Another common mistake is changing around verb tenses within a paragraph, which makes writing confusing and messy. Whichever tense you start a paragraph with should stay consistent throughout the paragraph., Many English words have roots in Latin or Greek. If you learn these roots, then you can figure out what a word means even if you've never seen it before.Here are some of the most common roots and what they mean.""A""- without or not. For example: asexual, amoral.
""Ante""- before. For example: antecedent, anterior.
""Bi""- two. For example: biped, bipartisan, bisexual.
""Bene""- good or favorable. For example: benefit, benefactor.
""Cide""- kill. For example: homicide, genocide, suicide.
""Macro""- large. For example: macroeconomics, macroscopic.
""Micro""- small. For example: microscope, microorganism.
""Trans""- across. For example: transport, transnational.

, You could pick a word on Monday morning, learn the definition, and try to use it in regular speech throughout the week. By the end of the week, you'll have the word memorized and you'll be able to use it in essays and sot it on tests., By reading, you'll be exposed a a lot of new words. Keep track of all of them by keeping a small notebook and a dictionary handy when you read. When you come across a word you don't recognize, look it up and write it down. Then review it every day until you know it by heart., There are tons of apps for smartphones that are designed to improve vocabulary. Take a look at the app store and search for some. Try them out to improve your vocabulary before your next test.

, While it may seem obvious, many students try to read while watching TV or listening to loud music. This dramatically decreases your reading comprehension. You might find that even though you read the assignments you were supposed to, you keep doing poorly on tests because you can't remember any of the information. By simply reading in a better environment, you could improve your English grade.Choose a quiet area where there are no distractions. Even potential distractions should be avoided- don't sit near a TV and mute or turn off your phone if you have to.
If your house is loud and you can't concentrate, try going to a local library or park for some solitude.

, It's likely that while you're reading, you'll come across some words you don't know. Instead of ignoring them and moving on, look them up. This will not only help you better understand the text, but will improve your vocabulary as well. Both of these will help improve your English grade.It might also help to keep a small notebook of the words you look up. That way, you can review them periodically and make sure you know them by heart.

, You've probably experienced the feeling when you've read an entire chapter of a book and realize you have no idea what it was about. To avoid this, you should periodically stop to summarize what you've read. This will focus your thoughts and help you ensure you know what's going on.This doesn't have to be an essay. Just take a minute to tell yourself what you just read, preferably in just one sentence.
There isn't a concrete rule on how often you'll have to summarize. For easy material, you might be able to do it only after every chapter. For complicated material, you may have to stop at the end of every page to summarize.

, English classes often have you read an entire book and then give you a test on it. It's unrealistic to expect that you'll read a whole book and remember all the details off the top of your head. Taking notes while reading will keep you focused on the text, and help you remember important details to study when the test is coming up.If you own the book, underline and highlight important passages. This will prevent you from breaking your momentum to write notes in a separate place. If you don't own the book, you can use post it notes to mark pages and make notes.

, Reading is a skill that needs to be fostered. If you never read, then reading for class will be a difficult task. Reading regularly will improve your speed, memory, and comprehension. This will make reading for school much easier because assignments will go faster, and you'll retain more information without having to read passages several times.Find things you enjoy reading. Chances are there's plenty of books out there on topics you like. If you enjoy sports, try reading books about your favorite teams or players. Anything will help improve your skills.
Also read something you don't enjoy once in a while. It's inevitable that you'll be assigned readings that you have no interest in, but you still have to do them. Reading things you don't find interesting will help train you for this, and you'll find it more manageable to read things for school.

Use a calculator to divide the top number by the bottom number.,
Multiple your answer by 100 to get your percentage.",How to Calculate a Test Grade1," Figure out how many questions you answered correctly and write this number down. Then, draw a line under this number so that it is the top number of a fraction. For example, if you had 21 correct answers, write down 21/. Do not write anything under the fraction yet.


For long tests, it might be easier to subtract the number of questions you got wrong from the total number of questions on the test. For example, if you got 5 questions wrong on a 26-question test, subtract 5 from 26 (26 - 5 = 21). Then, use 21 as the top number in your fraction.
If some questions are worth more points than others, use the total number of points you earned as your top number instead. For example, if you earned 46 points out of 60 points possible, then write 46 as your top number.;
, Finish the fraction with the total number of questions or points on the test. In our example, if the test had 26 questions, then your fraction would be 21/26.


Check your fraction to make sure that it is set up correctly. Remember that the number of questions you got right or the number of points you earned should be on the top of the fraction. The total number of questions on the test or the total number of points possible should be at the bottom of the fraction.

, You can use a basic calculator to figure out your percentage grade on the test. Just divide the top number by the bottom number. For example, take 21/26 and plug it into the calculator as 21 ÷ 26. You should get the answer 0.8077.Don’t worry about the numbers past the first four digits of the answer. For example, if the answer was 0.8077777, then you can just ignore the last three sevens. They will not affect your percentage.

, You can do this with your calculator or just move the decimal point two digits to the right. The answer will be your grade as a percentage (your score out of 100). In our example, 0.8077 x 100 = 80.77. This means your test grade is 80.77%.Depending on your teacher’s grading scale, 80.77% would be a B or a B-.

Check your course materials for a grade range.,
Know the typical grading range in the United States.,
Learn the British marking system.",How to Calculate a Test Grade2," Grade ranges vary among professors and teachers. If your professor or teacher provided a syllabus at the beginning of the year, it may list the grade range. Your school handbook may have this information as well. If you cannot find a range on any of your materials, ask your professor or teacher.

, Although there are variations, this is the most common grading range for schools and universities in the USA. A ""B"" or higher is typically considered a ""good"" grade. A D is the lowest passing grade, but it may not fulfill requirements for further courses or college applications.An ""A"" is 90% to 100%. A grade of 94% or higher would be considered an “A.” A grade of 90%-93% would be considered an “A-.”

A ""B"" is 80% to 89%. A grade of 87% or higher would be considered a “B+.” A grade of 83%-86% would be considered a “B.” A grade of 80%-82% would be considered a “B-.”

A ""C"" is 70% to 79%. A grade of 77% or higher would be considered a “C+.” A grade of 73%-76% would be considered a “C.” A grade of 70%-72% would be considered a “C-.”

A ""D"" is 60% to 69%. A grade of 67% or higher would be considered a “D+.” A grade of 63%-66% would be considered a “D.” A grade of 60%-62% would be considered a “D-.”

An ""F"" is 59% and below. An “F” is a failing grade, so professors and teachers do not usually assign + or – values to “F” grades., The United Kingdom uses several grading scales in primary and secondary school, for tests such as the GCSE and A-levels. These have their own classification terms, but the percentages roughly correspond to the following. This system is also used for undergraduate work in the UK and in India.


70% to 100% is the highest grade, a mark of Distinction.
60% to 69% earns a Merit.
50% to 59% is Pass.
Some schools Fail at 49% or below, while others fail at 39% or below.

First we need a number for every day of the week:


Monday is, 1
Tuesday is, 2
Wednesday is, 3
Thursday is, 4
Friday is, 5
Saturday is, 6
Sunday is, 0 or 7;
,
Have a number for every month:


January is, 6*
February is, 2*
March is, 2
April is, 5
May is, 0
June is, 3
July is, 5
August is, 1
September is, 4
October is, 6
November is, 2
December is, 4

For a Leap Year * January is 5 and February is 1 but that will be explained shortly.



,
Have a code for every year, which is simple as well but for now let’s put it together and see the formula at work:


Let’s use Christmas 2009;

December Month Code (4) + Day (25) + Year Code (4), which is: (4 + 25 + 4) = 33.



,
Now get as close to the 33 as you can with multiples of seven, subtract the difference and then use the remainder for the week code, (7 * 4) = 28, then (33 – 28) = 5, and that’s it, five is the day code for Friday, so Christmas day this year will occur on a Friday.

,
Before we go any further let’s look at how the Year Code is calculated.,
Starting with the year 2000 we assign the code 0 and then add one to each successive year.,
Now we need to use multiples of seven to get as close to that answer as we can so we’ll use (7 * 10) = 70, now subtract the two numbers: (76 – 70) = 6


That’s it; the year code for 2061 is 6.

,
Again take 2010.,
Let’s see what day of the week Christmas will fall on next year?

,
Year Code (5) + Day (25) + Month Code (4).,
Recap


The formula is Month Code + Day + Year Code and then use multiples of seven to get as close as you can to the answer and then the remainder is the Day Code that gives the Day.,
We could add one more step to that and calculate backwards to see what day the Declaration of Independence was signed but we need to leave Rain man something to do.

",How to Calculate Days of the Week Like Rainman,",,,, There are two ways to do it so I’ll show the first and then I’ll show the one that I think is easier. Once you deal with these you will be able to easily take a date and mentally crunch the day of the week rapidly in your head just like Rainman.

, For example:




2000 = 0
2001 = 1
2002 = 2
2003 = 3
2004 = 4
2005 = 5
2006 = 0
Etc.


Of course this is problematic because a “Leap Year” occurs every four years so that has to be factored in or not. Leap Years occur every four years, 2008 was a leap year so:

2007 = 1
2008 = 3
2009 = 4
2010 = 5
2011 = 6
2012 = 1
2013 = 2
Notice the zero got moved around.


The good news is there’s a shortcut, we’ll take the shortcut. Just take the last two digits of any year and divide it by four and ignore the remainder. (Anytime you don't have a remainder it's a Leap Year and then January Code is 5 and February Code is 1 as shown above) For Example:

The year 2061 is handled as, (61 / 4) = 15 with a remainder of one (Discard the one),


Then add that answer to the last two digits of the year (61 + 15) = 76

,, Divide 10 by 4 and we get 2 with a discarded remainder of 2. So we add 10 + 2 for an answer of 12 and see that a multiple of 7 will give us a 5 left over so the year code for 2010 is “5”.

,, That’s; (5 + 25 + 4) = 34. Then multiples of seven will get us to (7 * 4) = 28. The (34 – 28) = 6. The number six is the code for Saturday. So Christmas day 2010 will fall on a Saturday.

,
Month Code; Divide the last two digits of a year by four, discard the remainder and add the whole number to the last two digits of the year. Then use the multiples of 7 to get as close as you can to that answer and subtract the two for the year code.

Define the light year.,
Write the formula for distance.,
Define the speed of light.,
Calculate the number of seconds in a year.,
Plug variables into equation and solve.,
Calculate the distance in kilometers.",How to Calculate a Light Year1," A light year is a measure of distance equal to how far light travels in one Earth year. Because distances across the universe are so large, astronomers use light years. Without light years, discussing the distance between two stars would require the use of large, unruly numbers.Another measure of distance you may come across when learning astronomy is the parsec. It is equal to 3.26 light years. It is another way to simplify the numbers used to calculate and discuss astronomical distances.;
, Using the common physics formula, distance equals rate times time or d = r x t, you can calculate how long a light year is: Light Year = (speed of light) x (one year). Since speed of light is represented by the variable “c”, you can rewrite the equation as d = c x t, where d is the distance of a light year, c is the speed of light and t is time.If you want to know the distance of a light year in kilometers, you will need to find the speed of light in kilometers per second. If you want miles, you will need the speed of light in miles per second.
You need to know the number of seconds in one Earth year for this calculation.

, Light in a vacuum travels at a velocity of 186,000 miles per second. This is the equivalent of 299,792 kilometers per second or 670,616,629 miles per hour.Here we will use the velocity in miles-per-second.


For this calculation we will use the speed of light, c, equals 186,000 miles per second. This can be rewritten in scientific notation as 1.86 x 105 miles per second.

, To find the number of seconds in a year, you will do a series of multiplications by conversions units. To convert years to seconds you will multiply the number of days in a year times the number of hours in a day, times the number of minutes in an hour, times the number of seconds in a minute.


1 year x 365 days/year x 24 hours/day x 60 minutes/hour x 60 seconds/minute = 31,536,000 seconds.Again, we can rewrite this large number using scientific notation as 3.154 x 107.

, Now that you have defined the variables for speed of light and time, you can plug them into the equation d = c x t and solve for the distance of a light year. Replace c with 1.86 x 105 miles per second and time with 3.15 x 107 seconds.d = c x t
d = (1.86 x 105) x (3.154 x 107 seconds)
d = 5.8 x 1012 or 5.8 trillion miles.

, If you wanted to calculate in kilometers, simply replace the speed of light with the speed in kilometers per second: 3.00 x 105. The time in seconds remains the same because there is no conversion required.d = c x t
d = (3.00 x 105) x (3.154 x 107 seconds)
d = 9.46 x 1012 or 9.5 trillion kilometers.

Identify the distance you want to convert.,
Determine the correct conversion factor.,
Multiply the original distance by the conversion factor.,
Find help.",How to Calculate a Light Year2," Before you begin, you will want to make sure that whatever distance you are working with is either in miles (if using Imperial units) or in kilometers if working with metric. It doesn’t make much sense to convert smaller distances into light years, but you can if you’re curious.


To convert feet into miles, remember that there are 5,280 feet in a mile: x ft (1 mile/5280 ft) = miles.To convert meters into kilometers, simply divide by 1000: x m (1 km/1000 m) = km.

, You need to identify the units for the distance that you’re converting to light years. If you’re converting from kilometers to light years, you will use a different conversion factor than if you’re converting from miles.


To convert from kilometers to light years, you will use: 1 light year/(9.46 x 1012 km).To convert from miles to light years, you will use: 1 light year/(5.88 x 1012 miles)., Once you have determined the proper conversion factor, you can multiply by the original distance to obtain the distance in light years. When numbers are large, it is best to use scientific notation.


For example: If you knew that an object was approximately 14.2 x 1014 miles away from Earth, how many light years would that be?
Use the miles conversion factor: 1/(5.88 x 1012)
Multiply: (14.2 x 1014) x (1/(5.88 x 1012)) = 2.41 x 102 = 241 light years.
The object is 241 light years away.

, You can always ask for assistance from your teacher and fellow students. There are also many resources online and in your text book to help you when converting to light years. Don’t hesitate to ask for extra help if you need it.


Remember, there are always multiple ways to get help when looking for an answer.

Ask your math teacher or your parents for help.,
Ask the smart kids for help.,
Don't get intimidated by maths.,
Turn off and remove all distractions.,
Read through your notes from class.,
Be persistent.,
Study hard for tests and exams.,
Never stress about an exam or test.,
Try your hardest.,
Now you should start to see some better scores.",How to Become Better at Math," It's okay to ask for help; you will not get the help you need if you don't ask. Your parents may be happy to pay for a tutor; one-on-one learning can be very beneficial when you're willing to improve.;
, Ask the smart kids as they might have easier methods for math. You might even make some new friends.

, If Ramanujan could teach himself maths and prove Euler's identity on his own, you can easily pass your algebra without failing and extend your knowledge of math more widely. Read the history of mathematicians who have contributed to the field you are currently studying. This can help you to gain an interest in the topics you are studying, by giving you the inspiration to be as clever as these people and to strive for their mentality.


Broaden and expand your mind, if you block your mind and give up on math, then chances are you aren't going to get better at math, so give math some tries before you give up on it.

, Put the cell phone aside, turn off the TV and radio and put away the music. Don't have anything on your desk ,as you might be tempted to play with the object and lose concentration with learning. Really aim to concentrate on the work before you in the time you've set aside for it. There will plenty of time for the other things later.

, Also read the instructions which are provided in the school curriculum course books. Doing this will help you to understand the topics currently being discussed.


Listen closely. It's very likely that what the teacher is saying is important and is something you should remember that will help you study for tests.
Take lots of notes. When you take lots of notes, you have something to study with and you can remember math with greater ease.

, Practice makes perfect, as does getting back on that metaphorical horse every time you fall off. If you practice as hard as you can at math anywhere, you will see results.


Do each sub-part and beyond. Go beyond the math work given to you in class and find extra exercises to really test and push your understanding.

, When the teacher says a test is coming up, study in regular bursts over time rather than cramming the night before. If you study your hardest, you will be better than you would be if you didn't study at all, or left it until the last moment.

, If you freak out, you can scare yourself into not thinking it through. This can happen from obvious things, such as... not revising. You know you have the power to revise in you, so use it to reduce and even eliminate the anxiety.

, Remember to really try to do your best so you can get your best scores.

, If you really tried your best and you followed all the steps, you might find that you're now starting to get more Bs and even As. Keep it up!

, There are a lot of tricks in math that are fun to know because they save you a lot of time. They are often interesting, too. For example, adding up all the numbers from 1 to 100 is a lot of work. But, check out this very easy way to do it: 100 + 1 = 101 and 99 + 2 = 101, right? So does 98 + 3, 97 + 4, 96 + 5, etc. Instead, if you multiply 101 by the amount of these pairs, you will get your sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100, which is 5050. You could have added 1+2+3...but by doing this, you found a way out of doing extra work. That's fun.


Learn math tricks that will make calculating much easier.

, Math clubs will be filled with people who are passionate about math. By surrounding yourself with math lovers, it will inspire you to become interested in math, and to learn about the different ways in which math is incorporated in your everyday life. Join a club at school, online, or in your local community.

, A lot of people lose interest in math because it can be difficult to learn. Math can be difficult to learn because, in the modern-day classroom, students are taught to learn math by memorizing formulas. However, by learning math this way, students aren't taught the underlying principles and concepts, which are needed to understand why a particular formula is being used. Therefore, make math easier by learning and understanding the underlying principles and concepts of a given piece of mathematics.Ask your teacher during or after class why and how a particular formula works, while others do not. Ask your teacher, ""What are the underlying principles of this formula?"" or ""How can I make this formula less abstract and more concrete?""
You can test yourself to see if you understand math by asking yourself these questions:Can I explain mathematical facts and concepts in simpler facts and concepts?
Can I make logical connections between different concepts and facts?
Can I identify the principles that make everything work in a given piece of mathematics?

In creating the chart (in a few steps), I noticed larger guesses like 180, 360, 450 and 540 were moving the arc leftwards the way ti should go, but the method was error prone and unscientific, even if it did eventually hit on the correct answer by chance.

Hover over the lower right corner until the cursor changes to the double-headed arrow and then click on the corner of the chart and pull it open into a large square. The result should be approximately a quarter-circle of 16 spheres which do NOT start at 0 degrees and proceed to 0 degrees -- OOPS! That is, unless your Initial Guess was excellent and well thought out.

, There is only one cycle being made around the ring because of the 0.125 factor used in the formula for Cosine (and Sine), of ""=Radius*COS(C2*PI()/180*0.125)"", because 2880 * .128 = 360 (degrees). 90 degrees does not work. Neither did 360 +90=450 or 540 when I was ""Fooling around"" guessing at the answer instead of thinking. It's simple, really: 720 degrees is not only a quarter circle but it is 8 times 90 degrees! And the problem is very easy when described as the comparison of the ratios 90/360 - x/2880, which soon becomes 2880 = 4x or x = 720. 720 is the correct answer, even though it just seems wrong, being twice 360. Or, another way to think of it is that 0.125*720 = 90, or 1/4 of 0.125*2880. 8 of those are needed because 2880 is 8 times 360. So, 8*90 = 720. Think of 2880 as the level of detail obtained per spheroid; 2880/64 = 45 data points per spheroid. You may wish to double-click on the series plot line and decrease the Line Weight to 1 or do it via Chart Layout in the upper left hand corner where it says Format Selection.

Be positive about math.",How to Be Interested in Math2," Read books centered on mathematical mysteries or fictional and/or autobiographical books based on famous mathematicians. For example, a lot of Paul Verhoeven’s books incorporate math.Also, The Number Devil by Hans Magnus Enzensberger is a popular fiction book about math.


Read biographies of famous female mathematicians to cultivate and maintain your interest in math.For example, read about Hypatia, one of the earliest known female mathematicians in Alexandria., Baking uses a lot of proportions and ratios. By baking your favorite cake, brownies, or cookies, you can learn about proportions and ratios while having fun and satisfying your taste buds.

, You can promote your interest in math by exploring how math is related to something you love! For example, if you’re interested in historical landmarks, like the Golden Gate Bridge or the Statue of Liberty, learn about the math that was involved in building these landmarks.If you’re interested in a subject not traditionally associated with math, learn how that subject incorporates math. For example, if you are interested in fashion, explore how cutting patterns and sewing these patterns together involves math., New math formulas can seem mundane and uninteresting, especially if you do not apply them to anything. Make math interesting by applying mundane formulas to everyday life circumstances. For example, if you have an alarm clock, chances are you are calculating how many extra minutes you can sleep before you get out of bed once you hit the snooze button. Try to notice the different ways you do math in your day-to-day tasks., Realize that, if you keep an open mind, you can learn anything. Yes, math can be hard at times, but perhaps there is a better way for you to learn math, like playing games with friends or reading a fictional story based on a mathematical mystery.

Be prepared for math class by completing your homework on time, by getting help beforehand if you do not understand a problem, and by having all your materials ready for class to begin, i.e., pencil, paper, textbook, and calculator.

, If you find it hard staying focused in math class, try sitting in front of the class, for example, the first or second row. By sitting in the front of the classroom, you will be able to hear everything your teacher is saying. By sitting up front, your teacher will also make eye contact with you, and there are fewer distractions in the front of the classroom., Make math class interesting by participating! This means asking questions when you do not understand something. If you do not understand a math problem, ask your teacher about a real life example. You can also volunteer to work out the math problem on the board, or engage in a friendly competition with a classmate to see who can solve the equation first.

, By taking notes during class, you will be more engaged with the material. You can take notes by drawing pictures or diagrams to help you understand a concept. You can also write down words you have not heard before and their definitions.


Many mathematical words have their origins in Greek, Latin, or Arabic. Try tracing the root of these words to combine math with history.

, Start your homework as soon as you come home, so the lesson is still fresh in your mind. Try to write down each step that you take so that you can double check, and so that the teacher knows that you are working it out right.

, It doesn't have to be a long study session—one or two sessions of 15 minutes will work just fine. Try scheduling them at a specific time, to help make sure that you don't forget and miss days.


If you're doing a longer study session, schedule some quick breaks to keep your brain fresh.

, Avoid cramming or staying up late to study. Eating well and getting lots of sleep will help you have the energy to do your best.

, If you don't know how to do something, then ask your teacher or one of your friends how to do it. Ask them how to work it out instead of asking them for the answers.

, You'll be much more motivated to succeed if you can make studying fun.


Try finding some maths puzzles or books, such as the Murderous Maths books.
Play online math games.
Quiz your friends, parents, or siblings.

Network with other mathematicians.",How to Be a Good Mathematician," Maybe you have always been fascinated by numbers and how formulas explain the world in which we live. If you think mathematics might be something you want to pursue further, focus on your math courses in high school.


Ask your teachers for extracurricular activities you can participate in to hone your math skills, such as quiz bowl or mathletes.
Compete in mathematics competitions such as the International Mathematical Olympiad.;
, Math is not a subject that you can just sit down and memorize. Many of the concepts take time to fully understand. Do not be discouraged if you don’t comprehend right away. If you are easily defeated by complex problems, mathematics may not be the right field for you.When learning math, don’t just memorize formulas. Think about the problem itself and try to figure out a way to solve it.

, There are some very easy concepts in math and there are some very difficult ones. While self-study and online tutorials are helpful, you cannot become a mathematician all on your own. Find a like-minded group of peers that you can study with or study one-on-one with a professional math tutor.


If you are still in high school, ask one of your teachers if they know of any groups that you can join.
If you are at the college level, find a math club or society to join.

, This step may seem obvious, but it is one thing to study math and quite another to actually do math. Explore mathematical problems and concepts that go above and beyond what you may have learned in school.Do problems from your textbook and find more problems online to master difficult concepts.

, While it is important to stay current on what is happening today, it is equally as important to read about the history of mathematics and how it developed. Study the original papers and proofs that were developed hundreds of years ago to obtain a solid foundation in the subject.Many mathematical proofs and concepts have evolved and been simplified over time. Reading the original paper will help you understand how it has been streamlined to the form in which it exists today.

, In order to stay properly motivated, you must have a passion for what you are doing. If you are not motivated by the idea of discovery or working through a problem, you will be easily discouraged in your studies. Don’t try to force your passion. If it’s not something you truly love, it is not likely to magically become something you love.


On the flip side, you may be passionate, but lack inherent skill. Math may not come easily to you, but if you love it and are willing to put in the necessary time and effort, you can become a good mathematician.

, Gaining a fundamental understanding of mathematics mostly happens with intense and consistent studying on your own; however, asking questions and conversing with your peers can lead to personal insights or a new perspective on an old problem. Make time to stop for conversation and discuss difficult problems with fellow mathematicians., When you have encountered a particularly difficult concept, oftentimes, it is best to put it to the back your mind for a bit. Let your brain chew on the problem without pencil and paper and see if you can come up with an interesting solution.Even if you don’t come up with a groundbreaking new theory, taking some time out of your day to enjoy nature is a productive use of your time.

, When looking at something that is said to be true, see if you can prove it. If someone tells you something is true, ask them to prove it to you. Trying to prove something to yourself will help you exercise your math brain and start thinking about all math problems in this way., Logic is the foundation of a mathematical argument and necessary to developing a proper proof. There are self-study guides online or textbooks you can purchase to study logic. You can also sign up to take a logic course at the local college.


Spend time working through logic problems and cultivating that type of thought process.
Logic will help you write proofs in an ordered way that people won’t be able to find error with.

, Although it may seem strange to use sentences to explain equations and numbers, a proper mathematical proof is written out in a grammatically correct sentence. If you can’t write your argument in a sentence, you may not fully understand what you are trying to say and need to think about it more.When writing a proof, always write in full sentences.
Study old proofs to get an idea of the proper format to use.

, The contrapositive of a statement “If A, then B” is “If not B, then not A”. As an example, the contrapositive of the statement “If I’m from New York, I am American” is “If I am not American, I am not from New York”. The contrapositive is always true which can sometimes be difficult to wrap your head around.Always rewrite statements with the contrapositive to exercise that thought process.

, The converse of a statement such as “If A, then B” is “If B, then A”. The converse is not necessarily a true statement. When studying a problem, always ask yourself if the converse is true and then try to prove it. Even if it’s not true, it’s a good exercise to keep in mind when thinking about problems., It’s necessary to have at least a bachelor’s degree to start a career in mathematics. A master’s degree is recommended, but a bachelor’s is where to start.Choose a university that has a well-known reputation for their mathematics program: Harvard University
University of Cambridge
University of Oxford
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
University of Chicago

, When pursuing an advanced degree in mathematics, it is necessary to make a preliminary choice between studying applied and theoretical mathematics. While there is overlap between the two, advanced research will usually focus on one or the other.Applied mathematics uses established theories to solve problems in the real-world with mathematical modeling.
Theoretical mathematics push the boundaries of what we know and come up with new concepts to explain scientific and engineering questions.

, Advanced degrees are often considered to be necessary to be a mathematician. While you can start your career with a bachelor’s, pursuing a master’s or doctorate will increase the job opportunities open to you. When choosing a university, again consider the reputation of the program and the professors who teach there.Persistence is important when pursuing a doctorate. The first year or two can be very difficult because all of that you must learn to develop a research project., Many aspects of mathematics require proficiency in computer programs such as R, SAS, and MATLAB. These programs are not intuitive so taking a course or getting private tutoring is recommended.


There are many online tutorials that are useful for learning these programs, as well.

, Options for a career in mathematics vary widely. There are many careers available both in industry and in academia. Jobs in industry generally involve mathematical modeling for scientific/biomedical research, economics, encryption, business analytics, actuary analytics, and more. Careers in academia can involve teaching at any level and advanced research similar to that done during a doctorate.


While pursuing advanced degrees, speak with alumni from your program and your professors to find what is a good fit for you.

, Internships are a great way to test out a career and gain some necessary experience. You can apply for internships at any stage of your career or education. Many universities have programs that will help place you into an internship that aligns with your career goals. Math societies also promote internship opportunities. Relevant internship opportunities might include:A research position with a professor
Mathematical modeling with a biomedical or pharmaceutical company
Statistics and analytics in economics
Deciphering encryptions for military or law enforcement

, There are hundreds of mathematical societies that put on conferences every year. Some of them are more general mathematics, but there are many that are more concentrated on specific branches such as geometry or calculus. Conferences are a great venue to learn about the current research and network with peers in your field. Regular conferences are hosted by societies such as:


American Mathematical SocietyEuropean Mathematical SocietySociety for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, A strong publication record is a great way to boost your resume and get noticed when applying for jobs. Journals articles show that not only have you produced research that has advanced the field, but that you know how to communicate that research to the public.

, The best way to find a job is to meet people within the field. The more people you know, the more job opportunities you will hear about. These individuals might also be able to put in a good word for you when you are applying for the job to make your resume stand out from the crowd.


Conferences are a great place to meet new people in your field of study.
Being part of mathematical societies is also a great way to expand your network.
Join the alumni board of your university after you graduate to get in touch with older students.
If speakers come to give talks at your university, ask them to lunch or out to coffee.

Adopt a positive attitude about math.,
Reject the notion you are naturally bad at math.,
Take math seriously.,
Stay motivated.",How to Be Good at Mathematics," If you're not great at math, you need to make sure you're studying in an environment that allows for concentration. Before you sit down to practice, find a place free of outside stimuli that can cause distraction.Find an area where there is not a lot of noise or commotion. A quiet coffee shop could work, or a desk in your bedroom.
Minimize distractions in front of you. Disconnect from the internet and put away your phone.
If you like music while studying, go for instrumental music. Music with lyrics, or music that's very loud, can be distracting when you're studying.;
, There's no real secret to becoming good at mathematics. It all comes down to dedication. If you want to improve your math score, hard work is key. You will have to practice every day until you start to understand the underlying concepts behind math.Stick to a schedule. See where you can fit in some study time every day. Maybe you usually have some time in the early evenings. You could plan to study math from 6 to 7 every night after dinner.
Try not to study for hours and hours straight. This may create stress. Study for an hour or so each night.

, Math is sequential. Many people feel they have to memorize concepts and formulas, or map out the answer in their head before they begin. This is not productive. Instead, try to understand the concepts behind math. If you see how and why an equation works, you'll be able to remember it more easily in a pinch.Math theory may seem complicated, but with a little hard work you can begin to figure it out. In math classes, do not hesitate to ask why. Why does the Pythagorean Theorem work? How does the quadratic equation work on a logical level?
Understanding the underlying concepts is far more productive than simple memorization. If you understand something in depth, you'll have an easier time working with it. You'll be better equipped to check your answer if you understand why an equation makes sense.

, Doing math, you want to see how to discover an answer. Instead of pre-planning how you'll figure out the answer, simply work the equation one step at a time. Do not think ahead, as going slowly will allow you to see how the answer unfolds.If you first need to divide, concentrate only on dividing. If you need to add next, keep your focus on adding.
Once you've completed the problem, you can go through and look at the process. Try to understand why and how the process worked.

, You can learn a lot from your mistakes in math. When you find you have an incorrect answer, review your process. Where and how did you go wrong? Try to work through the problem again, figuring out how to get the correct answer.It's vital that you write down your process when solving math problems. Use a pen to write down the steps you took to solve a problem line by line. This way, when you make an error, you can review your work and figure out where you slipped up more easily.

, Review your process after completing an equation. Carefully make sure you calculated everything correctly and used the right process. When you check to see if you got the answer right, you're more likely to have succeeded if you checked your answers carefully. This will also help you get in the habit of checking answers, which can boost grades on an exam.Checking answers can also help you better understand the underlying theories behind math.

, If you know someone who's good at math, have them look over your work when you're done. You can ask a parent for help, a tutor you hired, or a friend or family member who excels at math.If you're very confused, choose someone with a lot of patience who's good at explaining things. Your cousin may be a whiz at math, but he may be short-tempered and judgmental. He may snap at you for not understanding something. Instead, ask your sister who's usually calm.
Do not be embarrassed to ask for help. It can take a long time to improve your math skills, and everyone needs some help along the way.

, If you're trying to improve your math skills outside of school, you can try taking an online course. Universities like Kaplan provide an array of online courses, and many colleges have classes online students can take remotely.Some schools provide certain aspects of a course, like PowerPoint presentations and taped lectures, for free online.
You can also look into an auditing a course at a local college. If money is an issue, auditing a course can allow you to gain knowledge for no cost.

, If you are in school, your school may have a math resource center. Many campuses have a center where students can go for one-on-one math tutoring. Check to see if a math center is available at your school. If it is, make use of the resource.If your school does not have a resource center, it may have a general resource center where you can get help on a variety of subjects.
You can also see if your professor does review sessions. If you're confused by a subject, a review session with a professor can help you better understand that subject.

, Sometimes, explaining a concept to another person can help you understand it more. If you're finally getting your calculus course, and a friend is struggling, you could try offering to help him or her. You could also form a study group. If anyone is struggling with something you're beginning to understand, you can offer to help.When helping, explain the subject material as clear as you possibly can. In addition to explaining the process, explain why it works.
If you're beginning to feel very comfortable with your math skills, you could work as a private tutor for people at a lower level. Explaining math to others can help improve your math skills.

, Most teachers are enthusiastic about encouraging students. If you want to be better at math, do not hesitate to ask your teacher for help. He or she may be able to give you one-on-one attention and go over problems after class.Do not feel bad about asking for help. Many people struggle with math, and your teacher has likely dealt with struggling students before. Your teacher is invested in seeing you succeed.
Be direct when asking for help, and explain the issue clearly. Do not say, ""I don't get any of this."" Instead, say, ""I feel like I understand everything until chapter three, but polynomials are really confusing me.""

, If you feel you need a lot of one-on-one attention, consider hiring a tutor. A tutor can sit down with you a certain number of times per week and go over problems with you. A quality tutor can help math start to click for you, leading you to better understand the subject as a whole.


If you have a learning disability that affects your competency at math, such as dyslexia, see if you can find a tutor who works with students with disabilities. National organizations associated with your disability may be able to find you a local tutor. A medical doctor may be able to refer you to a tutor as well., Many people self-sabotage with math by convincing themselves they can't do it. If you struggled with math in high school, college, or at another point in your education, you may think you're not good at math and simply will not be able to do it. A positive attitude can help you stay motivated and feel encouraged as you attempt to hone your math skills.If you have a bad attitude, you will get frustrated easily. If you assume you're bad at math, when you get a problem wrong you will see that as a confirmation of this assumption. You will think to yourself, ""I knew I'm no good at this. What's the point?""
Go into it with the right attitude. If you're currently struggling with math, don't think, ""I'm bad at math."" Instead, think to yourself, ""I have not taken enough time to practice math, so I'm still learning. With some hard work, I know I can improve my skills.""

, Many people convince themselves they're naturally bad at math. This can lead a person to not put in the work to improve. Understand that it's a myth that people have a natural tendency towards math. Studies show everyone can learn math with a little work.Some people do have an inborn talent for math. This can help them gain an advantage early on, and they may learn more quickly in elementary school. However, most studies indicate hard work can improve your math skills just as much as a natural inclination. In fact, hard work may pay off more long term than innate talent.
There are learning disorders, like dyscalculia, that can affect your ability to do math. However, even with a learning disability, you can improve your math skills with practice and proper treatment. Do not get discouraged. You are not simply bad at math. You just need practice.

, Another reason people struggle with math is that they do not take it seriously. They feel it's okay to be bad at math, or laugh it off. While you should not feel bad about yourself for struggling with math, take it seriously as a subject.The ability to do math can help with your reasoning skills, and mental math can make your day-to-day life less stressful.
Embrace math instead of disregarding it. Being good at math can be beneficial to you.

, Practice is really the only way to improve your math skills long term. There is really no magic trick that will improve your skills overnight. You just have to stay motivated. Keep up with your studies and ask for help when you need it. With some time and dedication, you can become a math whiz.

Investigate the steps of the Theory of Neutral Operations as they apply to spaces or zeroes arriving at negative and positive 1, from the point of view of an early Universe trying to create something from nothing (purely logically).,
Let there be at least 3 spaces (or zeroes), such that O>0>o and all are unequal or equal to the Null Set, {ø}, i.e.,
Notice that sometimes O+o = 0, that is when two spaces sum to make a third space.,
Regard that stating ""what is noticed"" sounds like one is talking about an Awareness in the Primordial Universe.,
Now do the Neutral Operation O+o = O*o = 0.,Do O+o-o = (O*o)-o by subtracting o from both sides of the equation.,
Do O = o*(O-1)... an admittedly great step for the Universe to take, to factor out o on the right after simplifying the left, but Nature has a way of trying all possibilities, so consider it at least a possibility.,
Do O:o = O/o = (O-1) .... now here is taken a step not taken with a and b.,Do O:o - O = O/o - O = -1 and negative 1 has been isolated and defined.,
Do O - O:o = O - O/o = +1 after multiplying through by negative 1, and the result is positive 1 has been isolated and defined.",How to Arrive at ‐1 and 1 from Spaces or Zeroes," Do so by going to the Desktop and selecting the green X (for XL), starting the app, and then select File Open New Workbook. Take notes of the Conditions and Formulas below onto the workbook worksheet and save the file into a logical folder.;
, they are exactly empty space or space-time, without energy, differentiable only by imagined size. To restate: in this primordial reality or existence, the zero symbol, 0, is less than than the capital O symbol and both are greater than the small o symbol., Let a multiplicity of these be noticed also, i.e. O*o = 0. What is noticed is that space may be proportioned into parts, and brought again together into wholes. You may also think about O*o as if they were each squares and the smaller square was unit inches or square inches; in that case, multiplying the larger square (space) by the smaller one (an abstract unit) would result in the larger space being measurable in terms of abstract inches, all of which are zeroes, not things. When we say 'One foot = 12"", we do not need a ruler or a thing to have a good idea of what is meant in terms of space. The space still equals zero since nothing occupies it yet. It's just an abstract ""overlay"" of a sort., Let it suffice that Truth = Comprehension, such that if a state is True, it is Comprehended by the Bounds of Reality since certainly human comprehension exists within the Bounds of Reality at least, and perhaps Universal Mind does as well. Therefore, if it is more proper to say ""space-time"" instead of ""space"", then that is what is meant by each symbol, including (one supposes) the operators, equality and inequalities. In other words, everything is being accomplished by pure logic and the only ""matter"" involved is empty space-time. That sort of abstraction connotes that logic is a property of space or space-time itself, or perhaps a property of different sorts of space or space-time -- just as air is different than outer space and the space around a neutron star is different than the space around other types of stars. Yes, those conditions require matter while instead a matter-less reality for the beginning of the Universe is supposed, but differences in the quality of matter may arise from differences in the quality of sub-space, e.g. in spin operators even where no particles are spinning, only where waves of space are somehow differentiable, if only by size. Because all the theory actually depends upon is O>o and O+o=0=O*o. That is to say, a difference in size existed in the Primary Universe, and that this difference had a Cause. What that Cause was matters less than the Logic it gives rise to for this case under consideration., Proceed as before with a and b, and when arriving at division, mean it geometrically, i.e. proportionally, i.e. a/b = a:b as a simple proportion, rather than as a mathematical operation that is performed. That is, the great space is greater in proportion to the smaller space, rather then physically divided by it (though that is possible as well, as in the ruler example).,, The raw logic of this may have taken eons or billions of eons, but time is on our side when attempting to create something as tremendous as a Universe. Carl Sagan once said that proving 1, or the Identity Principle, takes 28 steps in logic. Those 28 or so steps are being assumed., Then, both sides were divided by the parenthetical term in order to isolate a single term. Now, isolate -1. O/o = O:o, i.e. the greater space is in proportional relation to the lesser space.,, There now exists in the Universe 1, 1 thing, 1 unit, a counted thing in the Universe, and its antithesis, -1 as well from the previous step. Both require the ""know how"" to do O/o = O:o, i.e. hold two spaces of different size in ratio to one another -- that's the key. Let's suppose the larger O = 3 and the smaller o = 2. 3 > 3:2 and 3 > 3/2. Here what we have supposed is that the smaller space is 1/2 as large as the larger space. If we look at the final step, we have 3 - 3/2, which = 3/2, so it would not be true that 0>O, unless 0 is the very concept of ""zero-ness"", and includes all zeroes. It, strangely enough, also equals the Null Set, which is the absence of anything, even zeroes I believe. Thus, it is All and it is Nothing. It comprehends everything and exists nowhere in particular -- not even in empty Space-Time. It is the greatest and the least of all things ... being both Everything and Nothing, simultaneously. Conclude then, that it is beyond comprehension, yet contains comprehension, and thus all perception and reason, including this possible theory for the formation of its existence.

Find the Axis of Symmetry, which = -b/2a.
Find the parabola's Vertex, or ""turning point"", which is found by using the value obtained finding the axis of symmetry and plugging it into the equation to determine what y equals.
Find the Roots, or X-Intercepts, by solving the equation and determining the values for x when f(x) = f(0) = y = 0.

,
Find that -b/2a = -(-2)/(2*1) = 2/2 = 1, and the line x = 1 is the Axis of Symmetry about which the parabola is reflective.
Use the fact that x=1 for the minimum point of the parabola to find y of the Vertex, or ""turning point"", by plugging 1 into the equation given:y = x^2 - 2x - 15 so y = 1^2 - 2(1) - 15 is y = -16. The coordinates of the minimum, i.e. the Vertex, are (1, -16).
Solve the equation by factoring two numbers that when added = -2 and when multiplied = -15; those are -5 and 3, so the solution is (x-5)(x+3) = y = 0 (when you are finding the x intercepts, y = 0). So the Roots = 5 and -3 and the coordinates of the roots are (5,0), (-3,0).

  Accept an ellipse in standard formula format, i.e.,
  Find the following elements, which you also memorize the formulas for per the following KEY:

  The Center = (h,k){\displaystyle (h,k)}

  The Major Axis = 2a{\displaystyle 2a}

  The Minor Axis = 2b{\displaystyle 2b}

  The Vertices = (h,k+a){\displaystyle (h,k+a)}, (h,k−a){\displaystyle (h,k-a)}

  The Co-Vertices = (h+b,k){\displaystyle (h+b,k)}, (h−b,k){\displaystyle (h-b,k)}

  The Foci = (h,k+c){\displaystyle (h,k+c)}, (h,k−c){\displaystyle (h,k-c)} for c of b2+c2=a2{\displaystyle b^{2}+c^{2}=a^{2}}


,
  Given the equation (x−5)264+(y+2)2100=1{\displaystyle {\frac {(x-5)^{2}}{64}}+{\frac {(y+2)^{2}}{100}}=1}, analyze the ellipse it represents into the above elements:

  Following the standard formula format, (h,k){\displaystyle (h,k)} = (5,−2){\displaystyle (5,{-2})} because both numbers are subtracted in the standard format.,
  Create the Excel Chart.,
 Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

 See the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Analyze an Ellipse," (x−h)2a2+(y−k)2b2=1{\displaystyle {\frac {(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}}}=1} or  (x−h)2b2+(y−k)2a2=1{\displaystyle {\frac {(x-h)^{2}}{b^{2}}}+{\frac {(y-k)^{2}}{a^{2}}}=1}, where a>b{\displaystyle a>b}.

,, Thus, the Center is at (h,k){\displaystyle (h,k)} at (5,−2){\displaystyle (5,{-2})}.

  a2>b2{\displaystyle a^{2}>b^{2}}, so look to see which is larger of the two denominators and find that 100>64{\displaystyle 100>64}, a2=100{\displaystyle a^{2}=100} and b2=64{\displaystyle b^{2}=64}, so a=10{\displaystyle a=10} and b=8{\displaystyle b=8}.

  Per the KEY, find that the Major Axis = 2a{\displaystyle 2a} and thus = 2∗10=20{\displaystyle 2*10=20}.

  Per the KEY, find that the Minor Axis = 2b{\displaystyle 2b} and thus = 2∗8=16{\displaystyle 2*8=16}.

  Per the KEY, find that the Vertices = (h,k+a){\displaystyle (h,k+a)}, (h,k−a){\displaystyle (h,k-a)} and thus = (5,−2+10){\displaystyle (5,{-2}+10)}, (5,−2−10){\displaystyle (5,{-2}-10)} so the Vertices = (5,8){\displaystyle (5,8)} and (5,−12){\displaystyle (5,{-12})}.

  Per the KEY, find that the Co-Vertices = (h+b,k){\displaystyle (h+b,k)}, (h−b,k){\displaystyle (h-b,k)} and thus = (5+8,−2){\displaystyle (5+8,{-2})}, (5−8,−2){\displaystyle (5-8,{-2})} so the Co-Vertices = (13,−2){\displaystyle (13,{-2})} and (−3,−2){\displaystyle ({-3},{-2})}.

  You now should be able to sketch the graph with pencil and paper, given the above successful completion of finding the elements so far.

  Lastly per the KEY, find that the Foci = (h,k+c){\displaystyle (h,k+c)}, (h,k−c){\displaystyle (h,k-c)} for c{\displaystyle c} of b2+c2=a2{\displaystyle b^{2}+c^{2}=a^{2}}. You know that b2=64{\displaystyle b^{2}=64} and a2=100{\displaystyle a^{2}=100}, so c2=100−64=36{\displaystyle c^{2}=100-64=36} and c=6{\displaystyle c=6}. Therefore the Foci lie at (5,−2+6){\displaystyle (5,{-2}+6)} and (5,−2−6){\displaystyle (5,{-2}-6)}, or otherwise stated, at (5,4){\displaystyle (5,4)} and (5,−8){\displaystyle (5,{-8})}. Congratulations, you've completed all the elements.


, Open a new workbook and start a new worksheet titled Ellipse.

  Input x into cell A1 and y into cell B1 and Format Cell font red, align center horizontal.

  Select between the A of Column A and the 1 of Row 1 and thus the entire worksheet at upper leftmost corner. Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 4 and Font 9 or 10.

  Look over your figures to see the extent of the ellipse to guide your x values series. The Minor Axis runs from (−3,2){\displaystyle ({-3},2)} to (13,−2){\displaystyle (13,{-2})} so you want to create a series of x values that range from -3 to 13. Select cell A2 and input -3 and select a cell about 40 cells down, say in A43, and input 13. Do Edit Fill Series Column Linear Trend OK.

  For the y values of the ellipse, you need to restate the ellipse's formula in terms of what y equals all by itself. Switch the y term with the 1 term and arrive at (x−5)264−1=−(y+2)2100{\displaystyle {\frac {(x-5)^{2}}{64}}-1={\frac {-(y+2)^{2}}{100}}}. Multiply both sides by -100 and take the square root to arrive at 100−10064∗(x−5)2=y+2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {100-{\frac {100}{64}}*(x-5)^{2}}}=y+2}. Bring the 2 to the left side to isolate y and arrive finally at 100−10064∗(x−5)2−2=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {100-{\frac {100}{64}}*(x-5)^{2}}}-2=y}. You can simplify 10064{\displaystyle {\frac {100}{64}}} to 2516{\displaystyle {\frac {25}{16}}} if you like -- Excel doesn't care much either way. Input that formula to B2 as =SQRT(100-(25/16)*(A2-5)^2)-2 where A2 is the X value, and select cell range B2:B43 and Edit Fill Down.

  Notice that almost all the y values are positive. Clearly, you've only taken half the square roots. Copy A2:A43 to A44 and paste and then sort the column from largest values to smallest. That sets up a continuum with the 13 ending at A43 and decreases around back to -3 for the x values. For the y values, copy the formula in cell B43 and insert a minus sign in front of it so that it reads now =-SQRT(100-(25/16)*(A44-5)^2)-2 when you copy and paste it into cell B44 to B85.

  Select A2:B85 and using the Chart Wizard or the Ribbon, select Charts All/Other, Scatter, Smooth Line Scatter and leave the chart on the Ellipse worksheet. Add vertical grid lines and stretch the chart until the grid squares are approximate squares.

  Go to cell B2 and select the formula in the formula bar and copy it and then select cell C2 and type y and paste the formula in after it. Make it bold.

  Go to cell D4 and type in the main formula and format font size 18 bold.

  Copy cells A1:B1 to cells D6:E6 for the x y headers in red.

  Input the Vertices (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} pairs in cells D7:E8 and add the title Vertices (along Major Axis) in cell F7.

  Input the Co-Vertices (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} pairs in cells D10:E11 and add the title Co-Vertices (along Minor Axis) in cell F10.

  Input the Center (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} pair in cells D13:E13 and add the title Center in cell F13.

  Input the Foci (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} pairs in cells D15:E16 and add the title Foci in cell F15.

  Select in the Plot Area of the Chart and do menu item Chart Add Data and in response to the data query/ies, respond with the (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} pairs you just input. They may not ""land correctly"" and so require editing in the formula bar -- just edit them until they appear as given above, eg. Series 2 should be =SERIES(""Vertices"",Ellipse!$D$7:$D$8,Ellipse!$E$7:$E$8,2) and notice how ""Vertices"" was typed in the title at the beginning of the series description -- do that for each series so that they appear correctly in the Legend.

  Format the Vertices with a thin brown line and Size 8 red markers, or blue ones for the Co-Vertices. Format the Center as a large Light Blue Dot and the Foci as Large Black squares.

  Add data labels with both x and y if you prefer, as the chart above demonstrates, though it gets a bit crowded. Use font size 8 or 9.

  Move the Legend to the top of the Chart.

  Copy the Chart and Data with Grabber and save paste to a Paster worksheet to save your work and then save the workbook.

Accept a hyperbola in standard formula format, i.e.,

Find the following elements, which you also memorize the formulas for per the following KEY:

The Center at (h,k)
The Vertices at (h,k±a)
The Foci at (h,k±c) per a^2 + b^2 = c^2
Asymptotes 1 and 2 by the Point-Slope Form, given that slope is y/x (or k/h) and the asymptotes pass through the Center at point (x, y), yet to be determined.

,


Given the equation (y-1)^2/100 + (x+1)^2/64 = 1, analyze the hyperbola it represents into the above elements:

Center (h,k) is at (-1,1)
Vertices depend on a. a = sqrt(100) since a>b, so a=10.,

Create the Excel Chart.,
Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

See the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Analyze a Hyperbola," (x-h)^2 / a^2 + (y-k)^2 / b^2 = 1 or (x-h)^2 / b^2 + (y-k)^2 / a^2 = 1, where a>b. If it's not in standard format, put it in standard format. For example, if given the equation 9(x-2) - 16(y+4) = 144, simply divide both sides by 144 and simplify: 9(x-2)/144 - 16(y+4)/144 = 144/144; then (x-2)/16 - (y+4)/9 = 1 is in standard form.

,, (h,k±a) = (-1,11), (-1,-9) are the coordinates of the vertices. b = sqrt(64) = 8.
Foci depend on a^2 + b^2 = c^2. 100 + 64 = 164 = c^2 so sqrt(164) = c and sqrt(4*41) = c, so 2*sqrt(41) = c and this  is 12.8062 = c. (h,k±c) is (-1, 13.8062), (-1, -11.8062) are the coordinates of the Foci.
The asymptotes have slope a/b which = 10/8, or 5/4 when simplified. The asymptotes pass through the Center at point (-1,1). Therefore using the Point-Slope formula for a line, in which y1-y2 = m(x1-x2), and substituting in y for y1, k for y2, x for x1 and h for x2 -- we have:
Asymptote1: y-1 = 5/4*(x- -1) or y-1 = 5/4x + 5/4 or y = 5/4x + 9/4 as the asymptotic line equation.
Asymptote2 is found by changing the slope to become negative. Thus we have Asymptote2: y-1 = -5/4(x- -1) or y-1 = -5/4x - 5/4 or y = -5/4x - 1/4 as the equation of the second asymptotic line of the hyperbola.

, Open a new workbook, save it as ANALYZE A HYPERBOLA and start a new worksheet titled Hyperbola.

Input x into cell A1 and y into cell B1 and Format Cell font red, align center horizontal.
Select between the A of Column A and the 1 of Row 1 and thus the entire worksheet at upper leftmost corner. Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 2 and Font Size 9 or 10. Format align center horizontal.
Look over your figures to see the extent of the hyperbola to guide your x values series. Generally, a value range of ±15 is adequate. Select cell A2 and input -15 and select cell A32, and input 15. Do Edit Fill Series Column Linear Trend OK.
For the y values of the ellipse, you need to restate the ellipse's formula in terms of what y equals all by itself. Subtract the x term from both sides and arrive at (y-1)^2/100 = 1 + (x+1)^2/64. Multiply both sides by 100 and take the square root to arrive at (y-1)=sqrt(100+100/64*(x+1)^2). Add -1 to both sides and arrive finally at y=sqrt(100+100/64*(x+1)^2) +1. You can simplify 100/64 to 25/16 if you like -- Excel doesn't care much either way. Input that formula to B2 as ""=sqrt(100+100/64*(A2+1)^2) +1"" where A2 is the X value, and select cell range B2:B32 and Edit Fill Down.
Notice that all the y values are positive. Clearly, you've only taken half the square roots. Copy A2:A43 to A45 and paste and then sort the column from largest values to smallest. That sets up a continuum with the -15 ending at A64. For the y values, copy the formula in cell B43 and insert a minus sign in front of it so that it reads now "" =-SQRT(100+(100/64)*(A34+1)^2)+1"" when you copy and paste it into cell B34 down to B64, adjusting the cell reference as it goes. Make a copy of cell B34, place a space in front of it and paste it to C34, then left-align it.
Make columns C and D 16.17 units wide. Input y of Asymptote1 into cell C1 and y of Asymptote2 into cell D1. Enter into cell C2 the formula w/o quotes ""=5/4*A2+9/4"" and enter into D2 w/o quotes the formula ""=-5/4*A2-1/4"". Copy C2:D2 and Paste to C3:D32.

Select in the Plot Area of the Chart and do menu item Chart Add Data and in response to the data query, respond with A34:B64. This may not occur correctly, sp just edit the series formula in the formula bar until it reads =SERIES(""Hyperbola"",Hyperbola!$A$2:$A$64,Hyperbola!$B$2:$B$64,1) and make sure there's an empty data set at A33:B33 and that in menu item Chart Source Data you have Show empty cells as gaps.

Select in the Plot Area of the Chart and do menu item Chart Add Data and in response to the data query, respond with the (x,y) pairs you just input. They may not ""land correctly"" and so require editing in the formula bar -- just edit them until they appear as given above, eg. Series 3 should be ""=SERIES(""Vertices"",Hyperbola!$F$9:$F$10,Hyperbola!$G$9:$G$10,3)"" and notice how I've typed in the title ""Vertices"" at the beginning of the series description -- do that for each series, please, so that they appear correctly in the Legend.
Format the Vertices with a thin brown line and Size 8 red markers. Format the Center as a large Light Blue Dot and the Foci as Large Black squares.
Add data labels with both x and y if you prefer, as the chart above demonstrates, though it gets a bit crowded. Use font size 8 or 9.
Move the Legend to the top of the Chart.
Copy the Chart and Data with Grabber and save paste to a Paster worksheet to save your work and then save the workbook.

Your chart should now resemble this one, except that I did Copy Picture including the data section and did Paste Picture onto the 'Saves' worksheet, then copied that and opened it in Preview in order to save it as a jpg file:







,
B(t) = (1-t)*+ t*, where t is an element in the range , inclusive, which can be interpreted as the linear interpolant of corresponding points in the linear Bézier curves from P0 to P1 and from P1 to P2 respectively.
Rearranging the preceding equation algebraically gives:
B(t) = (1-t)^2*P0 + 2*(1-t)*t*P1 + t^2 * P2, where t is an element in the range , inclusive.
The derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to t is
B´(t) = 2*(1-t)*(P1 - P0) + 2*t*(P2 - P1), from which it can be concluded that the tangents to the curve at P0 and P2 intersect at P1.
As t increases from 0 to 1, the curve departs from P0 in the direction of P1, then bends to arrive at P2 from the direction of P1.
The second derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to t is:
B´´(t) = 2*(P2 - 2*P1 + P0].
A quadratic Bézier curve is also a parabolic segment. As a parabola is a conic sector, some sources refer to quadratic Béziers as ""conic arcs"".
Enter the sub headers and formulas which create the chart:

Except for some Data Marker Styles and Fill and perhaps a few other details, your chart should resemble this one:






,
The curve starts at P0 going toward P1 and arrives at P3 coming from the direction of P2. Usually, it will not pass through P1 or P2; these points being there only to provide directional information.
The distance between P0 and P1 determines ""how long"" the curve moves into direction P2 before turning towards P3.
Writing BPiPjPk(t) for the quadratic Bézier curve defined by points Pi, Pj and Pk, the cubic Bézier curve can be defined as a linear combination of two quadratic Bézier curves.
B(t) = (1-t)*BP0,P1,P2(t) + t*BP1,P2,P3(t), with t as an element in the range , inclusive.
For some choices of P1 and P2, the curve may intersect itself, or contain a cusp.
Any series of 4 distinct points can be converted to a cubic Bézier curve that goes through all 4 points in order.
Given the starting and ending point of some cubic Bézier curve, and the points along the curve corresponding to t = 1/3 and t = 2/3, the control points for the original Bézier curve can be recovered.
The derivative of the cubic Bézier curve with respect to t is
B´(t) = 3*(1-t)^2 * + 6*(1-t)*t*(P2 - P1) + 3*t^2 *(P3 - P2).
The second derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to t is:
B´´(t) = 6*(1-t)*(P2 - 2*P1 + P0) + 6*t*(P3 - 2*P2 + P1).

Use a character map.,
A second approach is to create symbols using a XML-based language called MathML (Mathematical Markup Language), which then requires a MathML ""plug-in"" to be installed to a browser to display the symbol.",How to Add Math Symbols in Online Assessments," To deal with this limitation simply, instructors resort to turning symbols and equations into image files (e.g., gif) which can then be displayed by browsers.









In Windows, go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> System Tools -> Character Map to insert special math symbols.
Then, make use of free built-in Paint in Windows Accessories to convert the mathematics equations with special symbols to images.

Consider an arithmetic sequence such as 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, ....;
,
Since each term is 3 larger than the previous, it can be expressed as a recurrence as shown.

,
Recognize that any recurrence of the form an = an-1 + d is an arithmetic sequence.

,
Write the closed-form formula for an arithmetic sequence, possibly with unknowns as shown.

,
Solve for any unknowns depending on how the sequence was initialized.",How to Solve Recurrence Relations1,",,,, In this case, since 5 was the 0th term, the formula is an = 5 + 3n. If instead, you wanted 5 to be the first term, you would get an = 2 + 3n.

Find two envelopes, ideally one slightly larger than the other.,
Write your mailing address in the center of the first envelope.,
Affix sufficient postage to the envelope.,
Write the receiver’s address in the center of the second envelope.,
Include your address in the upper left corner of the envelope.,
Stick sufficient postage to the envelope.,
Put the smaller envelope in the larger envelope.,
Mail your envelopes.,
Wait eagerly for your response.",How to Send an S.A.S.E. (Self Addressed Stamped Envelope)," Unless you’re sending several documents or a manuscript, you can use regular envelopes. For instance, you can use a #10 envelope for your larger envelope, and a #9 for the smaller one. Make sure both envelopes are large enough for whatever you want to send and receive. Usually, the receiver will specify the size of the envelope if it needs to be larger than a regular envelope.


Browse local stationery stores, copy centres and mailing stores to find a set envelopes best suited for this process. Feel free to ask an employee for help, specifying that you’re looking to send an S.A.S.E.;
, This is the envelope that will be returned to you by the receiver, hence why your address goes in the center. Make sure you don't seal it! The receiver will seal it after they insert whatever you were asking for (or to return whatever you submitted).

, If both you and the receiver are in the US, you’ll need a First Class Mail stamp. As long as the envelope is under 6 ⅛” in height, 11 ½” in length and 13oz in weight, this stamp is sufficient.If you’re outside the US but your receiver isn’t, you’ll need to use a Forever International Stamp on this envelope. This will allow the receiver to send your S.A.S.E. back to you no matter where you are.
If the receiver is outside the US, you’ll need to get sufficient postage from their postal service to send you the letter. You’ll have to research the kind of postage needed with the receiver’s postal service.

, This is the envelope containing your S.A.S.E., and the postal service will read the address here as the destination of your letter.

, This is the spot reserved for a return address. Writing your address here ensures the envelopes are returned to you if they end up lost in the mail or you use insufficient postage.

, If you’re sending your S.A.S.E. within the US, you’ll only need to use a First Class Mail stamp. This allows shipment throughout the US as long as the envelope follows the sizing requirements mentioned above.


If you’re sending your S.A.S.E. internationally from the US, you’ll need a Forever International Stamp on this envelope, which allows a letter to be sent from the US internationally.
If you’re sending your S.A.S.E. from outside the US, ask your postal service for advice on what constitutes significant postage.

, After both envelopes have been appropriately stamped, the first envelope has become the S.A.S.E. Place it within the second envelope. Seal the second envelope.


If using two envelopes of the same size, you can fold your S.A.S.E. in thirds before placing it into the other envelope.
It's fine to write a note to the receiver and enclose it in the larger envelope along with the smaller envelope. They might ask you to do this if they need specific details from you.

, Now that you’ve prepared your envelopes for mailing, you can send them like you would any other letter. You can simply drop them off in the nearest mailbox. You can go to your local post office if you have any questions or concerns on the mailing of your S.A.S.E.

, If you sent your S.A.S.E. domestically, expect it to take 4-6 weeks for anything to come back to you. This accounts for post office transit time as well as for time for the recipient company to process your request. If you sent your envelope internationally, expect more of a delay.

Consider a geometric sequence such as 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ....

,
Since each term is twice the previous, it can be expressed as a recurrence as shown.

,
Recognize that any recurrence of the form an = r * an-1 is a geometric sequence.

,
Write the closed-form formula for a geometric sequence, possibly with unknowns as shown.

,
Solve for any unknowns depending on how the sequence was initialized.",How to Solve Recurrence Relations2,",,,, In this case, since 3 was the 0th term, the formula is an = 3*2n. If instead, you wanted 3 to be the first term, you would get an = 3*2(n-1).

"
"
Consider the sequence 5, 0, -8, -17, -25, -30, ... given by the recursion an = an-1 + n2 - 6n.

,
Any recursion of the form shown, where p(n) is any polynomial in n, will have a polynomial closed form formula of degree one higher than the degree of p.

,
Write the general form of a polynomial of the required degree.,
Since a general cubic has four unknown coefficients, four terms of the sequence are required to solve the resulting system.,
Either Solve the resulting system of deg(p)+2 equations in deg(p)=2 unknowns or Fit a Lagrange polynomial to the deg(p)+2 known points.,
Present the closed formula for an as a polynomial with known coefficients.

",How to Solve Recurrence Relations3,",, In this example, p is quadratic, so we will need a cubic to represent the sequence an.

, Any four will do, so let's use terms 0, 1, 2, and 3. Running the recurrence backwards to find the -1th term might make some calculations easier, but isn't necessary.

,


If the zeroth term was one of the terms you used to solve for the coefficients, you get the constant term of the polynomial for free and can immediately reduce the system to deg(p)+1 equations in deg(p)+1 unknowns as shown.

This is the first method capable of solving the Fibonacci sequence in the introduction, but the method solves any recurrence where the nth term is a linear combination of the previous k terms.,
Write the characteristic polynomial of the recurrence.,
Solve the characteristic polynomial.,
Any expression of the form shown satisfies the recursion.,
Find the ci that satisfy the specified initial conditions.,
Solve the resulting system of equations.

,
Plug the resulting constants into the general formula as the solution.

",How to Solve Recurrence Relations4," So let's try it on the different example shown whose first terms are 1, 4, 13, 46, 157, ....

, This is found by replacing each an in the recurrence by xn and dividing by x(n-k) leaving a monic polynomial of degree k and a nonzero constant term.

, In this case, the characteristic has degree 2 so we can use the quadratic formula to find its roots.

, The ci are any constants and the base of the exponents are the roots to the characteristic found above. This can be verified by induction.


If the characteristic has a multiple root, this step is modified slightly. If r is a root of multiplicity m, use (c1rn + c2nrn + c3n2rn + ... + cmnm-1rn) instead of simply (c1rn). For example, the sequence starting 5, 0, -4, 16, 144, 640, 2240, ... satisfies the recursive relationship an = 6an-1 - 12an-2 + 8an-3. The characteristic polynomial has a triple root of 2 and the closed form formula an = 5*2n - 7*n*2n + 2*n2*2n.

, As with the polynomial example, this is done by creating a linear system of equations from the initial terms. Since this example has two unknowns, we need two terms. Any two will do, so take the 0th and 1st to avoid having to raise an irrational number to a high power.

Consider the sequence 2, 5, 14, 41, 122 ... given by the recursion shown.,
Write the generating function of the sequence.,
Manipulate the generating function as shown.,
Find the generating function A(x).

,
Find the coefficient of the xn in A(x).,
Write the formula for an by identifying the coefficient of xn in A(x).

",How to Solve Recurrence Relations5," This cannot be solved by any of the above methods, but a formula can be found by using generating functions.

, A generating function is simply a formal power series where the coefficient of xn is the nth term of the sequence.

, The objective in this step is to find an equation that will allow us to solve for the generating function A(x). Extract the initial term. Apply the recurrence relation to the remaining terms. Split the sum. Extract constant terms. Use the definition of A(x). Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

,, The methods for doing this will vary depending on exactly what A(x) looks like, but the method of partial fractions, combined with knowing the generating function of a geometric sequence, works here as shown.

The employees in those stores will be able to help you send a registered letter as well.;
, There, you’ll find a wide variety of forms for the different mailing services offered by the USPS. Feel free to ask a post office employee if you need help finding the right form — PS Form 3806, in this case.


If you want to skip hunting around for the form at the post office, you can download PS 3806 directly from the USPS website here.

, There are two types: one for domestic registered mail, and another for international mailings. Be sure to review the form carefully before filling it out.


If there’s a long line, it’s best to enter the line while filling out the form. By the time you’ve finished, you’ll have moved along quite a ways.
If the line is short, or if there is no line, fill out the form at the table so you don’t inconvenience the people around you by holding up the line.

, The cost of sending registered mail has risen in the past few years, but will likely be slightly above $10.


The post office accepts cash, credit and debit cards, and checks (with appropriate ID).
The employee should provide you with a receipt of transaction, but if they forget, don’t be too shy to ask for it — it’s the whole reason you’re paying for this service! The receipt will prove exactly when the letter was sent, so you can’t be held accountable if it doesn’t reach its intended recipient.

, The USPS offers insurance up to $25,000 for registered mail. Rates will vary depending on how much insurance you want to purchase.

, This will help reduce any complications with illegible handwriting, since you won’t be there to answer any questions when the postal worker enters the information into their system. Be sure to review the form carefully before printing.

, Make sure the ink levels are healthy enough to deliver a clearly legible form.


PS Form 3806 should be printed in black and white ink, and Label 200 should be printed in color, so as to be nearly identical to the official label used by the Postal Service.
Label 200 must be printed on either 1) white OCR bond, 20-pound basis weight paper (17 inches × 22 inches) with little to no fluorescence or 2) Smudge-proof Litho Label, 50-pound basis weight paper (17 inches × 22 inches), with general-purpose, permanent-type, pressure-sensitive adhesive coating on the back.
Label 200 must be printed on adhesive paper that sticks to the letter directly. Don’t try to tape the label to the package being mailed.

, Make sure it doesn’t bend over the corners of the letter, as this might make it difficult to read some of the information on it or scan its barcode.

Place a tea kettle on the stove.,
Place the envelope seal in the steam.,
Use an envelope opener to lift the flap.,
Let the envelope dry.,
Reseal the envelope.",How to Secretly Open a Sealed Envelope1," Boil water in a tea kettle until steam begins to shoot through the spout. The steam is what you'll use to loosen the glue in the envelope you want to open. Keep in mind that the steam method can get a little messy and potentially warp the paper, so if it's imperative that the envelope looks fresh and new, you might want to just use a new envelope instead.


If the steam is coming out in a strong, steady stream, stick a spoon in the spout to diffuse it. That way it won't be as likely to warp the paper with a thick stream of moist heat.
If you don't have a tea kettle, simply boil a small pot of water until it produces steam.;
, Steam is hot, so you'll probably want to use a pair of tongs or an oven mitt to hold the seal of the envelope under the steam so your hand doesn't get burned. Hold the envelope there for about 20 seconds to give the steam time to loosen the glue.If your envelope is a long business-sized envelope, run the entire thing over the stream of steam to make sure each portion of the glue gets loosened.
Don't hold the envelope in the steam for more than 20 seconds, or the paper will begin to warp.

, Lay the envelope on a table and carefully run an envelope opener under the flap to loosen it. Open the flap so that you can remove the contents of the envelope. You want to open the envelope slowly enough that you don't accidentally rip it, but quickly enough that the glue doesn't begin to reseal.


If the flap doesn't seem to be giving, and it tears slightly instead of easily lifting, place it back under the steam so you don't end up ripping it.

, After you've finished removing and replacing the contents of the envelope, let the envelope get completely dry before you seal it back up. In order to prevent wrinkling, lay a sheet of waxed paper over the envelope and put a heavy book on top. Pressing the envelope flat while it dries will keep it looking fresh.


You could also iron the envelope flat to prevent it from wrinkling. If you choose to do this, be sure not to leave the iron on the paper for more than a few seconds, since the concentrated heat can cause the paper to turn yellow or burn if you're not careful.

, The glue will have lost its tackiness after coming into contact with the steam, so you'll have to use a different method to reseal the envelope. To reseal the envelope so that it looks as though it was never opened in the first place, try one of the following techniques:


Use a gluestick. Since the glue in a gluestick is relatively dry, you can use it to reseal the envelope quite discreetly. Apply glue to the edge of the flap and close the envelope. Good as new.
Use a wet glue. White school glue, superglue, or another type of wet glue is fine to use if you don't have a gluestick. Just make sure you use as little as possible, so the envelope doesn't get wrinkled with moisture.

"
"
Place the envelope in a plastic freezer bag.,
Place the envelope in the freezer for several hours.,
Open the envelope.,
Reseal the envelope.",How to Secretly Open a Sealed Envelope2," Protecting the envelope from ice and moisture is essential, since these elements can cause it to warp. When an envelope gets wrinkled, it's a dead giveaway that it was tampered with.

, The very cold temperature in the freezer will cause the glue to lose its stick. You can keep it in the freezer for as long as you need to. Make sure it's in there for at least a few hours, or the glue might hold fast when you try to open the envelope.In order for this method to work, you must use the freezer, not the refrigerator. The refrigerator's temperature isn't cold enough to make the glue unstick.
If you don't have a freezer available, try placing the envelope in a plastic bag, then submerging it in a bowl full of ice water. This is quite risky, since a leak in the bag could cause water to flow inside and ruin the envelope and its contents.

, After a few hours in the freezer, you might be able to simply open the envelop with your fingers. If it doesn't easily pop open, use an envelope opener or a knife to gently open the flap. If the flap still won't budge, put the envelope back in the freezer overnight and try again., When you use the freezer method, the frozen glue loses its stick, but it gets tacky again when it thaws. To reseal the envelope, simply wait a few minutes for the envelope to warm up to room temperature, then press the flap shut. The envelope should now be sealed with no sign that it was ever opened.


If the flap won't stick when you try to reseal it, use a gluestick to keep it shut.
If you don't have a gluestick, use a very light application of white school glue or superglue to close it.

"
Use a sticker seal.,
Use a self-sealing envelope.,
Use a wax seal.,
Use tape or glue.,
Use nail polish.",How to Secure an Envelope1," Placing a seal over the envelope flap is a great way to provide some extra security. Seals specifically designed for envelopes will be difficult to remove and place back on. Therefore, if someone does open the envelope, the broken seal will be proof.


You can find these seals at any office supply store. A regular sticker won’t stick to the paper as well as a postal seal.;
, Envelopes with a clasp, strip removal, or string are less likely to open on their own. They can be found at an office supply store.


These envelopes may still be opened intentionally so you’ll want another security mechanism if you’re concerned about this.

, A very old-fashioned way of securing envelopes is to drip melted wax over the flap and let it dry. A wax seal will make it virtually impossible to open the envelope without ripping it. You can find sealing wax at any stationary store and most office supply stores.Most sealing wax comes in bars with a wick in the middle, much like a candle. Light the wick and hold the bar over the flap until a small amount of wax accumulates. The appropriate amount of wax should be able the size of a quarter.
Some sealing wax comes in small pellets. Place one in a microwave-safe dish and nuke it for about 30 second. Then slowly drip it over the flap.
You could also purchase a seal stamp that leaves a distinctive shape in the wax.

, If you don’t have a seal, you can use scotch or masking tape to secure the envelope. Double-sided tape is most ideal.You can also use any household adhesive like rubber cement or crafts glues.


If you only have one-sided tape, fold it back on itself so that the sticky side is pointing out.

, A lesser known solution is to apply nail polish to the adhesive strip rather than licking it or wetting it with a sponge. Nail polish won’t wear off if someone tries to steam the envelope open. Use the brush that comes with the nail polish to gloss a thin layer over the adhesive strip.

"
"
Wrap the content in paper.,
Use a security envelope.,
Use two envelopes.",How to Secure an Envelope2," Take a plain piece of paper and place the letter, check, or whatever else you’re mailing in the middle. Fold the paper into three or four parts, depending on the size of the envelope.


A similar option is to place your content inside a greeting card and then place the card in the envelope., Security envelopes will have a lining substance that makes it more opaque. These envelopes usually have unique colored patterns.They can be found at any stationary store or office supply store and should only be a dollar or so more expensive than regular envelopes.

, Another simple way to prevent people from reading through the envelope is to use two. In addition to your regular envelope, get another one with slightly larger dimensions and place the first one inside of it.

"
"
Consider the old-fashioned method if you only have one or two envelopes to seal.,
Lick the envelope.,
Seal the envelope.",How to Seal an Envelope1," Old-fashioned licking is the most common method, as long as you don't have too many envelopes to seal. It can be cumbersome and inefficient if you're handling a large number of envelopes at once.


Contrary to urban legend, envelope glue is not toxic—it’s composed primarily of gum arabic, an ingredient found in a number of common foods. Even if you cut your tongue on the edge of the envelope, the glue won’t sneak in and kill you. ;
, Swipe your tongue carefully across the seal of the envelope.

, Fold the flap down, and then run your fingers over the top to set it in place. The wetness from your tongue will moisten the glue on the seal, allowing it to bond with the paper of the envelope when sealed.

"
"
Use conventional envelope moisteners.,
Use a combination moistener/sealer machine.,
Try a vintage envelope moistening wheel.",How to Seal an Envelope2," These are typically plastic bottles topped with a small sponge and are available at most office supply stores. To use this type of envelope moistener:


Hold the bottle vertically, sponge-end down, and run it along the strip of envelope glue while gently squeezing.
Be careful not to squeeze the bottle too much, or you may over-moisten the envelope and leave it sodden or puckered.
This method is more efficient when you need to seal a large number of envelopes at once (making it useful for sending out wedding invitations, holiday cards, etc.), but it can become messy if you squeeze the bottle too enthusiastically.

, These represent the latest in envelope-sealing technology and will both moisten and seal your envelopes for you. Electric moistener/sealer machines will automatically feed envelopes through, while manual machines must be hand-fed, potentially making them as labor intensive as other, lower-tech methods.


Because these are a relatively new technology, they’re not without their glitches, and some models may work better than others. Be sure to do your research before investing.

, If you prefer an old-school approach, you can find envelope moistening wheels online and in stores specializing in vintage office equipment. Most are ceramic and feature a cylindrical wheel perched in a rectangular basin, which makes them rather resemble an office tape dispenser. To use one, fill the basin with water, run the envelope’s glue strip across the top of the moistened wheel (like running a knife blade over a whetting stone), and fold and press the envelope flap to seal. Though a bit old-fashioned, these envelope moisteners have the advantage of durability—the ceramic wheel won’t disintegrate as sponges do.

"
"
Use a sponge, q-tip, or cotton swab to help you moisten your envelopes.,
Use tape or glue.,
Use stickers.,
Seal it with nail polish.,
Make a wax seal.",How to Seal an Envelope3," This approach will spare your tongue and may allow you to seal a larger number of envelopes than the tongue alone could handle. To use this method, get a small bowl and fill it with warm water. Lightly moisten your sponge, q-tip, or cotton swab in the water and swipe it across the glue of the seal. Fold the moistened flap and press down on it to seal the envelope. But be judicious with the amount of water you moisten with. Start light and re-apply if necessary—if you over-moisten, the paper may become soggy or begin to pucker.

, You can simply tape the envelope shut by folding the flap of the envelope down and running a strip of regular tape across the top. For a less DIY-look, you can use double-sided tape or glue along the inside of the flap before folding down and sealing. Many prefer to use a glue stick over traditional liquid glue because it’s less messy and dries more quickly, but both are viable options.

, If you want to add a little unconventional personality to your envelope, you can seal it with stickers—just fold the flap down and place stickers across the line where the flap and body of the envelope meet. But be aware that stickers may not leave the most professional of impressions and may be less secure than other methods.

, Nail polish, it turns out, is one of the great household multi-taskers,and one of its lesser-known qualities is its ability to save you trouble sealing envelopes—and to offer a particularly strong and secure hold while doing it. Just swipe the nail polish along the inside of the envelope flap and press it shut. You might want to opt for clear nail polish to avoid giving the envelope’s seal an odd color—unless, of course, that’s the look you’re going for.

, Dating from the Middle Ages, the use of wax to seal envelopes is perhaps the most classic and impressive of all the envelope-sealing methods. For hundreds of years the use of wax seals was almost exclusively limited to royalty and nobility (given that most everyone else was illiterate and didn’t have much use for letters), and today it carries with it an air of prestige that will likely impress your recipient. As a bonus, sealing an envelope with wax can give you a dignified reason to melt things with fire. See How to Use Sealing Wax with a Glue Gun and How to Use Sealing Wax with a Melting Pot.

Include the appropriate postage.",How to Put an Address on an Envelope (Great Britain)1," Some countries have varying conventions on where to write the address on an envelope. In Great Britain, the address is positioned in the bottom left corner on the front of the envelope. When positioning the first line, be sure to plan ahead so that you leave enough room for the next lines of text. You should also plan to leave a generous margin of about 1/2 an inch (1.3 cm) around the entire address., As you begin to write the address out on the envelope, be sure to left align all of the text in each line. Some countries prefer that the address is centered, both in placement on the envelope and the alignment of the text, but in Great Britain the correct format is for all of the address lines to be aligned against the left address margin., In order for the envelope to be processed properly, you want to make sure that the mail carrier can read the address clearly. If you are handwriting the address, use a pen or ink that is clear against the color of the envelope. Do not use pencil or anything that could be easily smudged or rubbed off during the journey. If you are printing an address label, be sure to use a font that is easy to read and a color that stands out against the label. For both handwritten and printed addresses, make to size the text so it can be ready easily, with a text size comparable to a font size of 10 - 15., Be sure to include their first name and surname, spelling each correctly. For close friends and family members it is a personal preference whether you include titles with the name; however, for any other recipient you should specify titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Ms., Miss, Dr., etc.). If you are sending the envelope to a person at a specific organization, you should include the name of the organization in a separate line underneath their name., If the place you are mailing the envelope to has an official building number or property name, like “Building J49” or “Victoria House,” include this underneath the recipient’s name and drop the property number and street name to the next line. If the property does not have a full name, simply include the property number and the name of the street, or “thoroughfare” as it’s called in Great Britain., There are three types of localities in Great Britain, and in order for mail to get sorted properly the post town has to be included. There are two other locality elements that you can include as well, but only the post town is required. Each element needs to be included on separate lines. Each locality should be written in normal letter case, except for the post town, which should be all uppercase letters. You do not need to include the county name. For example:Locality line 1 is the double dependent locality (i.e., the neighborhood or borough): Otterley
Locality line 2 is the dependent locality (i.e., the town or civil parish): Hedge End
Locality line 3 (or line 1 since it is the only one required) is the post town (i.e., the county town): OXFORD

, The postcode aids in the sorting and delivery of mail and is similar to zip code in the United States. Like the post town, the postcode should be written in all capital letters. You should also include two spaces between the two parts of the post code (e.g., BH1 1AA). Since you are sending the envelope from a Great Britain address to a recipient in Great Britain, you should not include a destination country. The postcode should be the final line in the address..


If you don't know the postcode, you can look it up on the Royal Mail website: http://www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode


, A return address is an address that the post office uses to send the mail back to in case there is a reason the envelope could not be delivered. Even if you include all the elements of the address correctly, it is still a good idea to always include a return address when you mail something. In Great Britain, the return address is written on the back of the envelope (the side with the flap) in a center position with the text left aligned. You need to include all of the same elements as the front address, except the first line here should read “Return Address” with all the other lines coming after that., Postage is always required to send any envelope in the mail. The appropriate amount of postage depends on the size and weight of the envelope or parcel you are sending, with larger, heavier packages costing more money. The postage should always be included on the front of the envelope in the top right corner so that the mail carrier can read the address and confirm the shipping was paid for at the same time.


If you are not sure how much postage you need, you can look it up on the Royal Mail website: http://www.royalmail.com/personal/uk-delivery/stamps

Once you are sure they are lined up, use your finger to crease the fold carefully.

, Now take the top part of the letter and fold it downwards so that there is about half an inch (about 1 cm) of space between the bottom crease and the top (folded down) edge of the letter.Again, use your envelope as a guide if you aren’t sure. When your envelope is lying underneath the letter you can check to make sure that it will fit inside by lining up the top and bottom creases of the letter with the top and bottom of the envelope.

, Don’t forget to line up the top part of the fold with the edges of the page. This will give you a nice clean and straight fold.You can hold a ruler sideways between your fingers and slide the thin edge of the ruler along the paper to create a flat and crisp crease if you want to.

, Take the letter so that the folds face outward, and the top fold coincides with the top of the envelope. Hold the envelope so that the flap of the envelope faces you, and opens towards you. Place the letter carefully into the envelope so as not to dent the page.The recipient should be able to remove the letter and open it without having to turn it right-side up to read it.

Position the address correctly on the envelope.,
Left align all address elements.,
Use good penmanship and indelible ink.,
Write the name of the recipient on the first line.,
On the next line write the property number and street name.,
Include the name of the locality and the postcode on the next line(s).,
Write the country name as the last line.,
Include a return address.,
Include the appropriate postage.",How to Put an Address on an Envelope (Great Britain)2," Since you are sending an envelope from Great Britain to an international recipient, you should still position the address per Great Britain’s requirements. This means that the address should be positioned in the bottom left corner on the front of the envelope. When positioning the first line, be sure to plan ahead so that you leave enough room for the several lines of text, including a line for the country. You should also plan to leave a margin of about 1/2 an inch (1.3 cm) around the entire address., While some countries prefer that the address is centered, both in placement on the envelope and the alignment of the text, you still want to stick with Great Britain’s conventions for formatting. In Great Britain the correct format is for all of the address lines to be aligned against the left address margin., International mail has a long journey, so you want to make sure the address remains clear in order for it to be processed properly. When handwriting the address, use a pen with permanent ink in a color that is clear against the color of the envelope. Do not use pencil or anything that could be easily smudged or rubbed off during processing. If you are printing an address label, choose a font that is easy to read and use a color that stands out against the label. For both handwritten and printed addresses, size the text so it can be ready easily, with a text size comparable to a font size of 10 - 15., Be sure to include their first name and surname, spelling each correctly. Because it is international mail you should include a title with the name even for close friends and family members. If you are sending the envelope to a person at a specific organization, you should include the name of the organization in a separate line underneath their name. Some country-specific things to remember when writing out the name:Remember some countries use alternative titles (e.g., Herr or M. vs. Mr., Sra or Mme vs. Mrs., Mlle vs. Miss, etc.).
When addressing mail to France or Monaco, write the recipient’s surname in CAPITAL letters (e.g., M. Robert MARIN).

, If the place you are mailing the envelope to has an official building number or property name, like “U.S. Embassy” or “Paris-Sorbonne University,” include this underneath the recipient’s name and drop the street name and property number to the next line. If the property does not have a full name, simply include the property number and the name of the street. Keep the following in mind when writing the street address for other countries:For most countries outside of the United States, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand, the house number is written after the street name (e.g., “Rue du Diamant 215” instead of “215 Rue du Diamant).
If you don't know the correct order for the country you are sending the envelope to, you can look it up on the Royal Mail website: http://www.royalmail.com/personal/international-delivery/country-guides


, There are three types of localities: the double dependent locality, the dependent locality, and the post town. For most international mail, the address is only required to have the post town and postcode included, this time on the same line. If you need or want to include other locality elements, such as the state or province, they should go above the post town and postcode line, which should always be the second to last line for international mail. The post town and any letters in the postcode (if applicable) should all be written in capital letters, with other locality information written in normal case. Keep the following in mind when writing these elements for other countries:Some countries like Germany require the postcode to come before the post town.
Countries like Portugal require the province to be included in brackets after the post town.
Australia and the United States require the state abbreviation to be inserted between the post town and postcode.
For a full list of country-specific requirements for post towns and postcodes, look it up on the Royal Mail website: http://www.royalmail.com/personal/international-delivery/country-guides


, As a requirement for international mail, the destination country must be included on the last line of the address. For all countries, this must be written in in capital letters. This line should not contain any other information and needs to be spelled correctly. Do not abbreviate the country. For example, write out “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” instead of “U.S.” or “USA.”, In case the envelope needs to be sent back to you, a return address should be included with all international mail. It is not a requirement, but international mail is complicated, and sometimes mail is returned even if you include all of the address elements correctly. Since you are sending the mail from Great Britain, follow the convention of including the return address on the back of the envelope (the side with the flap). Position the return address in the center of the envelope with the text left aligned. You need to include all of the same elements as the front address, except the first line here should read “Return Address.” Be sure to also include your country in all capital letters as the last line in the return address., Postage is always required to send any envelope in the mail, but there are sometimes special requirements for sending international mail, like customs labels. The appropriate amount of postage depends on the size and weight of the envelope or parcel you are sending, with larger, heavier packages costing more money. Include the postage on the front of the envelope in the top right corner so that the mail carrier can read the address and confirm the shipping was paid for at the same time.


If you are not sure how much postage you need for international mail, or you want to check if a customs label is needed, look it up on the Royal Mail website: http://www.royalmail.com/personal/uk-delivery/stamps

Make sure you have formatted the letter correctly.,
Fold the letter into a “z fold.” To take advantage of the window of the envelope, you will need to fold the letter so that the recipient’s name and address face outwards.This version of folding doesn’t afford the same privacy as folding the letter inwards, but it must be folded this way if you want the name and address to show through the window.,
Begin with the letter so that the text faces down.,
Arrange the letter so that it is upside down.,
Fold the top down.,
Fold the bottom up.,
Insert the folded letter into the envelope.",How to Fold and Insert a Letter Into an Envelope2," If you are using an envelope that has a see-through “window"" where the recipient’s name and address will show through, it is very important that you have the letter formatted so that this information lines up correctly.To format a business letter, you should first ensure that your margins are set at 1 inch (2.5 cm) on all sides in your word processor. Make sure that you have the text aligned to the left hand side of the page while you are typing the date and the recipient’s address.
The letter should be single spaced except for in-between paragraphs. Between paragraphs there should be two spaces. The entire letter should be left aligned.
There should be approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) of blank space from the top of the page to the place where you type the first line of text (the date).
Type the date out in full (e.g. April 1, 2016 instead of 4/1/16).
Hit enter two times so that you have a blank space between the date and where you will type the recipient’s information.
Type the full name of the recipient (e.g. Mr. John Doe), hit enter and type the address of the recipient, hit enter again and type the city, state, and zip code of the recipient.
Be sure to include a space between the recipient’s contact information and the salutation.

,
If the letter contains sensitive information, it may be best to use a standard envelope with no window.

, Having the text facing down will make it easier to see where the name and address are when you fold it.If you have done this right, you will not be able to read the text of the letter.

, The letter should be text-side down, but make sure that it is also arranged so that the recipient’s name and address are closest to you.If you have done this right, when you peek underneath the paper, the name and address of the recipient will be the closest thing to you.

, Take the upper third of the paper and fold it down towards you.


If you aren’t sure how far that is, you can also align the envelope under the center of the paper to use as a guide.

, Take the bottom third of the paper and fold it up and away from you.The name and address of the recipient should now be visible to you.

, Take the letter so that the recipient’s information faces the front of the envelope. Insert the letter so that the information shows through the window.If you can’t see the recipient’s information, you might have inserted the letter upside down. Remove the letter and turn it around (the recipient’s information should still face the window).

Check the address.,
Lay the letter on a table.,
Fold the bottom half up.,
Crease the fold.,
Fold the right half of the letter inwards.,
Fold the left half of the letter inwards.,
Turn the letter sideways and insert into the envelope.",How to Fold and Insert a Letter Into an Envelope3," Before folding the letter, make sure that the address on the inside of the letter matches with the one that you have written or printed on the envelope.This will help avoid any mixups.
Don’t forget to check that you’ve signed the letter.

, Make sure that the text is facing up and towards you. This is your last chance to proofread and double check that you haven’t forgotten anything.For example, have you dated the letter? Are there any spelling or grammar mistakes?

, Take the bottom of the letter and fold it so that it is about half an inch (about 1 cm) from the top of the page.You can place the envelope underneath the letter to use as a guide. Make sure that when you have folded the letter up, it is small enough to fit inside the envelope.

, Make sure to line up all the outside edges of the paper before creasing so that you don’t end up with a crooked fold. If the fold is crooked, your letter may not fit into the envelope.Use a ruler to make the crease nice and sharp. You can do this by holding a ruler sideways and using the thin edge. Slide the edge of the ruler along the letter on the creases so they are nice and flat.

, You will now take the right part of the letter and fold it about one third of the way in.Line up the top and bottom edges of the letter and then crease the fold.

, Take the other side of the letter and fold it one third of the way in. This will be the same thing that you did with the right side.Line up the top and bottom of the edges so they are perfectly straight before creasing.

, The last crease you made should go into the bottom of the envelope first. Place it so that the folds face the backside of the envelope.This will make it easy for your recipient to find where to begin unfolding the letter.

"
"
Position the envelope.,
Print your title (Mr., Mrs., Miss, Ms, or title earned in your line of work) and name for the return address.,
Print your street address.,
Print your city, state, and zip code on the third line.,
Print the title and name of the person to whom the mail is being sent.,
The ""attention"" line abbreviation, “ATTN: ” is in all capital letters.,
Know when and how to use the abbreviation “c/o”.,
Write the street address of the recipient.,
Write the city, state, and zip code (or postal code) of the recipient.,
Be prepared with more information for military addresses.,
Determine the correct postage.,
Be aware of different postage rates.,
Place a stamp on your envelope.",How to Label an Envelope," Lay your envelope on a flat surface. Situate the envelope so the envelope flap faces down, towards the surface of the table, and the front of the envelope faces up, towards you.


The envelope should be oriented long ways left to right, not top to bottom.
For example, a standard business envelope measures 4 1/8¨ x 9 1/8¨.When you begin to label your envelope, the 9 1/8¨ length of the envelope should run from your left to right hand.
The front, smooth side of the envelope is where you will write all the information needed to get your envelope to the addressee.;
, The return address is necessary in the event the mail is undeliverable. If the mail cannot reach its intended destination, the postal service will send it back to you at the location indicated by the return address.


The return address is written in the upper-left corner of the envelope and contains three lines of text.
The first line will be your title and name. You should write your complete name legal name.
For example, you can write “Mr. Jeremy H. Doe”, or ""General Harry Smith"". This way, your mail carrier will be able to recognize your name and deliver it to your mailing address by the name indicated on the return address.

, The second line of text in the upper-left corner will include your street address as given to you by the post office.


Remember to include your apartment number, if you have one.#
If you receive mail at a post-office box, print that on the second line.

,


If, for some reason, your city and state information takes up a lot of space (you find yourself writing far out into the middle of the envelope), it is acceptable to write the zip code the fourth line.

, The mailing address indicates your letter's destination and also include at least three lines of text. The first line will be the title and name of the person to whom your letter will be delivered.


Write that person's title and name in the very center of the envelope, i.e., Mr. & Mrs. John Doe, Mrs. Jane Doe, Reverend Sam Holly, General George Patton. Miss or Ms is used for unmarried women. If you do not know a woman's title, then use Ms. It is rude and disrespectful to use Jane Doe, John Doe because it shows a lack of education and respect for others. It does not cost anything to show respect to the person to whom you are writing. You will be writing lines below this title and name, so be sure to start high enough up in the middle of the envelope to leave yourself space.

, For example, if you are sending your letter to an individual at a company, start the first line of the mailing address with the name of the company. For example, “Big Corporation X”.


Write the title and name of the individual to whom you are writing underneath the name of the company with ""ATTN: Mr. John H. Doe, Attorney at Law"". It is different for titled individuals, for example, Mr. James H. Howard, Secretary of State, or a Director.
This helps ensure that your letter will wind up in the correct person's hands instead of getting lost in the company's mail-room. Place: DO NOT OPEN IN MAIL ROOM on the envelope face, or EXCLUSIVE FOR: Director Jeremy A. Applegate.

, You may also consider using the designation “c/o” (which stands for “in care of”) instead of “Attn:”. Use this convention when you are mailing a letter either to a person or business but know that the letter will be handled or delivered by an intermediary.


For example, if you are applying for a job, you will want to address your letter to the head of the hiring committee, but the advertisement may include the name of the administrative assistant who handles the applications. In this case, the first line of the mailing address will indicate the name of the head of the hiring committee, and the second line will read “c/o Mr. J. Doe (the administrative assistant)”.
You may also use “c/o” when you are trying to send a letter to a person whose address you do not have, but when you do have the address of someone you believe will be able to forward the letter.
For example, if you do not have the current mailing address of a childhood friend, but do know where her mother lives, you can mail the letter to her mother. The first line will include the friend's name, the second line will read “c/o Mother's Name”, and you will then include the mother's address below that.

, Once you have filled in the name of the letter's recipient, you will print the street address to which the letter will be delivered.


Print this immediately below the name. This will be the second or the third line of the mailing address, depending upon whether you had a second line with “Attn:” or “c/o”.
Be sure to include the complete address, including any relevant apartment or suite numbers.
Also be sure to include any directions, such as NW (for northwest); many towns and cities have multiple streets with the same name which are only distinguished by these directionals., This information is the last line of the address, and appears directly under the street address.


If you are sending mail internationally, you will also need to include the country to which your letter is being delivered. This does not need to be included if you are mailing domestically.

, If you are sending a letter to a military address, be sure to include all relevant information.This includes the full name of the recipient (including either the middle name or middle initial), the PSC number, unit number, or ship name.
Instead of writing the city name, include instead APO (Air/Army Post Office), FPO (Fleet Post Office), or DPO (Diplomatic Post Office).
The state should be replaced with AA, AE, or AP.
Finally, the zip code should include the full ZIP+4.

, Postage is required to send mail through the postal services in most countries. If you are using a standard business envelope, you will most likely only need one stamp to mail your letter.


Currently, stamps are $0.49 each. One stamp is sufficient for a letter that does not exceed one ounce in weight.If your letter weighs more than one ounce, you will either need to affix an additional stamp, or better yet, you should take it to a local post office to be weighed. You can then pay the exact postage needed.
You can also calculate your required postage by going to the United States Postal Service's website.

, Postage rates do change fairly frequently. If you haven't mailed a letter in awhile, the old stamps that you have stashed in the back of your desk drawer may be insufficient.


A good way to handle surprise increases in the cost of a stamp is to purchase Forever Stamps. These are non-denominational stamps which once purchased can be used to mail First-Class letters forever—regardless of any subsequent price increases.Currently, a First-Class Mail Forever Stamp is priced at $0.49. Currently, a First-Class Mail International Global Forever Stamp and/or a Postcard Stamp is priced at $1.15.
If you send a lot of letters (and you should consider doing so—writing letters is a lost art!), you should definitely stock up on Forever Stamps.

, The stamp goes in the upper-right corner of the envelope.


Make sure that you do not place your stamp over any part of the mailing address (the mailing address should be centered lower on the envelope, so this shouldn't be a problem).
Make sure as well that you do not write over the stamp.
Of course, if you do not have stamps, or do not have the correct postage, take your addressed envelope to the nearest post office and they will handle it from there.
Double-check that you've included all of the necessary, correct information. You're ready to mail!

Practice the two sounds individually.,
To say 's', place the tip of the tongue just off the ridge behind the teeth.,
To say 't', place the tongue against the alveolar ridge (still at location 4) and stop the air momentarily before opening the mouth into the following vowel.,
Combine the two sounds.,
Add a voiced vowel after this sound.,
Practice words that begin with ""st"", such as stop, stand, stain, stone, stick, and steep.

,
Practice words that have ""st"" in the middle like ""twister"" and ""master"".

,
Practice words that end in ""st"", like ""test"", ""list"", ""last"", ""lost"", ""cost"".

,
Look at your mouth in the mirror while saying these words.",How to Pronounce 'st' in English," The 'st' sound in English is simply a combination of the 's' and the 't' sounds right together.;
, This place is called the alveolar ridge. Without voice, blow through this space so that you get a hissing sound. This is called a fricative.

, The 't' sound is also voiceless.

, Start with the hissing 's' sound and then close the tongue against the ridge momentarily to stop the air and get the 't'.

, Try pronouncing ""sta"" or ""stuh"".

,,,, You may have difficulty pronouncing because of incorrect tongue movements.

"
Try this first to reduce chance of damage.,
Find a tongue depressor or similar tool.,
Poke the tool under the corner flap.,
Be prepared to stop if the flap doesn't give way.,
Hold the envelope down and rock the tool up and down.,
Dampen a cotton swab slightly.,
Press the wet swab over the stuck flap.,
Try other flaps if present.",How to Open a Sealed Envelope1," This method works best on envelopes of thick paper, or envelopes with poorly attached glue, but it's tough to predict whether it will work on a given envelope until you try it out.Although it is not as effective as steaming the envelope open, it has a lower risk of damaging the envelope or its contents, which makes it a good place to start.;
, Some envelopes — but not all of them — can be gently opened using nothing but a flat, curved wooden tool, such as a tongue depressor.


According to an old CIA manual, the tool should have a smooth edge, preferably with a curved, blunt tip.These tools can be made by filing down a piece of wood or an ivory piano key blank, but any flat tool with the shape described should work.

, Look at the corner of the envelope flap for a small opening that hasn't been glued down. Carefully insert the tip of the tongue depressor or other tool into this opening. If the flap is completely sealed, carefully work a wire or other thin object into the corner to create an opening for the tongue depressor.

, Follow the steps below methodically, use slow, small movements. If the paper doesn't respond, or if you hear, feel, or see any tear in the paper, stop and move on to the next step.

, Use your non-dominant hand to hold the envelope flat against the table so it doesn't move. Gently rock the tool in your other hand up and down, applying light pressure to the edge of the envelope flap. If the envelope responds, repeat this technique to unseal the rest of the flap. If it resists, try the next step.

, Pour out a small amount of clean water, preferably distilled, into a bowl or cup. Dip a cotton swab into it, then press the cotton swab against blotting paper or a paper towel to remove excess water. Water can only be used in small amounts to weaken the paper and glue of the envelope flap; too much water can cause the ink to bleed and the paper to tear.


If you have opened the envelope partway, you can fold a piece of blotting paper and stick it under the flap to absorb any excess water., Focus only on the area that you're stuck on. Press down and wait a few seconds for the glue to soften before trying the same lifting technique with the tongue depressor. Repeat until the flap comes loose, or move on to the steam method if it remains stuck.


Never apply water to an area with ink or a stamp over it.
Some types of envelope adhesive are not water-soluble. If you notice no results at all, try the cutting method instead. If you notice minor results but not enough to get the envelope open, try steaming.

, Some envelopes have multiple ""built in"" folds that have been sealed during manufacture. If these respond to this technique, you can sometimes open the envelope at the side instead of the top.


Whichever method you choose, the flap can be sealed again using tiny dabs of glue, spread over the flap with a toothpick. Some envelopes will become sticky again when the glue is slightly dampened.

Practice the sounds individually before you combine them.,
To say 's', place the tip of the tongue just off the ridge behind the teeth.,
To say 'p', bring the lips together (location 2) and stop the air momentarily before opening the mouth into the following vowel.,
Combine the two sounds.,
Add a voiced vowel after this sound.,
Practice words that begin with ""sp"", such as spit, spin, spend, speed and spade.

,
Practice words that have ""sp"" in the middle like ""inspire"" and ""whisper"".

,
Practice words that end in ""sp"", like ""grasp"", ""crisp"" etc.,
Look at your mouth in the mirror while saying these words.,
Practice and use these words as much as you can.

",How to Pronounce 'sp' in English," The 'sp' sound is the same as the individual sounds, but in close succession.;
, This place is called the alveolar ridge. Without voice, blow through this space so that you get a hissing sound. This is called a fricative.

, The 'p' sound is also voiceless.

, Start with the hissing 's' sound and then close your lips momentarily to stop the air and get the 'p'.

, Try pronouncing ""spa"" or ""spuh"".

Turn the envelope so that the front side of the envelope are appearing to face you, and so that it's been slightly turned on one of it's sides.,
Grab the top edge and bottom edge slightly, as you fold over the top side's perforated side till that perforation stops being folded.

,
Pick up the fold, and re-fold it until it reaches the other side and stops.

,
Flatten the perforated sides again, so they are at the same location as when you initially had to open it (laid completely flat).

,
Situate your fingers to pull this perforated side away from the envelope.,
Fold the envelope so that one of the smaller sides have been folded, using the same method as folding the perforation at the top (folding it one way, then reversing course and folding it the opposite, then returning to the midpoint and pulling it away.),
Make sure the finger is not overstretched onto the envelope portion, when pulling these sides.

,
Repeat with the other side of the envelope.

,
Turn this envelope back around again.

,
Push your finger into the crevice made by the envelope's interior.",How to Open an Envelope Having Three Perforated Sides1," (the side containing the return address, the send-to address, and the stamp) appear to face you.);
,,,, Pull this perforated side with your fingers, maintaining that one finger is situated from above the tab, and the next finger below the used finger, is in back of the envelope. (Make sure the finger is not overstretched onto the envelope portion, when pulling these sides.)

,

,,,, Separate the sides of the envelope in the interior of the envelope.

"
Put the envelope in a plastic bag.,
Put the envelope in the freezer for a couple hours.,
Pry the envelope open.,
Seal the envelope again when finished.",How to Open a Sealed Envelope2," This will protect it from moisture while it is in the freezer., Some envelope glues, but not all of them, may become loose and tacky again when frozen.

, Use a blunt, smooth tool such as a tongue depressor or butter knife, or carefully use a penknife. The flap will not come free on its own, but if you're lucky, it will become loose enough to lift without tearing.

, Some envelopes can be sealed again by dampening the glue on the flap with a damp cotton swab. Others may need to be sealed using inconspicuous dabs of glue.

"
"
Use this on envelopes that were licked closed.,
Start with a cup of boiled water.,
Warm a flat opening tool.,
Attempt to open the envelope.,
Try a jet of steam from a kettle.,
Use an iron to smooth the opened envelope if necessary.,
Once back in shape and dry, slip the contents in and re-lick, or use a small dab of glue to secure once more.",How to Open a Sealed Envelope3," This method may not work on self-adhesive envelopes, since the glue used (typically latex) is not water-soluble. If you don't know which type of envelope you're handling, use a small amount of steam to test the method without much risk of damaging the paper and ink.

, Pour boiling water into a narrow cup. This won't produce much steam, but is a recommended starting point for beginners to reduce the risk of damage to the paper. If it doesn't work, the steps below will move on to more powerful, riskier methods.


If the envelope ink looks wet or starts to run, remove from the steam and try another method.

, Warm a tongue depressor, butter knife, or other flat, blunt tool in the steam for ten seconds, then wipe off the water droplets. This prevents the steam on the envelope flap from condensing around a cold tool, which can cause water damage to the paper and ink., Place the warm tool against the corner of the flap. Hold this corner directly in the path of the steam. Move the envelope gently against the tip of the tool, pausing whenever you feel resistance. The tool should stay in place, so the area you're working on always remains in the steam. As you work, rotate the envelope so the freed flap doesn't touch the envelope again and reattach.A smooth, continuous motion is less likely to leave wrinkles, but involves a higher risk of damage if you are not experienced at this task.

, If the gentle steam is not enough to do the job, try keeping a water-filled kettle on to produce a constant jet of hot steam. Repeat the steps above to open the envelope in this hotter steam jet. Move quickly but carefully, as too much steam can wrinkle or dampen the paper.


Wear an oven mitt to protect your hands.
If your kettle doesn't produce a focused jet, stick a spoon or other heat-safe object into the spout to narrow the opening., Wait for the envelope to cool and dry before replacing the contents. If the envelope's paper or its contents become wrinkly after drying, cover with a dry cloth and use an iron on the lowest possible setting over the cloth, to smooth the paper out again.

, You could also try freezing the envelope for a couple hours; some glues will become sticky again once frozen.

Know the risks.,
Hold the envelope in front of the light.,
Cut the corner of the envelope.,
Slice open the short side of the envelope.,
Make a small amount of papier-mâché paste.,
Seal the cut with Papier-mâché once finished.,
Wait for it to dry and repeat if necessary.,
Using fine sandpaper, sand away the rough bits of paste from your envelope.",How to Open a Sealed Envelope4," This is a creative method for hiding a cut in the side, using Papier-mâché paste to seal the opening. If the papier-mâché ends up too thick, too weak, or too sticky, its presence will be obvious. This method is best used on letters that won't be carefully examined or heavily handled. You may also need plenty of time to adjust the papier-mâché seal.

, Hold it up to a bright light or window so you can see the shadow of the document inside. Take a mental note of its position and take care not to disturb the document inside.

, Using a pair of sharp, small scissors, snip off an absolutely tiny corner, preferably the bottom, while ensuring you do not snip the document.

, Cut along the crease of the side of the envelope, not removing any width but effectively opening your envelope. You can now read the document inside, or insert any materials you forgot to include in your mailing list.

, Mix white flour and water together to a fairly runny consistency. Test this on a spare piece of folded paper to see if it will stay stuck together once dried. Add more flour if necessary until the mixture dries strong in a thin layer.


Boiling the flour-water paste will make the mixture dry clear instead of white or off-white, but will also make it weaker.Boiling is crucial for dark-colored envelopes to make the papier-mâché less obvious.

, Using a letter opener or some other smooth-edged instrument, spread the paper mâché paste to the edge of the cut in the envelope. Make sure not to get the document inside wet.

, Wait until fully dry. For a stronger seal, apply a second layer of papier-mâché paste. Repeat until there are no holes visible and the side stays stuck together.

, Work slowly to avoid scratching the envelope itself, especially if there is ink on the edge you're sanding. After the visible paste is removed, the envelope should look like an ordinary envelope that has never been opened.

"
"
Make the top and bottom of the envelope ready, using the ""non-glue like fold and separate"" method above.

,

Change your wrong impression of grammar.,
Forget the myth of listening.,
Speak.,
Learn vocabulary by heart.,
Accept what can't understand.,
Read in English.",How to Learn English if You're a Non Native Speaker," If you're a non-native speaker, chances are your grammar isn't that bad. In fact, you studied a lot of English grammar in your elementary, middle school, and high school. Now the first thing you need to do is to unlearn the bad impression of grammar that you got. Grammar isn't dry, useless, dead, only paper-based, strict, and boring. Quite the contrary! Grammar is fun, practical, dynamic, situation-based, free, and exciting. That is, if your teacher had known how to teach it right. Grammar isn't something you can run away from in English. And grammar isn't some scary, dictatorial monster anyway. You should start seeing grammar as a friend who only gives you guidelines - not rules. In short, real grammar says: ""Do,"" not ""Don't."";
, The myth of listening says that listening is a zero-sum game: either you get it 100% or 0%. This is simply not true. If you're having a hard time making sense of what the other person (maybe a native speaker) is saying, don't be discouraged. More importantly, don't stop listening and thinking! In home economics, there's a saying that goes: ""There won't be a dollar without a cent.""


This is true in listening as well. Just because you can't make sense of what someone is saying in English, you don't have to drop everything and throw away the few things that you do hear. Instead, concentrate on them and gather as much as you can.






Think about the context (the situation around the speaker) and try to connect the separate words that you can catch. Try to fill the gaps that you don't hear. Why? Because, believe it or not, that's what everybody's doing - even the native speakers.







, Speak and speak. Practice! This step is connected to No 1. Because of your wrong way of learning grammar, you have unconsciously developed an aversion to practice and real application. Somehow, you believe that English is a skill that's best used only inside the four corners of your classroom - or quietly by yourself. And because you've undergone years and years of this sort of training, it's a tough habit to break. This step goes deep down to your inner confidence. You've got to learn to surmount the shyness and the voice inside your head that keeps telling you: ""You'll just make a fool of yourself!"". If you can't overcome this, then you won't be able to learn English. Remember: English is a language, a form of communication meant to be practiced together with other people.

, Learning Vocabulary by heart means you should stop cramming your head with the translation of English words in your native language. No matter how many words you memorize everyday - 50, 100, 200! - they're all useless if you don't know what type of word you're learning, how to use it in a sentence etc. Non-native speakers of English are known for mechanically memorizing a lot of information. But in terms of the long-term goals of language-learning, it isn't so much the quantity that counts, only the quality.

, Eventually, you'll have to admit that some expressions and parts of English don't have the perfect grammar explanation that you are looking for. For instance, idioms, infinitives vs. gerunds etc. You'll just waste a lot of time trying to force a logical, iron-clad rule. Of course you should try your best to learn grammar, but keep in mind that grammar doesn't have the answer to everything. In those cases when Grammar doesn't work, start repeating the sentence and expression. Pretty soon you'll realize you're getting comfortable with it and you don't really need a grammar explanation to use it.

, Reading is one of the best ways to learn grammar and vocabulary, and you'll learn more about English culture along the way.

You don't have to read a book. Any text, whether it be a newspaper or an online article, will work.

Start with the official IELTS website.,
Consult your nearest British Consul, as they will provide you many helpful materials for taking the test, or you may like to practice classes for the test.

,
Try to find out your weak points and start working on them (e.g.if you are not so strong in the writing section then you should start with this and eventually you will like it), or if you have difficulties in the speaking section then start to talk and think in English, as there is no better way to learn speaking.,
Start reading newspapers, journals and articles and you should be well informed about the current issues used for the speaking and writing topics.You can discuss those issues with your friends in English as that'll help you to prepare better for both sections-3.

,
Listen to the BBC and CNN, or watch British movies, shows and music.,
Choose an achievable goal.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Increase your personal speed.,
Develop a memory for English.,
Buy the recent books about IELTS such as ""EXAMINATION PAPERS CAMBRIDGE IELTS"" so that you can practice by yourself.",How to Prepare for IELTS," There you will find a lot of information about the test, e.g. the test format, how many sections it has, etc.;
,, If you think in English you will be able to express yourself more naturally.

,, Spend 30 minutes on listening to the BBC news every day if you are not a native speaker.

, To obtain a satisfactory IELTS Band Score, it is necessary to be realistic. Your skill and dedication must match your overall goal for English proficiency. It is important to know what an IELTS score in any of the Sub-tests means before you set yourself a goal.

, Set aside the most hours you can spare each day to practise English for all four Subtests. Do not concentrate only on your weakest areas. Be regular in your practice, and give yourself a rest between tasks. Take at least one day out of your week to rest and forget the test completely.The secret of success is to work towards your goal slowly, steadily and regularly. It is best not to leave any long intervals between your practice and your test.

, In the IELTS, time is your enemy. Candidates who have taken the test and did not perform as well as they had hoped often complain that they were unable to give all the answers in the Listening Test because the tape was too fast, and that they ran out of time in the Reading Test.To begin with, do not worry if you do not finish the tests. Remember, the test is designed to measure candidates over a range of scores from 0 to 9 (0 indicates the test was not attempted). Candidates whose English is near perfect can expect to score 9, but even native English-speaking people would be unlikely to complete every Listening Test answer perfectly or finish the Reading Test a long time before the examination ends.


The Listening, Reading, and Writing Tests are usually given in that order, and are usually held on a single morning. The combined length of those three tests is 2 hours and 30 minutes. (The Speaking Test is conducted at an appointed time in the afternoon.) Only one short break is given between the Reading and Writing Tests, so you need to be at your best for a long period of time, which is why you must sleep and eat well before the test. The hints and guidelines in this article should help you achieve your ""maximum speed"". The more effort you put in, the faster your personal speed will be on the day.

, In the Reading Test, it pays to remember as much as you can of what you have just read, but at least the words can be read again. However, in the Listening Test you cannot go back, and the tape is only played once. If the answer comes before the keyword/phrase, your memory of what you have just heard is even more important. Nevertheless, the answer usually follows the keywords/phrases that you hear, and is close in time to the main keyword/phrase you are listening for.

, If you learn well in a group, YouTube and Facebook can help you in this case. Like the pages (Facebook) and subscribe to the channels (YouTube) related to IELTS. This will help you to manage your budget and lead you to worldwide learning. You can then easily discuss about a point with the people( who are on the same boat) from all over the world. It's fun and effective

Practice the two sounds individually.,
To say 's', place the tip of the tongue just off the ridge behind the teeth.,
To say 'k', bring the back of your tongue (14) up against the roof of your mouth (8, called the wiktionary:velum) so that it stops the air momentarily.

,
Practice the two sounds in close succession.

,
Add a voiced vowel after this sound.,
Practice words that begin with ""sk"", such as ""scam"", ""skip"", ""skin"", ""skid"" etc.

,
Practice words that have ""sc"" in the middle like ""muscular"".

,
Practice words that end in ""sk"", like ""task"", ""desk"", and ""ask"".

,
Look at your mouth in the mirror while saying these words.",How to Pronounce 'sk' in English," The 'sk' sound in English is simply a combination of the 's' and the 'k' sounds right together.;
, This place is called the alveolar ridge. Without voice, blow through this space so that you get a hissing sound. This is called a fricative.

,,, Try pronouncing ""ska"" or ""skuh"".

,,,, You may have difficulty pronouncing because of incorrect tongue movements.

"
"
Familiarize yourself with the alphabet.,
Get a teacher.,
Go online.,
Go to the library.",How to Learn Simple English1," If your native language is Latinate, this will be very easy. If it's not, start with the basic sounds of each letter. There are 26 and there's a song to help you remember.Unlike many Germanic and Romance languages, English letters don't necessarily correlate with one specific sound (this is why English is regarded as one of the hardest languages to learn). Know that the vowels (and certain consonants in certain environments) have two or three sounds, depending on the word. For example, ""A"" sounds different in father, path, and say.;
, Your number one resource will be a real live person that you can ask your questions to. He or she will be able to provide you with material and tasks to improve your skills. They'll also demand that you speak -- a skill that is pretty hard to learn on your own.


Headway, Face2Face, and Cutting Edge are all popular and reputable lines of books.But if you have a teacher, they'll be able to point you to (or even give you) a book that may be more catered to your interests. If you're looking for simple business English or simply conversational English, you may be better off with a book of a narrower focus.
The best teacher is someone who's actually a teacher. Just because someone can speak the language does not mean they'd be a good teacher. Try to find someone who has a bit of experience tutoring or supervising others, if not teaching. It is a skill and, to top it off, more weathered teachers will probably have more resources for you.

, The internet is jam packed with resources to fill your time, bettering your language skills. Any English website is good, but you may find you're happier with ones geared to your abilities. There are many simple English websites or websites for recommended easy reads.


Simple Wikipedia is a great source for information on anything put into language that's easy to understand.With this site, you can study the things that interest you while simultaneously learning English. Breaking News Englishand BBC Learning Englishare good sites for news stories, too.
There are also sites that can give you information on good material. GoodReads has an Easy English shelf that has lists of books that are made just for your level., Sometimes the internet isn't portable (or you just don't want to stare at a screen anymore). Books you can hold in your hands are just as good for learning than the internet. You can read at your discretion and make notes in the margins to ease the path to a bigger vocabulary.


Don't be afraid to start with children's books. The language is short and to the point; what's more, the books are short, too, and good for a squirrel-like attention span. You can start as simple as you want and work your way up the age groups.
If you have a book you know by heart, grab the English translation. Since you know the book so well (provided you know how to read English script), it'll be faster to translate and follow the plot points.

Get a penpal.,
Keep a journal.,
Start labeling.",How to Learn Simple English2," Talking to a person in an English speaking country can be an incredibly fun and exciting adventure to start on. They'll be able to tell you about their culture, their customs, and give you a real path to the English speaking world. And getting mail is always a pick-me-up!


Students of the Worldand PenPal Worldare both good online resources to finding a penpal. You can either use snail mail or email with your new writing friend. Though email goes much quicker, snail mail can be a lot more personal and exciting.

, Though you won't be able to correct your own mistakes, you will be able to keep up your vocabulary and discover the words you don't know (and then look them up!). If you don't use words, you're likely to lose them -- keeping a journal daily keeps the words and phrases fresh in your head.


This journal can take on a number of forms. It can either be an English journal devoted to other's musings -- where you write down song lyrics, poems, and quotes in English that you like -- or it can be writing of your own: thoughts, venting, gratitude, or just devoted to one specific topic.

, This tactic is good for writing and recall. Take everything in your home and label it in its English name. The goal is to start thinking in English; at home, you'll be more likely to think, ""What's on TV?"" if ""TV"" is right in front of you.

Don't stop at what's in front of you (bed, chair, TV, lamp, refrigerator) -- go inside your cupboards and fridge. If there's a place you keep the dishes, label it. If there's a place you always keep the milk, label it. It'll help keep you organized, too!

"
"
Join a conversation group.,
Watch videos.,
Listen to English programs.",How to Learn Simple English3," If you have a college, university, or language school in your area, odds are they have organizations you may be able to get involved in. You'll meet other people just like you who are just looking to better their skills.


Before you start conversing, you'll be well off if you know the basics:

Numbers (1-100)
Time (numbers 1-59 plus o'clock, past, and till)
Days of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday)
Introductory phrases

Hello! My name is...
How are you?
How old are you? I'm X years old.
What do you like? I like...
How is your family?





, As always, YouTube is a great resource for knowledge and information. There are hundreds of videos dedicated to ESL learners that keep a steady pace and are all about expanding vocabulary and grammar.


You don't have to limit yourself to ESL videos. As long as it's in English, if it's a topic you enjoy, you may find it useful. Try to find videos that have captions so you can read along. Many music videos have lyrics with them, making it easier to follow and keep up.

, Turn the captions on (if you have to) and tune into a popular English show or the news. Though you may not be able to catch most of what they're saying, the more you study, the more you'll understand and the more you'll be able to notice your progress. Podcasts are good sources, too.


Keep in mind that when you're listening, each speaker has an accent. Some speakers will be easier to understand than others. If you're interested in American English, listen to American speakers. For British English, stick to European programs. People speak English all over the world and there are hundreds of variable accents.

This is good news for you! Regardless of your accent (in general), most native speakers will be able to understand you. Since English comes in so many varieties, native speakers' ears are used to the differences.

Identify naming words as nouns.,
Know that pronouns stand in for nouns.,
Recognize action words as verbs.,
Learn that adjectives modify nouns and pronouns.,
Know that adjective and verb modifiers are adverbs.,
Understand that prepositions express relationships.,
Identify words used to join clauses as conjunctions.,
Recognize exclamations as interjections.,
Learn the Subject-Verb-Object rule.,
Understand correct adjective and adverb placement.,
Identify clauses and phrases to find conjunctions.,
Use exclamation points to identify interjections.,
Look for nouns and pronouns to identify prepositions.,
Recognize suffixes that are common in nouns.,
Know which suffixes are common in adjectives.,
Learn which suffixes are common in verbs.,
Remember that most adverbs share a common suffix.",How to Identify Parts of Speech," A noun is any word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns can be concrete (Alice, dog, table, etc.) or abstract (beauty, independence, cycle, etc.).Proper nouns are used to name a specific person, place, or thing, and the main words are always capitalized (Fred, New York, the Declaration of Independence).
Nouns can be either singular or plural.
Nouns can be possessive, in which case they typically end in 's or s'.;
, Sometimes, a noun is not always named. Words that do not directly name a person, place, thing, or idea, but take the place of a word that does, are pronouns.Some pronouns stand in for people's names (he, our, hers, etc.).
Other pronouns represent an object or idea (it, they, this, etc.).
Pronouns may also stand in for very indefinite nouns that may be difficult to name without the use of a pronoun (everyone, no one, something, etc).

, A verb is any word that is used to express an action (run, cleaned, driven, etc) or being (is, was, been, etc). Verbs have multiple tenses that express when the action took place.Auxiliary verbs (also known as helping verbs) are words that are used to change the tense of the main verb (will, did, would, etc.). These are still considered verbs.

, An adjective is any word that is used to modify or describe a noun or pronoun (blue, many, smart, etc.). Adjectives typically answer questions like ""how many?"", ""what kind?"", or ""which one?""Numbers are considered adjectives when they are used to answer the question ""how many?""
Articles (a, an, and the) are considered adjectives by many because they answer the question ""which one?"" However, some people consider articles to be a separate part of speech.

, An adverb is similar to an adjective in that it is used to describe or modify. Instead of modifying a noun or pronoun, however, an adverb modifies a verb or adjective (happily, extremely, then, etc.). Adverbs typically answer the question ""how?"", ""why"", ""when?"", or ""how much?""Adverbs may also modify other adverbs. (I ran very quickly.)

, A preposition is a word or phrase that is used to show the relationship between noun or pronoun and another element in the sentence (at, by, in, to, from, with, etc.). Prepositions are typically very short words., A conjunction is a word that connects other words, phrases, or clauses (and, but, or, because, etc).Coordinating conjunctions are used to join two clauses that are equally important to the sentence. (I like cats, but I don't like dogs.)
Subordinating conjunctions are used to join a main clause and a subordinate clause, which is less important to the sentence. (I went outside, although it was raining.)

, An interjection is a word or phrase used to express an emotion or feeling, such as surprise. (oh, wow, my goodness, etc). Interjections are typically capable of standing alone and are not grammatically related to the rest of the sentence., Most sentences in the English language have the same basic structure: the sentence begins with the subject, followed by the verb, and then the object (if the sentence has an object). There are exceptions to this rule, but understanding the norm can help you identify the parts of speech in most sentences.Both the subject and object of a sentence will contain a noun or pronoun. This means that a sentence that has both a subject and an object will contain a noun or pronoun both before and after the verb. (I ate the apple.)
The subject and object may contain modifiers such as adjectives as well.
When the sentence has a direct object, it will come directly after the verb. (I like cookies.) When the sentence has an indirect object, it will come after a preposition. (I gave the card to Frank.)

, Although there are certainly exceptions to the rules, the placement of adjectives and adverbs is usually very predictable. Understanding where these words are most often found can help you identify them in sentences.


Adjectives are almost always found before nouns and pronouns (We look at a red dress.) or after the linking verb ""to be"" (The dress is red.)When adverbs are used to modify adjectives, they are almost always found right before the adjective. (The meal was truly delicious.)When adverbs are used to modify verbs, they may be found before the subject (Later I will walk to school.), directly before the verb (I will carefully clean the artifacts .), or directly after the verb. (I go to the park frequently.)

, Because conjunctions are typically found between two clauses or phrases, you should be able to identify one by looking for the clauses or phrases that it joins together. If the word comes between the two clauses or phrases and seems to join them, it is likely a conjunction.Conjunctions like ""and"" and ""but"" are sometimes used at the beginning of a sentence, although this is more rare. When it is done, you should be able to identify the other clause or phrase in the previous sentence.

, Most interjection are followed by exclamation points because they express emotional responses. If you see an exclamation point, the word proceeding it may be an interjection, although exclamation points are used after other types of words as well.


Another clue that a word might be an interjection is that it is used alone. If there are other words in the sentence, it is less likely to be an interjection.

, Prepositions are typically found before noun or pronoun phrases. (I went to the store.) This is because the preposition expresses the relationship of the noun or the pronoun to the previous part of the sentence.Keep in mind there may be an adjective, adverb, and/or article between the preposition and the noun or pronoun. These modifiers are all considered to be part of the noun or pronoun phrase. (We paid for the very expensive jeans.)

, Although not all nouns contain one of these suffixes, many do. Understanding that they are most common in nouns can help you identify the part of speech of a word, even if you do not know its meaning. Look for the following suffixes to help identify nouns:-ion (population)
-sion (tension)
-tion (attention)
-acy (accuracy)
-age (image)
-ance (allegiance)
-ence (permanence)
-hood (childhood)
-ar (scholar)
-or (editor)
-ism (idealism)
-ist (realist)
-ment (government
-ness (sadness)
-y (beauty)
-ity (capacity)

, Just as with nouns, there are certain suffixes that are most commonly used with adjectives (although there are exceptions). Committing the following suffixes to memory may help you identify adjectives in sentences more easily:-al (clerical)
ful (wonderful)
ly (friendly)
ic (chronic)
ish (squeamish)
-like (childlike)
-ous (contagious)
-y (yappy)
-ate accurate
able (laughable)
-ible (horrible)

, There are a few suffixes that are used with verbs more often than any other type of word. If you see one of the following suffixes on a word, it is likely that it is a verb:-ify (typify)
-ate (proliferate)
-ize (rationalize)
-en (tighten)

, Adverbs are by far the easiest parts of speech to identify using suffix clues. This is because the majority of adverbs end in the suffix -ly (merrily, wonderfully, quickly, etc.). If you see a word that ends in this suffix, there is a very good chance that it is an adverb.There are some words that end in -ly that are not adverbs (butterfly), so be careful not to overgeneralize.
There are also a few adverbs that do not end in -ly (well, fast, very, etc.).

The current GRE has a verbal, math, and essay section. Most humanities departments, such as English and/or Literature, will focus on the verbal and writing scores.Acquire a practice test and take some sample tests to help get a better score on the actual test.
Check your prospective program's guidebooks, usually on the department's website, for average accepted scores, as the scoring scheme on these tests changes from time to time.
GRE scores are valid for 5 years after the year in which you took the test. The year runs from July 1-June 30.If your scores are more than 5 years old, you will likely need to retake the GRE.
Submit the scores on your tests to the correct school(s) you are applying to during the actual test. You can order up to four scores at the time that you take the test. If you are applying to more than four programs, you will need to order additional score reports for a fee.;
, Not all doctoral programs require this subject test, but many do. Check the website or contact your prospective program's graduate coordinator to find out whether you need to take this test. If you do, you will almost certainly need to take it in addition to the GRE General Test.This subject test consists of about 230 questions that cover the full range of literature in English, including a few questions on important works of ""world lit"" that are routinely translated into English, such as Homer's Iliad or the Christian Bible.The test also covers basic knowledge about important cultural and historical contexts, as well as literary criticism.
The subject test is only offered on paper and is only offered at certain times of the year, which means that you need to schedule your exam well in advance. Additionally, you should allow up to six weeks for your scores to become available to your chosen graduate program(s)., The humanities can cover a wide variety of subjects. You do not have to have a master's degree in English to apply for an English Ph.D. program, but you should consider getting your earlier degrees in topics related to English/Literature.Some Ph.D. programs will admit students directly from undergraduate programs, without requiring a master's degree first. You can investigate this option too.


Look through your prospective master's program's degree offerings for an English and/or Literature department.
Contact the graduate coordinator for the master's program you're considering to see if she recommends the program as a starting point for an academic career in English and/or literary studies. If not, she may be able to direct you to better departments or programs.
Look into related fields like history, anthropology, philosophy, and theology for potential leads on programs and classes that will benefit your breadth and depth of study.
If your master's degree is in a completely unrelated field, such as computer programming, don't despair. English is a very flexible field and welcomes people with all types of backgrounds. However, you will need to carefully and convincingly explain why you want to do a Ph.D. in English and how your experience has prepared you for the program.

, If you're already in a master's program for English/Literature, you might ask about staying at your current school for the doctorate degree. Some schools will allow students to combine some master's degree achievements into their doctorate program.If you have a ""fast track"" option you can and want to pursue, ask your advisor if you're in a position academically to move onto it by your program's deadline. Some will admit you only if you intend to pursue a doctorate.
Acquire an accurate list of the requirements of the doctorate program in comparison to your existing master's program. This likely means increased credit hours, differences between a thesis and a dissertation (the final written composition you will produce), and changes to your course selection.
Even if you do not have a ""fast track"" option, you may investigate the choice of staying in your current school for the Ph.D. after achieving your master's degree. However, this may require a fresh application, just as if you were a new student to the school.

, Most humanities doctorate programs in the United States, English/Literature included, require at least reading knowledge of at least one foreign language. If you are considering a prestigious graduate program, you may need to demonstrate competency in two or three languages.


If your thesis or dissertation involves incorporating multinational and older works, you may need additional languages beyond the program requirements.
Check your prospective program's course lists for what languages are regularly offered.
Get a schedule of when the official knowledge reading exams or equivalent tests are given each semester.
Consult with your prospective program about their requirements for passage of the language credit, especially if a class or just an exam is needed to pass the credit.

, The thesis is the major writing composition at the end of a master's degree. These projects, at least for the master of arts in English/Literature, are lengthy original works in poetry, fiction, drama, rhetoric and/or similar genres.Choose something that will inform your dissertation later. Don't ""reinvent the wheel,"" as this will take you too long. Write about something that's already been done but look for new inspiration for your subject matter to write about or find a different angle within an established topic.
Keep a portfolio of all your work. This will be helpful in applying for doctoral programs, teaching jobs, and/or other forms of employment should you pursue them.

, Look at your prospective schools' department lists to see if they have an English/Literature department.You may want to take popular rankings systems, such as U.S. News & World Report's ""Best Grad Schools,"" into account.Take a close look at the faculty list of the top few programs you are most interested in and narrow down the list to professors that cover the sub-fields of English/Literature you are interested in.Consider highly ranked schools first. Students who earn their doctorates from the top 10 programs are significantly more likely to find tenure-track positions after graduating.Apply to the most prestigious programs you think you have a shot at. It is also wise to have a ""fall-back school,"" which is well-ranked but more within reach.

, This professor will most likely direct both your program of study and dissertation.


Introduce yourself and your ideas for the theoretical project you would like to work on with this faculty member.
Explain about the work you've already done, including compositions from your master's program. This is a good chance to engage the faculty member on literary, rhetorical, and pedagogical (teaching) ideas and see if you can form a good professional relationship.
The professor you pair up with finally is frequently referred to as your ""major professor"" for various purposes. Sometimes they will also be called your dissertation director when that time comes.
On rare occasions, major professors will leave a department/university for one reason or another. It is possible to still work with them remotely if you can get permission from your department/program. Otherwise, you will have to find another professor in the department to take you on.

, If you've narrowed your prospective program choices down to just a handful, then physically going to them may help make your decision about where to spend the next few years it may take to get your degree.Schedule time to meet with the professor(s) you may work with. See if you can at least with your potential major advisor to go over likely dissertation subjects, courses, and program expectations.
Take a walk around the department. Find out what the other English, Literature, and Creative Writing professors and grad students are studying. They may contribute to your work and vice-versa.
Find out if there are any writing clubs, literary workshops, poetry reading groups, book clubs or similar organizations that work with the department or university that could be of use to your topic. Get their contact information at the very least.Ask to talk with current doctoral students in the program. Many graduate programs will organize informal lunches, dinners, or social times with current grad students so that you can ask questions about what their experience is like. These can be just as informative as speaking with the faculty, if not more so. Ask about the camaraderie of the department, work/life balance, and whether there are any ""problem"" faculty you should be aware of.

, You will need these for your applications to other graduate schools. These letters will, ideally, highlight your aptitude and work ethic, among other positive traits observed by those that know your work and character.Try to give your chosen writers at least a month's advance notice so they can take their time writing the letter. Consider providing your writers with a copy of your curriculum vitae (C.V.) to help remind them of your work. Be transparent and let them know exactly what the letter is for and the school you intend to apply for. They can tailor the letter better for your needs.
Pick writers that know your work, such as teachers and employers. Make sure you seek letters that include some from your master's program faculty--especially your thesis advisor. Your program may have specific requirements about who writes the letters.
Choose not to see the letters before they are sent. Sometimes you are given the option of viewing sealed or unsealed letters before they are sent to where you apply, and some schools will invalidate the letters if they are unsealed. Additionally, requesting to examine the letter may seem as though you do not trust the sender. If the faculty member seems hesitant to recommend you, it is better to find someone else than take a half-hearted letter.
Confirm with the school if the letters need to be sent from the university, on university letterhead, submitted electronically, or should be sent with your application packet.
If there is a physical mailing involved, provide the properly addressed envelope and postage to your writers. If there is an electronic submission involved, make sure all the web addresses are correct, and get confirmations.
If it's approaching the deadline and your recommenders have not provided their letters, it's acceptable to give them a polite reminder about your request for a letter of recommendation.

, Your personal statement, sometimes called a statement of purpose, is a major component of your application. It introduces you to the admissions committee and makes your case as to why you want to pursue a doctorate in English/Literature. You should prepare to write several drafts of this important document and get feedback from mentors. The personal statement may be anywhere from 500 words to two pages.Discuss your academic background, research interests, and professional aspirations. If you have already conducted extensive research or have peer-reviewed publications, mention them here. Talk in detail about what you want to research and how the degree will further your career goals.Mention specific attractions about the program to which you’re applying. For example, do they have an extensive rare manuscripts library? Is there a faculty member you are keen to work with? You don’t need to “suck up” to the committee, but making informed statements about why you want to study at each particular program will help convince the committee that you have prepared for the work ahead.Avoid cliches. Do not talk about how you have always liked to read, or how you burn with a hard, gem-like flame for poetry. Do not use a dictionary definition or famous quote to open your essay. Convey that you are engaging with the field at a professional level.
Show, don’t tell. Use specific examples whenever possible. For example, don’t say “I am passionate about literature.” Say “In my spare time I volunteer as a reading group coordinator for underprivileged schoolchildren because I want to share with them my passion for literature.”Try to keep your writing polished but approachable. You don’t want to come across as stuffy, but you also don’t want to come across as unsuited for the rigors of a Ph.D. program.

, You will need to submit a writing sample to your doctoral program. This sample displays your intellectual abilities, the quality and rigor of your work, and your promise as a scholar. Ask for help from a mentor or faculty member in choosing what essay you will use as your writing sample.You may be asked to prepare several writing samples, especially if you are applying to a doctoral program with a creative writing emphasis. Choose samples that reflect the variety of your work as well as the quality of it.
Keep your sample to the length requested. If this means you have to cut chunks out of it, do so. Do not submit a sample significantly longer than requested. The committee may well simply stop reading it., You will likely need to submit your CV along with your other application materials. If you are applying to the Ph.D. directly from your undergraduate degree, you may need to include some accomplishments from your high school years. If you are applying from your master’s program, make sure that you don’t include too much early stuff -- this can make it appear as though you are padding your CV. However, unlike with a traditional resume, the lengthier your CV, the better, so do not leave off important information.Include the following sections:Heading. This includes your name, address, and contact information
Education. This includes your degrees, beginning with those in progress or most recently earned. Include the name of the institution, city/state, degree type and major, and the month and year the degree was (or will be) awarded. If you graduated with honors, it is acceptable to mention it. If you are coming from a master’s program, state your thesis title and advisor’s name.
Relevant Experience. List positions that reflect your experience and expertise. If you have prior teaching or tutoring experience, highlight this, as you will likely need to teach to support yourself in the doctoral program. Include your job title, organization name, city/state, and the dates you held each position. Include a brief summary of your responsibilities. Don’t include non-academic jobs here.
Publications. If you have already published research or creative work, list it here. If you do not have publications, you can title this section “Research Experience” and discuss any major research projects you have conducted or assisted with.
Professional Presentations. If you have attended conferences or other professional events, list them here.
Honors and Awards. List any competitive scholarships or fellowships you have received. You may also list scholastic honors and other awards.

, Some will be printed, some will be online. Make sure you have mailing supplies (large yellow envelopes, postage stamps) if it's a print application. Make sure you have the correct browser software and settings according to the instructions if it's online.


These can be large and detailed forms, so take your time. If it's a paper application, print a couple of copies in case you fill out something incorrectly and need to redo a page. Hold off stapling the pages until the end.
For online applications, make sure you set aside plenty of time since they often are done in one sitting. Save your work frequently if possible.
Use a large yellow envelope to mail your application materials to the university in the case of a print application. If you are unsure of the amount of postage you need, take the entire pack to your local post office and they will weigh it, let you know the postage amount, and mail it for you if request.
Submit your application online if that is the method available.

, Ask friends to proofread your application as well. Print out your documents and read them in hard-copy. You are applying to the highest-level degree in your field, and the admissions committee will notice minor errors. Sloppy proofreading suggests a lack of commitment., You should consider applying to at least half a dozen schools, if not more. These departments can vary considerably in size and funding, so it's hard to predict how much competition you will be facing.


Most programs will have fees associated with applying, so take that into consideration with the number of applications you submit.
Be prepared that you may get staggered responses from your different applications. Some may accept, wait-list, or reject you earlier than others.
If you are accepted or wait-listed fairly early, be alert to response deadlines since most programs are aware that students they accepted sometimes refuse admission. This may open up a position for a wait-listed student, but also may compel you to make a decision on one school that accepted you before others have responded.

, Make sure they arrived at your prospective doctoral program by its application deadline.


Some schools will have this service for free, some will have you pay for it. But to be official, they must be submitted by your school to the destination. Some schools will ask for copies from you in the interim, but those will be unofficial.

, The names of the major field may differ from school to school, but some examples of major concentrations include: medieval, Renaissance, Restoration and 18th century (British/American), 19th century (British/American), criticism, theory, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and rhetoric.Most universities require a major field to be taken along with several minor fields to improve a graduate's breadth of academic coverage. So you may focus on one area, but still take a few classes in others you weren't initially interested in.

, These will be professors that lead your minor fields and consult for your comprehensive exams in addition to your major advisor. They may or may not continue onto your dissertation committee.


Take classes with at least some of your committee members if possible. It will help them learn your work, and facilitate collegiality (professional friendship).
Some universities require an ""out of area"" member--a professor from another department to ensure your department is not giving students a free pass. Ask your major professor who they recommend, or if you have a professor in mind, run the choice by your advisor first.
Occasionally committee members will retire, move, or for whatever reason leave the department. If this happens you can arrange with your department to conduct academic business with them remotely, or consult the procedures to replace them.

, These professionals are the source of information and guidance throughout your program.


Check with your department's academic advisor especially for administrative information and deadlines. Also the advisor can help make sure you're on time with fulfilling the required credits for your major and minor fields.
Meet with your major professor frequently for guidance on theoretical ideas, professional development, and to make sure you are meeting program requirements in conjunction with the academic advisor.
Check your program rules for how many credits you need for each major and minor concentration. You might want to keep your own chart in addition to the department's records.
See if some classes ""double count"" for major and minor fields, two minor fields, etc., with your advisor. This can free up room to take other classes you need or might be interested in.
Do not be averse to taking classes out of your ""comfort zone."" This can lead to helpful collaborations with other colleagues, introduce rich ideas into your work, and provide breadth and depth to your professional applications later.

, In most doctorate of English/Literature programs, a minimum of 2 years or 30 credit hours of full-time coursework is required for the degree beyond the master's degree. But this can vary widely.Pick mostly classes that also help your dissertation along with the writing that you will complete for them.

, Most graduate programs fund their students through assistantships of some kind. Frequently, teaching assistants provide grading or some other form of assistance to professors and the department on a part-time basis during the semester.


Take advantage of opportunities to instruct a class if you get them. This will be practice for a teaching position should you get one, and experience you can put on a job application later. Note that even if you are the instructor of record, meaning you are entirely in charge of teaching the class, you will likely still be called a “Teaching Assistant.”

, Most programs require students to pass a written and/or oral comprehensive exam to become a Ph.D. candidate, at which point all coursework is recognized as complete and only the dissertation remains for degree completion.


Prepare for this test to cover the major and minor concentration fields. In some programs, you may get to choose which areas you take exams in. Other programs may have pre-established examination areas.
Get questions or prepare with your committee members ahead of time.
Expect the written essay parts to last several hours, whether in take-home form or on-site in a classroom/computer lab form. If you know graduate students that have taken exams from these professors before, you should consider asking them what to expect--but remember your experience could still be different, their experience should just be a guide.
Oral exams typically involve the entire committee in the room together with you, asking you questions. This can be very intimidating, but typically you will not be allowed to enter comprehensive exams unless your major professor thinks you are ready. If at any point you are having serious questions, consult your major professor first.

, You should do this to plan your dissertation's development. Your status at this point frequently will be called ""ABD"" (all but dissertation).


Discuss fellowship and grant funding opportunities for your dissertation work.
Establish your dissertation committee, keeping in mind it may differ from your committee leading up to comprehensive exams. You should pick committee members that contribute to your work's theoretical framework, but also can help with the practical writing critique.
Get an idea of time-frame for completion. This will likely change, but you should keep in mind your program's deadline to complete your degree requirements. Otherwise, you may need to retake your comprehensive exams or file an extension (to allow more time to complete the degree) with your university.
Discuss other professional activities you might do while ""ABD,"" including book reviews, conferences, teaching assistance, etc.

, Consult frequently with your major advisor about your work. Ideally, you can build off of ideas you generated earlier in your master's program and/or classes, but either way you will be doing a considerable amount of additional writing.Outline your rhetorical ideas, characterizations, plots, inspirations, philosophical arguments, methods, and keep a list of works you may cite.
Plan a more detailed time frame for completing each step of your dissertation including time to travel if needed to gather resources, when you might complete chapters, and potential defense dates.
Explain how your work fits in genre of literature you seek to enter.

, Outline the dissertation itself including chapters, subheadings, and a works cited section. This will organize your thoughts, and keep your workload manageable.


Consider dropping in headings of works you have already done as potential chapter titles
Having sections to work on will allow you to more easily budget your time to work on the dissertation. You can work on a section, take a break, move onto another, and repeat.
Ensure an overall theme or current of thought is running through these sections you are setting up. If you set this up in your outline, it will focus your ability to maintain coherent thoughts in the body of the dissertation.

, There are numerous funding opportunities for humanities and graduate students. Consult with your program's and college's listings as well as any academic societies you may belong to. These can be competitive, so look for and apply to multiple sources.Find funding for the right stage of your work ""pre-dissertation,"" while you're researching, and others while you're in the writing phase near completion.Ensure that your project falls within the grant/fellowship scope, and write any application letters to argue for such a case.
Make a note of deadlines and notification time frames as they tend to move from semester to semester and year to year.
Check to see if you can satisfy the grant/fellowship commitments beyond your own work. Some will ask you to conduct lectures, present your progress, travel, etc...

, Like the thesis, this will be mostly original work. Bring in the work you used for your master's degree if applicable. Look for contributions that will enrich your content.


Ask experienced writers for help on other techniques, plot devices, and/or writing strategies that might help your work along.
Present work you do at conferences to get early feedback before it’s in the final form. You may also get ideas on more concepts you had not considered.

, Keeping a steady writing schedule can be extremely difficult, especially as one is likely to have other distractions from life crop up by the time the dissertation writing phase arrives.


Try to write just a little each day, maybe a couple of hours. If you can't, then maybe set aside blocks of time you know you won't be disturbed on specific days.
Shop around parts of what you write to your major advisor or graduate students at the same level of progress as yourself. Putting together a group of students at the dissertation phase can be mutually motivating.

, Upon completion of the dissertation, each student meets with a dissertation committee--usually the major advisor, a few others from your department, and one ""out of area"" faculty member. If the committee approves the dissertation and defense, you will have completed the degree.


Make sure you have consulted with your committee on a date and gotten a location for the defense. Frequently these defenses are budgeted to last two hours, but may be shorter.
If one professor is abroad, see if teleconferencing them in is an option.
Check with your college office/advisor to see if your dissertation has met all formatting requirements.

Choose a realistic and achievable goal.,
Follow a regular study plan.,
Increase your personal speed.,
Increase your sentence-reading speed.,
Develop a memory for English.,
Manage your time carefully: The Listening Sub-test.,
The Golden Rule of IELTS: The Golden Rule is ""Always give the monkey exactly what he wants"".,
Read the instructions carefully: Candidates who do not read or listen to the instructions carefully may believe they are saving time,but the instructions contain vital information which must be understood in order to answer correctly.,
Always look at the example:The example is given to you for a number of very good reasons.,
Use question keywords to find the answer: The keywords or key phrases in the questions help you in your search for the answers.,
Check before the end of the test.

,
Do not forget to make logical guesses: In the Reading Sub-test, if you are having trouble completing the questions to a particular passage,you should leave a minute or so at the end of each advised time period for that passage (usually 20 minutes) to guess those questions that can be guessed.,
Are your answers grammatically correct?,
Give one answer only: Give just one answer to a question, unless you are specifically requested to give more than one answer.,
Check your spelling: In the Listening and Reading Tests exact spelling is not always essential.,
Make sure your answers are easy to read: You cannot expect to do well if your answers cannot be read.",How to Get 7 in IELTS," To obtain a satisfactory IELTS Band Score, it is necessary to be realistic. If the goal is to reach a certain level of English proficiency, success can only be achieved with much practice. It is important to know what an IELTS score in any of the Sub-tests means before you set yourself a goal.;
, Set aside the maximum number of hours you can spare each day to practise English for all four Subtests. Do not concentrate only on your weakest areas. Be regular in your practice, and give yourself a rest between tasks. Take at least one day out of your week to rest and forget the test completely.The secret of success is to work towards your goal slowly, steadily and regularly.Take every opportunity to listen to English whenever and wherever you can. Watch TV programmes and films, listen to radio programmes and English language tapes - even songs in English on tape.Have as many conversations with native English speakers as you can, and practise in English as often as possible with your non-native English-speaking friends.Try to read texts in English at least once every day. You should always be in the process of reading a book in English - a page or two each night before bedtime is an excellent plan. Read newspapers,magazines, and novels written for your English level (available from good language bookshops). Academic Module candidates should obtain academic articles, if possible. Always carry English texts with you, so you can read when you have spare time that would otherwise be wasted.Do not worry about understanding every word. Read some articles in detail and some for speed.

, In the IELTS test, time is your enemy. Candidates who have taken the test and did not perform as well as they had hoped often complain that they were unable to give all the answers in the Listening Test because the tape was too fast, and that they ran out of time in the Reading Test. To begin with, do not worry if you do not finish the tests. Remember, the test is designed to measure candidates over a range of scores from 0 to 9 (0 indicates the test was not attempted). Candidates whose English is near perfect can expect to score 9, but even native English-speaking people would be unlikely to complete every Listening Test answer perfectly or finish the Reading Test a long time before the examination ends. Remember, the test is meant to be challenging. The IELTS test measures many aspects of your English ability including the speed at which you listen, read, write, speak, and think in English. Your personal speed is not something which changes a great deal from day-to-day, but does change considerably over a longer period of time, as a direct result of practice in working with the English language.Your personal speed and ability in the 5 areas previously mentioned is pretty well fixed at any given time. The official IELTS Band Scores you receive are extremely accurate, since each test is trialled extensively to achieve standardised results for candidates at all English levels. Nonetheless, there are certainly many things you can do, before and on the day of the test, to help maximise the use of your time and give yourself the best chance of success. Consider the following situation: although a racing car cannot go faster than its maximum speed, the race can still be won, and its maximum speed maintained for longer, if an expert driver is at the wheel.The Listening, Reading, and Writing Tests are given in that order, and are usually held on a single morning. The combined length of those three tests is 2 hours and 30 minutes. (The Speaking Test is conducted at an appointed time in the afternoon.) Only one short break is given between the Reading and Writing Tests, so you need to be at your best for a long period of time, which is why you must sleep and eat well before the test. The hints and guidelines in this book should help you achieve your ""maximum speed"". The more effort you put in, the faster your personal speed will be on the day.

, The faster and more accurately you read, the more questions you will be able to answer. In all the tests, the instructions, the example, and the questions themselves need to be read quickly, and must be well understood in order for you to have more time to find the answers. It pays to increase your overall reading speed

, In the Reading Test, it pays to remember as much as you can of what you have just read, but at least the words can be read again. However, in the Listening Test you cannot go back, and the tape is only played once. If the answer comes before the keyword/phrase, your memory of what you have just heard is even more important. Nevertheless, the answer usually follows the keywords/phrases that you hear, and is close in time to the main keyword/phrase you are listening for.

, The tape is heard once only, and the questions are answered as you listen. Time is, therefore,managed for you, but you have a short period of time after each passage is heard to check your work.Do not use this time to transfer your answers to the Answer Sheet because you are given 10 minutes at the end of the test in which to do this. The Reading Sub-test. An advised period of time is usually given in which to complete each of the three sections of the test. Keep an eye on the time as you progress through the Reading Sub-test, and as you complete each question group. Make sure that you stop answering questions when the advised time is up. Move on to the next group of questions even if you have not finished those questions. If you do not, you will probably not complete as many questions as you could. Remember that you are in charge of managing your time in the Reading Sub-test.

, If a monkey asks for a banana, you must give him a banana and not an apple. In other words,your answer to a question must be exactly what is required. You must be quite sure of the type of information you are asked to give as an answer, and what you must do with that information to give an accurate answer. You might think that this advice is too simple to be worth remembering. It might seem obvious that you have to do what the test asks you to do and give the answers the test asks you to give. Yet failure to remember and apply the Golden Rule is one of the main reasons why candidates do not score as well in the test as they believe they should. Read the questions very carefully. Know the type of information the test asks you to give: Is the answer a method of transport? ... a person? ... a place? ... a number?If you know, you have a better chance of giving the correct answer. Know what you have to do with the information:Do you have to complete a sentence, or fill in the missing words in a sentence? If so, your answers must, therefore, be grammatically correct within that sentence.Do you have to provide an answer with no more than a maximum number of words?If so, your answer must not contain more than that maximum number of words.Do you have to name two items that you must hear on the tape, or find in a reading passage? If so, your answer must contain two items only; three items would be incorrect. Always know exactly what type of information you need to give and what you have to do with it.

, The instructions may contain information about the passage topic which helps to predict what you may hear or read. The instructions tell you what to do, what kind of answer to give, and, in the case of the Listening Test instructions, they tell you when to answer. It is important to read the instructions quickly and accurately. You might not have time to complete the test if you are too slow at reading the explanatory information.

, It is important to read and/or listen to the example carefully. Some candidates believe they can save time by not looking at the example. This is a mistake. If you do not know how to give the answer, you are very likely to give an incorrect answer or a correct answer in the wrong form.The example tells us 3 very important pieces of information about the task:1. The example tells you how to give the answer to questions.2.The example gives you information about the listening or reading passage.3.The example tells you when to start listening, or where to start reading to find the answers.

, This is true for both the Listening and Reading Sub-tests. First, you must choose which word or phrase to listen for on the tape, or search for in the reading passages. There may be more than one keyword or keyword phrase in a question, and they can be placed before or after the answer.

,, In the Listening Sub-test, you are given a minute of silence after each section has finished. Candidates who forget to give a logical guess to questions they cannot otherwise answer, do not give themselves any chance at all to get a mark!

, While it is true that not all words and phrases given as answers to questions in the Listening and Reading Tests need to be grammatically correct, it is often possible to work out the correct answer by using your knowledge of grammar. Always consider whether your choice of answer is grammatically acceptable before making your final decision. This is especially true of the following types of tasks: short-answer question tasks•all table/chart/diagram/note completion tasks• sentence completion tasks • gap fill tasks.Verb forms, plural forms and other grammatical forms can be important when you give Listening and Reading Test answers. A good rule is to always try to give the answer in correct grammatical form.

, Even if one of the multiple answers you give is correct, you might score zero if too many of the other answers are incorrect. Surprisingly, candidates sometimes give more answers than necessary! If you are asked to name just three items that you hear or read about in a passage, it makes no sense to give four items as your answer. You will score zero, even if all four items are correct. Remember the Golden Rule.Note that with short-answer questions, especially in the Listening Test, there is sometimes a variety of words or phrases that can give the correct answer. However, you waste valuable time if you give more than one of the correct answers to short-answer questions. Alternative answers are given to various questions in the Answer Keys for the Listening and Reading Tests contained in this book.

, It is only necessary in the Listening Test if a word answer is spelt out for you on the tape.Other correct answers in the Listening and Reading Tests can be incorrectly spelt and still count towards your Band Score, but they must be sufficiently well spelt to indicate the correct answer.Copy answers from the passages accurately in the Reading Test. In the Listening Test, if you are unsure of the spelling, write an approximation of the way the answer sounds.

, Candidates may be unaware that their answers cannot be understood by the examiners who mark the tests. Be careful!Words: If you have trouble with English letters, you could write your Listening and Reading Test answers in BLOCK LETTERS.Your letters must be distinguishable from each other. Pay particular attention to: E and F I, J and L M, N and W U and V I and T(It is often hard to tell the difference between these letters when candidates write them quickly.)Numbers: Numbers can be even more difficult to read:Many candidates do not realise that their numbers cannot be recognised by the examiners. Practise so that your numbers look similar to those shown above.

Set aside time to read for fun.,
Take frequent breaks.,
Pace your deadlines.,
Avoid doing too much at once.,
Don't cram the night before a test.",How to Do Well in a High School English Class1," Spend at least 20 minutes reading at home every day. You will be amazed by how much vocabulary you will learn and how much better your writing will be. You don't have to limit your reading to literature. Read anything you like: newspapers, blogs, history books, poems. The wider variety of reading you do, the better., When doing homework, take a short break about every 20 minutes. Stand up, stretch, walk around, rest your eyes, and drink a glass of water. Short, rejuvenating breaks are better than long ones that distract you or make you groggy., This means not waiting until the last minute to do assignments and giving yourself plenty of time before the due dates to review and revise your work. If an assignment is due the next day, don’t wait until after dinner to begin doing it. If it is due in two weeks, do not wait until the middle of the second week. Start assignments as soon as possible., Set clear limits for your homework. Don’t try to read an entire novel overnight. Doing too much at once will overwhelm you and cause burnout., Cramming almost never works, even for people who say they work best under pressure. Pace yourself and study in the few days leading up to the test, rather than only the night before or morning of the exam. Remember that good rest and exercise make for a clear mind."

Stay for extra help after school.,
Bring a notebook and pen to class.,
Pay attention in class.,
Write due dates down if you find those dates hard to remember.,
Keep a running list of tasks and goals.,
Don’t try to do everything on your own.,
Ask for help on major assignments.",How to Do Well in a High School English Class2," If you want to improve your writing, then ask the teacher or a tutor for extra help. Your teacher will appreciate that you took the initiative to ask for help. Being proactive about your grades will work in your favor.

, Take notes on what your teacher is saying so you can reference them later. Pay particular attention to anything the teacher writes on the board or shows on an overhead projector.

, Don’t play games on your phone or check social media. It is rude and will irritate your teacher. Maintaining eye contact and putting down your phone shows your teacher that you are listening.

, Get a planner to keep track of your assignments and due dates across classes. Use your planner also to schedule extracurricular activities around your scheduled homework times.

, Give yourself reasonable deadlines to meet them, and check them off when done. Put these tasks in the order of most important to least important, and work on them in this order. Having them prioritized like this will help you with your homework time management.

, Seek out friends in your English class and set up a study or reading group. If your teacher allows it, share your essays with your classmates ahead of time and ask for comments/feedback from them.

, Almost every high school English class will require you to write essays. The requirements for these assignments will vary by teacher, so you will want to ask your teacher specifically what they are looking for. How many pages do they want your essay to be? Do they want citations at the end? Do you get to pick your topic or will a topic be assigned to you? Which of the three standard types of essays (expository/argumentative, narrative, or descriptive) are you writing?


For an expository or argumentative essay assignment you will be asked to investigate a particular topic and create an argument or take a stance on that topic. Expository essays are generally shorter than argumentative essays and are more common in introductory classes, while argumentative essays are more common in advanced, capstone-type classes. An essay in either of these categories might, for example, ask you to research capital punishment in the United States and explain why you might take a stance either for or against it.For the narrative essay assignment your teacher will be looking for more storytelling. An example prompt for an essay in this category might be to write about your greatest accomplishment or worst fear. These tend to be very personal and anecdotal essays.For the descriptive essay assignment your teacher will expect you to describe an experience, person, object, or place in detail, usually in a five paragraph format. This essay style often allows for more creative flexibility for the writer, depending on your topic. For example, describing a favorite childhood toy will be discussed differently by different students because each student had a different experience."

Ask questions.,
Participate in class discussions about the books your class has been reading.,
Attend class every day.,
Pay attention to directions.,
Turn in every assignment.,
Ask your teacher if there are additional books you can read on a particular subject.,
Don’t resort to flattery.",How to Do Well in a High School English Class3," Teacher enjoy answering your questions about the day’s lesson because it shows you were paying attention. If you ask questions, you will better understand what’s going on in class. If you don't know the answer to a question, ask! It shows that you are engaged in the material.If you’re uncomfortable speaking up in class, talk to your teacher after class about something that you thought was interesting or was confusing. This will clarify the issue in your mind and allow for the teacher to explain the concept to you privately.
Try to preface your question with direct quotations from the assigned reading. The more specific the question, the better it will be. For example, when Dickens writes “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times” at the beginning of A Tale of Two Cities, is he referring specifically to London and Paris in that order? Or does he mean it was the best and worst of times in both places?

, Support your opinions with quotes from the book, or make connections to other books the class has read. Most teachers give participation grades, and these can really help to bring up your final grade.

, Cutting class will lower your grade. You will miss out on valuable class material and will be behind when you decide to return to class. It’s also inconsiderate to your teacher.

, Ignoring directions on an assignment will usually hurt your grade. At minimum, it will annoy your teacher. For example, if he or she assigns a 3 page paper, don’t hand in a 2 page paper with extra large font and margins. Take pride in your work and take care to fulfill the assignment or paper requirements.

, Skipping assignments is a sure way to get a low grade in any class. Be sure to turn in all assignments, even if you think you didn't do your best work. Getting at least some points on a paper or other assignment is far better than earning zero points.

, For example, Charles Dickens’ David Copperfield is often assigned in high school English classes. It is one of the most studied novels of the nineteenth century. You might ask your teacher if there are particular studies or interpretations of the novel that they recommend?


You might also ask if the teacher has any recommendations by a particular author If you enjoyed one of their texts in class. If you liked David Copperfield, for example, your teacher might suggest Oliver Twist or Great Expectations as further Dickens readings for you. Asking about further reading shows the teacher that you genuinely are interested in the subject matter and the class.

, Remember that teachers are busy, too. You don’t have to be the “teacher’s pet” to win over your teacher. All you need to do is to be attentive, hardworking, and interested. Work hard on your assignments and participate constructively in class, and your teacher will be impressed.

Create a title for the essay.",How to Get an A on an English Paper," Your essay or paper will likely be directed by a question or a prompt, like a quote, with a question. It’s important that you read the question carefully and understand what it is asking of you. If you have created your own topic for the paper based on an assigned piece of literature or author, ensure you understand what you are expected to be exploring in the paper.


For example, you may get a prompt in the form of quotation from a work of literature, such as: “What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?” - Hamlet by William Shakespeare.You may be given an essay topic based on an assigned book or text, such as: “Discuss how Shakespeare’s Hamlet treats the idea of suicide in a moral, religious, and aesthetic sense. Pay particular attention to Hamlet’s two important soliloquies on suicide: “O, that this too solid flesh would melt” (I.ii.129–158) and “To be, or not to be” (III.i.56–88). Why does Hamlet believe that most human beings choose to live, despite the cruelty, pain, and injustice of the world?”;
, Before you get into structuring and writing your essay, take some time to do research on your topic. If your essay is about suicide and Hamlet, for example, you should start by reading the play again and highlighting any sections that discuss suicide, injustice, cruelty, or pain. You may also want to look at several academic articles that examine the play’s approach to suicide and mortality to use as sources or references.


If your topic is based on a historical framing of a text or book, such as the rise of 19th century factory life in Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities, you will need to use other resources besides the book as supporting material for your paper.
Always cite your sources properly in your paper, as failing to do so can lead to accusations of plagiarism and a failing grade. Never simply copy and paste information from a source into your paper, as this is considered plagiarism. You will need to quote the source and cite the source, or paraphrase the source so you are still using your own words to discuss the topic.

, Use a highlighter or a pencil to mark any relevant passages or quotes in the text. If you are using online sources, copy and paste relevant quotations into a blank Word document. Write down notes about how the source relates to your topic. You can then use these notes to create your thesis statement and to structure your essay.

, A thesis statement will explain the points or arguments you are going to make in your paper to your reader. It acts a road map for your paper and should answer the question, “What is this paper about?” It should take a stand and announce your position towards the topic.For example, an essay about suicide and Hamlet may respond to an essay question with the thesis statement: “In Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Hamlet’s fear of moral and religious punishment prevents him from ending his suffering through suicide and reinforces the complex nature of action in the play.”

, Go through your research notes and identify any key quotes or sections that you can use a supporting material for your paper. Look for a strong quote to open your essay in your introduction, or to end your essay in your conclusion. Consider how your notes from other sources will inform your essay.

, Many students use the five paragraph essay form to structure their paper. However, some teachers frown upon this structure and argue that you can use as many paragraphs as you need in your essay, as long as there is a clear introductory paragraph and a clear concluding paragraph. The five paragraph essay outline is:Introduction: Your beginning paragraph should contain an engaging first sentence and your thesis statement. Some writers find it easier to write create a temporary introduction and revise it once they are finished with the essay. This will ensure the introduction is cohesive with the rest of the essay.
Body paragraph 1-3: Each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence. You should also discuss one major point of your thesis, with at least one supporting example in each paragraph.
Conclusion: This paragraph should summarize your main argument and restate your thesis. You may also want to include last thoughts around the essay question and answer any questions or concerns you presented earlier in the paper.

, There are other ways to structure an English paper beyond the five paragraph essay, especially if you are writing a paper or essay at the college level. Consider structuring your essay around three basic parts:The introduction: This beginning paragraph should draw your reader in and act as a signpost for the rest of your essay. State your thesis and explain the purpose of the essay or paper.
The multi-paragraph body: These paragraphs are like building blocks, as they move your reader toward the goal or purpose of the essay. Each paragraph should expand on your main point or points and contain supporting examples for each point. However, some paragraphs may be longer than others to develop your points fully, and you are not restricted to only three paragraphs for the body of your essay. Always include transitions between each paragraph so the paper flows smoothly and the reader does not get confused or overwhelmed by your supporting points.
The conclusion: This section is the final destination of the reader's journey through your paper. Your conclusion can be more than one paragraph, but it should reinforce the purpose of your essay or the main idea of your essay and connect to the points made in your introduction. Avoid repeating your thesis statement or the earlier points made the essay. Instead, use the points you developed in your body paragraphs to strengthen your position in your conclusion. At the end of your paper, you should feel you have made a strong case to change the reader's mind about a topic or issue.

, There are several possible hooks you can use in your essay to draw your reader in.An interesting or surprising example: This could be a personal experience or a key moment in the life of the historical figure you are discussing in your essay. For example, to use an personal experience related to themes of suicide and mortality in Hamlet, you may discuss a moment where you felt despair and misery, only to realize the kindness of others and find solace in the strength of a friend or a peer.
A provocative quotation: This could be from a source you used for your essay or one that feels relevant to your topic. For example, you may use a well known quote from Hamlet, spoken by Hamlet, such as: “There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”A vivid anecdote: An anecdote is a very short story that carries moral or symbolic weight. Think of an anecdote that might be a poetic or powerful way to start your essay.
A thought provoking question: create a question that will get your reader thinking and engaged in your topic. For example: “Why does a melancholy character like Hamlet still embrace life over death, or suicide?”

, Focus on fleshing out each paragraph with at least one example of your main point. Sign-post each paragraph by beginning with a strong argumentative point that links to a supporting example of your main point. If you use an essay on suicide and Hamlet as an example:Body paragraph 1: Discuss the first soliloquy “O, that this too solid flesh would melt” (I.ii.129–158) in relation to suicide and mortality. Note how the soliloquy introduces the theme of mortality and suffering, as well as Hamlet’s inability to commit suicide because it is against his religious upbringing.
Body paragraph 2: Discuss the second soliloquy “To be, or not to be” (III.i.56–88). Look at how the soliloquy explores suicide and death, and how Hamlet ends the soliloquy with a philosophical conclusion about the complex nature of suffering.
Body paragraph 3: Choose a third soliloquy or quote in the later half of the play that you feel discusses suicide and death, such as Hamlet’s last words to Horatio where he tells Horatio not to commit suicide and to share Hamlet’s story. Discuss how Hamlet’s final words allow for a sense of optimism among tragedy and how it reinforces the play’s approach to suicide and death.

, Cliches are expressions that have a non specific meaning or have lost significant meaning over time. These are overused phrases that are so familiar, they do not create a specific or unique meaning. For example, “the grass is always greener”, “there’s no “i” in team”, “work hard, play hard.” To make your essay stronger, resist the urge to throw in cliches to get your point across. Be specific and use your own words to discuss your paper topic. Your teacher will want to read your original thoughts and ideas, not familiar phrases or sayings.Rather than start your paper with a cliche like, “Since the dawn of time…” or “In modern society…” or “Throughout history…”, create an original opening or use a quotation from a source.
Awkward or wordy phrases are usually phrases that run more than two lines on the page. Instead of cramming in all your ideas in one sentence, break up the sentence into shorter sentences. This will help you eliminate any wordy sentences or phrases that seem awkward and hard to understand.

, Another way to raise the level of engagement of your reader is to vary your sentence structure. The simplest sentence structure is composed of one independent clause, or a combination of a subject and a verb. For example: “Hamlet has issues.” But you can extend the simple sentence to include two or more clauses and create more complex sentences. Rather than use only simple sentences or complex sentences, use a variety of sentence patterns in your essay. This will show you have a more sophisticated understanding of sentence structure and take your essay to the next level, without confusing your reader.A compound sentence is composed of two or more independent clauses, subject verb and subject verb, separated by a connector like “for”, “nor”, “and”, “but”, “yet”, “or”, “so”. You can also used a connector with a semicolon or a comma, such as “however” “nevertheless”, “therefore”, “nonetheless”. For example: “Hamlet is torn between life and death.” “One of the play’s main themes is death; however, it is not all doom and gloom.”
A complex sentence is composed of one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. You can arrange these sentences as: subject verb (SV) because subject verb (SV), because SV, SV, or S because SV, V. You can use several different connectors, based on whether you are trying to describe cause and effect, a comparison and contrast, a place and manner, a possibility and conditions, a relation between two subjects and a duration of time.
For example: “Hamlet demonstrates his love for Ophelia in his soliloquy because he has difficulty telling Ophelia how he feels.” This is cause and effect. “One of the most pivotal scenes in the play occurs when Hamlet realizes his mother’s cup has been poisoned, though he is powerless to help her.” This is comparison and contrast. “After Hamlet watches his mother die, he takes his revenge on his murderous uncle.” This is a complex sentence that describes time.
A compound complex sentence is composed of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses. You can arrange these sentences by: SV, and SV because SV or Because SV, SV, but SV. Often compound complex sentences can get wordy and convoluted, so use them sparingly in your essay.
An example of a compound complex sentence is: “Once Hamlet ends his “To be or not to be” soliloquy, he realizes his fear of moral and religious damnation is greater than his desire to end his suffering, though he still feels there may be too much evil in the world that outweighs the good, so he decides to continue living with skepticism and anxiety.”

, Vary your word choice so you do not use the same terms or words more than once within the same sentence. If you tend to put “also” in every sentence, vary this by using “therefore” or “as well”. Grab a thesaurus and look for replacement words for terms you use often. Demonstrating your vocabulary will show you put time and effort into fine tuning your paper and your teacher will appreciate an essay without too many redundant or familiar words.You can start to create a vocabulary bank with a list of terms to replace words you use often. Look for adjectives that are unique and interesting, and use action verbs to replace any weak verbs in your writing. However, be careful not to throw in long, obscure words for the fun of it. If a simpler, shorter word works better, use it. The goal is to make your writing enjoyable to read, not confusing or pretentious.

, Make your conclusion clear and to the point. Avoid introducing new ideas or arguments in your conclusion. Instead, restate your thesis and your main points.


For example, you may restate your thesis: “In Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Hamlet’s fear of moral and religious punishment leads him to embrace mortality and reinforces the play’s perspective on living, despite the suffering and injustice in the world.”
It's important that once you finish your conclusion, you read over your essay to confirm you have connected your claim (or your thesis) to your evidence (laid out in your body paragraphs) and to your explanation (laid out in your conclusion). Check that each element is present in your paper and that each element connects smoothly and clearly to each other. Your claim or thesis will act as the grounding center of the paper and should connect your evidence and your explanation together.

, Print out your paper and read it several times for any spelling or grammatical errors. You can also read your paper out loud to ensure it flows well and is not confusing or jumbled.


Look at each paragraph carefully to ensure there is a topic sentence and at least one supporting quote or reference. Confirm that you use the same tense throughout the paper and the tone of the paper is professional and clear.
Check your citations to make sure you cite all sources and references in your paper.

, It can be easier to create a title for your essay once you have finished it. You could use a quotation from the essay, a phrase or term you refer back to often in the essay, or a summary of your main point.


For example, an essay on suicide and Hamlet could have the title: “To be or not to be: Choosing Life in Shakespeare’s Hamlet” or “The Beauty of the World: Against Suicide in Shakespeare’s Hamlet”.

Know the definitions of each.,
Learn how to distinguish between them.",How to Differentiate Between a Term and a Word,"


A word is a set of letters that when modified and combined according to laws of grammar (syntax) may constitute a sentence, an imperative or other aspect of language.

Most often words are terms, because they provide meaning (through representation) and hence our understanding.


A term is a word that has meaning (semantics) and most often refers to objects, ideas, events or a state of affair.

A term is (in addition to being a word) a point of reference, whereas a word is only a constituent of language. Hence, all terms are words, but only some words can be terms. A term refers to something, either abstract or concrete.
Because a term refers to something (e.g. object, event, relation) it represents that something. Terms can easily be spotted if they can be associated with other terms, hence forming a set of terms - a terminology. Thus, to spot the difference between a term and a word requires that the term represent something.

;
, Distinguishing between for example ""of""-as-a word from ""of""-as-a-term is often provided by the context of the appearance of the word. Thus, ""of"" is a word when reading ""Napoleon of France"" in a book on European history, whereas it is a term when introduced in the context of a book on grammar: ""the of-construction"".

Be clear on the course objectives.,
Prepare for each component of the course.,
Don’t procrastinate.,
Read with a purpose.,
Stay organized.",How to Get a 7 in IB Diploma English1," The goal of Language and Literature coursework in the International Baccalaureate program, in English and otherwise, is to develop skills in textual analysis, oral and written communication, and recognition of contexts, themes, forms, styles, and aesthetics.For English A1, there are three major assessment objectives:First, “knowledge and understanding.” The goal here is to develop your ability to read and respond to texts of various types, by recognizing elements such as stylistic choices and cultural contexts for both creation and reception of the work.
Second, “analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.” The coursework aims to enhance your skills at critically analyzing a text through thoughtful interpretation and evaluation, along with your ability to synthesize ideas from multiple works into evaluations of literary techniques, genres, and conventions.
Third, “selection and use of appropriate presentation and language skills.” Comprehension and analysis are inherently weakened without the ability to clearly and coherently write and speak about a subject in an appropriately structured and formal language, so the maturation of such skills is another goal of the program.;
, It is broken up into four parts, which in combination are prescribed to take a minimum of 150 hours (SL) or 240 hours (HL).


Please note: IB courses are offered at both a standard (SL) and advanced (HL) level. The essential goals and basic structures of the course remain the same, but HL requires a greater time commitment and demands a more rigorous evaluation criteria. Unless otherwise noted, this article refers to the HL course, although it is largely applicable to SL as well.
The four parts described below are the same in HL and SL, but the number of works within each varies.Part 1: Works in Translation. Three translated foreign-language works from the prescribed literature in translation (PLT) list are chosen, with the goal of furthering understanding of cultural contexts in the production and reception of texts. This is commonly referred to as “World Lit.”
Part 2: Detailed Study. Three works, each from a different literary genre, are selected from the prescribed list of authors (PLA) for close analysis of form, style, content, and context. At least one of the works will be poetry.
Part 3: Literary Genres. Three works, all from the same genre, are selected from the PLA to provide a more thorough investigation of the conventions of a particular literary genre.
Part 4: Options. This section provides the flexibility to choose and study three works regardless of genre or form. They need not appear on the PLA or PLT.

, In some corners of the academic world, IB students are rather notorious for procrastination, for instance by waiting until the night before to complete the “World Lit” assignment that constitutes 25% of the grade.


Procrastination is possible not because the coursework is easy for most students, but because of the amount of self-guidance and self-motivation required for the program.High school students who are used to very structured and supervised daily assignments and regular assessments can find it hard to adjust, or simply assume that they need not keep their “noses to the grindstone.”
IB programs are thus excellent preparation for college, where self-guidance and self-motivation are essential. Professors, after all, will not “hold your hand.”
Establish a clear schedule to keep up with your assignments, and set your own deadlines if necessary to make sure that you don’t fall behind. Don’t be afraid to ask your teacher for guidance or assistance.

, There is no getting around the fact that there is a substantial amount of reading in IB Diploma English. Simply reading the material, however, is unlikely to be enough to secure that score of seven.Read each selection more than once, whenever possible. The more familiar you are with the work, the better able you will be to effectively analyse it.
Take notes as you read. Jot down key details of each work — setting, main subject(s) or character(s), etc. — along with identifying key themes, stylistic elements, and so on. Highlighters can be your friend here as well.
WikiHow offers several articles on effective note taking in a variety of settings.
As you read, ask yourself questions like: “In what conditions/contexts did the author create this work?”; “How does the use of language and style reflect the author’s intent?”; “How does this work reflect and/or diverge from common literary genres?”; and, most simply “Why did the author write this piece?” Considering such questions as you read will better prepare you for your assessments.

, Even the best notes are worthless if you cannot find them when needed. You are likely to end up with far more notes than you are used to in high school classes, so organization is critical — and good practice for college coursework.Clearly label and identify your notes. For handwritten notes, use a clean sheet for each new note-taking session, with the topic and date clearly marked. For typed notes, create individual documents, and label and store them in a manner that makes them easy to identify and retrieve.
Invest in a good binder that allows you to store your notes in one place, and also reorganize them as needed to maximize their accessibility and utility.
Good organization also refers to the basics: make sure you do the correct assignments for each class meeting, and bring the proper materials with you.

Play the percentages.,
Light up your Literary Commentary (Paper 1).,
Energize your Essay (Paper 2).,
Win your Written Assignment.",How to Get a 7 in IB Diploma English2," The External Assessment component is worth 70% of your final grade (Paper 1 - 20%, Paper 2 - 25%, Written Assignment - 25%), so naturally it makes sense to dedicate a majority of your preparation time to these assignments. You’ll need to excel at both external and internal assessments to earn a seven, but you’ll have little chance of a good overall score without doing well with the former.External Assessment is labeled as such because the assignments are evaluated by IB assessors off-site; that is, they are sent out to be graded.
This means it is more important to be aware of the general expectations for these assignments, and somewhat less essential to be concerned with your teacher’s specific points of emphasis.

, For this assignment, you are provided two previously unseen passages, one poetry and one prose, and are given two hours to write a literary commentary on one of them.For a literary commentary, purpose and effect are two key elements to consider. That is, what was the author’s intent for this piece (and how is that reflected in the construction of the piece), and how does the resulting piece impact the reader (based on cultural context)?
Before writing, read the entire piece carefully, identify major themes and assertions, highlight stylistic elements, and consider the author’s point of view carefully.
When writing, structure your essay clearly, provide quotes or specific references as evidence, and analyze — don’t just identify — the features of the piece. Explain what was written and why.

, Here, you respond to a given question and write (within two hours) an essay that incorporates two works studied in Part 3 of the course (Literary Genres).The question is almost certainly going to ask you to, to at least some degree, compare and contrast a key theme in two works within the same genre. When considering the three works in Part 3 (two of which you will write on here), mentally align them side-by-side and consider commonalities and differences.
Consider content, context, and literary elements utilized in each work.
If you can draw from a couple of specific quotes or key incidents from each writing, that will add weight to the major assertions in your essay.
Organization is, as always, critical. Make sure you clearly address the question given — it is surprisingly easy to write an essay without actually doing this. Turn your basic answer into your thesis statement, and use the body of the essay to flesh out this answer in more detail, using the two works as your evidentiary base.

, This assignment is part of the aforementioned “World Lit” element of the course, where you are dealing with works translated into English. You write and submit a reflective statement (300-400 words) and essay (1,200-1,500 words) on one of the works studied in Part 1.You have greater time flexibility to complete this assignment on your own schedule, which can be a blessing (plenty of time to refine it into a masterpiece) or a curse (waiting until the night before to write it). Choose the former if you want a shot at a seven for the class.
The reflective statement constitutes a rather meager component of your overall score for this assignment, so spend the bulk of your time on the essay. That said, make sure your reflection is clearly organized, free of grammar errors, and fulfills the requirements of the assignment. It is a personal reflection on your experience with the work, but that doesn’t mean you can skip out on details about the actual work itself.
The literary essay will (or at least should be) be the most complete analysis of any one written work you will produce during the class. You need to clearly define the author’s intent, show an appreciation for his/her writing choices, indicate an awareness of cultural contexts within which the work was written and is now being received, and do all of these in a clear, structured manner.
Identify the work and your major interpretive assertion about it (your thesis) quickly in the introduction, then use the body of the essay to substantiate this claim with supporting evidence that draws from the text itself, along with considerations of genre, literary conventions, intended audience, the impacts of translation, and so on.
If you do excellent work on this assignment, which constitutes 25% of your total grade, that seven may be within reach.

Play the percentages (again).,
Own your Individual Oral Commentary and Discussion.,
Produce results with your Individual Oral Presentation.",How to Get a 7 in IB Diploma English3," The assignments that fall under this section, which are assessed internally by your IB-approved teacher (hence the name), are worth 30% of your final grade. It includes an Individual Oral Commentary and Discussion and Individual Oral Presentation. Focus your energies appropriately, then. This does not, however, mean that you should brush off these assignments as insignificant. If you really want to score a seven, that thirty percent will be critical.
Because your teacher is involved in the assessment, pay increased intention to his/her points of emphasis regarding the works themselves and the themes/topics/details worth extra consideration.

, For this assignment, you present a formal oral commentary on a extract of poetry from Part 2 of the class, followed by questions from the teacher, for ten minutes total, followed by an additional ten minutes of discussion about another extracted work from Part 2.You are not made aware of the extracts to be considered until twenty minutes beforehand, so you may feel that you cannot do much preparation. Nothing could be further from the truth, however. By thoroughly analyzing each work in Part 2, thereby preparing yourself to discuss key components like poetic conventions, authorial intent, themes, contexts, and the like, you will be more capable of providing cogent, reasoned analysis quickly and clearly.
Conduct “practice runs” by selecting extracts yourself and preparing oral commentaries within the given time constraints. Even if the likelihood of your choosing the exact extract is small, the process of preparing, organizing, and presenting your thoughts within a given time limit will serve you well for the actual assessment.
For the questions and discussion session, prepare by thinking about questions and issues you would raise regarding these works. Practice either alone or — even better — with a partner by raising and discussing these questions / issues.
As you prepare, practice speaking within the prescribed time limit, neither too long (which can cause you to rush or be cut off) nor too short (which opens you up to even more questions from the teacher.)

, This assignment provides you a bit more flexibility, giving you 10-15 minutes to present a cogent analysis of one or more works from Part 4 (freely-chosen works).Work in consultation with your instructor to determine which works to cover and what themes/issues/topics to emphasize.
Essentially, for the oral presentation, you want to achieve the same thing as in an essay, just in another format. You need to provide a clear argument (thesis), provide specific supporting evidence from the texts under consideration, and use clear, effective, proper language in doing so.
Your grade is determined by your demonstrated knowledge of the work(s), appreciation of thematic aspects, audience engagement, and manner of delivery, so what you say and how you say it are both of importance.
Practice, practice, practice. Practice your presentation as many times as possible beforehand. Practice in the mirror or in front of others. Sufficient preparation is the best way to battle nerves about public speaking and to ensure that your presentation comes in on time (10-15 minutes).
Instead of being wary of failure, think of this as your chance to shine — to determine what you want to discuss and present it in an engaging, effective manner.

Make a chart.,
Diagram sentences.",How to Explain Parts of Speech1," Before you can explain to others what the parts of speech are, it is good to brush up on them yourself. Knowing the parts of speech can help clarify grammar lessons, increase understanding from students, and improve your own writing.It is best to start with the four basic parts of speech. These are the nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.



Noun: a person, place, thing, or idea. A noun can be common (a general object) or proper (the name of a person or place). For example, dog and goodness are common nouns while Rhode Island and Joe are proper nouns.

Verb: a word that shows action or state of being. For example, run, jump, sit, learn are actions that a subject can do.

Adjective: a word that describes a noun or a pronoun. For example, pretty, large, beautiful, and loud are all adjectives.

Adverb: a word that describes a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Adverbs usually end in -ly, but not always. For example, quickly and carefully are adverbs that modify verbs while very is an adverb that modifies adjectives and other adverbs.;
, As your lessons develop, you can start introducing the more complex parts of the speech. Pronouns, prepositions, and conjunctions are a good intermediate step, as they have a clear function in the sentence and they interact with the basic parts of speech.



Pronoun: a word that takes the place of a noun. The most common type are person pronouns. Personal pronouns include: I, me, you, we, he, she, it, and they. There are many different kinds of pronouns besides the personal. They include indefinite, interrogative, reflexive, intensive, relative, and others.

Preposition: a word that describes the position of an object. For example, in, on, under, over, beside are all prepositions. A preposition begins a prepositional phrase.

Conjunctions: words that join words, phrases, or clauses. The most common are the coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, nor, for, yet, and therefore) and subordinating conjunctions, which are those words that join dependent clauses to main clauses in complex sentences (since, when, where, if, although, etc.).

, Interjections and determiners can be difficult to teach and to learn because their function in the sentence is often ambiguous. Without a strong basis in the other parts of speech, learners might struggle with identifying these parts, and you might find it difficult to explain them. Save your lessons on these parts for last.



Interjections: words that are used to express an emotion like surprise or shock or disappointment. They are words that are thrust into the midst of the sentence (hence, interjected).

Determiners: the first words in noun phrases that act in a way that limits or quantifies the noun. Articles such as “a/an” and “the” as well as words like many, some, or two are what “determines” if the noun is specific or general., With eight differently colored pens or markers, underline, circle, or box every part of speech. Tell your students which color marker corresponds to which part of speech. For the rest of the lesson, whenever you underline that part of speech, use the same color. Once you are finished teaching the lesson, give your students a short passage to read. Ask them to underline each part of speech using the same corresponding colors as you did., For nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, you can encourage students to ask certain questions to help them understand what the different parts of speech are. These questions will encourage them to think about how each part functions in the sentence as well as give them an easy tool for identifying the parts of speech.


Nouns answer the questions “who?” and “what?”Adjectives answer the questions ""what kind?”; ""which?""; and ""how many?""Verbs answer the question “what is it doing?”
Adverbs answer the questions “how?”; “when?”; “where?”; and “why?” , For the more difficult parts of speech—such as pronouns, conjunctions, interjections, and conjunctions—it may be easier to make a chart of the most common examples of these parts of speech. Explain these parts of speech, pointing to these examples on the chart. After the student has learned them, try asking them to make their own chart from memory.

, Diagramming sentences is a traditional method of explaining the parts of speech. In a sentence diagram, the parts are visualized on a series of connecting lines to show how the parts of speech relate to one another.


On a horizontal line, write the noun subject and verb of the sentence. Divide these with a vertical line.
Using diagonal lines, connect adjectives and determiners to the noun that they modify and adverbs to the verb or adjective that they modify.
Use dotted lines to link conjunctions with the words that they connect.

Start basic.,
Make a game.,
Introduce tactile activities.,
Sing a song.,
Play Mad Libs.,
Create an obstacle course.",How to Explain Parts of Speech2," Work with children first on the four basic parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. For young children, these will be the concepts that are easiest to grasp. Conjunctions, interjections, determiners, and prepositions are more abstract concepts and therefore difficult for young children.

, Children learn best when they are engaged in an activity. When it comes to grammar and the parts of speech, try making their learning a game. Set out eight paper bags, each labeled with a part of speech. With the child, write down a variety of words on a set of notecards. Ask them to place each word in its correct speech bag. For every word they correctly place, they earn a point., Rather than present grammar as an abstract concept, try using activities that link the parts of speech to objects and actions that the child would use. One such activity can be done with a class or individual child. Write “Noun,” “Adjective” and “Verb” on the board or on a piece of paper. Place an object in a bag. Have a child reach into the bag and--without looking-- feel the object. Ask them what they think it is and write their answer under noun. Ask them what it feels like and write the answer under adjective. Ask them what they would do with it and write their answer under verb. Once you have all of their answers, have them make a sentence using all three of their words., Music helps increase attention and improve memory when learning.Children may find it easier to memorize tricky grammar concepts when it is explained to them in song. There are songs available on the internet or available on children’s music albums. Better yet, try to write a song with your class or child that will engage them in the creation process.


Songs can provide an easier method for children to memorize the more difficult and abstract parts of speech, such as the conjunctions, interjections, prepositions, and determiners.

, Mad Libs is a game where one person asks the other for various parts of speech, before inserting these words into a predesigned story template. What emerges is a funny and nonsensical story. Since Mad Libs requires players to understand parts of speech, you will be testing the child's understanding of grammar. They will be so tickled by the resulting story that they will not notice that you are teaching them.

, This is a fun idea for a large group of children. Gather various outdoor sports equipment (such as hula hoops, cones, jump rope, and balls). Break up the children into groups. Each group must design an obstacle course using sentences that use all of the basic parts of speech: nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. They will describe the obstacle course to the other groups using their sentence, and the other groups must set up and perform the described action.Examples of sentences include:


Quickly twirl in the green hula hoop.
Gently bounce the big ball.
Gracefully jump through the spinning rope.

Learn the parts of speech in your students’ native language.,
Teach parts of speech with vocabulary.,
Do a worksheet.,
Spend more time on determiners.",How to Explain Parts of Speech3," It has been shown that literacy skills in a language learner’s native tongue can improve English proficiency.If you can learn what the parts of speech translate to in the native language of your student or class, you may find it easier to explain it to them. If they know the parts of speech in their own language, they will pick up on the parts of speech in English much more quickly.


If you have a class composed of speakers from many languages, this may be difficult to do. Instead, try asking each student what they would call a verb, noun, etc. in their own language. Have them produce examples of each in their native language before translating them into English.

, Research suggests that vocabulary acquisition is one of the most important parts of learning a language, and strong vocabulary skills can increase the speed at which a learner becomes fluent.As you teach vocabulary, ask your students to mark down the part of the speech of the word on their flashcards or in their notes. When you test vocabulary, ask them to not only define the word but state its part of speech. Students will quickly connect the part of speech with English words.

, Homework can reinforce your lesson and help clarify a subject outside of the classroom. Worksheets can guide a learner through the process of discovering parts of speech in a way that encourages memorization and application. As you explain the parts of speech, walk the learner through the worksheet. They may struggle and ask you questions that were not included in the lesson. After the first few examples, see if they can complete the worksheet on their own.

, Determiners are some of the most difficult parts of speech for non-native speakers to grasp. These short words at the beginning of noun phrases are often forgotten completely. Spend at least one lesson on determiners and reinforce them throughout your lesson plan. You can break up the determiners into specific and general determiners.The specific determiners are used when the listener knows the exact noun the speaker is referring to. For example, in the sentence “That woman was speaking,” the determiner “that” refers to a specific woman known to the speaker and listener. Specific determiners include the definite article (the), possessives (my, your, his, her, its; our, their, whose), demonstratives (this, that, these, those), and interrogative (which).
The general determiners are used with general subjects and nouns which are unfamiliar to the listener. For example, in the sentence, “A woman was speaking,” the determiner “a” refers to an unknown woman. General determiners include the indefinite articles (a/an) and words like any, other, another, or what.

Think on portability.,
Consider buying an MP4 Player instead of an MP3 Player.,
Think on compatibility with portable speakers.,
Think on usability.,
Consider buying some extra earphones.",How to Choose an MP3 Player to Improve Your English," The selected device must be a flash memory-based MP3 player. It's the smallest and lightest and typically allows to store hundreds of audio files. Because it's small and contains no moving parts, it's ideal for carrying while exercising. Generally flash memory-based MP3 players fit in a pocket.;
, Some basic models of MP4 players are cheap. Prices of basic MP4 Players can be similar o just a bit higher than prices of MP3 players.

, This is another key factor. Your ears can become tired just after a little while or one or two hours of being exposed to the direct contact with the ear buds. That is why it's important to check before buying whether the output of the chosen MP3 player can be redirected or not to portable speakers.

, The selected device must be handy. Time is gold. A good model just need to be plugged into the computer in order to get it ready to be used. The ideal model should also be able to get unplugged from your computer just pressing one button, without intervention of the computer's mouse or keyboard. The selected MP3 player must allow doing easily common tasks like these:


Interact with your computer
Increase/decrease the volume
Select a different folder/audio file

, If the earphones included are not good enough, consider buying some extra ones. These are the must-have features:


Portability: Ear buds or earphones are smaller headphones that are placed directly outside of the ear canal, but without fully enveloping it. They are generally inexpensive, portable and convenient.
Volume control included. Generally audio files from different sources have different volume levels. It's important that the level volume can be adjusted easily.

Learn HOMES.,
Remember ""Superman Helps Every One"".,
Recall the Hebrew name for Moses, Moshe.",How to Remember the Five Great Lakes1," HOMES is the most popular mnemonic device used to remember the great lakes. Each letter in HOMES stands for a different lake. If you can remember HOMES (as in, the lakes provide HOMES for many species of birds and fish) you'll be able to remember the five lakes. Here's what each letter stands for:


H is for Huron.
O is for Ontario.
M is for Michigan.
E is for Erie.
S is for Superior.;
, If thinking about a super hero is likely to get your brain's wheels turning, this mnemonic might be the one for you. The first letter of each word in Superman Helps Every One stands for a lake. This lists the lakes geographically from West to East, which can come in handy if you're labeling a map. Remember,


S is for Superior.
M is for Michigan.
H is for Huron.
E is for Erie.
O is for Ontario.

, The name Moshe means ""to pull or draw out of water,"" just as Moses was pulled out of water as a baby. Since there's water involved, remembering the name Moshe might help you remember the lakes. As a reminder,


M is for Michigan.
O is for Ontario.
S is for Superior.
H is for Huron.
E is for Erie.

Learn about Lake Superior.,
Learn about Lake Michigan.,
Learn about Lake Huron.,
Learn about Lake Erie.,
Learn about Lake Ontario.,
Test yourself by looking at a map.",How to Remember the Five Great Lakes2," It's called Superior because it is larger than all of the other Great Lakes combined. This gigantic lake contains 10 percent of all the world's fresh surface water. Lake Superior touches Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ontario, CA, and is the western-most lake of the five.A few more interesting facts:


It's home to 88 species of fish.
It can produce waves as high as 40 feet tall.
Some of the world's oldest rocks can be found on its shore.

, Lake Michigan is the only lake to be located entirely within US borders. It's the third largest lake of the group. Chicago and Milwaukee are two major cities located along the lake.In addition,


The lake is home to a metallic eel species called sea lamprey.
The Petoskey stone, a pebble-shaped coral, is located on its shores, and it's Michigan's state stone.
Since in summer the water is warm enough to swim in, Lake Michigan is sometimes referred to as the United States' third coast.

, This lake has the longest shoreline of all the great lakes. By surface area, it is the second largest great lake and the fifth-largest lake in the world. It is home to 30,000 islands.Also of note:


More than 1,000 shipwrecks have taken place there.
It is named for the Wyandot Indians, or Huron, who used to live there.
The surrounding areas are remote and sparsely populated.

, Lake Erie has the greatest temperature fluctuations of all the great lakes; it's the warmest in the summer, but it freezes over the most often in winter.Many major cities sit along the shore, including Buffalo, NY; Toledo, Ohio; Cleveland, Ohio; and Erie, PA. The lake's main outlet is Niagara Falls. In addition,


The lake played a significant role in the war of 1812.
It has it's own legendary lake monster, named Bessie.
It's home to the Erie Canal, one of the gateways to the west.

, Lake Ontario is the smallest and easternmost lake of the bunch.It lies right at the base of Niagara Falls. It has nearly 2,000 islands, many located in the Thousand Islands region near the US-Canada border. Also of note about this lake:


It has a rich history of commerce and trade.
The area around the lake has the perfect climate for growing fruit trees.
The lake is home to a number of migratory birds.

, Now that you know the great lakes backwards and forwards, look at an unlabeled map and try to figure out which lake is which. Writing down the names and one or two facts about each lake will help cement the five lakes in your memory.

Make a list to guide you.",How to Study for a Geography Exam," The first thing to do is get all the information you can about the exam so that you can best prepare. Make sure you know when it is, so you know how long you’ve got, and you can give yourself time to plan your studies. If possible, find out if the exam is based on essay questions, multiple choice questions, a mixture, or something else.


It’s very helpful to know if you will have to write essay responses in the exam so that you can practice this in your study.;
, Your teacher isn’t going to tell you what questions are going to come up, but be sure you know what you’ll be tested on more generally. Once you know this you can make sure that you have all the notes, maps, and information that were included in your lessons and could come up in the exam. If need be, compare notes with another student to make sure you haven’t missed anything out.

, Before you start it’s helpful to think ahead and set aside time for studying. Clear regular spots in your diary which you can use as time to prepare for your exam. You might find it helpful to study at the same time every evening if you like a very strict routine, but a bit of variety can be useful to break it up so try to keep some flexibility.


You might find it best to study straight after school while you are still in a working frame of mind, so you can switch off later.

, It’s good to have a quiet, secluded spot to avoid being distracted or interrupted when you are studying. This could be your bedroom or the library, or somewhere else. It’s a good idea to study somewhere that you have put aside strictly for studying and isn’t somewhere you use for other things like watching TV or eating.Make sure it is a comfortable place to sit, and ideally somewhere you can leave your studying materials when you’re not working.

, Look through all of your geography notes, and try to organise by particular topics and areas so they are easy to read through and in a good order. By doing this you will also be able to easily identify if you have any gaps from missed classes that you need to get notes on. Be sure that you have all the necessary information in order to study before you start.


If you find that you are missing vital notes, borrow them from a student or ask a teacher for help.

, Once you have organised your class notes you should have a good outline of how much material you need to revise for the exam. Just reading through your notes will give you a picture of which elements you feel more confident on, and which ones you need to focus more time on. When you have done this you can write a revision checklist., With your checklist of areas you need to cover, it’s a good idea to go through this and try to prioritise the things which you think will require more studying. Highlight the facts that you already know, and focus on the ones that you don't. Be sure that you thoroughly understand the information in order to remember it better.

, Once you have organised what you need to study and seen how much time you have until the exam, you can move on and make your studying schedule. Put in things like school and sports that you know you will be doing at certain times and look to see what time is left. Break up the time you have identified for studying into half-hour slots.It’s good to have a brief break after half an hour or twenty minutes so you keep your mind fresh and concentration high.
Limit the time you spend each night studying. Be sure to set aside space for other projects and assignments, as well as other activities.

, Now you have your study time slots and the checklist of material you want to learn you need to bring the two together. Break the main topics down into what you think you can cover in thirty minutes, and write them into your schedule. Each person will have their own preferences, but you could, for example, try thirty minutes on rivers, thirty on weather, thirty on rocks and geology, and so on.If you are uncertain about how to do this you can ask your teacher for some advice.

, Before you hit the books, drink a glass of water and eat a light snack to refresh your body. Turn off any electronic devices, and ask your family members for an hour of quiet time. By freeing your mind and surroundings of any distractions, you'll be able to focus on your studying.

, Geography has quite a lot of special terminology that it is important to get clear in your head. A good way to learn and remember terms and words is by using flashcards. Write one term onto a small piece of card or paper, with the definition and brief explanation written on the other side. Create these as you go all you will build up a good library of cards with key terms which you can then revise easily.


Once you have the cards then pick one at random and try to remember what it means, checking the back if you can’t. Once you have done this a few times you will find you can remember a lot more than before.
For example, you could write “Oxbow Lake” on a card with an explanation of what this is on the reverse side.

, Quite often, geography exams require you to fill out locations and identify countries and cities on maps. Although maps can be difficult to study, there are some useful techniques that can help you to study them effectively and remember them.


Memorize your locations by shapes. For example, Italy can be recognized since it is in the shape of a boot.
Learn the main cities first before focusing on the surrounding, smaller cities.
Create acronyms to help you learn the names of locations.
Listen to the world song by Yakko Warner to help you remember countries.

, You can test some of your knowledge about geography and maps on certain websites. Lizard Point has a number of quizzes that you can do and track your progress. Try it at the beginning of your studying and then every few days until your exam. This will help you to get a clear picture of your progress while also helping you identify areas that you need to do some more work on.


Not everything will apply to you and your exam, so use your judgement to decide if it is useful or not.

, If some of the techniques are working for you better than others, then you might want to focus more time on those ones. By finding the ones that work best for you, you can make studying an easier time. But always keep in mind the big picture of what you want to cover in your studying before the exam. If you are good are maps, you might find that more fun, but don’t neglect the areas where you are less strong, even if you do find it more boring.

, Be sure to take a five minute break every twenty minutes so that you don't exhaust yourself. You might think that studying for two hours straight means you’ve done loads of work, but if you lost concentration and were staring into space half the time, then you have wasted time. If you can revise in shorter bursts your studying will be more effective and you will have time to do things that are more fun.


In these short breaks stand up and move around a bit to release some tension and get your blood moving around more.
Don’t take really long breaks, you could lose your flow and find it harder to get back to work., This can come down to personal preference, but there is research which suggests that listening to music with vocals can lower concentration levels and is best to be avoided when studying.If you find yourself singing along then you’re probably not really focused on your geography.


Researchers have, however, argued that listening to instrumental music, and in particular Mozart, has a beneficial impact on concentration levels., Every now and then you might like to try studying in a small groups with some of your friends and classmates. This can have advantages and disadvantages, and will depend on how well you work together. Obviously if you end up just talking about other things you are not studying your geography, so you need some discipline.


This might be easier for some than others, so if you are trying to work and your friend keeps chatting, try to steer them back on topic and then maybe study on your own in the future.

, One of the big advantages of studying a group is that you can test each other and see where you have gaps. You can do this by using the flashcards you prepared. Pick up a card and read out the term, such as “Igneous rock!” and see who is able to describe and define it more precisely.


This also works with maps. Draw the outline of a country on a piece of paper and use it as a quiz question. Or say the name of the country and see who can draw it.
You can test capital cities in this way too.
You can keep score to make it more fun.

, If your exam has essay questions, it can be very helpful to do a few practice answers and go through them with a friend. Compare how you have approached the question and analyse which of you has best answered the question. Pick out the strengths and weaknesses of each of your approaches, but remember your friend might not be right.


You can ask your teacher if they will look at a practice answer.
You could also ask a parent or older sibling.

, By being faithful and applying yourself to your studies, you'll be able to memorize important facts and do well on the exam. Keep your discipline and stick to your study plan. Remember that you reap what you sow. If you do miss a session, don’t give yourself a really hard-time, but make it up over the next day or two with some extra study.

, By reviewing what you have studied with another person, you'll be able to see how much you know. Ask them to jot down or underline the facts that you aren't familiar with. Also, be open to suggestions from them, as they could come up with good ways to help you memorize facts. It might be helpful to do this with someone who isn’t in your class, like a parent.

, Go over the information that you have studied, highlighting facts that you know as you go. Be sure that you thoroughly understand the notes. Hopefully you will have a good command of the terms on the flashcards by now. If there are any you still can’t remember, put these aside and spend some extra time just on these.

, Although you might know them well, it may become easy to forget them if you have filled your head with other knowledge. You have most likely concentrated on things you were less certain of, but it’s a good idea to have a look through some of the easier things before the exam. While you should not spend all your time going over information that you know, you should not completely ignore them. You will keep it fresh in your mind this way.

, Include the facts that you found easy to study, as well as the ones that you had difficulty with. You can use the list as a reference if you decide to ask a teacher for help. After you have done the exam you can see where you lost marks and whether this matches up with areas you struggled with when you were studying. This experience can help you to study for future geography exams too.

Reinforce your knowledge.",How to Memorize the Canadian Territories and Provinces," You can do this with most variations of a Canadian map. Make sure you can spell their names correctly

, Their names are British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Newfoundland. You may find the acronym BASMOQN ('bas-mok-win') useful. Try creating a mnemonic such as 'Bill and Sally Made One Quart of Nothing', 'Bart A. Simpson Marred Our Quiet Night', or 'Buy Albert's Scary Men on Quilts Now.' Be as creative as you can!

, They are Yukon Territory, Northwest Territory, and Nunavut. The acronyms are YNN (""yin""), ""Why an N?"" (sounds like ""Y-N-N""), and You're Not Naked.

, They are Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Just visualize them as a triangle; Prince Edward Island on top, Nova Scotia in the right corner and New Brunswick in the left corner. Some acronyms are PEI-NB-NS (""pay-noo-bens"") and Please Excuse It, Nobody Brought NeverSoft. (PEI,NBNS).

Try using visual cues while learning to help you remember the continents later.That is, use something like a coloring page of the world to help you visualize where the continents of the world are.,
Write the names of the continents over and over in alphabetical order.,
Learn something about each continent as you go.,
Play a geography game.,
Quiz yourself.,
Use an acrostic as a mnemonic device.An acrostic is when you use the first letters of each word in a phrase to remember the letters or other words.,
Create a ""memory palace"" of the seven continents.,
Learn a continent song or poem.,
Try creating a mental tree.,
Create and memorize a story for the continents.,
Get enough sleep.,
Eat more salmon.,
Learn in the afternoons.,
Keep your brain engaged.,
Take a deep breath.,
Take a walk.",How to Remember the Seven Continents," Coloring, which is both a tactile and visual experience, will help the continents stick in your brain.


Instead of coloring, you could use a geography puzzle to help you learn the continents, which provides a similar experience.;
, Similar to coloring, this task is both tactile and visual. As you go along, try writing it without looking at the previous lists you wrote, which will help commit the continents to memory., By making geography more interesting through other facts, you're more likely to remember what the names of the continents are., You can find games online or in person. You will learn while playing, and you'll be having so much fun you won't even realize how much you are retaining.

, Try using the shapes of continents as flash cards. Write the name on the back of each card in pencil, so you can't see it from the front. Hold up the continent to see if you can remember its name, then check to see if you're correct. Trying to recall will help solidify the continents in your memory.


Alternatively, try listing the continents in alphabetical order to see if you can remember them.

, For instance, one acrostic for remembering continents is ""Eat an apple as a snack."" The ""E"" in ""Eat"" helps you remember ""Europe,"" while the ""AN"" in ""an"" reminds you of ""Antarctica,"" and it continues down the line: ""A"" for ""Australia,"" ""AS"" for ""Asia,"" ""A"" for ""Africa,"" ""N"" for ""North America,"" and ""S"" for ""South America.""An alternative to ""Eat an apple as a snack"" is ""Eat an aspirin after a nighttime snack.Another phrase to help you remember the continents is ""SEAN got three AAAs,"" where ""SEAN"" stands for ""South America, Europe, Asia, and North America"" and ""AAA"" stands for Australia, Antarctica, and Africa., Cicero outlined this method in his De Oratore as a way to memorize material. In Cicero's method, you create a mental map of a physical place in your head. To memorize new material, you attach pieces of information to each room or place in your head, and you retrieve them by walking through the area in your mind. Try creating a mental map for the continents by imaging yourself walking over the globe with one foot landing in each continent every time you step.Attach the name to each continent as you go. When you need to recall the names, walk around the globe again in your head.

, Continent songs attach information to familiar tunes to help you remember it. For instance, you can sing ""I've got the whole globe in my hands. I've got the whole globe in my hands. I've got the whole globe in my hands. I've got Europe, Africa & Asia in my hands. North and South America in my hands. Australia and Antarctica in my hands. I've got the whole globe in my hands."" to the tune of ""He's Got the Whole World in His Hands.""


Alternatively, try memorizing this poem about the seven continents, which reminds you how to remember them in the poem: ""To name the seven continents, think of the letter a,/and when you're down to only one an ""e"" will save the day!/There is Africa, Antarctica, Australia, Asia, too./The oceans run between us, with waters deep and blue./There is also two America's, North and South you see,/and now you're coming to the end, Europe starts with 'E!'"", That is, hang the continents off the tree in your mind. You could try going in order from the smallest at the top to the largest at the bottom. By visualizing the continents and their names, you'll be more likely to recall them later., Use the continents as the names of children in the story or the destinations that a detective visits around the world to help solve a crime. Keep it short, but use enough detail to make it stick in your head., Being sleep deprived can affect your memory. If you get enough sleep, it will help you retain memories as you learn them, and it can also help with recall later., Any food rich in Omega-3s, such as salmon, tuna, walnuts, or Brussels sprouts, is brain food. Though eating a handful of walnuts won't give you the brain power to memorize a phone book in an afternoon, eating these foods over time can increase your memory., Some studies have shown afternoons to be the best time of day to help with fact retention, so try studying the continents in the afternoon instead of the morning or night., Read something challenging. Play a new board game with friends. Try crossword puzzles or sudoku. By keeping your brain engaged in new activities, you'll keep your brain active, which in turn helps memory., Stress can harm your memory recall when the hormone cortisol is released. By staying calm, you can increase both how much you learn in the moment and what you are able to remember later., Exercise has been shown to increase the volume of the hippocampus, which is an area in your brain. That increase in size can help your memory. Getting regular exercise can be beneficial to both body and mind."

Since many people no longer rely on maps to get where they need to go, reading and understanding one may not come naturally to you. Make sure you know what you are looking at, how different features are represented, and what the map can tell you.;
, At its core, it is about people, the places they live, and how these people and places affect each other. To succeed in the bee, you need to learn as much as possible about how culture, society, and politics have evolved across the globe. Geographers have developed different categories for doing this.Physical geography describes the Earth’s physical landscape, including its seasons, climate, soil, water, and land. It also takes into account how human have changed these systems. Climatology, for instance, is a part of physical geography that looks at both the natural world and human behavior.
Human geography is even more interested in humans both affect and are affected by location. It explores where people live and why, as well as how people’s behavior affects those living both around them and across the globe. It also focuses on how beliefs and behaviors travel from one area to another.
Geographic techniques involve different ways of describing and representing the Earth’s landscape and processes. Cartography (map making) has long been an important geographic technique, but today the field also involves data culled from satellites and analyzed by sophisticated computer programs.
Regional geography involves characteristics of the other categories, but its practitioners focus their attention on a specific region. A regional geographer will use different geographic techniques to study the landscapes and people of their chosen region, be it a continent or a city.

, Although the earth’s features usually change slowly, national borders, international relations, and scientific knowledge can change very rapidly—sometimes overnight. Know that any of these developments are fair game in the bee.Newspapers, radio, television, and the Internet are all good sources for news, but make sure your sources are reliable. Consume a wide variety of sources to make sure you are getting the most comprehensive picture possible.

, This will help you learn the kinds of questions to expect and where to focus your studying.


Talk to older students who participated in the bee. What was their most effective study habit? What do they wish they had done differently? Take their advice into consideration when planning your own preparation.
However, don’t think that you can just focus on the same subject areas as other people. Talking to them can give you a sense of the level of detail exam runners will be looking for, but not the content. You’re on your own for that!
Emulate previous years’ winners. 2015 winner Karan Menon has said that he studied for at least one or two hours per day. He also stressed the importance of using different kinds of sources and studying all aspects of geography, including current events., It will be up to you on test day, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get help along the way.


Recruit a parent or other adult to quiz you on bee questions. They will probably be learning something, too.
If you are studying with a group of friends, stage mock bees. Try to mimic the conditions of the bee as closely as possible. The friendly competition will give you practice answering questions under pressure.

, You might want to glance over your notes the night before or the morning of the bee, but do not try to cram. Instead, get a good night’s sleep, and eat a healthy breakfast. Make sure to include some protein for lasting energy—the bee could last for a while, and you want to be at the top of your game.


Many people also find it helpful to get in some physical activity on a big day, even if it’s just jumping rope for ten minutes.

, It’s natural to feel some anxiety before and during a competition. You don’t want your nerves to get the best of you, though.


Know that the better prepared you are, the likelier you are to be relaxed on bee day. This is just one more reason to start studying early and do so regularly.
Think about what is important to you and why. Scientists have found that this is a great way to feel better about yourself and your abilities.Avoid focusing too much on the big picture. Instead, ask yourself what you need to do in that moment—and focus on doing the best job possible with that one task., It’s no secret that public speaking is one of the most common fears out there. Conquering these fears might not be as simple as the old “picture your audience in their underwear” trick, but it can be done.


Remember that the audience is rooting for you. The people in the audience are your friends, family members, neighbors, and teachers. They want you to do well! If you can see the audience, find someone—be it a parent or a stranger—who is smiling or otherwise looks supportive, and focus on them. Don’t obsess over people who look bored or are on their phones. They may not think they are being rude, even though it will certainly seem that way to you. , If you are disappointed in your performance, know that you can try again next year as long as you will still be in 4th-8th grade. Students may participate up to five times total., Only one student from each school will have the opportunity to compete in the state bee. This means that, as a fourth grader, you will be competing against students who have a lot more experience than you do. You will be in their position in a few years, though, so don’t give up.

, If you win your school bee, you may move on to the state bee, but you will not qualify automatically. All school winners will take a test, which will be administered on the computer at your school. You will not be allowed to receive any help on this test. Only those with high enough scores will move onto the state bee.Your parents and school will be contacted if you qualify., State champions will automatically move on to the national championship, held each year in Washington, DC. The winner receives a $50,000 college scholarship, a trip to the Galápagos Islands, $500 in cash, and more. Top finishers also receive prizes.Try to watch videos of previous years’ national bees. This will give you a sense of both the kind of competition you will be up against and the atmosphere you will face if you get that far.

Have students roll the ball to find the city or country listed on the card.You can also have students call out a specific city or country and roll the ball to another student. The other student can then locate the city or country on the world map ball.;
, This game is a fun way for students to learn about landforms around the world. Print out pictures of landforms from all over the world, such as glaciers in Antarctica or the Rocky Mountains in Canada. Then, make bingo cards for students that have the image of each landform. Call out the names of each landform and show them to students so they can mark them off on their bingo cards.The winner of the Bingo game may be given a small geography-related prize.
You can also play this game with the U.S. states or the continents.

, This is a fun, interactive game that can be played by four to five people at a time. Make a large map out of non-slip material or use a map made of rough foam. Then, have students pick out a card with the name of a country. They will have to place their arms or legs on the selected country.The map twister keeps going until someone falls over or gets too tangled up to make any further moves on the map.

, There are many geography board games on the market, made for a range of age levels and educational levels. Some board games focus on U.S. states or famous landmarks around the world. Some games have participants quiz each other on world capitals and landmasses.Look for geography board games online or at your local toy store.
Go for geography board games made for your students’ age range, such as games for age 3 and up for pre-schoolers or games for 12 to 14 year olds for kids in middle school.

, There are also a lot of geography games that students can play online using a computer. These geography games challenge students to use their knowledge of geography to solve problems and get clues to win.Search for online geography games that will suit the age range of your students.
You may also look for online games that focus on specific aspects of geography, such as land masses, capitals, or longitude and latitude.

, Have students create their own world globes out of paper mache. Give them strips of newspaper, water with glue, and a balloon. They can then use colored paints to draw land, water, borders, and land masses on the globe.For a less messy alternative, you can have students create a large map on white paper using colored paper or markers.

, Use a large map or world globe to get students to do mapping activities, such as identifying where their favorite foods come from. For example, if a student likes tacos, they may identify Mexico on the map. If the student likes pizza, they may identify Italy on the map.You can also have students research the most common foods in a certain area on the map, such as popular foods in India or common foods in South Korea.

, Ask students to find famous landmarks like the Great Wall or Stonehedge on the map or globe. Make a list of famous landmarks all over the world and hand the list out to students so they can find them all.This can also be turned into a fun game where students compete to identify all the famous landmarks around the world first. They can do this independently or in teams.

, Use a large map or world globe to get students to identify where they are from. As a fun extra challenge, you may ask students to identify where their parents or guardians are from on the map., This is a fun activity that students can do independently. Give the students supplies like paper, colored pencils, and highlighters. Then, ask them to draw a map of their hometown or their neighborhood. Get them to label major landmarks, streets, roads, and key locations on the map.This is a fun activity to do if you have students that come from different areas or a variety of different places. At the end of the activity, you may have each student present their mini map to the group and discuss each element they put on the map.

, Start by presenting a large map to the students. Then, have them write down their birthday date and month. They will then use the month for latitude and the day for longitude. Have students plot their birthday coordinates on the map.For example, if a student’s birthday is December 4, the coordinates would be 12 degrees N, 4 degrees East.
Students can also make four sets of coordinates for their birthday, using the north or south latitude and the east or west longitude.
Ask students to name the location of their birthday coordinates and then consider, what would it be like to live in the location? Have they traveled to the location before? Would they like to travel there?

, Have students create a map of their neighborhood without using key map elements like a compass rose, any place labels, or a labeling key. Let them draw the map on a piece of paper. Then, have them give the map to another student so they can use the map to reach a particular destination.If the students are under 10 years old, they may need to be accompanied by an adult during the activity.
After the activity is over, ask the students if they found it difficult to use the map to get to the destination and if so, why?
This activity should prompt students to think about the importance of map elements when using a map.

Learn the rules.,
Study which consonants commonly correspond to which numbers.,
Notice that similar sounds are grouped together.,
Practice by taking some words and determining which numbers go with them.,
Take some phone numbers and make words and phrases out of them.,
Break up large numbers into word phrases.",How to Memorize Numbers1," This is also known as the ""consonant system"" or ""phonetic system."" You build associations between each individual number and a sound. Since words are easier to remember than numbers, you construct a word from each group of numbers and then memorize the word(s).The associations you choose to make are up to you. There is no right or wrong answer as long as you continue to make the same associations as you continue to use this technique.;
, Each number is assigned a consonant based on some kind of recognizable relationship between the two:0 - z, s, soft c - ""z"" is the first letter of zero. The others have a similar sound
1 - d, t - t has one downstroke d has as similar sound (some variants include th)
2 - n - n has two downstrokes.
3 - m - three downstrokes, also ""3"" looks like ""m"" on its side
4 - r - last letter of four
5 - l - L is the Roman numeral for 50
6 - j, sh, ch, soft g - a script j has a lower loop / g is almost a 6 rolled around
7 - k, hard c, hard g, q, qu - capital K contains two sevens
8 - f, v - script f looks like a figure-8 (some variants include th)
9 - b, p - P is a mirror-image 9, b sounds similar

, The system goes by sound rather than spelling, and the unused sounds (vowels and the consonants ""w,"" ""h,"" and ""y"") can be put into a word anywhere without changing the value.

, After a few minutes of this, you will know the system.""ledge"" = 56 (sound rather than spelling)
""Editing Memorize Numbers (section)"" = 1123340239400762

, Add vowels between the consonants to make meaningful words. Use your imagination and try to make them funny and outrageous (which will make them easier to remember). After a short while this becomes automatic, and you will be surprised how easy it is to form memorable words out of seemingly random numbers.31415926 (the first 8 digits of pi) = ""my turtle, Pancho""
7713370 (a made up phone number) = ""cooked mom eggs""
Break that into chunks. Try the following game:-
Two phone number are given. Say which is easier to remember. After that, remember the following number.
It may be hard for you to remember.















, If the number is very large, break it up into a series of words, and then memorize the list of words using any of the following techniques:How to Memorize Lists Using the Pure Link System

Learn the rules.,
Convert each individual number into a letter.,
Divide the letters into pairs.,
Associate each pair with a person with those initials.,
Associate each person with a particular action.",How to Memorize Numbers2," Like in the major system, you assign each number a letter, although the associations are arbitrary. After converting the numbers to letters, you associate those letters with people and actions in the form of a story., Choose common letters that will be easy to make associations with. Consider using the following examples:A
B
C
D
E
S
G
H
N
O

, Mentally breaking up the sequencing of a longer number into several pairs of numbers will help you remember it more easily. For example: 827645 = HB GS DE

, Try to think of someone you know with those initials. Connecting your memory of the person to the image of the number will make it stick in your mind more firmly., Again, this is a way to increase the ease with which you’ll be able to remember the numbers. Association is key here. Link the number pair to some action that will be easier to remember than just a random list of numbers.When assigning meanings to each pair of numbers, alternate between people and actions.

"
Learn the rules.,
Choose numbers that work with this method.,
Create simple math problems to help you remember numbers.",How to Memorize Numbers3," Using simple math problems can be a great way to help your mind remember longer numbers. By associating the sequence of numbers into a logical mathematical equation, it can be a foolproof way to memorize numbers.


Of course, this method really only works for numbers that you can choose yourself because not all number sequences will also function as a math equation.

, For passwords, PIN, and phone numbers choose sets of numbers that can be made into simple math problems. This way you can memorize them without substituting letters for the original numbers.

, Think of numbers that also function as math equations and choose those. You can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions – basically any kind of math problem you want – as long as it helps you remember the number sequence.For example, 5420 is easily remembered as 5x4=20 or ""five times four equals twenty.""
Example: 62311 or 6+2+3=11
Example: 21293 or 21=2x9+3

Use a carat (^) to enter exponents in Excel.,
Use “E+” to show scientific notation.,
Use double asterisks in Excel as a shortcut for scientific notation.,
Use double asterisks to write exponents in some programming languages.",How to Write Exponents," When a number is multiplied by itself any repeated number of times, you can use an exponent as a shortcut. The exponent shows the number of times that the base is being multiplied. This rule applies to any base, whether it is a number, a variable, or even a mathematical expression. Look at the following examples:2∗2∗2=23{\displaystyle 2*2*2=2^{3}}


5∗5∗5∗5=54{\displaystyle 5*5*5*5=5^{4}}


7∗7=72{\displaystyle 7*7=7^{2}}


10∗10∗10∗10∗10∗10∗10=107{\displaystyle 10*10*10*10*10*10*10=10^{7}}


x∗x∗x=x3{\displaystyle x*x*x=x^{3}}


(x+2)(x+2)(x+2)=(x+2)3{\displaystyle (x+2)(x+2)(x+2)=(x+2)^{3}}
;
, When numbers with exponents are multiplied by each other, you can represent the result easily by adding the exponents together. The base number remains unchanged. This rule only applies if the bases are the same. See these examples:32∗34=3(2+4)=36{\displaystyle 3^{2}*3^{4}=3^{(2+4)}=3^{6}}


54∗51=5(4+1)=55{\displaystyle 5^{4}*5^{1}=5^{(4+1)}=5^{5}}


103∗103=10(3+3)=106{\displaystyle 10^{3}*10^{3}=10^{(3+3)}=10^{6}}


x5∗x2=x(5+2)=x7{\displaystyle x^{5}*x^{2}=x^{(5+2)}=x^{7}}


(a−3)2∗(a−3)4=(a−3)(2+4)=(a−3)6{\displaystyle (a-3)^{2}*(a-3)^{4}=(a-3)^{(2+4)}=(a-3)^{6}}


34∗25=34∗25{\displaystyle 3^{4}*2^{5}=3^{4}*2^{5}}…. (Because the bases are different, there is no change.)


, When numbers with exponents are divided, you can find the result by subtracting exponents. The base number remains unchanged. This rule only applies if the bases are the same. See these examples:3632=3(6−2)=34{\displaystyle {\frac {3^{6}}{3^{2}}}=3^{(6-2)}=3^{4}}


5853=5(8−3)=55{\displaystyle {\frac {5^{8}}{5^{3}}}=5^{(8-3)}=5^{5}}


x10x4=x(10−4)=x6{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{10}}{x^{4}}}=x^{(10-4)}=x^{6}}


x5y4=x5y4{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{5}}{y^{4}}}={\frac {x^{5}}{y^{4}}}}…. (Because the bases are different, there is no change.)


, Whenever a base number has a negative exponent, that number should be read as the reciprocal of the base. Thus, (12)−1=2{\displaystyle ({\frac {1}{2}})^{-1}=2}. The negative exponent does not make the number negative. If the negative exponent appears in the denominator of a fraction, then the reciprocal would move the base number into the numerator. Consider the following examples:4−2=142=116{\displaystyle 4^{-2}={\frac {1}{4^{2}}}={\frac {1}{16}}}


5−3=153=1125{\displaystyle 5^{-3}={\frac {1}{5^{3}}}={\frac {1}{125}}}


12−2=22=4{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2^{-2}}}=2^{2}=4}


(12)−2=22=4{\displaystyle ({\frac {1}{2}})^{-2}=2^{2}=4}


x−42=12x4{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{-4}}{2}}={\frac {1}{2x^{4}}}}


, When you have a base with an exponent, and then that is raised to another exponent, you find the solution by multiplying the exponents together. The base remains unchanged, as in the following examples:(24)3=2(4∗3)=212{\displaystyle (2^{4})^{3}=2^{(4*3)}=2^{12}}


(53)3=5(3∗3)=59{\displaystyle (5^{3})^{3}=5^{(3*3)}=5^{9}}


(x2)5=x(2∗5)=x10{\displaystyle (x^{2})^{5}=x^{(2*5)}=x^{10}}


, Any exponent that is a fraction indicates that you are to find the root of the base number that corresponds to the denominator of the fraction. For example, an exponent of 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} means you are to find the square root of the base number. An exponent of 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}} means you are to find the cube root of the base number. A number in the numerator of a fraction exponent works an a regular exponent would. Thus, a fractional exponent can mean both a root and a power at the same time. See these examples:


x12=x{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{2}}={\sqrt {x}}}


x13=x3{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{3}}={\sqrt{x}}}


x32=x3{\displaystyle x^{\frac {3}{2}}={\sqrt {x^{3}}}}


x23=x23{\displaystyle x^{\frac {2}{3}}={\sqrt{x^{2}}}}


332=33=27=33{\displaystyle 3^{\frac {3}{2}}={\sqrt {3^{3}}}={\sqrt {27}}=3{\sqrt {3}}}


, Scientific notation is a way of representing numbers that are based on powers of 10. You can understand scientific notation much easier if you become familiar with several of the powers of 10:100=one{\displaystyle 10^{0}={\text{one}}}


101=ten{\displaystyle 10^{1}={\text{ten}}}


102=one hundred{\displaystyle 10^{2}={\text{one hundred}}}


103=one thousand{\displaystyle 10^{3}={\text{one thousand}}}


106=one million{\displaystyle 10^{6}={\text{one million}}}


109=one billion{\displaystyle 10^{9}={\text{one billion}}}


1012=one trillion{\displaystyle 10^{12}={\text{one trillion}}}

Note that these are the American terms for the multiples of ten. In Britain or countries following the British system, 109 is called a “thousand million” or a “milliard,” and 1012 is called a “billion.” In the British system, a “trillion” doesn’t happen until 1018.


, When you have a very large or very small number that you wish to express in scientific notation, the first step is to write the first digit of the number in the “ones” column. Then put down a decimal point, followed by any other numbers.For example, to begin writing 93,850,000 in scientific notation, set the first digit, 9, in the ones column, followed by a decimal point and the remaining numbers. This will look like 9.385. You can drop any zeroes that appear at the end.

For very small decimals, do the same thing, but drop any leading zeroes. Thus, the number 0.00000002457 would be written as 2.457.


, To finish the scientific notation number, count the number of digits in the original number and write that as the power of 10.In the example of 93,850,000, after placing the decimal after the 9, there are seven following digits, the 3,8,5,0,0,0, and 0. Therefore, the final number in scientific notation is 9.385 x 107.

For decimals, count the number of spaces from the original decimal point to the new position of the decimal point, and use that number for the exponent. In this case, the exponent will be negative. For the example of 0.00000002457, the new decimal will be placed after the 2, so there are eight spaces before it - the seven zeroes and the 2. Therefore, the number in scientific notation will be 2.457 x 10-8.


, When you are working on a document in Microsoft Word and want to print an exponent, first type the base number. Then select the “Home” tab. In the “Font” section of the toolbar, select the superscript function, which appears on the toolbar as “X2.” Type your exponent and it will appear in the appropriate position. Click the superscript button again to turn it off and return to regular typescript.An alternate way to do the same thing is to type your base and your exponent as regular numbers. Use your mouse to highlight the exponent and, while highlighted, then click on the exponent button on the toolbar. The number will automatically move into the exponent position.


, When you are entering a function in Excel and wish to enter an exponent, use the ^ symbol between the base number and the exponent. Excel will not actually print the exponent as a superscript number, but it will mathematically interpret the ^ symbol to work as an exponent.For example, to indicate 2*2*2, which is two to the third power, you would write 2^3. Excel will interpret this as the value 8.

To write the number 52 in Excel, you will enter 5^2. This will then print as the value of 5*5, which is 25.

LaTeX is a typesetting program used commonly in academia. LaTeX also uses the ^ to indicate exponents. If the exponent involves more than a single character, the exponent is set off with braces. Thus, 223 would be written as 2^{23}., In Excel, and on some handheld calculators, the notation “E+” is used to write numbers in scientific notation. First, print the number using a single decimal place, then the E+, followed by the exponent for the power of 10.For example, to express the number 85,420,000, begin with 8.542. Then follow immediately with E+ and the power of ten, which is 7. The final number will appear as 8.542E+7.

Texas Instruments calculators use this system for scientific notation but do not use the “+” symbol along with the E. Therefore, a number like 92,000,000 would appear simply as 9.2E7.


, A shortcut format for writing a number in scientific notation in Excel is to use the double asterisk. First write the base number, with or without decimal places. Follow that immediately with ** and then the number that represents the exponent for the power of ten.

For example, to write 4.25x104 in an Excel cell, you can type 4.25**4.

To write 3.16x108 in Excel, you can type 3.16**8.


, FORTRAN is a popular scientific programming language. In FORTRAN and other similar programming languages, you write an exponent using a double asterisk. Write the base number first, then two asterisks (with no spaces), and then the exponent. The program will interpret the number following the double asterisks as the exponent.For example, 10**3 will be read as 103.

2**4 will be read as 24.

Examine and study thoroughly the nautical chart of the specific waters you will be navigating before setting sail.
,
Note your starting point and examine your route, making mental note of any nautical hazards or geographical features you may come across on your journey.,
Notice all buoys and markers as you encounter them; then keep track of their numbers as they appear.,Look for objects noted on the nautical chart that will be visible so you can confirm your location as you make your trip.,
Know your boat's draft--the depth from the water line to the bottom of the hull or keel--so you do not venture into water that is too shallow for your vessel.,
Know your boat's height when it is sitting in the water--especially if it is a sailboat or has a bridge--so you will know whether your boat can clear the bottom of bridges and power lines.,Know your hull's beam or width so you will know if you can navigate locks or narrow bridges, which are noted on nautical charts.,
Note that water depths on charts are denoted by a simple number.,
Watch for buoys and markers on the charts and as you navigate as they are some of the most important navigational features.,
Measure distance on a nautical chart from the legend.,Visit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) web site at http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/ to familiarize yourself with nautical charts.",How to Read a Nautical Chart,", If you are sailing in unfamiliar waters, write notes on geographical or waterscape features noted on the nautical chart so you are prepared for upcoming hazards., Once that is done it won't be necessary to locate buoys or markers on the small print of a nautical chart.,, Water depth is noted on nautical charts., Nautical charts show heights of features that boats must clear.,, If you are in U.S. waters, the number will be in feet. Contour lines give an approximation of where water is getting shallower or deeper., As an example of how buoys are marked, the chart will note a red buoy flashing every 4 seconds at night and measuring 33 feet (10.1 m) tall, visible for 4 miles (6.4 km) and sounding its horn every 15 seconds as follows: FL R 4sec 33 feet (10.1 m) 4M ""2"" HORN. Or, the designation FL G 4sec 10 feet (3.0 m) 4M ""1"" denotes a green buoy that flashes every 4 seconds at night. The buoy is 10 feet (3.0 m) tall, is visible for 4 miles (6.4 km) and carries the number 1.

Look on the back of the nautical chart to see many of the symbols noted on the front of the chart.

, On U.S. nautical chart legends, 1 nautical mile is about 1.5 inches (3.81 cm). A nautical mile is 6,076 feet (2,000 m) (1,852 m).,"

Pick a binary number.",How to Read Binary2," Let's use 101. Here is the same method but in a slightly different format. You may find this format easier to understand.









101= (1X2) power of 2 + (0X2) power of 1 + (1X2) power 0
101= (2X2) + (0X0) + (1)
101= 4 + 0 + 1
101= 5

The 'zero' is not a number, but its place value must be noted.

Find your number.,
Read from right to left.,
Add the values of the ones.,
Translate the value into letters or punctuation marks.",How to Read Binary3," The example we'll use is 00101010.








, With each slot, the values are doubled. The first digit from the right has a value of 1, the second is a 2, then a 4, and so on.








, The zeros are assigned their correlating number, but those numbers are not added.









So, in this example, add 2, 8, and 32. The result is 42.

Convert difficult to add numbers to easy to add numbers.,
Convert addition to multiplication.,
Cancel Additive Opposites.",How to Do Number Sense (Mental Math)1,"


Round the number (to be added) up to the next highest multiple of ten.
Add to the other number.
Subtract the amount rounded up.

Example 88 + 56 = ? ; Round 88 up to 90.
Add 90 to 56 = 146
Subtract the two added to 88 (to round up to 90).
146 - 2 = 144 ; the answer!
This process is simple reframing of the problem as 56 + (90 -2 ). Examples of other usages of this technique: 99 = (100 - 1); 68 = (70 - 2)
You can use a similar reframing technique for subtraction, too.

;
, Multiplication is addition of multiple occurrences of the same number.


Note how many times a number to be added is repeated.

For example:
7 + 25 + 7 +7 +7 =
becomes 25 + (4 × 7) =
25 + 28 = 53



, Additive opposites can be +7 - 7.
Additive opposites can also be 5 - 2 + 4 - 7.


Look for numbers that add or subtract for a total of 0. Using the example above: (NOTE: The picture above is wrong. It shows 5 + 9 = 9 <--> -2 -7 = 9 when it should be 5 + 4 = 9 <--> -2 -7 = -9)
5 + 4 = 9 is the additive opposite of -2 -7 = -9
Since they are additive opposites, no actual addition of all four numbers is needed; the answer is 0 (zero) by cancelling.

Try this:
4 + 5 - 7 + 8 - 3 + 6 - 9 + 2 =
becomes:(4 + 5) - 9 + ( -7 - 3) + (8 + 2) + 6 = By grouping
and remember, don't add them; just remove additive opposites from the problem.
0 + 0 + 6 = 6

Understand the basic formula, often expressed as z = z2 + c. This simply means that, for each point in the Mandelbrot universe we wish to see, we keep calculating z until one of two conditions occur; then we color it to show how many calculations we made.,
Get 3 different-colored pencils, or crayons, or felt-tipped markers, plus a black pencil or pen to make the outline.,
With the black marker, draw a large tic-tac-toe board, 3 by 3 squares, on a piece of paper.

,
Label (also in black) the middle square (0, 0).,
Calculate the first pass, or iteration, of the formula.,
Let's try a square 3 times bigger, 9 by 9, but still keeping a maximum of 3 iterations.

,
Start with the 3rd row down, because that's where it gets interesting right away.,
Continue calculating each cell until it has escaped, or you have reached the maximum number of iterations (the number of colors you're using: 3 in this example), at which point you color it.,
Iterate the same matrix again with more colors (iterations) to reveal the next few layers, or better, draw up a much larger matrix for a longer-term project!",How to Plot the Mandelbrot Set By Hand," Don't worry! This will become clear in the following steps.;
, The reason we want three colors is because we'll make a first approximation with no more than 3 iterations (passes, or in other words, applying the formula up to 3 times per point):

,, This is the constant (c) value of the point in the exact center of the square. Now let's say each square is 2 units wide, so add and/or subtract 2 to/from the x and y values of each square, with x being the first number and y being the second number. When done, it will look like what you see displayed here. Whenever you follow the cells across, the y-values (the second number) should be the same; whenever you follow the cells down, the x-values (the first number) should be the same.

, You, as the computer (actually, the original meaning of the word was ""a person who computes"") can do this yourself. Let's start with these assumptions:
The starting z value of each square is (0, 0). When the absolute value of z, for a given point, is greater than or equal to 2, that point (and its corresponding square) is said to have escaped the Mandelbrot set. When that happens, you will color the square according to the number of iterations of the formula you have applied to that point.






Choose the colors you will use for pass 1, pass 2, and pass 3. Let's assume red, green, and blue, respectively, for purposes of this article.






Calculate the value of z for the top-left corner of the tic-tac-toe board, assuming a starting z value of 0+0i or (0, 0) (see Tips for a better understanding of these representations). We are using the formula z = z2 + c as outlined in the first step. You will quickly see that, in this case, z2+c is simply c, since zero squared is still zero. And what is c for this square? (-2, 2).






Determine the absolute value of this point; the absolute value of a complex number (a, b) is the square root of a2 + b2. Now, since we'll be comparing this to a known value: 2, we can avoid taking square roots by comparing a2 + b2 to 22, which we know equals 4. In this calculation, a = -2 and b = 2.






(2 + 22) =
(4 + 4) =
8, which is greater than 4.


It has escaped the Mandelbrot set after the first calculation, since its absolute value is greater than 2. Color it with the pencil you chose for pass 1.












Do the same for each square on the board, except for the center square, which will not escape the Mandelbrot set by the 3rd pass (nor will it ever escape). So you've only used two colors: the pass 1 color for all the outer squares, and the pass 3 color for the middle square.

,,
The first element, (-2, 1) is greater than 2 (because (-2)2 + 12 turns out to be 5) so let's paint that one red, as it escapes the Mandelbrot set on the first pass.






The second element, (-1.5, 1) turns out not to be greater than 2. Applying the formula for absolute value, x2+y2, with x = -1.5 and y = 1:






(-1.5)2 = 2.25
12 = 1
2.25 + 1 = 3.25, less than 4, so the square root is less than 2.


So we move on to our second pass, calculating z2+c using the shortcut (x2-y2, 2xy) for z2 (see Tips for how this shortcut is derived), still with x = -1.5 and y = 1:





(-1.5)2 - 12 becomes 2.25 - 1, which becomes 1.25;
2xy, since x is -1.5 and y is 1, becomes 2(-1.5), which yields -3.0;
This gives us a z2 of (1.25, -3)
Now add c for this cell (add x to x, y to y) yielding (-0.25, -2)


Let's test if its absolute value is now greater than 2:. Calculate x2 + y2:






(-.25)2 = .0625
-22 = 4
.0625 + 4 = 4.0625, the square root of which is greater than 2, thus it has escaped after the second iteration: our first green!
As you become familiar with the calculations, you'll sometimes be able to tell which ones escape the Mandelbrot set just by glancing at the numbers. In this example, the y component has a magnitude of 2, which when squared and added to the squared value of the other number, will be greater than 4. Any number greater than 4 will have a square root greater than 2. See the Tips below for a more detailed explanation.


The third element, with a c value of (-1, 1) does not escape the first pass: since both 1 and -1 when squared is 1, x2+y2 is 2. So we calculate z2+c, using the shortcut (x2-y2, 2xy) for z2:






(-1)2-12 becomes 1-1, which is 0;
2xy is then 2(-1) = -2;
z2 = (0, -2)
adding c we get (0, -2) + (-1, 1) = (-1, -1)


That's still the same absolute value as before (the square root of two, about 1.41); continuing with a third iteration:






(2)-(2) becomes 1-1, which is 0 (yet again)...
but now 2xy is 2(-1)(-1), which is positive 2, yielding a z2 value of (0, 2)
adding c we get (0, 2) + (-1, 1) = (-1, 3), which has an a2 + b2 of 10, much greater than 4.


Thus this one also escapes. Color the cell in with your third color, blue, and move on to the next one, since we have completed three iterations with this point.






The fact that we're using only three colors becomes apparent as a problem here, since something that escapes after only 3 iterations is colored the same as (0, 0) which never escapes; obviously we still won't see anything close to the Mandelbrot ""bug"" at this level of detail.



, Here's how the 9 by 9 matrix looks after 3 iterations on each square...Looks like we're onto something!

, You get more accurate pictures by:






Increasing the number of cells; this has 81 cells per side. Note the similarity to the 9 by 9 matrix above, but the much smoother edges on the circle and oval.






Increasing the number of colors (iterations); this has 256 shades each of red, green, and blue for a total of 768 colors compared to 3. Note that you can now see the outline of the well-known Mandelbrot ""lake"" (or ""bug"", depending on how you look at it). The downside is the amount of time it takes; if you can calculate each iteration in 10 seconds, that's about 2 hours for each cell in, or close to, the Mandelbrot lake. Though that's a relatively small part of the 81 by 81 matrix, it would still probably take a year to complete it, even if you worked on it for several hours each day. This is where the silicon type of computer comes in handy.

Find the length to the nearest tenth of a centimeter.",How to Measure Centimeters1," Many rulers have two sets of numbers. You are looking for the metric set of numbers. This side of the ruler will be labeled cm{\displaystyle cm}, the abbreviation for centimeters.It might also be labeled mm{\displaystyle mm}, the abbreviation for millimeters.

Millimeters are the smaller metric units shown on the ruler by the shorter lines in between the centimeters.The other side of the ruler is the standard side of the ruler. It will show inches, which is the standard U.S. unit.
;
, If you look closely at your ruler, you will see that each centimeter is divided into 10 parts by the shorter lines. A millimeter is one-tenth of a centimeter.Note that 1 mm = 0.1 cm.


, Note that the edge of the physical ruler often does not align with the beginning of the first centimeter. So take care to align the object to the first line, not to the edge of the ruler.Keep the ruler as flat against the measured side of the object as possible.


, Look at the other edge of the object. Identify the nearest mark to that edge. This mark will tell you how long the object is. 

If the edge falls on a longer centimeter line marked with a whole number, the object is that many centimeters long. For example, if the edge of an eraser ends at the line marked 7, the eraser is 7 cm long.

If you are measuring to the nearest centimeter, look for the nearest line to the edge of the object that is marked with a number. This mark will tell you the nearest centimeter. For example, an eraser might fall less than halfway between the 7 and 8 cm marks. Since the eraser ends closer to the 7 cm mark, you would say that, to the nearest centimeter, the eraser is 7 centimeters long.


, Look at the last whole centimeter the edge of the object passes. Then, count the number of millimeters past the last whole centimeter that the object’s edge goes. Each millimeter is one-tenth of a centimeter. So, to find the length, combine the number of whole centimeters and tenths of a centimeter.For example, if the edge of an eraser ends 1 millimeter past 7 centimeters, the eraser is 7.1 centimeters long.

The easiest objects to use are a standard pencil, pen, or highlighter. The width of a pencil is close to 1 cm.

Other options include the length of a staple, the width of five CDs or DVDs stacked together, the thickness of a standard notepad, and the radius of a U.S. penny., Make sure that the entire item fits on the paper. Mark its starting edge with a pencil or pen.

The paper needs to be light in color so that you can clearly see the marks being made.


, Line up one edge of your measuring object with the starting edge of the item you are measuring.

For example, if you are using the width of a pencil to estimate centimeters, place the pencil perpendicular to the item being measured, so that its eraser or unsharpened point lies flat against the edge being measured. One side of the pencil should be flush against the starting edge of the measured item.


, Being careful not to move it, make a small mark against the inside edge of the measuring object with a pencil or pen.
, Pick up the measuring object and re-position it so that its opposite edge now lies on the mark previously created. Make another mark on the inside edge of the measuring object.

Make sure that the measuring object is flat against the side of the item being measured each time you shift its position. The item being measured must remain in the same position the entire time.

, In 1 foot there are 30.48 centimeters. So, to convert feet to centimeters, multiply the number of feet by 30.48.For example, to convert 7.2 feet to centimeters, you would calculate 7.2×30.48=219.46{\displaystyle 7.2\times 30.48=219.46}. So, 7.2 feet is equivalent to 219.46 centimeters.


, A yard is 3 feet. Since there are 30.48 centimeters in 1 foot, the amount of centimeters in a yard is triple that: 91.44. To convert yards to centimeters, multiply the number of yards by 91.44.

For example, to convert 3.51 yards to centimeters, you would calculate 3.51×91.44=320.96{\displaystyle 3.51\times 91.44=320.96}. So, 3.51 yards is the same length as 320.96 centimeters.

","How to Create a Matrix, Vector, and Cell Array in MATLAB"," A matrix is a rectangular set of numbers that are arranged in multiple rows and columns. Code a matrix by listing a series numbers separated by spaces or commas per row within the command window. For a new row, a semi colon is placed between the values of the old row and new row. The matrix is finished by surrounding it by brackets. Hit enter when finished to display the matrix.

Example: M=or M=;
, Type commands such as zeros or ones to create a matrix with only one value within it. Follow these commands by the number of rows then the number of columns separated by a comma and surrounded by parenthesis.

Example: zeros(# of rows, # of columns)






Example: ones(# of rows, # of columns)






Edit a ones matrix. You can multiply a ones matrix by any number to create a new matrix in which all the elements are the value which the ones matrix was multiplied by.







, A vector is a set of numbers that are arranged in a single row or single column. Code a horizontal vector by listing a series of numbers in the vector that are separated by spaces or commas and surrounded by brackets. Hit enter once completed the code to display the vector.

Example: V=or V=, Start by listing a series of numbers that are separated by semicolons and surrounded by brackets. Hit enter once completed the code to display the vector.

Example: V=, Type commands such as zeros or ones to create a horizontal or vertical vector with only one value within it. Follow these commands by the number of rows then the number of columns separated by a comma and surrounded by parenthesis.

Example: zeros(# of rows, # of columns)






Example: ones(# of rows, # of columns)






Edit a ones vector. You can multiply a ones vector by any number to create a new vector in which all the elements are the value which the ones vector was multiplied by.







, A pattern is a list of numbers that follow a certain rule or sequence. Type the colon operator or the linspace command. A colon operator focuses on a specific increment that the pattern follows while the linspace command focuses on the number of variables within the pattern that are have the same increment between them.

Use a colon operator. Type the first number of pattern, increment between the values, and last number of the pattern all separated by colons. Hit enter once code is completed.






Use linspace command. Type linspace then first number in pattern, last number in the pattern, total number of equally spaced values separated by commas and surrounded by parenthesis. Hit enter once the code is completed.







, A cell array is a rectangular set of data similar to a matrix but it can hold any type of data such as text, numbers, and/or vector. Code a cell array by listing a series of numbers, vectors, or characters in the same format as a matrix while characters are in quotation marks and vectors are in brackets. The cell array is surrounded by curly brackets { }. Hit enter once the code is completed.

Example: C={1, ‘h’, 5, 7; , ‘m’, 8, 25} or C={1 ‘h’ 5 7; ‘m’ 8 25}

Discover your circumference formula: The diameter can be curved and placed end to end around the circle, about three times--meaning that: three diameters plus a small fraction of diameter = Circumference.,

Measure accurately around each of the four circular items by wrapping a string snugly around it.,
Straighten and measure the part of the string that you marked as the distance around the circle.,

Measure across each circle exactly through the center of each of the four items with a straight edge measure (meter-stick, yardstick or ruler).,
Divide each circumference by the same circle's diameter.,
Average the four answers to the division problem by adding those four quotients and dividing by 4, and that should give a more accurate result (for example, if your four divisions gave you: 3.1 + 3.15 + 3.1 + 3.2 = ____ /4 = ____?,

, Mark the distance one time around it on the string. This is the circumference: it's just like perimeter, but, the perimeter of a circle--the distance around a circle--is called the circumference, not perimeter, usually.

, Write down your measurement of the circumference using decimals.
Pin or tape the ends of the string for measuring it accurately (straight and extended to its full measure), since you would have needed to tighten the string around the circular object, so now you would tighten it lengthwise.

Note: Multiplying two times radius, i.e.: ""2 X radius = diameter"" is also written as ""2r = d"".

, The four division problems of C / d = _____, should be about 3 or 3.1 (or about 3.14 if your measurements are accurate); so what is pi: It's a number. It's a ratio. It relates diameter to circumference. Of course, using precise measurements using dividers, which are similar to a compass can help.

, That's 12.55 / 4 = 3.1375, and can be rounded-off to 3.14).
That's the idea of ""pi"". The number of diameters that makes the circumference (all the time, so it's constant)... That is the constant ""pi"". That number of diameters.


Also, the radius will fit a little more than 6 (2 times pi) times around a circle, as well as knowing that the diameter goes three times; so, that implies a circumference formula C = 2 X 3.14 X r, which is just = 3.14 X d ... by using 2r is d (""Got it"", nod yes. ""Yeah!"" But, read and think over it again until it really soaks in, if it's not yet crystal clear).

, Do this for each of the containers. The left-over piece of string from each of the circumference strings cut-outs will be approximately the same length. The measurement length of this short piece of string should be .1415 which is just an example of getting approximately 3.14..."

When you’re done, divide the number of crosses by 2 and divide the number of tosses by that.",How to Calculate Pi by Throwing Frozen Hot Dogs," There are a couple of qualifications. First, it must be long, thin, hard, and straight, like a frozen hot dog, for example. Second, it must be a reasonably stiff item. Third, it should be somewhere between 15 to 20 cm (6-8 inches) long; the experiment can be performed otherwise, but read on, and you will see why this size is optimal. There are lots of other items that fit these criteria including Otter Pops, celery, and churros. (If you simply can't come to grips with throwing perfectly good food, see the Tips section for some additional ideas.)

, You will probably need about 180-300 cm (6-10 feet) in front of you, as you will be throwing straight ahead.

, The place at which you are throwing should be devoid of objects that your food item could possibly run in to. So, if you are throwing in your kitchen, consider moving the table into another room or at least throwing in such a way that your food won't hit the table during its flight., A tape measure should do the trick. Be as accurate as you can, even down to the millimeter, for best results. Since length is a factor, it’s best to choose food items that are all the same size. If you’ve chosen something that isn’t naturally uniform, such as celery sticks, cut them evenly beforehand.

, The strips should be perpendicular to the direction you will be throwing. If your item is 15-45 cm (6-18 inches) long, lay down about 6-10 strips; lay down fewer if longer and more if shorter.

, The ""Tosses"" column is where you’ll keep track of how many times you throw your food item. The ""Crosses"" column is where you’ll keep track of how many times your item lands across one of the lines. (Note that landing is not the same thing as bouncing.)

, Throw just one item at a time. Once it is at rest, observe whether or not it is crossing one of the lines. If it is, put a tick under ""Crosses"" and a tick under ""Tosses."" If it isn't, just put a tick under ""Tosses."" When you’ve run out of hot dogs, pick them up and re-use them, making sure to throw from the same position. Repeat this as many times as you like. You should start seeing some interesting results by around 100 to 200 throws. (This doesn't take as long as it sounds.)

, For example, if you threw 300 times, and it crossed 191 times, you would calculate 300/(191/2). And, to your amazement, you will now have an approximation for pi!

Understand interest.,
Pay attention to the time period for each loan.,
Don't forget the principal.,
Learn the difference between simple interest and compound interest.",How to Calculate Simple Interest2," Why does interest exist? The person lending money is giving up other uses for that money until the loan is repaid. The interest is supposed to make up for the fact that the lender could have spent that money in ways the brought in extra value., Interest accumulates over regularly-spaced periods of time. For annual interest the time periods are years, but the terms of the loan could use months, weeks, or days. The shorter the period of time, the more often interest gets added to the loan.

This can make a huge difference. A loan with annual interest adds the interest rate ten times in ten years. A loan with monthly interest adds the same interest rate 120 times in ten years:

 10 years×12 months1 year=120{\displaystyle 10\ {\text{years}}\times {\frac {12\ {\text{months}}}{1\ {\text{year}}}}=120}




, When a loan is paid off, the borrower doesn't only have to pay the interest — they must also pay back the principal that was borrowed. The sum of the interest generated plus the principal is also known as the ""future value,"" or the ""maturity value"" of the loan., You've just calculated simple interest, in which you only pay interest on the principal you borrowed. Many credit cards and other loans, however, utilize compound interest, where the interest you owe gathers interest of its own. Compound interest can result in much higher interest over time than simple interest. Calculating compound interest requires a different formula. Here's a side-by-side comparison of the two systems:

You take a loan out for $100 at 30% simple interest. You'll owe $30 interest after the first time period, $60 after the second, $90 after the third, and $120 after the fourth.

You take out a second loan of $100 at 30% compound interest. You'll owe $30 interest after the first time period, then $69, then $119.70, then $285.61.

Multiple other factors can come into play when calculating more complex forms of interest, including credit risk and inflation.

Separate the characteristic and the mantissa.,
Use the antilog table to find a corresponding value for your mantissa.,
Find the value from the mean difference columns.,
Add the values obtained in the previous steps.,
Insert the decimal point.",How to Do Antilog1," Consider the number under observation. The characteristic is the part that comes before the decimal point; the mantissa is the part that comes after the decimal point. Antilog tables are arranged with respect to these parameters, so you need to separate them.


As an example, say you need to find the antilog for 2.6452. The characteristic is 2, and the mantissa is 6452.;
, Antilog tables are easily available; you may have one in the back of your mathematics textbook. Open the table and look for the row number consisting of the first two digits of the mantissa. Then find the column number equal to the third digit of the mantissa.


In the example above, you would open the antilog table and find the row number beginning with .64, then the column for 5. In this case, you would find that the corresponding value is 4416.

, The antilog table also includes a set of columns known as “mean difference columns.” Look at the same row as before (the row corresponding to the first two digits of your mantissa), but this time, find the column number equal to the fourth digit of the mantissa.


In the example above, you would again use the row number beginning with .64, but find the column for 2. In this case, your value is 2.

, Once you have these values, the next step is to add them together.


In the example above, you would add 4416 and 2 to get 4418.

, The decimal point always goes in a specific designated place: after the number of digits that corresponds to the characteristic plus 1.


In the example above, the characteristic is 2. You would therefore add 2 and 1 to get 3, then insert the decimal point after 3 digits. The antilog of 2.6452 is therefore 441.8.

Calculate MMI (Mathematical Multiplicative Inverse) for Prime1 and Prime2

 Calculate MMI

 MMI1 = Prime2 ^ -1 Mod Prime1

 MMI2 = Prime1 ^ -1 Mod Prime2



 For Prime Numbers only (it will give a number for non-prime numbers but it won't be its MMI):

 MMI1 = (Prime2 ^ (Prime1-2)) % Prime1

 MMI2 = (Prime1 ^ (Prime2-2)) % Prime2



 e.g

 MMI1 = (97 ^ 33) % 35

 MMI2 = (35 ^ 95) % 97




,
Create a binary table for each MMI up to Log2 of the Modulus

 For MMI1

 F(1) = Prime2 % Prime1 = 97 % 35 = 27

 F(2) = F(1) * F(1) % Prime1 = 27 * 27 % 35 = 29

 F(4) =  F(2) * F(2) % Prime1 = 29 * 29 % 35 = 1

 F(8) = F(4) * F(4) % Prime1 = 1 * 1 % 35 = 1

 F(16) =F(8) * F(8) % Prime1 = 1 * 1 % 35 = 1

 F(32) =F(16) * F(16) % Prime1 = 1 * 1 % 35 = 1



 Calculate the binary of Prime1 - 2

 35 -2 = 33 (10001) base 2

 MMI1 = F(33) = F(32) * F(1) mod 35

 MMI1 = F(33) = 1 * 27 Mod 35

 MMI1 = 27



 For MMI2

 F(1) = Prime1 % Prime2 = 35 % 97 = 35

 F(2) = F(1) * F(1) % Prime2 = 35 * 35 mod 97 = 61

 F(4) = F(2) * F(2) % Prime2 = 61 * 61 mod 97 = 35

 F(8)  = F(4) * F(4) % Prime2 = 35 * 35 mod 97 = 61

 F(16) = F(8) * F(8) % Prime2 = 61 * 61 mod 97 = 35

 F(32)  = F(16) * F(16) % Prime2 = 35 * 35 mod 97 = 61

 F(64)  = F(32) * F(32) % Prime2 = 61 * 61 mod 97 = 35

 F(128) = F(64) * F(64) % Prime2 = 35 * 35 mod 97 = 61



 Calculate the binary of Prime2 - 2

 Answer = 99


,
Verify that ""Prime1"" is not Prime

Repeat steps 1 through 7 at least two more times.",How to Check if a Number Is Prime," Divide n by each prime from 2 to ceiling(n{\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}}).

, Warning: false positives are possible, even for all values of a.

Choose an integer value for a such that 2 ≤ a ≤ n - 1.

If an (mod n) = a (mod n), then n is likely prime. If this is not true, n is not prime.

Repeat with different values of a to increase confidence in primality


, Warning: false positives are possible but rarely for multiple values of a.

Find values for s and d such that n−1=2s∗d{\displaystyle n-1=2^{s}*d}.

Choose an integer value for a such that 2 ≤ a ≤ n - 1.

If ad = +1 (mod n) or -1 (mod n), then n is probably prime. Skip to test result. Otherwise, go to next step.

Square your answer (a2d{\displaystyle a^{2d}}). If this equals -1 (mod n), then n is probably prime. Skip to test result. Otherwise repeat (a4d{\displaystyle a^{4d}} etc.) until a2s−1d{\displaystyle a^{2^{s-1}d}}.

If you ever square a number which is not ±1{\displaystyle \pm 1} (mod n) and end up with +1 (mod n), then n is not prime.  If a2s−1d≠±1{\displaystyle a^{2^{s-1}d}\neq \pm 1} (mod n), then n is not prime.

Test result: If n passes test, repeat with different values of a to increase confidence.


, By the definition of primality, n is only prime if it cannot be divided evenly by integers 2 or greater. The formula given saves time by removing unnecessary tests (e.g. after testing 3 there is no need to test 9).

Ceiling(x) rounds x to the closest integer ≥ x.


, The ""x mod y"" operation (short for ""modulo"") means ""divide x by y and find the remainder.""In other words, in modular arithmetic, numbers ""wrap around"" back to zero upon reaching a certain value, called the modulus. A clock counts in modulo 12: it goes from 10 to 11 to 12, then wraps around back to 1.

Many calculators have a mod button, but see the end of this section for how to solve this by hand for large numbers.


, All numbers that fail this test are composite (non-prime), but unfortunately numbers that pass this test are only likely primes. If you want to be sure of avoiding false positives, look for n on a list of ""Carmichael numbers"" (which pass this test every time) and ""Fermat pseudoprimes"" (which pass this test only for some values of a)., Although tedious to perform by hand, this test is commonly used in software. This can be performed at a practical speed and gives fewer false positives than Fermat's method.A composite number never gives a false positive for more than ¼ of the values of a.If you choose several values of a at random and they all pass this test, you can be fairly confident that n is prime.
, If you do not have access to a calculator with a mod function, or if your calculator can't display numbers that high, use properties of exponents and modular arithmetic to make the process easier.Here's an example for 350{\displaystyle 3^{50}} mod 50:

Rewrite the expression with more manageable exponents: (325∗325){\displaystyle (3^{25}*3^{25})} mod 50. (You may need to break it down further if calculating by hand).


(325∗325){\displaystyle (3^{25}*3^{25})} mod 50 = (325{\displaystyle (3^{25}} mod 50 ∗325{\displaystyle *3^{25}} mod 50) mod 50. (This is a property of modular multiplication.)


325{\displaystyle 3^{25}} mod 50 = 43.


(325{\displaystyle (3^{25}} mod 50 ∗325{\displaystyle *3^{25}} mod 50) mod 50 = (43∗43){\displaystyle (43*43)} mod 50


=1849{\displaystyle =1849} mod 50


=49{\displaystyle =49}


,  One of the numbers is not prime and the second number is the number that needs to be tested for primality.

 ""Prime1"" = 35

 Prime2 = 97


,  They can't equal each other.

 Data1 = 1

 Data2 = 2


,,,,,,

 If step 7 is 0:

 Use a different ""prime1"" where prime1 is a non-prime

 Use a different prime 1 where prime 1 is an actual prime.  In this case, steps 6 and 7 should equal 0.

 Use different data points for data1 and data2.



If step 7 is 0 every time, there is an extremely high probability that prime2 is prime.

 Steps 1 though 7 are known to fail in certain cases when the first number is a non-prime number and the second prime is a factor of the non-prime number ""prime1"".  It works in all scenarios where both numbers are prime.

 The reason why steps 1 though 7 are repeated is because there are a few scenarios where, even if prime1 is not prime and prime2 is not prime, step 7 still works out to be zero, for one or both the numbers.  These circumstances are rare.  By changing prime1 to a different non-prime number, if prime2 is not prime, prime2 will rapidly not equal zero in step 7.  Except for the instance where ""prime1"" is a factor of prime2, prime numbers will always equal zero in step 7.

Determine the highest measured value.,
Find the lowest measured value.,
Subtract the lowest value from the highest.,
Report the range as the precision.",How to Calculate Precision1," It helps to begin by sorting your data in numerical order, from lowest to highest. This will ensure that you do not miss any values. Then select the value at the end of the list.

For example, suppose you are testing the precision of a scale, and you observe five measurements: 11, 13, 12, 14, 12. After sorting, these values are listed as 11, 12, 12, 13, 14. The highest measurement is 14.
;
, Once your data has been sorted, finding the lowest value is as simple as looking at the beginning of the list.

For the scale measurement data, the lowest value is 11.


, The range of a set of data is the difference between the highest and lowest measurements. Just subtract one from the other. Algebraically, the range can be expressed as:


Range=x(max)−x(min){\displaystyle {\text{Range}}=x(max)-x(min)}

For the sample data, the range is:


Range=x(max)−x(min)=14−11=3{\displaystyle {\text{Range}}=x(max)-x(min)=14-11=3}




, When reporting data, it is important to let the readers know what you have measured. Because there are different measures of precision, you should specify what you are reporting. For this data, you would report Mean=12.4, Range=3, or simply that the Mean=12.4±3.The mean is not actually part of calculating the range or precision, but it is generally the primary calculation for reporting the measured value. The mean is found by adding up the sum of the measured values and then dividing by the number of items in the group. For this set of data, the mean is (11+13+12+14+12)/5=12.4.

Find old and new values for a certain variable.,
Subtract the old value from the new value.,
Divide your answer by your old value.,
Multiply your answer by 100 to get a percentage.,
When dealing with variables with more than one change in value, find the percent change only for the two values you wish to compare.,
Divide the new value by the old value and multiply by 100 to find the absolute relationship between the two values.,
Generally, use absolute change when dealing with two percentages.",How to Calculate Percent Change," As noted in the intro, the purpose of most percent change calculations is to determine the change in a variable over time. Thus, to make a percent change calculation for a certain variable, you'll need to start with two pieces of information - an old (or ""starting"") value and a new (or ""ending"") value. The percent change equation finds the percent change between these two points.


One example of this is in the world of retail. When a product receives a discount, this is often expressed as the product being ""x% off"" - in other words, as the percent change from the old price. Let's consider a pair of pants that were previously sold for $50 and are now sold for $30. In this example, $50 is our ""old"" value and $30 is our ""new"" value. In the next few steps, we'll find the percent change between these two prices.

, The first step in finding the percent change between two values is to find the difference between them. The difference between two numbers is found by subtracting one from the other. The reason that we subtract the old from the new (and not vice versa) is that this conveniently gives us a negative percentage as our final product if the variables value decreases and a positive value if it increases.


For instance, in our example, we would start with $30, our new value, and subtract $50, our old value. 30 - 50 = -$20.

, Next, take the answer you obtained by subtracting your old value from your new value and divide it by your old value. This gives you the proportional relationship of the change in values to the old starting value, expressed as a decimal. In other words, this represents the total change in value over the starting value for your variable.


In our example, dividing the difference between our new and old values (-$20) by our old value ($50) gets us -20/50 = -0.40. Another way of thinking of this is that the $20 change in value is 0.40 of the $50 starting point, and that the change of value was in the negative direction.

, Values for percent change are (appropriately) expressed as percentages, rather than decimals. To convert your decimal answer to a percentage, multiply it by 100. After this, all that's left to do is to add a percentage sign. Congratulations! This final number represents the percent change between your old and new values.


In our example, to get our final percentage, we would multiply our decimal answer (-0.40) by 100. -0.40 × 100 = -40%. This answer means that the new price of $30 for the pants is 40% less than the old price of $50. In other words, the pants are ""40% off"". Another way to think of this is that the $20 difference in price is 40% of the initial price of $50 - since this price difference results in a lower final price, we give it a negative sign.
Note that a positive answer for your final percentage implies an increase in the value of your variable. For instance, if the final answer for our example problem was not -40% but instead 40%, this would mean that the new price of the pants was $70 - 40% more than the initial price of $50.

, Finding the percent change for a certain variable that changes value more than once over time can seem intimidating, but don't let the multiple value changes lead you to over-complicate things. The percent change equation only compares two values at a time. This means that if you're asked to calculate percent change in a situation involving a variable with multiple value changes, only calculate the percent change between the two values specified. Don't calculate the percent changes between every value in the sequence, then average or add up the percent changes. This is not the same as finding the percent change between two points and can easily give nonsensical answers.


For example, let's say that a pair of pants has an initial price of $50, is discounted to $30, is then marked up to $40, and is finally discounted again to $20. The percent change formula can find us the percent change between any two of these values; the two leftover values are not needed. For instance, to find the percent change between the initial price and the final price, use $50 and $20 as your ""old"" and ""new"" values, respectively. Solve as follows:

((V2-V1)/V1) × 100
((20 - 50)/50) × 100
(-30/50) × 100
-0.60 × 100 = -60%




, A process that is similar (but not identical) to the process used to find percent change is that used to find the absolute percentage relationship between the ""old"" and ""new"" values. To do this, simply divide the old value by the new value and multiply by 100 - this gives you a percentage that directly compares the new value to the old, rather than expressing the change between the two.


Note that subtracting %100 from this answer will give the percent change.
For example, let's use this process for the discounted pants example above. If the pants started at $50 and ended at $20, dividing 20/50 and multiplying by 100 gives us 20/50 × 100 = 40%. This tells us that $20 is 40% of $50. Note that subtracting by 100% gives us 40 - 100 = -60%, the percent change we found above.
This process can give answers over 100% For instance, if $50 is our old price and $75 is our new price, 75/50 ×100 = 150%. This means that 75$ is 150% of 50$.

, The language surrounding the process of calculating percent change can get somewhat tricky when the two values being compared are themselves percentages. In these cases, it's important to distinguish between the percent change and the absolute change. The latter is the exact number of percentage points by which the new value differs from the old value - not the familiar percent change concept we've covered.


For example, let's say that a pair of pants is offered at 30% off (a percent change of -30% from their old price). If the discount is increased to 40% off (a percent change of -40% from their old price), it's not inaccurate to say that the percent change of this discount is ((-40 - -30)/-30) × 100 = 33.33%. In other words, the pants are 33.33% ""more"" discounted than before.

However, this is usually instead stated as the discount having a ""10 percent increase"". In other words, we usually refer to the absolute change between the two percentages rather than the percent change.

Consider your number and its parts.,
Know the base.,
Calculate the 10x.",How to Do Antilog2," For whatever number you are observing, the characteristic is the part that comes before the decimal point; the mantissa is the part that comes after the decimal point.


As an example, say you need to find the antilog for 2.6452. The characteristic is 2, and the mantissa is 6452.

, The mathematical log operator has a parameter known as the base. For numerical computations, the base is always 10. Know, therefore, that when you use this method for calculating an antilog, you will always use a base of 10.

, By definition, the antilog of any given number x is the basex. Recall that the base for your antilog is always 10; x is the number with which you are working. If the mantissa of the number is 0 (in other words, if the number under observation is a whole number, with no decimal point), the computation is easy: simply multiply 10 times 10 that number of times. If the number is not an even whole, use a computer or calculate to compute 10x.


In the example above, we do not have a whole number. The antilog is 10^2.6452, which, using a calculator, comes to 441.7.

Pick the number of times a week that you want to have chocolate.,
Multiply the number by 2.,
Add 5 to the last result.",How to Calculate Your Age by Chocolate2," That’s the starting point for figuring out your age by chocolate.


This number should be more than one time per week but less than 10 times per week.You could choose 1 or 10, too.As an example, let’s use the number “7.” Figuring out someone’s age by chocolate is what is known as a parlor trick. It uses complexity to hide an outcome that is actually very simple.
Try to be realistic here. How many times per week do you really want to have chocolate?

, You take whichever number of times you want to have chocolate per week and multiply it by 2. So far, so good!


To continue our example, you would multiply 7 X 2 = 14.
To use another example, let’s say that you said you wanted to have chocolate 3 times per week. Then, you would take 3 X 2 = 6.
To repeat: Whichever number you picked for the number of times per week you want to have chocolate, you should multiply by 2. It’s a simple mathematical equation. Feel free to use a calculator if you need to, but so far you should be able to do the equations in your head.

, This means you should add 5 to whatever running total you have. It helps to write all of this down on a piece of paper as you go along.


To use our first example, which started with 7, you now have 19. That’s because 14 + 5 = 19.
To use the example starting with 3, you would now have 11. That’s because 6 + 5 = 11.
If you are good at basic math, you should be able to easily calculate your age by chocolate. If not, grab the calculator. This is a fun way for children to master basic math equations, though.

Grab the calculator.,
Multiply your number by 50.,
Add a number based on the year to your total.,
Subtract one if you haven't had your birthday yet.",How to Calculate Your Age by Chocolate3," Up to this point, you’ve probably been able to calculate your age by chocolate in your head or using a pencil.


At this point, though, the calculations are about to get a lot more complex! You should grab a calculator from the drawer.You can also find many calculators online, and most smart phones and laptops also have them built in if you don’t have a calculator online.
Again, in an orderly fashion, write your answers on a piece of paper, likely vertically.

, Whatever number you ended up with after you added 5 should now be multiplied by 50.To use our core example, in which you started out with 7, you would take 19 X 50. The answer is 950.
To use our second example, in which you started out with 3, you would take 11 X 50. The answer is 550.
The tricky part about figuring out your age by chocolate is to keep track of it all. If you get distracted by someone or something, you might lose your place and have to start over.

, For example, let's say you're doing the equation in 2016 (any year would work, though).


To figure out the number you should use, take the current year minus 250 if you've already had your birthday in 2016. So, if you are doing the equation in 2016, take 2016-250=1,766.
Let's say you are trying the calculation in 2017. You would take 2017-250=1,767 if you have already had your birthday in 2017.
Add the number you get to your running total. To continue with our example of 7, presuming you are doing the calculation in 2016, you would add 950+1766=2716.

, If you haven't had your birthday, you need to take another point off the total.


For example, if you haven't yet had your birthday in 2016, and that's the year you're performing the equation in, you would use the number 1,765.
If performing the equation in 2017, you should also subtract another point if you haven't had your birthday yet. So you would use 1,766. The same is true of any year.
Add the number you get to your running total.

Subtract the year you were born.,
Interpret the number.,
Play the trick on a friend.",How to Calculate Your Age by Chocolate4," This year should be four digits. Say 1970. Or 1988.


Let’s continue with our example of 7, and use the 2,716 number you got above. Let’s say you were born in 1970.
The answer would be 2,716-1970=746.
Continuing with our example of 3, let’s go with the 2,315 number and say you were born in 1990. The answer would be: 325.

, You should end up with a three-digit number (in our first example, we ended up with 746 and in the second example, we ended up with 325).The first digit (in the first example 7, and in the second example 3) was the number of times you like chocolate in the week.
The last two digits (in the first case 46, and in the second case 25) are your age!
Weird, huh? Now go eat some chocolate! It’s impossible to think about chocolate constantly and not want to eat some. For most people, anyway.

, The cool part is to guess a friend’s age by chocolate, rather than just doing the trick on yourself!


Maybe pick an older relative or a teacher – someone whose age you don’t really know. It will work like magic!
What the trick really does when you break it down is that it ends up having you subtract your birth year from the current year.The other numbers in the equation, though, are meant to distract you. That’s how the trick works! It’s simple but fun.

Find the mean of the data.,
Calculate the absolute deviation of each value from the mean.,
Find the average deviation.,
Report the precision result.",How to Calculate Precision2," The average deviation is a more detailed measure of the precision of a group of measurements or experiment values. The first step in finding the average deviation is to calculate the mean of the measured values. The mean is the sum of the values, divided by the number of measurements taken.

For this example, use the same sample data as before. Assume that five measurements have been taken, 11, 13, 12, 14, and 12. The mean of these values is (11+13+12+14+12)/5=12.4.


, For this calculation of precision, you need to determine how close each value is to the mean. To do this, subtract the mean from each number. For this measurement, it does not matter whether the value is above or below the mean. Subtract the numbers and just use the positive value of the result. This is also called the absolute value.Algebraically, the absolute value is shown by placing two vertical bars around the calculation, as follows:


Absolute deviation=|x−μ|{\displaystyle {\text{Absolute deviation}}=|x-\mu |}

For this calculation, x{\displaystyle x} represents each of the experimental values, and μ{\displaystyle \mu } is the calculated mean.



For the values of this sample data set, the absolute deviations are:


|12−12.4|=0.4{\displaystyle |12-12.4|=0.4}


|11−12.4|=1.4{\displaystyle |11-12.4|=1.4}


|14−12.4|=1.6{\displaystyle |14-12.4|=1.6}


|13−12.4|=0.6{\displaystyle |13-12.4|=0.6}


|12−12.4|=0.4{\displaystyle |12-12.4|=0.4}




, Use the absolute deviations and find their mean. As you did with the original data set, you will add them together and divide by the number of values. This is represented algebraically as:Average deviation=Σ|x−μ|n{\displaystyle {\text{Average deviation}}={\frac {\Sigma |x-\mu |}{n}}}

For this sample data, the calculation is:


Average deviation=0.4+1.4+1.6+0.6+0.45{\displaystyle {\text{Average deviation}}={\frac {0.4+1.4+1.6+0.6+0.4}{5}}}


Average deviation=4.45{\displaystyle {\text{Average deviation}}={\frac {4.4}{5}}}


Average deviation=0.88{\displaystyle {\text{Average deviation}}=0.88}




, This result may be reported as the mean, plus or minus the average deviation. For this sample data set, this result would look like 12.4±0.88. Note that reporting precision as the average deviation makes the measurement appear much more precise than with the range."
"
Use the correct formula for standard deviation.,
Find the mean of the data values.,
Find the square of each variation.,
Calculate the sum of the squared differences.,
Divide by the data size.,
Find the square root of the result.,
Report your result.",How to Calculate Precision3," For any size data set, the standard deviation is a reliable statistic for reporting precision. There are two formulas for calculating standard deviation, with a very slight difference between them. You will use one formula if your measured data represents an entire population. You will use the second formula if your measured data is from only a sample of the population.Your data represents an entire population if you have collected all the measurements possible from all possible subjects. For example, if you are conducting tests on people with some very rare disease, and you believe that you have tested everyone with that disease, then you have the entire population. The standard deviation formula in this case is:


σ=Σ(x−μ)2n{\displaystyle \sigma ={\sqrt {\frac {\Sigma (x-\mu )^{2}}{n}}}}



A sample set is any group of data less than an entire population. This is actually going to be used more often. The standard deviation formula for a sample set is:


σ=Σ(x−μ)2n−1{\displaystyle \sigma ={\sqrt {\frac {\Sigma (x-\mu )^{2}}{n-1}}}}



Notice that the only difference is in the denominator of the fraction. For an entire population, you will divide by n{\displaystyle n}. For a sample set, you will divide by n−1{\displaystyle n-1}.


, As with calculating the average deviation, you will begin by finding the mean of the data values.Using the same set of measurements as above, the mean is 12.4.


, For each data point, subtract the data value from the mean, and square that result. Because you are squaring these variations, whether the difference is positive or negative does not matter. The square of the difference will always be positive.

For the five data values in this sample, these calculations are as follows:


(12−12.4)2=(−0.4)2=0.16{\displaystyle (12-12.4)^{2}=(-0.4)^{2}=0.16}


(11−12.4)2=(−1.4)2=1.96{\displaystyle (11-12.4)^{2}=(-1.4)^{2}=1.96}


(14−12.4)2=1.62=2.56{\displaystyle (14-12.4)^{2}=1.6^{2}=2.56}


(13−12.4)2=0.62=0.36{\displaystyle (13-12.4)^{2}=0.6^{2}=0.36}


(12−12.4)2=(−0.4)2=0.16{\displaystyle (12-12.4)^{2}=(-0.4)^{2}=0.16}




, The numerator of the standard deviation fraction is the sum of the squared differences between each value and the mean. To find this sum, add together the figures from the previous calculation.For the sample data set, these are:


0.16+1.96+2.56+0.36+0.16=5.2{\displaystyle 0.16+1.96+2.56+0.36+0.16=5.2}




, This is the one step that will differ for either a population calculation or a sample set calculation. For a full population, you will divide by n{\displaystyle n}, the number of values. For a sample set, you will divide by n−1{\displaystyle n-1}.This example has only five measurements and is therefore only a sample set. Thus, for the five values being used, divide by (5-1) or 4. The result is 5.2/4=1.3{\displaystyle 5.2/4=1.3}.


, At this point, the calculation represents what is called the variance of the data set. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Use a calculator to find the square root, and the result is the standard deviation.σ=1.3=1.14{\displaystyle \sigma ={\sqrt {1.3}}=1.14}


, Using this calculation, the precision of the scale can be represented by giving the mean, plus or minus the standard deviation. For this data, this will be 12.4±1.14. The standard deviation is perhaps the most common measurement of precision. Nevertheless, for clarity, it is still a good idea to use a footnote or parentheses to note that the precision value represents the standard deviation.


"
"
Use the word precision correctly.,
Choose the best measure of precision.,
Report your results clearly.",How to Calculate Precision4," Precision is a term that describes the level of repeatability of measurements. When collecting a group of data, either by measurement or through an experiment of some kind, the precision describes how close together the results of each measurement or experiment are going to be.Precision is not the same as accuracy. Accuracy measures how close experimental values come to the true or theoretical value, while precision measures how close the measured values are to each other.

It is possible for data to be accurate but not precise or to be precise but not accurate. Accurate measurements are close to the target value but may not be close to each other. Precise measurements are close to each other, whether or not they are close to the target.


, The word “precision” does not have a single meaning. You can represent precision using several different measurements. You need to decide the best one.Range. For small data sets with about ten or fewer measurements, the range of values is a good measure of precision.This is particularly true if the values appear reasonably closely grouped. If you see one or two values that appear far from the others, you may wish to use a different calculation.

Average deviation. The average deviation is a more accurate measure of precision for a small set of data values.Standard deviation. The standard deviation is perhaps the most recognized measure of precision. Standard deviation may be used to calculate the precision of measurements for an entire population or a sample of the population., Very often, investigators will report data by giving the mean of the measured value, followed by a statement of the precision. The precision is shown with a “±” symbol. This provides an indication of precision, but it does not clearly explain to the reader if the number following the “±” symbol is a range, standard deviation, or some other measurement. To be very clear, you should define what measure of precision you are using, either in a footnote or parenthetical note.

For example, for one series of data, the result could be reported as 12.4±3. However, a more explanatory way to report the same data would be to say “Mean=12.4, Range=3.”

If you are addressing an envelope to a man with the same name as his father, or his son, include ""Jr."" or ""Sr."" at the end of each name, respectively. For example: ""Mr. Christopher Smith, Jr."" or ""Mr. Christopher Smith junior"".
If a man has the same name as his father and grandfather and is considered ""the third"" or beyond, use Roman numerals to address him. For example, ""Mr. Christopher Smith IV.""
Address couples based on their marital status. Addressing unmarried couples is different from how you address married couples.
Address married couples as ""Mr."" and ""Mrs."" followed by the man's name. For example, ""Mr. and Mrs. Christopher Smith."" Address unmarried couples who live together by their names preceded by their appropriate titles. For example, ""Ms. Jane Doe"" and ""Mr. John Smith.""
Address men and women with their professional titles when applicable. Address the envelope with their title, which does not require that ""Mr.,"" ""Mrs.,"" ""Miss,"" or ""Ms."" precede it.
Different titles people may use include ""Dr."" ""Reverend"" or ""Judge."" If you are not sure of a person's formal title and cannot locate this information, a good rule of thumb to use is to ""elevate"" the position you think they have. For example, if you're not sure someone is a Captain or General in the military, write their title as ""General."" This way, you won't offend anyone. The following is a list of titles you may encounter in addressing your formal envelope:Include the names of children on envelopes at your discretion. If children are not invited to the event, do not include them on the envelope. If you are inviting children, write only their first names on the second line underneath their parents.

, Write this information just under the names of persons, including children on the envelope.


As with names and titles, don't abbreviate with the address. Write out words like ""street,"" ""avenue,"" or ""circle."" For example: ""200 Main Street,"" ""15 Dupont Circle,"" ""1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest.""

, For example, ""Washington, DC 20002,"" or ""Berkeley, CA 94703.""

Canadian addresses should not include punctuation. It is important to write addresses correctly, because many addresses are read by sorting machines. If it is addressed legibly according to Canada's postal conventions, it will arrive at the destination more quickly.

, Canadian addresses have specific postal and province codes for different parts of the country. Before writing out the address, you must find out what the specific codes, including the correct abbreviation of the provinces, are.

While the invitation envelope is addressed and mailed to the invited guests, the response card will be sent to you, or whoever you designate to be in charge of collecting responses.Use the guest’s address for the return address so that they will receive the response card back if there is a problem with the mail.
Because response card envelopes tend to be much smaller than invitation envelopes, you can instruct your calligrapher or printing service to print the guest’s address on the envelope’s back flap, leaving only your address on the front of the envelope.;
, The return address on your address cards may differ from the one on your invitations because someone may be hosting one event and someone hosting another, such as a wedding and the reception. Typically, whoever is hosting the event will receive the response cards and their address should be used as the return address.In formal and traditional weddings, this is usually the bride's parents' residence. Many modern couples have them sent to whomever is primarily responsible for tracking RSVPs and communicating with wedding vendors.

, How you address recipients can set the tone for your event. If you address them more formally or traditionally, this signals that your event is likely formal or traditional. Similarly, a more contemporary method of address may indicate a less formal or more contemporary event. Whatever you choose, verify that you have the spelling of each name correct before you begin filling out envelopes.If you prefer to be less formal or more contemporary, you may simply write the attendees first and last names on the envelope – “John and Kim Washington”.
The traditional wording is ""Mr. and Mrs. John Smith,"" or “The Smith Family.""

, Whether your event is traditional, formal, contemporary, or informal, you want to avoid using guests’ nicknames or initials. It’s fine to use these names in conversation, but not for an event, no matter how formal or informal it may be.The only exception to this rule is if one of your guests strictly goes by an initial and then a last name. For example, “W. Daniel Johnson” would be acceptable if they only go by that name professionally and personally, with no exceptions.

, If your guest has a professional title, use this title in your address. Examples of professional titles include Dr., Esq., and Sergeant. You won’t abbreviate these titles in the address; instead, you’ll spell them out, just as you will with the addresses.If your guest has a professional title and their companion doesn’t, you’ll still use the appropriate professional and social titles – “Doctor and Mr Sanchez” or “Colonel and Mrs. Brown”
If both of your guests hold the same professional title, you’ll simply write “Doctors Cantello”

, When addressing your response cards, use appropriate social titles if no professional title is being used. The traditional social forms of address are Mr., Mrs., Ms., and Miss.Some of your guests may not be comfortable with these gendered forms of social address and might prefer a gender-neutral title.Mr. is the social address used for men, unless they have a professional designation.
Miss indicates an unmarried woman.
Mrs. indicates a married woman.
Ms. is often used professionally by women, and also is used frequently by women who prefer their social address be unrelated to their marital status.
There is a lengthy list of gender-neutral forms of address. Find out what your guest’s preference and use that title.
Follow the same rules of address for same-sex couples, basing your decision on shared or different last names and professional titles., While many of your guests will share last names, it is likely that many won’t. If you’re sending a response card to a couple with different last names, simply write out both names. It would be seen as disrespectful to send separate invitations rather than put one couple on the same response card.For couples with different last names, write out both names – “Mr. Ezra Houston and Ms. Sam Pirkle”.
You don’t need to fill in names on the response cards themselves. Instead, write a capital letter M followed by a long line “M____________________________”. This allows attendees to fill in their own information as they’d prefer it be written.

, All response cards should have an RSVP date, which is the date that you want guests to respond by. Typically your RSVP date should be three or four weeks before the event so that you have plenty of time to make seating charts and give a final head count to the caterers.Contact anyone who hasn’t responded via phone or email and ask them to follow up on your conversation by returning the printed card so that you can keep everything organized.
There are several ways to word this section, such as, “Kindly reply by May 3, 2016” or “RSVP by 5/3/16,” or you might even have fun with it by saying, “Respond by 5/3 or forever hold your peace.”

, You not only want an accurate head count, but you want to make sure that you know the name of every person attending your function. How you handle this will be dictated, in part, by the formality of your event. At the minimum, though, make sure that you leave a space so that guests may write out their names on the card.This is also helpful because it ensures that you have the correct spelling of everyone’s name.

, Every response card should have a space for guests to accept or decline your invitation. Again, how you word this will be informed by the formality of your event and your personal preference. At the minimum, though, you want to know if they are coming and how many people will be in their group.Etiquette says that only those invited by name should expect to attend; however, some guests assume that they can bring their children, partners, or other guests. One clever way to avoid this is to write, “_____ seats are reserved for your party.” Then, simply fill in the space when you address the card so that it’s clear exactly how many people you’re inviting.If you’re inviting specific guests to multiple events, such as a rehearsal dinner, wedding, and reception, include a response card for each event so that you can keep everything organized., The response card is the perfect opportunity to ask your guests what entrée they would prefer. Of course, this is only applicable if you’re planning on offering options. If you’re opting to offer the same meal to all guests, have a buffet-style meal, or serve hors d’oeuvres, you might leave this section off altogether.You can also include a space for dietary restrictions here, if you plan to accommodate them.

, Traditionally, a response card is returned in an enclosed, stamped envelope. To save money on printing and postage, and to reduce paper consumption, many people are opting for a postcard-style response card instead. A more formal or traditional event will almost certainly call for an envelope, whereas more contemporary or less formal events may work well with a postcard style response card., In addition to deciding whether you want a postcard or envelope system, you also need to decide if you want to print or hand letter your cards, typically written in calligraphy. It is useful to remember that the print on your invitations should match the print on your cards, which may inform your decision to print or hand letter one way or another.If you are planning a wedding and it is formal, all of your stationery should be professionally hand-scribed. Etiquette is more lax with semi-formal and informal weddings, and many brides use their own penmanship, or labels printed from their computers.

, If you prefer a personal touch and opt to have your invitations and return cards hand lettered, consider hiring a calligrapher. Even if you’re proficient in calligraphy, hiring a trained calligrapher can save you time and aggravation, freeing you up to focus on your event. Of course, there are considerations that go into hiring someone to hand letter your correspondence for you.Your budget. Calligraphers usually charge between $2-$5 per envelope, although the price may be higher if you have special requests.
Your schedule. Begin looking for a calligrapher as early as possible. The quicker the turnaround, the more expensive the service will be.
Your style preference. Every calligrapher has their own style. Look at several calligraphers and decide whose style you like most.
Your area. Whether you’re from a large city or not, look outside your area for calligraphers. This is especially easy with the internet.
Recommendations from wedding planners, event organizers, or word-of-mouth.

, If you opt to print your cards rather than hand scribe them, you’ll need to decide if you want to print them at home or have them professionally printed. If you choose to print them at home, you’ll need to purchase a few items beforehand. If you opt to have them printed professionally, discuss stationery and font options with your printer before designing your invitations and response cards.If printing at home, you’ll need a computer, a desktop publishing program, stationery, a working printer, and plenty of printer ink.

, Whether you choose to pay for postage of the response cards is your decision. Some people believe that they should not be required to pay for postage because they’ll be paying for the event, and others feel that the hosts should pay for postage as a courtesy. Ultimately, you must decide if postage is within your budget and if you agree that it’s your responsibility.You will likely receive more returned response cards if you include postage.
Place a stamp on the top right corner of each response card envelope or postcard.

You can also find the address of a college's admissions office online. However, you should call the office to double check this is the proper place to send application materials.
If you are a teacher, your student should be able to provide you with this information. If your student cannot provide the information, you can also check online and call the admissions office.;

You can also use your own computer or a typewriter to print address labels for an envelope. This may be a good idea if you have sloppy handwriting.

, The return address is the address of the person writing the letter. If you're providing your teacher with an addressed envelope, you may need to ask for his or her personal address.

Attach your rubber band to the end of the ruler (or item you are using instead of a ruler, see Things You'll Need section).,
Put a piece of tape over the rubber band to help ensure that it does not slip or change position on the ruler.,
Clip the paper clip onto the rubber band so that it will be able to hold onto a letter while hanging from the rubber band.,
Move the ruler so the rubber band is just hanging off the edge of a table.,
Make a calibration weight.,
Find the balance.,
Make a mark on the ruler.,
Add more weight to the calibration.,
Repeat the previous three steps for as many ounce marks you like.

,
Confirm your scale, if you like.,
Clip an envelope on the paper clip and tell its weight.,
See how much postage to put on the envelope.,
You may need to add additional postage if your letter is smaller than 3x5"", larger than 6.125x11.5, over 3.5 OZ, or more than 1/4"" thick.

",How to Create a Letter Postage Scale," Tie a knot near one end of the rubber band (leaving loops on either side of the knot) and attach it to the end of the ruler.;
, The rubber band must be flat on the surface of the ruler opposite the knot.

, A large paper clip is recommended.

, The table should have a sharp edge.


If you don't have a table available, use anything that has a sharp edge and a flat and level surface that is at least the length of the ruler. A book on a table or small box or desk picture frame might suffice. Put this sharp-edged surface at the end of the table to be used instead of the table.

, Gather 5 quarters and make a stack. This is one ounce! Place the stack of quarters on the rubber band that is wrapping the ruler. Be careful to make sure the quarters are perfectly balanced on the rubber band. If they lean off of the rubber band and touch the ruler, the scale will not be accurate. This is why a medium width rubber band is needed. A thin rubber band is tough to balance the quarters on.

, Slowly inch the ruler off of the desk (or the surface with a sharp edge). The ruler should be perpendicular to the edge you are using. Any angle you use off of 90 degrees will reduce accuracy. You will find at some point that the ruler will begin to tilt and want to fall off. Go back and forth between it desiring to fall and it staying on. Try to get to the place where the end of the ruler slowly lifts off the table and begin to tilt down toward the quarters.

, Make a very small and fine line to show at what point the ruler began to fall. Again, make sure that the ruler is still perpendicular to the edge it is tilting off of.

, Add a second stack of 5 quarters so that 10 quarters are balanced. This is two ounces.


You can also try to use tape to create a bundle of quarters and hang the bundle from the paper clip. Just be sure to use thin, light tape--like Scotch tape--and not much of it.

,, With marks at 1 ounce and 2 ounces, you can also make a mark at 1/2 ounce without much effort. Use a piece of paper and copy the marks you made on your ruler to the edge of a paper (copy the distance, in other words). Now, make a new mark on the ruler that exact distance away from the 1 ounce mark and heading away from the 2 ounce mark. You should now have three marks of exactly the same distance with 1 ounce in the middle, 2 ounces closest to the rubber band and 1/2 ounce closest to the middle of the ruler. Place 4 dimes and a nickel back on your scale (almost exactly 1/2 ounce!). Slide the scale to the new mark you made and see how close you are.

, If the ruler doesn't fall off of the table when the stick is lined up to the 1 ounce mark, you're good with a single stamp! Over 1 ounce but under 2 ounces, add a 17 cent stamp. You can also tell the approximate weight by sliding the ruler slowly until it begins to tip off the table.

Give your writing a good title. Snazzy titles are a big plus! Serious titles that accurately describe the contents of your writing are a good bet, as are clever, ""snappy"" ones (puns, references, and so on).

In addition, there are test centres in over 130 other countries. You can find a full list of test centres with contact details for each one at www.ielts.org.

, IELTS is offered all year round and some test centres offer the test as often as twice a month, so you might be able to choose several possible dates. Just be sure to register early so you get the date you want as dates often fill up quickly.

, You will need to give the test centre a completed application form, two recent passport photographs, which are in colour and identical, and a photocopy of your passport or national identity document, which should still be valid when you take the test.

, The fee varies, but it is currently around USD185 in the USA, GBP115 in the UK and AUD317 in Australia.

, Bring your passport or national identity document. You will also need to bring pencils and pens to write with.

, These will be available 13 days after the test.

Learn the difference between your and you're.,
Learn the difference between their, they're, and there.,
Learn the difference between its and it's.,
Use ""two,"" ""too,"" and ""to"" correctly.,
Learn the difference between ""less"" and ""fewer."",
Use ""lay"" and ""lie"" correctly.,
Use ""random"" and ""literally"" correctly.,
Avoid textspeak.",How to Be Good at English1," Mixing up these words is one of the most common and easily-fixable usage errors in English. Since there is nothing that stands out more quickly than writing ""You're not coming to the dance, are you?"" it's important to clear up the difference and never make this mistake again.



Your is used to mean ""something you own."" Saying ""Is that your cantaloupe?"" or ""Where is your pocketknife?"" are appropriate uses of ""your."" You can always sound it out and try substituting ""you are"" for ""your"" in a sentence. If ""you are"" would make sense, then you should use the other form ""you're.""

You're is a contraction of the words ""you"" and ""are,"" and it's used as a replacement for those words in a sentence. ""You are an excellent tennis player"" can be written ""You're an excellent tennis player."";
, If ""you"" and ""your"" is a solid first place mistake, misusing these words is a close second. It's also a common spell-check mistake, because spell-checkers won't suggest the right version of the word, necessarily, if you make a typo. It can be confusing, but the difference will be clear once you've memorized the usage rule.



Their means ""belongs to them."" Appropriate uses would include ""Their balloon popped quickly"" or ""Have you not seen their baby?"" The word is only used in this context and for no other reason than to mean ""more than one owner.""

They're is a contraction of the words ""they"" and ""are,"" and should be used to replace those words in a sentence. ""They are very much in love"" could be written ""They're very much in love."" Despite the fact that a contraction is used, this word does not imply ownership.

There refers to locations and all other uses. ""Place the apple over there"" or ""There is nothing more boring than math"" are appropriate uses of ""there.""

, This is a slightly confusing rule because it goes against the basic rule for apostrophes, but this is just an example of a contradiction in contractions. Quick rule: Substitute the words ""it"" and ""is"" to sentences with an ""its"" or an ""it's."" If the words make sense in that sentence, you need to have an apostrophe. If not, then leave the apostrophe off.



Use its when you intend to assign possession to something. Though there is no apostrophe, this means that something owns something else. ""Its hair was really dirty"" or ""I can't compete with its power!"" would be appropriate uses of its.

Use it's when you want to contract ""it"" and ""is."" It would be appropriate to write ""It's not that great"" or ""When it's raining, I like to read.""

, This is a common typo, but also a common usage error that many talented writers still make regularly. The differences are pretty easy to get down, however. Quick Rule: Too has two ""Os,"" which can help you remember that it means there's more of something, so you should use the word to compare amounts. If, as in ""To be, or not to be,"" there is no amount being discussed, leave the extra ""O"" off.



To is a preposition, which should always precede a noun or a verb and begin a prepositional phrase. ""I want to visit France"" and ""I went to France"" are both appropriate uses of ""to.""

Too is used as a quantity or to agree. ""There was too much alcohol the party"" or ""I ate too many ice cream cones"" are appropriate uses. It can also suggest degrees or levels of emotion, and lengths of time: ""You're way too angry"" or ""I cried for too long."" It's also used to agree: ""I want to go to the party too.""

Two is a number and should only be used as a number. ""I ate two large pizzas"" or ""There were two pro wrestlers at the party"" are appropriate uses of ""two.""

, This is a big one, commonly misused, but it's easy to learn. One is used to refer to amounts and the other is used to refer to numbers. If you've ever learned about the difference between ""count"" and ""non-count"" nouns, that'll come in handy with this rule. When there is ""less traffic"" that means there are ""fewer cars.""



Less refers to amounts and non-count nouns. ""There was much less water in the pool than last week"" or ""Much less applause could be heard at the game"" are appropriate uses. If you can't count individual units of something, ""less"" is the appropriate word when referring to it. There is less doubt, less oxygen, and less morale.

Fewer refers to numbers and count nouns. ""Many fewer people applauded"" or ""One more bike, one fewer car"" would be appropriate uses of fewer. If you can give a specific number of an object, like marbles, dollar bills, cantaloupes, or video games, the right word is ""fewer.""

, If you get this one wrong, you're in good company. Learn the rule and you'll never have to worry about getting it wrong again. People get confused because the past tense of ""lie"" is also ""lay,"" but the difference is something you can learn quickly.


Use ""lay"" when you're putting something down. ""I lay the book on the table"" or ""Please lay your head on your desk"" are appropriate uses of ""lay.""
Use ""lie"" when you're resting or reclining. You would write, ""I'm going to lie down now"" but the past tense form of the word is ""lay,"" which accounts for a lot of the confusion. In other words, you would also write, ""I lay down yesterday."" Use context clues in the sentence to find the meaning.

, No words are overused and more incorrectly used than these two in English. Learn to use them correctly and you'll win the admiration of English teachers and grammar curmudgeons alike.



Random means a lack of order or coherence in a series or sequence. There should be no pattern in something that's truly random. Often, people use ""random"" when they mean ""surprising"" or ""unexpected."" For example, it wasn't ""some random guy"" that talked to you after class. You take the same class, go to the same school, and live in the same town, which means there's nothing random about having a conversation with another person you share space with. It's actually quite likely.

Literally should not be used to imply severity, because ""literally"" means that something actually happened, and was a literal truth. The only time it would be appropriate to say, ""I literally couldn't get out of bed this morning,"" is if you were actually physically unable to move your legs, not because you were unwilling to move your legs. Otherwise, you mean ""figuratively.""

, When you're writing, don't slip into shortened text speak, or use emojis to replace actual words. A colon and a half parenthetical smiley face should never end a sentence. Those have real uses! Let your words communicate your meanings, and use the full versions of those words.


We all like to text quickly, but it's best to avoid texting spelling like ""ur"" even when you're actually texting. When you're writing in textspeak, you're training yourself to connect those typing muscles with those words, making you more likely to unconsciously use the wrong spelling in a formal setting.
When you're speaking, it's also good habit to avoid actually saying things out loud like, ""OMG"" or ""lol."" If you're laughing, just laugh, don't editorialize it.

Read everything.,
Learn the words you commonly misspell.,
Use mnemonic devices to help you memorize tricky words.,
Play word games.,
Turn your spell-checker off.",How to Be Good at English2," The best way to improve your English in all respects is to read aggressively. Read difficult books, read silly books, read long books, read magazines, read cereal boxes, billboards, and programs. Read everything and surround yourself with words. Reading lots of different books will not only improve your vocabulary, but it will help you with spelling. Plus, it's great entertainment and a good alternative to watching TV.


Try reading out loud sometimes, especially if you're uncomfortable doing so in class. The more comfortable you get working your way through words, the better your speech will become and the more confidence you'll have about pronunciation and speaking. It can also be fun to hear how really great writing sounds. Read Edgar Allan Poe aloud, or other poetry to get the full effect.

, English is full of contradictions and abnormalities, making it difficult to sound out everything and spell it correctly. Why is there a ""b"" at the end of ""comb"" when it makes no sound? Why do people pronounce ""conch"" like ""konk"" but don't say ""church"" like ""churk""? Who knows. We all have words that give us fits, so it's best to just learn the spelling and memorize those words you have a hard time remembering.Commonly misspelled or challenging words people struggle with include:


definitely
beautiful
believe
library
nuclear
neighbor
ceiling
exercise
vacuum
villain
jewelry
license

, People have been misspelling words for as long as people have been spelling words. It's not a new thing. Fortunately, that means lots of little tricks have been passed down over the ages, so you can use some great shortcuts to make life easier on yourself, and on your English grade card.Here are a few of the best ones:


You cut a piece of pie

You hear with your ear


Because Elephants Can Always Understand Small Elephants. Just because.
Never believe a lie.
An island is land.

Eee! A cemetery!

, There are loss of digital and analog word games you can play that will help you stay engaged with words on a regular basis, in a fun way as opposed to homework. Play board games like Boggle, Scrabble, and Bananagrams to keep your spelling muscles flexed and do crossword puzzles to help with your vocabulary. On your phone, you can play Crosstix, Hangman, and Word Scramble for free, or challenge your friends to the popular game ""Words with Friends."" Way better than Candy Crush.

, In a recent study completed and reported by the BBC, over a third of respondents were unable to spell ""definitely"" correctly, while two-thirds were unable to identify the correct spelling of ""necessary."" Dubbed this the ""auto-correct"" effect, it seems that spell-check might have a negative effect on our ability to spell words correctly.While getting rid of your spelling companion and crutch might seem like a fate worse than death, it can be good to force yourself to learn and spell the words correctly. You can still run it through the spell-checker before you turn it in. Just practice.

"
"
Use active voice instead of passive voice.,
Use fewer commas and use them correctly.,
Be concise.,
Stop using the thesaurus function on your word processor.,
Revise, revise, revise.",How to Be Good at English3," Verbs have passive voices and active voices, and good writers are always active. The passive voice, appropriate for science reports and some technical writing, places a distance in the writing. Active voice, on the other hand, stands up and demands recognition. Using the exact same verb, you can make a sentence much more active and lively. Active writing is good writing.Passive voice: ""The city has been scorched by the dragon's breath."" Here, the verb in the sentence is actually ""to be,"" because the subject of the sentence–the city–is in the act of being changed by something (the dragon's breath).

Active voice: ""The dragon's breath scorched the city."" Here, the dragon is the subject of the sentence, and the stronger verb–scorch–is used as the verb in the sentence, rather than a vestigial verb phrase.

, Lots of inexperienced writers think their biggest problem in the world is using commas correctly. It's not as significant a problem as you might think. Commas aren't used when you want ""a pause,"" they're used to separate clauses in complex sentences. That's not to say they aren't complicated punctuation, but that going through and adding commas willy-nilly is bad writing.Use commas when you start sentences with adverbs: ""Although I drank the poison Kool-Aid, my Wednesday was mostly boring.""
Use commas with ""because"" sentences only if the clause after the because is complex. For example: ""I drank the Kool-Aid because I was thirsty"" doesn't need a comma before the ""because."" However, ""I drank the Kool-Aid, because my sister left me home alone and there wasn't anything else to drink"" requires a comma. You didn't drink Kool-Aid because your sister left you, you drank it because there was nothing else to drink.
Use commas to set off intro clauses: ""Fortunately, I carry a pocketknife"" is an appropriate comma use. Likewise, ""To begin a novel correctly, forget everything you know"" is also correct.
Use commas to separate opposing clauses: ""The puppies were cute, but smelled disgusting."" Avoid commas when the clauses agree: ""I'm happy but I can't help it.""

, In general, fewer words makes for better writing. Lots of students and inexperienced writers get it in their gourds that writing long, flowery prose will impress the teacher and fool them into thinking a genius wandered into the classroom. Just worry about writing clear sentences, not ""smarting up"" your writing with complexity. Don't write beyond your capabilities and load your sentences with extra words to try to extend the word count. Use the most muscular sentences possible–cut the fat.


Adverbs and adjectives are easy cuts. ""The flowing, fiery dragon breath beset the besieged and ragged city dwellers, cowering in their filthy, stinking, scorched rags of clothes, all matted and terrible"" would be much better written, ""Flowing, the dragon breath scorched the city dwellers, who cowered in their stinking clothes.""
Avoid stacked prepositional phrases. To avoid writing run on sentences, get in the habit of looking for ""stacked"" prepositional phrases. These are good indicators that you need to restructure sentences to improve the agreement of the subject and verb. A ""stacked"" sentence is confusing: ""In the field, over the cascading weeks, inside a house, like a weeping girl stood Joseph."" Instead, try this: ""Like a weeping girl, Joseph stood inside a house in the field. Over the cascading weeks, he…""

, Lots of students think right-clicking and substituting the suggested synonyms for ""over-used"" words will result in better writing. Most of the time, this is not true. Plus, if you change ""The bond between the nations was strong"" to ""The bond between the nations was beefy,"" like the synonym-generator suggests, your writing will look foolish. Most teachers can also recognize when you're writing beyond your vocabulary, as well, so it's best to focus on more important aspects of your writing.


If you want to use a more appropriate word, or substitute a word for something that you're overusing, looking at the suggested synonyms is a perfectly acceptable way to find alternatives, but if you don't know the word you must look it up before you insert it.

, Good writing means good editing. No great writers wrote perfect drafts the first go-around, and you won't either. If you want to be good at English and succeed in your English class, it's important that you save enough time at the end of a writing assignment to go over it, both for proofreading and for editing. While they involve similar skills, proofreading and revising or editing are actually quite different, and equally important.


Editing happens when you improve a piece of writing by re-wording sentences to improve them, checking the writing for content, and addressing large concerns about the essay or the assignment. When you revise, you're ""re-visioning"" the writing, looking at it with new eyes.
When you proofread, you're specifically looking for mistakes on the sentence-level. So, spelling issues, commas, and other little problems are what you should look for when you proofread. This should happen after you revise.

Make sure your students understand what you teach.",How to Be a Good English Teacher," While classics like Moby Dick are incredibly important historically and have a lot of literary value, they can be too long, boring, and seemingly irrelevant to hold your students' interest for long. Instead, assign shorter or more contemporary works, or works that you know your students will enjoy.


Look for literary or academic merit in unlikely places: even a zombie apocalypse novel like Colson Whitehead's Zone One deals with challenging and important topics that perfectly complement a classic like Hemingway's In Our Time while still remaining relevant to modern audiences.;
, While it may seem nice to have your students read a lengthy novel in a week, this can be an unreasonable expectation. Your students won't be able to finish the reading and will skim it, read a summary instead, or not read it at all. Encourage your students to complete their homework and to do it well by assigning only reasonable amounts of work.


Short stories are excellent ways pieces to assign as critical reading. And just because there's less to read doesn't mean your students can't learn key concepts. Find short stories that illustrate whatever you're discussing with your students and use them to keep your students engaged.

, Ask students to write a short response to a reading assignment, including an interpretation of or questions about the reading. These assignments should challenge students to think critically and consider important questions, or make connections between class topics.


Don't assign busywork. Assignments that are boring and tedious don't help the students understand or appreciate your lessons, and they are annoying to do and to grade. Be careful to only assign work that will help your students learn.

, While it's important that your students learn lots of new vocabulary words and understand the minute details of a text, this isn't what they're going to take away from your class. Focus on their general understanding of the topics you teach. Impress upon them the larger significance of what they're studying and how this can help them elsewhere in their lives. Teach them how to learn rather than simple facts. This will help them come away from your class with a more lasting understanding of and appreciation for the subject.

, Rather than jumping from topic to topic at will, order your lessons chronologically or thematically. Tie different topics together in your discussions so that your students understand how each topic is related. Help them draw connections and encourage them to consider their ideas in different contexts. What does Whitman's relationship with nature have to do with Tennyson's, or Hemingway's? How are they the same or different, and why?


Ordering your lessons chronologically can make the progression from one topic to the next feel natural — it makes sense to study 18th century writers before 19th century ones. Also consider ordering topics thematically, so that you study the progression of a theme or idea across several texts.

, If you'll be discussing a short story, reread it several times to make sure you pick up the smaller details that you might not have noticed the first time. Come up with an interpretation of the work, but remind yourself that yours is not the only possible interpretation. Make sure you'll be able to answer any questions students might have about the work.

, While the main focus of the discussion should be based in the text itself, it can be helpful to bring in outside material like biographical information about the author, the backstory of the text, or famous or controversial interpretations. Do some research and bring in the most relevant or interesting information you find.

, Pick out a few key points of the text that you think your students will find most challenging or confusing. Have in mind the specific topics you'll want to cover, and come up with a few important points your students should take away from the discussion.


Keep in mind that your students will have questions and interests that you may not be able to anticipate. Your lesson plans should not be set in stone. Responding to what your students want to talk about will create a lively, engaging, productive discussion.

, You should guide your students to interpret the text rather than discuss factual aspects. Ask ""how"" and ""why"" questions rather than ""what"" or yes or no questions. For example, ""What did Ender do to Bonzo Madrid?"" is a very simple question, while ""Why did Ender do it?"" is much more challenging and complex, and ""How do you know?"" demands close reading and attention to the text.

, It can be good to start with broad questions like ""What did you like about this story?"", but only if they are quickly followed by much more specific questions. Broad questions don't help students think critically about the text, and they encourage generalizations and assumptions rather than text-based arguments. In contrast, asking specific questions about specific aspects of the text will challenge your students to focus on things they may have missed, construct arguments based in the text, and contend with details that challenge their interpretations.

, In a discussion, students shouldn't talk to you. Rather, they should direct their questions and comments to each other, and you should step in only to keep the discussion moving forward. They will learn best if they work together to build their own ideas and interpretations — they won't get much out of the conversation if you simply tell them what you think. Remember, you're helping them learn, and a large part of that is teaching them how best to learn.


If your students will listen to and respect each other, encourage them to jump into the discussion without raising their hands and waiting to be called on. This will create a more responsive, quickly-moving, and engaging conversation that can sustain itself without you. If your students talk over each other or if a few students monopolize the discussion, have the person who just spoke choose the next person to talk, or find another way to allocate speaking time without having to do it yourself.

, You shouldn't disagree with everything they say, but ask them to support their claims with textual evidence, and encourage other students to come up with different interpretations. Putting pressure on students' ideas makes them think harder to come up with convincing arguments. It also helps them develop the skills to speak persuasively and debate with their peers.


Debates and arguments help a discussion become lively, engaging, and interesting. If these debates start to get personal, or if students might offend each other, think about turning the conversation back to the text. You should challenge students' interpretations of the text, not the students themselves.

, Read many kinds of literature including books, magazines, newspapers and poetry. Reading is the best way to confront challenging topics, pick up vocabulary and writing techniques, and discover new material to bring to the classroom. Depending on the grade you teach, you should be familiar with the most important works in literary history. And you should always be able to give reading suggestions to your students.


As well as reading important literature, read for fun. Remember why you love reading, and encourage your students to do the same.
Be aware of current trends in reading material, and try out the things you think your students might be reading. This will help you better understand their interests and relate to them outside the classroom, which will make you a more effective teacher overall.

, Make a point of looking up new words that you come across in your reading. Study your favorite words and begin to amass a large vocabulary. Challenge yourself to think about words you don't know. Guess at their etymology, and use similar words to figure out their meaning. Don't be afraid to look up words that you're unsure about, and encourage your students to do the same.


At the same time, teach your students that the mark of a good writer isn't just whipping out two-dollar words and using them to sound sophisticated. Teach your students the difference between using a word to draw a historical comparison, or using an alliterative word, and using a word to impress someone with your learning. There are more and less useful ways of wielding words.

, Students need to be able to read your handwriting so that they can understand notes you take on the whiteboard or feedback you give on an essay. Write letters or keep a journal to keep your handwriting alive and healthy, and always focus on readability rather than the speed of your writing.

, Make sure you have a firm grasp of spelling, punctuation, and grammar. You don't want to find yourself teaching your students mistaken or wrong information. Use reference books and the Internet as sources for grammar and punctuation rules, and don't be afraid to look up topics you're not sure about.

, Learn to be confident, to stand in front of your students and speak well. Practice reading aloud to get comfortable speaking loudly and clearly and to make sure you won't stumble when you do it in front of your class. Practice good public speaking skills so that you can perform well in the classroom.

, Pay attention to your students and give their ideas your full consideration. Treat them as intelligent and worthy people, and respect them academically and otherwise. Encourage them to pursue their interests and curiosities, and challenge them in and out of the classroom. When you give them attention and respect, you'll find that they perform well so as to be worthy of it.

, Encourage your students to drop by at lunch or after school. This can make a huge difference for students who may be struggling or who want to pursue a discussion further. Being available for them encourages them to foster a genuine interest in the material, and it's a display of your respect and desire to help them learn.

, Don't shout at the pupils every chance you get, but on the other hand don't let them walk over you. Show discipline, but don't go over the top, or this will make them behave worse towards you. If a pupil has done well, tell them so and reward them. Likewise if a pupil is struggling, tell him or her to stay behind so that you can help them to find out what's going wrong, or ask another pupil who understands the concept to help the struggling one.

, Don't speak and write too quickly. This will give them time to listen, understand, and copy things down so that they don't miss essential information. Help them absorb your lessons, and encourage them to make connections between topics and outside of class so that they can more fully understand your lessons.

Make flashcards.,
Identify roots, prefixes, and suffixes.,
Write down the words and definitions.",How to Study for an English Exam1," Flashcards are one of the best ways to memorize vocabulary words. Write down the word on one side of an index card and the definition on the other side.You can quiz yourself or have someone else quiz you.


You can use electronic flashcards too. There are computer programs and smart phone apps that are specifically made for studying information on flashcards: you enter the “front” and “back” of the cards and scroll through them.;
, One way to study vocabulary more quickly and effectively is to know common root words, prefixes, and suffixes. Being able to identify these can help you make educated guesses about vocabulary words instead of just having to memorize a long list of words that have little meaning for you.The prefixes un, in, il, and ir often indicate “not.”
The suffixes –ive, -ative, and –itive indicate that a word is an adjective- one that describes a noun.
The prefix man usually has to do with using your hands.
The suffix phobia indicates a fear of something.
The prefix re means back or again.
The prefixes sur, sub, suc, sup, and sus often mean under, below, or secretly.
The prefix psyche indicates a relationship to the mind.
The prefixes mono (one) and poly (many) indicate a number or amount.
The suffixes log, logo, and ology suggest the study of something.

, Even if you do not have flashcards, the act of writing down the words and definitions will help you remember them.


If you have time, try writing the words and definitions more than one time.
If you have a visual memory, try using different colors. You may be able to remember the color of the word and visualize the definition during the exam.

You may be tempted to take notes on your laptop, but resist the urge. In addition to the overwhelming temptation to surf Facebook, working on your computer actually doesn’t stimulate your brain to remember stuff as much as writing things out by hand does. Good old-fashioned pen and paper is the best way to take notes.Don’t try to copy down everything your teacher says. Listen to lectures and discussions and write down the most important things, such as definitions, vocabulary words, key terms, themes, etc.
Write down things that your teacher writes on the board or puts on slides.;
, If you’ve been assigned a textbook or a book like a novel for your class, bring it with you to every class meeting. Often, teachers will point out specific passages or parts that are particularly important. Use a highlighter or pencil to mark these, so you can remember them when you’re studying.


Make sure to get the edition of the book requested by your teacher. It may not seem important, but having the right edition of a book can be the difference between doing well and not doing great. It’s easier to follow along in class if your page numbers are the same as everyone else’s, and sometimes certain editions of books have helpful extra materials like glossaries or contextual information. Check the ISBN to make sure you get the right edition.

, It can be oh-so-tempting to skip class, especially if your freshman comp class is at 8 AM. However, English classes tend to rely very heavily on discussion. Even if you read the assigned materials, you will probably miss out on important information if you cut class. Go to every class meeting. Your grades will thank you.


If you can’t make class, ask ahead of time for a friend or classmate to take notes for you.
If you really have to miss class, ask your teacher for a breakdown of what s/he covered in class. It’s important to phrase this respectfully! Don’t just send an email asking “Did I miss anything important?” That implies that class usually isn’t important. Instead, speak with your teacher in person or write an email asking “Could you please share what we covered in class on Monday? I had a broken ankle and would love to know what I missed.”

, Sure, spending your weekend plowing through King Lear might not be your fantasy weekend, but it’s important to do the reading assigned. In many English classes, you may be asked to analyze a passage or write an essay exam discussing important themes, which you won’t be able to do if you haven’t read the text.


Summaries like Cliff Notes and Shmoop can be helpful if you’ve already read a text and are still clueless about what’s going on. However, you should never rely on them as your only source of information about a text. They aren’t the definitive word on the subject, and you may miss out on the things your teacher wants to emphasize if you only crib from summaries.
Re-reading texts can also help. If there’s a passage or poem that you don’t get the first time, don’t just stop there. Re-read it more slowly. Look up words you don’t know. Check to see if there are any study aids online. This review will pay off., Believe it or not, most English teachers don’t assign homework and other assignments just to torment you. These assignments help boost your knowledge and show your weak spots so you can prepare for exams and large essays. Completing them will help you stay on top of everything you’re supposed to be learning.


Often, these little assignments can be the difference between a good grade and a failing grade. Missing one homework assignment may not seem like a big deal, but they add up quickly, especially if your teacher gives them a lot of weight in the syllabus.

, Reading classic novels, poetry, and respectable journalism like The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal is the best way to boost your vocabulary. If you come across a word you don’t understand, look it up right there if you can. (You can access free online dictionaries with your phone.) If you can’t look it up immediately, copy down words you don’t know to look up later. Read good books whenever you have the time, so you won't fumble during vocabulary tests.


There are also many mobile apps that will test your vocabulary. Turning learning into a game can help you retain knowledge and enjoy yourself while studying.
Crossword puzzles can also expand your vocabulary, as they often use unusual words and synonyms for common words.Create mnemonic aids. If you’re having trouble getting a definition to “stick,” try making it into a mnemonic. For example, you might not remember that gregarious means “sociable, enjoying company,” but you might remember that “Greg Arious is a party animal!”
If your teacher gives you vocabulary lists or worksheets, make sure you study them!

, It’s a mistake to wait until the night before a big exam to look at your notes. Take a few minutes a few times a week to flip back through your notes and review key ideas. By “chunking” this information in small amounts over a longer period of time, you’ll remember a lot more of it.


The more often you review information, the more likely you are to commit it to your long-term memory.You’ll also be able to make connections between earlier material and new material if you familiarize yourself with your notes a few times a week. These kinds of connections will serve you very well on exams, especially essay exams.

, Plagiarism is representing any work that you did not personally do as your own. This can include passing off someone else’s ideas as your own, copying an essay from a webpage, or turning in work that you didn’t complete yourself. It can also include failing to accurately cite sources that you use in your own work.While it may seem like the easy way out to copy a few paragraphs from a website, it’s a bad idea for several reasons. The most important reason is that you won’t be learning anything if you plagiarize. The other important reason is that you will get caught, and plagiarism can have dire consequences, including failing the assignment, failing the class, or even being expelled.
If you’re concerned about your use of sources and other writers’ ideas, bring your essay to your teacher ahead of time. Teachers are usually very happy to help you make sure you’ve cited all your sources correctly and carefully -- if you see them ahead of time. Once you’ve turned your work in, all bets are off.
Remember: if you can find it online, your teacher can too. Most teachers are very familiar with how your writing sounds and will be able to pick up if it suddenly changes. Teachers also know the most commonly plagiarized sources, like Wikipedia, and many also use plagiarism detection software. To paraphrase Nike: Just don’t do it.

, So English isn’t your best subject, and your grade isn’t what you wanted it to be. Many English teachers understand that English scares a lot of students, and they offer extra credit in class if you complete related tasks, such as seeing a play or watching a movie and writing a short response.


Don’t assume that extra credit is a given. Teachers aren’t required to offer extra credit, so don’t be upset if yours doesn’t. If s/he does, consider yourself lucky.
Don’t wait until the very end of the semester or term! Get started on those extra credit tasks early. By the end of the semester, you may find yourself too slammed with work to do them.

, Some students will plow through class all semester without ever asking a single question. Don’t be one of them! If there’s something you don’t understand, or something that you feel could be clearer, speak up. Chances are, if you’re confused, your classmates probably are too -- and they’ll be glad you asked the question.


You can also ask your teacher if s/he can meet with you one-on-one if you have more detailed or involved questions. Many teachers are happy to meet with you during free periods or office hours.

, If you’re having trouble, a tutor can help. You don’t even need a formal tutor; you could consider asking a classmate who seems to have it all together to help you study or review important concepts. It can be hard to ask for help, but it’ll make all the difference to your grades.


Many high schools, colleges, and universities have writing centers. At these centers, you’ll find tutors who can help you with most types of writing, including English essays. They’re usually free and they’re a great resource, so use it if you’ve got it.

, You never know when something will happen to get in the way of studying (funeral, run-away dog, etc.). Give yourself at least a week to prepare for your exam. This will allow you to spread out your studying over several days, which is much more effective than trying to cram it all in on the night beforeTry scheduling specific time to study. If you make an appointment in your calendar with yourself, you may be more likely to take study time seriously. Set aside at least one hour per evening for a week to study for your exam.

, It’s a good idea to double-check the exam format. In many cases, your syllabus will say what types of tests and exams you can expect. If you aren’t clear, ask your teacher.Knowing the format of the exam will help you know what to study. For example, if it’s an essay exam, merely memorizing definitions won’t be much help. You’ll probably want to familiarize yourself with themes and significant concepts, too. If it’s a multiple-choice exam, you’ll know that you’re probably looking at factual information, such as names, plot points, and definitions.
If you need to study for an English Literature exam, Wikihow has a very helpful guide.

If you’re studying for a more content-based exam, Wikihow’s got your back there too: check out this guide.


, Many teachers will provide a study guide that outlines the important concepts, definitions, and other information you need to know. If you’ve been given one, make sure you review it and learn everything on it.


If you aren’t given a study guide, try making your own! As you review your notes, look for things that repeat or stand out, such as themes, concepts, and definitions. On a separate sheet of paper, write down all of these things. Now, you’ve got a study guide.

, Flashcards are an excellent way to memorize definitions, vocabulary words, even names of fictional characters. Write the term on one side and the definition on the other. Quiz yourself, or team up with a friend and quiz each other.There are also many mobile apps that will let you make flashcards for your phone. This can be very handy: you can flip through your flashcards when you’re in line at the store, riding the bus, or hanging out.

, You may think highlighting and underlining is the best way to study, but you’d be wrong. The way most students use these techniques doesn’t lead to information retention. Most of the time, you’ll have no idea why you highlighted something.Instead of highlighting or underlining, try jotting a few words in the margin of your reading to stimulate your memory for later.
If your teacher emphasizes a particular passage in class, go ahead and highlight it. But make sure you also note why it’s important.

, Mindlessly re-reading and re-reading your texts and notes won’t help you much. Instead, try to condense your notes to the most important material. Re-copy out the significant bits onto a new sheet of paper. Ask yourself questions as you go.


Asking yourself questions like “What’s the significance of this?” or “How does this fit with what I already know?” is a great way to figure out what’s really important in your notes and what isn’t. If something seems isolated and you can’t connect it to the other material, it probably isn’t important.

, It can be helpful to transform your notes into different mediums. Doing so encourages you to look at the information in new ways, and may also help you remember it better.


In addition to things like flashcards, consider making diagrams or even flow-charts. For example, if you want to understand the impact of Hamlet’s actions, you could make a flow-chart of every person who’s affected by his actions and in what way. You’ll be able to more easily visualize this information when you need it on test day.

, If your exam is an essay exam, consider outlining a few responses to “big picture” ideas. While you probably won’t be able to use all of this on the actual exam, chances are good that you’ll have a clearer idea of how to proceed with your answer if you’ve outlined it first.

, You are definitely not the only person in your class who’s worried about your English exam. Ask your classmates if they want to come over and study with you. You can quiz each other and compare notes.Planning ahead is crucial here: almost nobody will be able to form an impromptu study group the night before a test. Start a couple of weeks out.

, Just like studying for exams, you can’t write a good paper if you wait until the night before. You need to give yourself time to write a draft and revise it (sometimes more than once). Waiting until a day or two before it’s due to start an essay is a good way to get a bad grade.


Work on your essay in stages. Do your research and prep work, then outline it, then write a first draft. Give yourself a day or two “off” before you look at the draft to revise it.

, Your thesis statement is the road map for your paper. It tells your readers (and your teacher) what your essay will discuss or argue. Without a solid, clear thesis statement, your essay will feel meandering or shallow., Good essays have a logical organization that helps support the argument or discussion. Organization starts with having a clear thesis. Then, you can formulate an outline. After you’ve outlined your essay, filling in your ideas and discussion is relatively easy.

, Transitions and topic sentences act as “signposts” for your readers, saying “this is where the paper is going next.” Using them will help make your writing clear, readable, and smooth.A topic sentence will set the direction for your paragraph. It should give the reader an idea of what the paragraph’s main idea will be.You can find a list of common transitional words and phrases at the website of the Writing Center at the University of Wisconsin - Madison., Handing in what’s essentially the first draft of an essay isn’t likely to get you the grade you want. Revision is more than just proofreading. It’s a reconsideration of major things like structure, organization, and even content. It’s also crucial to presenting a polished final product worthy of that coveted “A.”Read through your essay from start to finish. Look for places where you repeat yourself, that don’t seem clear, or where ideas seem to jump around. You may need to reorganize sentences, shuffle paragraphs, or even -- yup -- delete and rewrite things.Check that your argument still relates to your thesis. It’s natural, and even good, for your argument to evolve as you write the essay. However, you need to check to make sure that what you’re arguing is still in line with what your thesis says you’ll argue. If not, tweak the thesis to align with what you actually wrote.

, Few things make an English teacher’s eyes twitch like sloppy proofreading errors. A misplaced comma or misspelled character name may not seem like a big deal to you, but to your teacher, it suggests that you didn’t value the class and the material enough to take your time doing a good job. Proofread your work carefully before turning it in.


Read your work aloud. By the time you’re at the proofreading stage, you’ll have read the essay so many times that you may be “filling in” information that isn’t there or missing errors. Go slowly and read aloud, marking and fixing errors as you find them..
Double-check things like vocabulary words, character and author names, and titles of literary works.

Look for helping verbs.,
Move the helping verb to the start of the sentence.,
Only move one word from long helping verbs.,
Look for helping verbs in contractions.",How to Change a Statement to Question1," Helping verbs are separate words that change the meaning of the main verb.If a statement has a helping verb, you can change it to a question easily. Here are some example statements with the helping verb in bold text:


The teachers have treated us kindly.
They had already eaten.
She will win the fight.
My cat would climb that tree.
A pie can feed eight people.
We shall meet again.
I was standing.;
, Leave the rest of the sentence as it is. Just move the helping verb to the front, and you've got a question.


The teachers have treated us kindly. → Have the teachers treated us kindly?
They had already eaten. → Had they already eaten?
She will win the fight. → Will she win the fight?
My cat would climb that tree. → Would my cat climb that tree?
That pie can feed eight people. → Can that pie feed eight people?
We shall meet again. → Shall we meet again?
I was standing. → Was I standing?

, Some helping verbs are more than one word long. For example, has been, will have been, will be, or would have been are all helping verbs. Just move the first word to the beginning of the sentence, and leave the rest where they are. Here are two examples:


Your brother has been growing quickly. → Has your brother been growing quickly?
I could have been studying. → Could I have been studying?

, Helping verbs are often put in contractions, making them hard to find. Keep an eye out for examples like these:



We'll be running all day. → We will be running all day. → Will we be running all day?
Our boss hasn't arrived yet. → Hasn't our boss arrived yet? (Or you can say ""Has our boss not arrived yet?"")

Re-read short selections of text.,
Read introductory material and side notes in your textbook.,
Review course notes.,
Identify “big picture” themes.,
Review online study guides and summaries.,
Memorize details such as characters’ names.",How to Study for an English Exam2," Any poems or short stories that you studied in class should be re-read. For longer texts like full-length novels, be sure to re-read any sections that seem really important or that your teacher spent a lot of time talking about in class.


If you took notes while discussing the texts, review the notes first, then re-read the text.
Be sure to consult your syllabus to remind yourself about all of the texts that you read.
Reviewing the chapter titles and the first and last sentences of each chapter of novels can help refresh your memory about the specifics of the novel.

, If you used a traditional textbook for your class, read the introductory material and any footnotes that accompany the poems or stories you read.


These items, often overlooked when initially reading the texts, often provide context and overviews that can be very helpful for essay questions.

, If you took notes in class, re-read them. If you don’t normally take notes, you should try to make an effort to do so in the future. This is the best way to remind yourself about what you talked about in class. Teachers rarely ask exam questions that were not directly discussed in class, so being able to review information from class time is the best study guide you can have. It is also good to review class work. 

, Many essay questions about literature will have to do with theme, or the “big picture” messages of a text. If you have trouble identifying themes on your own, try searching online for the name of the text plus the word “theme.” You will likely find some useful overviews and study guides. Knowing common themes in literature may help you identify them in specific texts:(Wo)Man versus nature
(Wo)Man versus a hostile society or God/the gods
The fleeting nature of time
The inevitability of death
The state of Alienation
The danger of ambition

, There are many websites devoted to providing students with summaries and study guides for canonical (popular and famous) texts. These can be great tools for studying, but they should never be used as a substitute for reading the text in the first place.


If you choose to use an online guide, use a reputable one written by experts. Avoid using personal blogs and websites that don't say they're written by experts.

, Though you may not be asked specifically to identify characters’ names and relationships to each other on the exam, these are details that will come in handy while taking the exam.


Getting characters’ names wrong or mixing up characters can undermine even otherwise great responses to test questions.
Use flashcards (either paper or electronic cards) to memorize characters’ names and details about them."

Refer to your study guide.,
Review your course syllabus.,
Review your class notes.,
Attend class before the exam.,
Ask your teacher what you should study.,
Consult previous course exams.,
Know the format of the exam.,
Determine appropriate test-taking materials.",How to Study for an English Exam3," The best way to prepare for an exam is to consult and fill out your entire study guide. Most teachers who give out a study guide are basically handing the class a key to the test. Becoming familiar with everything on the study guide can ensure success on the test.


If your teacher does not provide a study guide, this option may not be available to you. You could try visiting your teacher before or after class or during her office hours and asking for a guide or for tips about where best to focus your studying.

, If your instructor hands out a course syllabus or calendar, read over it. Often, the instructor’s philosophy about exams is part of a detailed syllabus.This can also serve as a reminder about specific texts you read or items that you focused on.


Anything that your teacher spent more than one day of class on is sure to be important.
Most syllabi include a section about exams. At the very least, you should be able to determine what percentage of your overall grade each exam makes up, which can help you determine how long you should spend studying for it.

, For some exams, you may need to be able to provide definitions of key concepts or literary movements. For others, you may need to be able to talk about how a theme is explored in various works. Look through your notes to check for definitions, lists, and any theme or topic that comes up more than once; this is usually a good sign that these may be on the exam.

, Often, the day or days before the exam are the best times to attend class. Your teacher will likely preview the exam and indicate directions of focus that you should study. This is also when teachers usually distribute study guides.


If you must miss class, ask a friend or reliable classmate for copies of any handouts or her notes from class. If she knows that you will be gone ahead of time, she is more likely to take thorough notes instead of just listening.
As a last resort, contact your teacher to find out what materials you missed in class. It is best to let her know you will be gone ahead of time, and tell her that you have tried to have another student take notes for you. Don't phrase your request by saying you wanted to know if you missed anything or if anything important was covered; this may offend your teacher. Instead, ask if your teacher will share with you what she went over in class.

, If your teacher does not volunteer a study guide or information about the exam, ask her about it towards the end of class one day. It is best to be very polite and just ask for guidance about studying rather than demanding to know what the content of the exam will be.


It’s also important to know whether the exam is cumulative, covering everything from the beginning of the semester, or if it is only covering material since your last exam.

, If this is not your first exam for the course, look at the last test you took. Many teachers use similar formats for each exam, so an earlier test can serve as a study guide or at least give you an idea about what to expect for the format of the exam.

, In addition to asking about the content of the exam, you should ask your instructor about the format of the exam.Knowing, for example, whether an exam will be multiple choice or entirely essay can help you decide how to study.


Knowing whether you will be taking the test on a computer or with pen and paper will also help you determine how best to study. A computer with word processing software may negate the need to spend a lot of time studying the spelling of vocabulary words, for example.

, Be sure that you will be prepared for the exam by bringing the appropriate materials for the exam. If your exam will be administered on a computer, you may not need to bring anything with you at all.


Find out if you need pen or pencil, paper or a test booklet, and if you will be able to use your textbook or novels that you read while taking the test.
Some teachers may even allow you to use a notecard or a study guide while taking the test.

Ask classmates if they want to meet to study.,
Share notes with each other.,
Talk about literature.,
Compare previous tests.",How to Study for an English Exam4," You are likely not the only person who wants to study for the English exam.Asking before or after class if anyone wants to meet for a study group can be a great way to increase the effectiveness of your studying.


You are more likely to be able to put together a study group if you do not wait until the day before the exam to suggest it: plan ahead.

, Everyone takes class notes differently, so circulating or comparing notes can be a good way to remember details about specific class discussions. This can also be a good way to review any material from days that you were absent from class.


Remember that your group members were not planning to share their notes, so be kind about their handwriting, messy notes, and/or doodling on their notes.
Don’t be embarrassed about the state of your class notes. You weren’t expecting to share, and even messy notes can be helpful to someone who doesn’t have any.

, A lively debate about the texts is a good way to get you interested in them and to review the content. Be sure you back up your discussion by looking at the text and finding opportunities to use “evidence” from the text to back-up your points.

, If your classmates are comfortable sharing the results of previous tests in the class, you can compare to see what types of responses seem to be the most successful for your particular teacher. Knowing, for example, if your teacher tends to give higher marks to longer, more detailed responses or to responses that are direct and to-the-point can help you determine how to approach answering questions on the test.

Identify the two basic parts of speech in a sentence.,
Learn about adjectives and adverbs in a sentence.,
Identify the role of the pronoun in a sentence.,
Understand the role of the preposition and the conjunction in a sentence.,
Use practice sentences.,
Identify the noun in the sentence.,
Find the verb in the sentence.,
Locate the adjective in the sentence.,
Note any adverbs and pronouns in the sentence.,
Identify the prepositions and conjunctions in the sentence.,
Practice with other example sentences and questions.",How to Find Parts Of Speech In Text," There are two basic parts of speech that will appear in a sentence: a noun and a verb.A noun is the name of a person, place, thing, or idea. For example: “woman”, “Montana”, “pen”, “sadness”. A noun often appears after an article, such as “the”, “a”, or “an”, in a sentence. Nouns can also be singular or plural and can function differently within one sentence.
For example: “The young man gave me a rare gift from Montana and then calmly told me he valued happiness above all else.” In this sentence, the nouns are: “man”, “gift” “Montana”, and “happiness”.
A verb expresses an action, or “to be”. For example: “run”, “swim”, “jump”, “sit”, “think”. In one sentence, there is a main verb and sometimes one or more verbs that help in the sentence. The verb in the sentence must agree with its subject, so if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural. Verbs can also appear in different tenses (past, present, future).
For example: “The young man gave me a rare gift from Montana and then calmly told me he valued happiness above all else.” In this sentence, the verbs are: “gave” “told” and “valued”.;
, Once you understand the two basic parts of speech, expand your knowledge to more complex parts of speech: adjectives and adverbs.An adjective describes or modifies a noun or a pronoun. For example: “cute”, “new”, “red”, “strong”. An adjective will answer the questions: which one, what kind, or how many. Keep in mind articles, such as “a”, “an”, “the”, are classified as adjectives.
For example: “The young man gave me a rare gift from Montana and then calmly told me he valued happiness above all else.” In this sentence, the adjectives are: “young” and “rare”.
An adverb describes or modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. However, adverbs never modify a noun. Adverbs usually end in “ly”. For example: “calmly”, “deeply”, “carefully”, “clearly”.
In the example sentence: “The young man gave me a rare gift from Montana and then calmly told me he valued happiness above all else,” the adverb is: “calmly”.

, A pronoun is a word that is used instead of a noun in a sentence. For example: “she”, “her”, “we”, “they”, “it”.


In the example sentence: “The young man gave me a rare gift from Montana and then calmly told me he valued happiness above all else,” the pronouns are “me” and “he”. “He” replaces “man” in the sentence.

, The preposition and the conjunction in a sentence are the smaller terms that frame the main parts of the sentence (the noun, the verb, and the adjective).A preposition appears before a noun or a pronoun. It will modify the noun or the pronoun in a sentence. For example: “by”, “with”, “without”, “about”, “until”, “from”.
In the example sentence: “The young man gave me a rare gift from Montana and then calmly told me he valued happiness above all else,” the preposition in the sentence is “from”.
A conjunction connects words, phrases, or clauses. It also tells the reader about the relationship between two words, phrases, or clauses. For example: “and”, “but”, “or”, “because”, “although”.
In the example sentence: “The young man gave me a rare gift from Montana and then calmly told me he valued happiness above all else,” the conjunction is “then”.

, Test your knowledge of the parts of speech in a text by practicing with example sentences. Type the sentence on your computer or write it down. Then, use highlighters, colored pens, or the highlight tool on your computer to identify each part of speech.


There are several example sentences you can access online, and practice parts of speech test sheets that you can use to test your knowledge. You can try using simple sentences to identify basic parts of speech, like the noun or the verb, and longer, more complex sentences to identify more complex parts of speech, like the adverb or the preposition., Choose a highlighter color for nouns and try to locate it the noun in a simple sentence, such as: “I went to the store.” In this sentence, the noun is the object, “store”. “He eats to fight off his anxiety.” In this sentence, the noun is the feeling, “anxiety”.


After you feel comfortable with locating the noun in a simple sentence, try a more complex sentence: “The little girl suddenly dropped her new doll and raced by me to the store.”
Use your highlighter to find all the nouns in this sentence: “girl”, “doll”, “store”.

, Choose another highlighter color for verbs and find the verb in a simple sentence, such as: “I walk to the station.” In this sentence, the verb is the action word, “walk”. “She drank all the juice.” In this sentence, the verb is the action word, “drank”.


Try to find the verbs in a more complex, and much longer sentence: “The little girl suddenly dropped her new doll and raced by me to the store.”
Use your highlighter to find all the verbs in this sentence: “dropped”, “raced”.

, Pick another highlighter color for adjectives and highlight the adjectives in a simple sentence, such as: “My mother dropped the blue vase.” In this sentence, the adjective is the descriptor “blue”. “My father sings Italian operas in the shower”. In this sentence, the adjective is the descriptor “Italian”.


Look for the adjectives in a more complex, and much longer sentence: “The little girl suddenly dropped her new doll and raced by me to the store.”
Use your highlighter to find all the adjectives in this sentence: “little”, “new”.

, Choose a highlighter color for adverbs and find the adverbs in a short, simple sentence, such as: “I spoke to him calmly.” In this sentence, the adverb, “calmly” is the modifying the verb “spoke”.


Identify the adverbs in a longer sentence: “The little girl suddenly dropped her new doll and raced by me to the store.”
Highlight the adverb in this sentence, “suddenly”.
Pick another highlighter color for pronouns and identify the pronouns in a simple sentence: “I picked him up at noon.” In this sentence, the pronoun is “him”.
Locate the pronouns in a longer sentence: “The little girl suddenly dropped her new doll and raced by me to the store.”
Highlight the pronouns in the this sentence: “her” and “me”.

, Practice identifying prepositions in a simple sentence: “I went with her to the store.” In this sentence, the preposition is “with”.


Practice finding the prepositions in a more complex sentence: “The little girl suddenly dropped her new doll and raced by me to the store.” The preposition in this sentence is “by” as it modifies “to the store”.
Try to find the conjunctions in a simple sentence: “We ate pizza and ice cream”. The conjunction in this sentence is “and” as it connects two nouns together, “pizza” and “ice cream”.
Try to identify the conjunction in a more complex sentence: “I didn’t want to go to the show that night because I knew she would be there.” In this sentence, the conjunction is “because” as it connects the first half of the sentence to the second half of the sentence.

, Once you have ran through several example sentences, simple and complex, use your highlighter colors to identify the parts of speech in one sentence or question.


For example: “Why did you go to the late show without me?” Use your highlighter colors to find the noun, the verb, the adjective, the pronouns, and the preposition in this sentence.
You may want to try highlighting the parts of speech of practice sentences and questions with a partner so you can quiz each other on the parts of speech.

Point out metaphors and similes.,
Identify the tone of the quote.,
Note the use of alliteration.",How to Analyze a Quote1," A quote, whether or written or spoken, will have a unique linguistic style and structure. Note the use of any figurative language (e.g. metaphors, similes) that may add depth or a double meaning to the words. Such comparisons often make quotes more memorable and consequential.As an example, you could write, “Hemingway used a blunt and dark metaphor when he said, ‘Writing is easy. You just open a vein and bleed.’”;
, Show the impact and significance of a quote by outlining the spirit in which it was spoken or written. Elements like sarcasm may alter the true meaning of a quote, while negativity or nihilism can intensify their message. Note the tone and mood of the quote, and mention if it is emblematic of the person who gave it.For instance, you might identify the tone of a Dorothy Parker quote by saying, ""with her typical tongue in cheek defeatism, Dorthy Parker wrote, 'Take me or leave me; or, as is the usual order of things, both'.""

, Alliteration is a literary tool that creates a musical effect in text and prose, making it enjoyable to recite and easy to memorize. This writing technique groups a number of words with the same first consonant sound closely together. Identify alliteration when analyzing a quote and comment on how it might have made the quote more memorable or recitable.For instance, an analysis of a famous line from ""Romeo and Juliet"" might note that, ""Shakespeare used alliteration in a memorable line that reads like a song: 'From forth the fatal loins of these two foes; a pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life.'""

Learn when to use ""does"".,
Add ""do"" instead for plural subjects or ""you"".,
Use ""did"" for simple past tense verbs.,
Move the verb ""to be"".",How to Change a Statement to Question2," If the statement has a singular subject and a verb in the simple present tense, add ""does"" to the beginning of the sentence. Change the verb to its base form, dropping all special verb endings.Here are a few examples:


He cleans the bedroom. → Does he clean the bedroom?
A year consists of four seasons. → Does a year consist of four seasons?
My cat listens when I talk. → Does my cat listen when I talk?

, If the subject is a plural noun and the verb is in the simple present tense, add the word ""do"" to the beginning of the sentence. Use ""do"" when the subject is ""you"" as well.


They greet their teacher. → Do they greet their teacher?
The protesters call for change. → Do the protesters call for change?
You throw stones at my window. → Do you throw stones at my window?

, ""Did"" is also used when the verb is in the simple past. It does not matter whether the subject is singular or plural. Even though the question is still in the past tense, change the verb back to its base, present tense form.


He saved the cat. → Did he save the cat?
The sheep jumped over the fence. → Did the sheep jump over the fence?
He broke my oven. → Did he break my oven?
Remember, a simple past tense verb has no helping verb. If you see the word ""was"" or ""has"" in front of a verb, you'll need to use the helping verb method instead.

, Statements with the verb ""to be"" do not need any extra words to turn into questions. Just move the verb in front of the subject.


I am happy to see you. → Am I happy to see you?
You are going home. → Are you going home?
He is thirsty. → Is he thirsty?
I was tired. → Was I tired?
You were happy. → Were you happy?
My father will leave tomorrow. → Will my father leave tomorrow?

For other forms of ""to be"", use the same rules as helping verbs: move the first word only. For example: The horse has been angry. → Has the horse been angry?

Add question words.,
Add a tag question.,
Use intonation.,
Add a question mark.",How to Change a Statement to Question3," Words like who, what, when, why, where and how are used to find out more information. Adding one of these to a statement doesn't just make it a question; it asks for a specific detail. Use the rules above to turn the statement into a question, then add the question word to the beginning. You must also switch the subject and the verb.


You are going home. → When are you going home?
The sheep jumped over the fence. → How did the sheep jump over the fence?

In this example you are adding a question word and changing the form of the verb jump from simple past to emphatic past (the sheep did jump). You could just as easily use have, which is the simple present perfect, or were (playing), the past progressive.



, Tag questions are statements with a question ""tagged"" onto the end.The statement stays exactly the same, except for a comma and a question fragment at the end. People often use tag questions when they're looking for confirmation of a fact. Here are some examples:


She eats fish. → She eats fish, right?

James Joyce was Irish. → James Joyce was Irish, wasn't he?


, When spoken aloud, the same sentence can become a question with a different tone of voice, with no other changes. This is never used in writing.


The correct intonation varies depending on what region you're in. It's best to learn this technique from a fluent English speaker from the region you'd like to visit.

, You can add question marks to the ends of sentences in writing, though generally these would be dialog questions.


You are going home. → You are going home?
She's a scientist. → She's a scientist? (insinuates disbelief)

Add any further explanatory notes.",How to Make a Map," Before you start drawing, you need to decide just how large of a map you’re going to create. Do you plan on showing an entire planet (perhaps even Earth) stretched out, a hemisphere, a single continent, a country, or just a state or city? This goes for both true-to-life maps and fantasy maps that you create from your imagination.;
, With very few exceptions, you will need to create a map (unless it’s an extreme close up) that includes both water and land. However, you’ll need to decide exactly how much of each you’re showing. For larger scale maps, you should be showing oceans, rivers, and lakes. Smaller scale maps may only show portions of an ocean, rivers, or a few lakes and ponds. If your map has only a few landmasses in an archipelago-type setting, you’ll likely have a page that is mostly water with a few islands.

, What style of map are you creating - geographical/physical, political, a road map, or something else? The type of map you make may change the way you outline or draw it, so determine this prior to starting your project. You can certainly create a map that is a combination of all three, but you’ll have to reduce the amount of detail you include in order to avoid overwhelming the viewer.


You can create maps based on other characteristics as well, such as trade routes, major population points, or different languages.

, This goes hand in hand with determining what you’ll include/the scale of your map, but is important to note. Do you plan on only marking off the largest or most important places on your map? Or, are you interested in showing even the smallest aspects of the are you’re portraying? The detail you intend to include may have a big impact on how big you physically draw the map (on a very large piece of paper/file, or a small file size or piece of paper).

, Although this applies mainly to those creating their own fantasy maps, thinking about weather patterns is important to designating certain physical aspects on your map. Where will there be lots of rain or desert areas? Will these areas match up with the locations of seas/oceans, mountain ranges, and the location on the planet (as they do in real life)? You might consider the climate/environment and weather patterns of certain areas before sketching them out, to make a more detailed and realistic map.

, Do you plan on hand-drawing your map, using a computer program to draw it, or creating your map using an online interactive map creator? Each of these will require different preparations, particularly if you intend on hand-drawing it. There are dozens of online map-making programs as well, if you’re not interested in doing so much work or aren’t certain of your artistic capabilities., If you’ve already decided how detailed your map is going to be, you should have a good idea of how many landmasses you’re drawing and their general size. Start with just a rough outline using straight lines to sketch out the landmasses. When you’ve gotten the outline just the way you want it, go over it again to create a more detailed outline (typically a bit wavy) depicting coasts and borders.


When outlining your landmasses, consider where tectonic plates (imaginary or real) would lie underneath. This will help you to form more a more realistic map, assuming you’re drawing it from your imagination.
Add details like peninsulas, islands, archipelagos, deltas, or inlets to your main land masses.

, It is typically assumed that the area around your land masses are oceans or other large bodies of water. However, now you should add in other smaller bodies of water or waterways that you may want to include. These typically are rivers, lakes, seas, canals, and bays. Depending on how detailed you get, ponds, streams, creeks, and coves may also be included on your map.


If a body of water is small but important (such as a cove or a canal) you may choose to mark it on the map and note that it is out of scale.

, You may or may not add a lot of detail to your land masses depending on the style of map that you’re going for, but normally at least a little detail is added. Consider putting mountain ranges, valleys, deserts, forests, and plateaus on your land. Keeping weather patterns and climate in mind, you can add jungles, rainforests, swamps, tundra, grasslands, and coral reefs throughout your map., Again, this will be different depending on the style of map you’re making, but it is generally helpful to add outlines for countries/territories and add a few major cities. Designate continental divisions, state lines, and territories with simple lines; these may follow natural boundaries like rivers or mountain ranges, or may be entirely of your own choice. You can show cities with a symbol of choice, typically a small dot of star.

, Maps are greatly enhanced with the addition of color. Color can show different styles of land mass (as in a physical map), show different countries (like a political map) or simply be decorative. If you choose not to add color, at least add shading in black and white/gray. You may add detailed layers of color to show specific items like cities or forests using a broad color palette, or you may use only 2-3 colors for basic differentiations.

, You aren’t technically required to add labels to a map, but it will be confusing indeed if you lack labels altogether. Start by labeling the largest and most important areas; you might show that these are the largest and most important by using a larger font/print than you do for the rest of your labels. If you want to create more detail, simply label more areas on your map. Use different styles of font to symbolize different types of labels, including italicized or bold font (or handwriting)., The key is a small box that identifies the symbols or colors that you used throughout your map. These will help the viewer to understand what a type of line or mark means, as well as why you chose to use a particular color. Be sure to include every symbol you used in your key, so that you don’t confuse the viewers.


The key is sometimes also called a legend.

, The scale designates how many miles/kilometers are represented in a square inch/centimeter on the map. You can create a scale by drawing a small ruler on the bottom that shows how much distance is portrayed in a small section of area. You may also add an inset map of a zoomed in or zoomed out portion to show the scale more accurately. If you’d rather, you can add a ratio for your scale instead of drawing anything (such as 1”: 100 miles).

, You can show the orientation of your map by adding a compass rose on some portion of the blank space. This will show the way the directions work, such as North/South and East/West. This is particularly helpful if the orientation of your map is non-traditional, such as having North located near the bottom.

, Latitude and longitude lines may not need to be used on a fantasy map, but are almost always required on a true-to-life map. These lines divide the map vertically and horizontally, so that specific locations can be found by looking at coordinates within these lines. Be sure that these lines are perfectly straight and evenly spaced.

, The area shown on maps, both physical and political, often change over time (even in a fantasy map). Therefore, you will need to make note of the time or date that the map is depicting somewhere on the page. You may also want to include the date that the map was originally drawn, although it is more important to make note of the date range the map depicts.

, You may be interested in writing a few explanatory notes on your map somewhere. These are not required, but are particularly helpful if your map is not a traditional set-up or if it is a fantasy map you have created. These traditionally go along the very bottom border of the map, so that the reader knows they are not meant to match up with a specific location on the map.

Use an up-to-date map.,
Go by continent.,
Prioritize countries you have trouble identifying.,
Quiz yourself alphabetically.,
Tie in current events.,
Use the method of Loci.",How to Memorise the Locations of Countries on a World Map1," Make sure that you are using an up to date map to study. Look for maps on reputable, regularly updated websites online, and print one out if you prefer to study a paper map. Otherwise, consider buying a new map to study at an office supply store, book store, or online.


For instance, visit the National geographic website at http://maps.nationalgeographic.com/maps for accurate, up-to-date world maps.;
, To keep from being overwhelmed, focus on only one or two continents at a time while studying. Trying to cover the entire map at once will break up your concentration and make memorization more difficult. If necessary, cover the parts of the map you are not concentrating on to keep your eyes focused.For example, devote each day of the week to studying one of the seven continents: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.

, Isolate the countries that you have trouble remembering and give them extra attention when studying (e.g. note the other countries and bodies of water surrounding them). Make a list of all of the countries that you make three or more guesses about without getting the right answer. When testing yourself, make a point to identify the countries you have difficulty remembering first, rather than the ones you recognize easily., To reinforce your knowledge of where countries are located on a world map, quiz yourself alphabetically. Choose a continent and try to name each country in it in alphabetical order. By making the studying process more complex, you will sharpen your focus on the material and challenge yourself more thoroughly., Use new stories and global current events to contextualize the countries you are trying to place. For instance, look up and memorize countries that are currently in the headlines to get a better sense of the geographical context of those news stories. Alternatively, if there are countries that you are having trouble memorizing on the world map, search them in Google News to get more information about them and create stronger mental associations., Try using the method of Loci, a technique used by Roman orators to remember long speeches, to memorize countries on a world map. Picture the countries of a continent within the framework of a familiar building (e.g. your home or workplace). Imagine memorable things happening in each room, section, or hallway, and assign countries from the map accordingly. Make the narrative memorable enough to stick in your mind and call up the connections you make with the world map.For example, associate countries in Europe with your colleagues' cubicles at work, and imagine an absurd narrative that will help you remember (e.g. remembering Portugal and Spain by picturing a co-worker's cubicle, which has shrunk in size and holds a child-sized desk and chair, located at the corner of another co-worker's cubicle which is large enough to accommodate flamenco dancers.

Question the status quo.,

Make it fun.,
Use apps and software.",How to Learn Geography," The approach that you take will be determined by what your learning goals are. If you would like to just know more about your world or do better at bar trivia questions about geography, the stakes are relatively low. If you are planning to take a multiple-country backpacking trip and will need to know your way around, or if you have slept through an entire geography class and need to prepare before the final exam, the stakes may be higher.


Ask yourself what you hope to achieve by learning geography, and let the answer to that question help guide your scope and approach.
For example, if you plan to backpack across Europe, you will want to focus on the region through which you are traveling and learn the culture, currency, and perhaps languages of each area.;
, It is impossible for anyone to immediately learn everything about every place in the world. Determining the scope of your learning, whether it is to know a smaller area really well, or a much bigger area more generally, will help you determine an approach. Some possible scopes may be:


Learn every road in my town
Learn all the major roads in my metropolitan area
Learn all of the cities or counties in my state
Learn all of the states and their capitals and governors
Learn all of the countries in the world
Learn all of the continents and oceans and the most populous countries
Learn all of the English-speaking countries
Learn all of the regions in Europe

, There are two main approaches to the study of geography: from the inside out or from the broad to the specific. An approach that moves from the inside out would take the area that you live in and slowly extend out until you have a more general knowledge of the world.An approach that moves from broad to specific would start with very general knowledge and move to more and more specific “layers” of knowledge.


If you select an “inside out” approach, begin by learning about your city or county. Then learn about the surrounding counties, then the state as a whole. Then learn about the bordering states, then the states that boarder those. Learn about all of the states, then the bordering countries. Keep expanding outward until you have a working knowledge of the geography of the world.
If you select a “broad to specific” approach, start by learning the continents and oceans. Then learn the countries. Then learn the capitals of each country. Then learn the major cities or regions in each country. Then learn the leaders of each country. Continue until you have the level of knowledge that you set out to learn. You may want to work on one continent at a time each time you move to a new level of specificity.

, To learn geography, you need access to maps. Many maps are available online, but you can also use printed maps. Maps contain a wealth of information but come in varying levels of detail; be sure to select a map or maps that provide all of the information that you wish to learn.You may want to find and print copies of blank maps. Copying the names of states, countries, or cities down on a blank map is a good way to learn them, and you can use blank maps to quiz yourself as well.

, Getting to know the name of a place on the outline of a map is somewhat impersonal, and memorizing just the names of countries may seem somewhat pointless to you if you don’t connect them to the people who live there.Every place is made up of people with often unique cultures and histories, and getting to know the character of a place by learning about the culture and the people can make your study of geography come to life.Try to make your study more interactive by “experiencing” the culture of a place. For example, you may find videos of a dance or music style unique to the region you’re studying.
You could also treat yourself by cooking a recipe from each area you study to put yourself in the culinary shoes of the local population. , Borders between countries often have a long history of conflict or controversy. Learning about the conflicts can make it easier to remember who is on each side of the border. Similarly, learning about any name changes of countries or cities—not just the fact that the name changed, but why it changed and who changed it—can give you richer context for understanding the area and remembering the current names of countries or cities.

, Civilization always settles around water. Most major cities—particularly cities with a long history—can be found near oceans, harbors, or large rivers. Learning about trade routes and imagining details about shipping and sea travel as the continent evolved into its current state can help give land areas context.

, If you are trying to learn geography but find it rather dull or rote, try to learn it in terms of an area or subject that does interest you. If you are particularly interested in climate, for example, learning about the climate of each region may help you remember the geography more effectively., The best way to really learn about an area is to visit it! While it may seem counter-intuitive to learn the geography after you visit a place (if, indeed, you are learning the geography in order to navigate effectively while visiting), it may be easier to internalize the details if you have an experience to draw upon. For example, if you’re trying to learn about the most populous cities in your state, try to visit each city. Traveling from one to another will give you a sense of the distance between each city as well as the key features of each city.

, Part of really understanding something is being able to think about it critically. In the case of geography, you may want to question who decides where borders go, who makes the maps that you are studying, or how political boundaries influence or change native populations who may not have conformed to the borders initially., Try to find a blank map of the country, continent, or region you’re learning about.Print the blank map, and do your best to fill the map out. You may want to begin by giving yourself a list of items to place on the map and work towards filling out the map purely from your memory.


Try searching online for “blank map of .” For example, you may search for “blank map of Africa.”
Use pencil while filling out the map so that you can erase and make changes. Additionally, you could reuse the map to quiz yourself again if you erase everything cleanly.

, One of the best ways to learn anything is to have fun with your learning. If you can find a way to turn your geography learning into a game, you will likely be more successful. Here are some ideas for keeping it fun:


Make a bet with a friend who is also learning geography about who can fill out a blank map of an area faster. The loser buys the other person dinner.
Make a fake passport, and every time you feel that you have mastered details about a country, give yourself a “stamp” from that country.Play an online geography trivia game.
Play trivia that includes a geography category. Many bars and restaurants have regular trivia nights, and you can use these as an opportunity to flex your geography “muscles.” You might even win money or a gift certificate that could pay for your meal!

, There are many apps for smartphones and tablets and software or online program options for learning geography. You can find a list of free geography quiz sites/programs here. Technology opens up the world to you, and if you embrace the opportunities afforded by various technology, you can learn about the geography and culture of many different places in the world in no time!


If the program you are using gives you a score, keep trying to improve your score each time you use the program.

Paraphrase the quote.,
Establish the quote’s significance.,
Relate the quote to current events or ideas.",How to Analyze a Quote2," Re-state the quote in your own words to clarify what it means. Begin with a phrase like, ""In other words,"" and present the quote in different terms to convey what the author meant. Be sure to avoid straying from the original meaning.For example, say, ""In other words, when Aristotle said, 'It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it', he meant that it is important to know what other people's beliefs are, even if you don't agree with them.""

, Link the quote to a greater significance, movement, or theory to justify why you’ve analyzed it. Be concise and convey this importance in no more than 2-3 sentences. Include a breakdown of how the quote affected its audience (e.g., by introducing a new idea or by inciting an emotional response).For instance, write something like, “This quote from Churchill, as part of a stirring speech that inspired Britain, encapsulates his role in boosting morale during the war.”

, Establish the lasting effect of a quote by demonstrating how it is still relevant today, beyond its immediate context. Look for parallels between different historical eras. Offer a theory for why the words have resonated over time.For example, you might connect the Winston Churchill quote, ""Healthy citizens are the greatest asset any country can have"", to current-day debates about healthcare.

Set up the quote.,
Introduce the source of the quote.,
Provide the quote.",How to Analyze a Quote3," Before presenting the quote that you will be analyzing, provide a sentence or two that sets up its tone and importance. Give some indication of how the quote should be received by attributing a positive or negative value to it. If possible, show how the quote was received when it it was first spoken or written.For instance, set up a negative quote by saying something like, ""Critics of the group were vocal about their dismay.""
Situate a quote within a theme or phenomenon by saying something like, ""The anti-vaccine movement has swept across the country in recent years.""

, Frame the quote within the context of who said it, when, and where. Provide the name of the individual who said it, and a bit of background about who they were and why they said it. Be sure to note when the quote was made and through what medium (e.g., in a book or speech).For instance: ""In his 1975 publication, 'Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison', Michel Foucault had this to say about power, knowledge, and sexuality : ""

, As a general rule, you should always present a quote in the same way as it was originally presented. Reproduce the spelling, internal punctuation, and capitalization of written quotes exactly, even if these elements are grammatically incorrect. If you are quoting a lecture, speech, or interview, make sure to get an accurate transcript to use from a library or reputable online archive. "

Plug all the known values into the formula.,
Use a calculator to find the sines of the angles.,
Simplify the complete ratio.,
Set the incomplete ratios equal to the complete ratio.",How to Use the Laws of Sines and Cosines1," To use the law of sines to find a missing side, you need to know at least two angles of the triangle and one side length.For example, you might have a triangle with two angles measuring 39 and 52 degrees, and you know that the side opposite the 39 degree angle is 4 cm long. You can use the law of sines to find both missing side lengths.
;
, The convention is that side lengths are labeled a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c}. The angle opposite each side is denoted by the capital letter of that side’s variable. For example, the angle opposite side a{\displaystyle a} is A{\displaystyle A}, the angle opposite side b{\displaystyle b} is B{\displaystyle B}, and the angle opposite side c{\displaystyle c} is C{\displaystyle C}.For example, in your triangle:a=4cm{\displaystyle a=4cm}; A=39degrees{\displaystyle A=39\;{\text{degrees}}}b=?{\displaystyle b=?}; B=52degrees{\displaystyle B=52\;{\text{degrees}}}c=?{\displaystyle c=?}; C=?{\displaystyle C=?}   


, The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.Thus, if you know two angles of a triangle, you can find the third angle by subtracting both angles from 180.

For example, since A=39degrees{\displaystyle A=39\;{\text{degrees}}} and B=52degrees{\displaystyle B=52\;{\text{degrees}}}, C=180−39−52=89degrees{\displaystyle C=180-39-52=89\;{\text{degrees}}}.


, The formula is asinA=bsinB=csinC{\displaystyle {\frac {a}{\sin {A}}}={\frac {b}{\sin {B}}}={\frac {c}{\sin {C}}}}. The formula shows that the ratio of one side of the triangle to the sine of the opposite angle is equal to the ratio of all other sides to their opposite angles., Make sure you substitute side lengths for the lowercase variables, and angles for the capital variables. Also, remember that opposite sides and angles should have the same letter.

For example, 4sin39=bsin52=csin89{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{\sin {39}}}={\frac {b}{\sin {52}}}={\frac {c}{\sin {89}}}}.


, You can also use a trigonometry table.Substitute the sines in the denominators of the ratios.

For example, sin39=0.6293{\displaystyle \sin {39}=0.6293}, sin52=0.788{\displaystyle \sin {52}=0.788}, and sin89=0.9998{\displaystyle \sin {89}=0.9998}. So, your ratios will now look like this: 40.6293=b0.788=c0.9998{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{0.6293}}={\frac {b}{0.788}}={\frac {c}{0.9998}}}.


, You have one complete ratio, with an angle and side. To simplify it, divide the numerator by the denominator.

For example, 40.6293=6.3562{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{0.6293}}=6.3562}.


, To solve for a missing variable, multiply the complete ratio by the denominator of either incomplete ratio.

For example:6.3562=b0.788{\displaystyle 6.3562={\frac {b}{0.788}}}(6.3562)(0.788)=(b0.788)(0.788){\displaystyle (6.3562)(0.788)=({\frac {b}{0.788}})(0.788)}5.0087=b{\displaystyle 5.0087=b}AND6.3562=c0.9998{\displaystyle 6.3562={\frac {c}{0.9998}}}(6.3562)(0.9998)=(c0.9998)(0.9998){\displaystyle (6.3562)(0.9998)=({\frac {c}{0.9998}})(0.9998)}6.3549=c{\displaystyle 6.3549=c}Thus, side b{\displaystyle b} is about 5 cm long, and side c{\displaystyle c} is about 6.35 cm long.

Solve a problem with incomplete information.",How to Use the Sine Rule," The sides of a triangle are traditionally marked with three consecutive letters, usually A, B and C. The order that you choose to mark the sides generally does not matter, unless something in the problem you are working on specifies it., Mark the three angles of the triangle with letters that correspond to the side lengths. For example, if you use capital letters A, B and C for the sides, then mark the angles with lower case letters a, b and c. You can also use lower case Greek letters α,β,and γ{\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta ,{\text{and }}\gamma }. Place these so they correspond with the labeled sides, so angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } is opposite side A, angle β{\displaystyle \beta } is opposite side B, and angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is opposite side C.One way to determine that a side is “opposite” a chosen angle is to make sure that it does not form one of the rays of the angle. If labeled correctly, angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } wll be formed by the two sides B and C. It will therefore be “opposite” side A.

Similarly, angle β{\displaystyle \beta } is formed by sides A and C and is opposite side B.

Angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is formed by sides A and B and is opposite side C.

Some math texts will use capital letters for the sides and lower case for the angles. Others do the opposite. It does not matter, as long as you are consistent.


, In your problem, you must be given some side and angle measurements. You should mark these on your sketch of the triangle.You may be able to calculate one or more measurements using some rules of geometry. 

For example, if you are told that the triangle is isosceles, then you are able to mark that two of the angles are equal, as well as the two corresponding sides.

As another example, if you are told that two angles are 40 and 75 degrees, you can then calculate the third angle to be 65 degrees, since all three angles must add up to 180 degrees.




, The Sine Rule, also called the law of sines, is a rule of trigonometry that relates the sides of a triangle and its angle measurements. While most of trigonometry is based on the relationships of right triangles, the law of sines can apply to any triangle, whether or not it has a right angle.'

The law of sines is stated as follows:


Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β=Csin⁡γ{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}={\frac {C}{\sin \gamma }}}



The same rule can be rearranged to yield the following equivalent statements:


sin⁡αA=sin⁡βB=sin⁡γC{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin \alpha }{A}}={\frac {\sin \beta }{B}}={\frac {\sin \gamma }{C}}}




, For the law of sines to be useful, you must know the measurements of at least two angles and one side, or two sides and one angle. In either case, you must have at least one pair that consists of a side and its opposite angle.For example, the following combinations would be sufficient for the law of sines to apply:

Side A, Side B and angle α{\displaystyle \alpha }

Side A, Side C, and angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma }

Side B, angle β{\displaystyle \beta } and angle α{\displaystyle \alpha }



The following combinations are examples that would NOT be sufficient to apply the law of sines:

Side A, Side B and Side C. (This does not work because you have no angle measurement.)

Side A, Side B and angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma }. (This does not work because the known angle is not opposite either of the known sides.

Side B, angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } and angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma }. (This does not work because the known side is not opposite either of the known angles.)




, The law of sines works to help you find one piece of information about a triangle -- a side or an angle measurement -- if you know three others. While the full law of sines is written as a three-part equation, you only need to equate two for the rule to work.For example, if you know sides A and B and angle α{\displaystyle \alpha }, then you need the portion of the law of sines that says:


Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}}



Notice the similarity of the law. It really doesn’t matter which label you use for any sides or angles. The important thing to remember is that you are comparing ratios. The ratio of any side to its opposing angle is equal to the ratio of any other side to its opposing angle.


, Suppose you are given that side A is 12, angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } is 80 degrees, and angle β{\displaystyle \beta } is 40 degrees. Find the length of side B. You can mark these numbers on the triangle and set up the problem as follows:Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}}


12sin⁡80=Bsin⁡40{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{\sin 80}}={\frac {B}{\sin 40}}}


, Use basic algebra to maneuver the unknown information to stand alone on either side of the equation. You can then reduce the problem to find the answer.12sin⁡80=Bsin⁡40{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{\sin 80}}={\frac {B}{\sin 40}}}


12sin⁡40sin⁡80=B{\displaystyle {\frac {12\sin 40}{\sin 80}}=B}


7.83=B{\displaystyle 7.83=B}

To find the value of the sine of an angle, such as sin⁡40{\displaystyle \sin 40} in the problem above, you can use most handheld calculators with trigonometric functions. Different calculators operate differently. With some calculators, you will enter your angle measurement first and then the ""sin"" button. With others, you will enter the ""sin"" button first and then the angle measurement. You will have to experiment with your calculator. 

Alternatively, there are some tables available either in math books or online. With a trigonometry table, you can find your desired angle measure in one column and the corresponding value of sine, cosine or tangent in another column.


, Suppose, as a different problem, that you know two sides and need to solve an unknown angle. You are given that side A is 10 inches long, side B is 7 inches long, and angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } is 50 degrees. You can use this information to find the measurement of angle β{\displaystyle \beta }. Set up the problem as follows:Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}}


10sin⁡50=7sin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{\sin 50}}={\frac {7}{\sin \beta }}}


sin⁡β=7sin⁡5010{\displaystyle \sin \beta ={\frac {7\sin 50}{10}}}


sin⁡β=7∗0.76610{\displaystyle \sin \beta ={\frac {7*0.766}{10}}}


sin⁡β=0.536{\displaystyle \sin \beta =0.536}


, In the above example, the law of sines provides the sine of the selected angle as its solution. To find the measure of the angle itself, you must use the inverse sine function. This is also called the arcsine. On a calculator, this is generally marked as sin−1{\displaystyle \sin ^{-1}}. Use this to find the measure of the angle.For the example above, the final step is as follows:


sin⁡β=0.536{\displaystyle \sin \beta =0.536}


β=arcsin⁡0.536{\displaystyle \beta =\arcsin 0.536}


β=32.4{\displaystyle \beta =32.4}.




, Suppose you are told that angle α=30 degrees{\displaystyle \alpha =30{\text{ degrees}}}, angle β=50 degrees{\displaystyle \beta =50{\text{ degrees}}}, and side C, which connects them, is 10 inches long. Find the measurement of all sides and angles for the triangle.

First, you should recognize that you do not yet have enough information for the sine rule to apply. The sine rule requires that you have at least one pair with an angle that opposes a known side. However, you can calculate the third angle of this triangle using simple subtraction. All three angles add up to 180 degrees, so you can find angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma } by subtracting:


γ=180−α−β=180−30−50=100{\displaystyle \gamma =180-\alpha -\beta =180-30-50=100}



Now that you know all three angles, you can use the sine rule to find the two remaining sides. Solve them one at a time:


Csin⁡γ=Bsin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{\sin \gamma }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}}


10sin⁡100=Bsin⁡50{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{\sin 100}}={\frac {B}{\sin 50}}}


10sin⁡50sin⁡100=B{\displaystyle {\frac {10\sin 50}{\sin 100}}=B}


10∗0.7660.985=B{\displaystyle {\frac {10*0.766}{0.985}}=B}


7.78=B{\displaystyle 7.78=B}



Thus, side B is 7.78 inches long. Now solve for the final remaining side.


Csin⁡γ=Asin⁡α{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{\sin \gamma }}={\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}}


10sin⁡100=Asin⁡30{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{\sin 100}}={\frac {A}{\sin 30}}}


10sin⁡30sin⁡100=A{\displaystyle {\frac {10\sin 30}{\sin 100}}=A}


10∗0.50.985=A{\displaystyle {\frac {10*0.5}{0.985}}=A}


5.08=A{\displaystyle 5.08=A}



Side A, therefore, is 5.08 inches long. You now have all three angles, 30, 50 and 100 degrees, and all three sides, 5.08, 7.78, and 10 inches.

Write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle using the diameter.,
Plug the given value of the diameter into the formula and solve.",How to Calculate the Circumference of a Circle2," The formula is simply this: C = πd. In this equation, ""C"" represents the circumference of the circle, and ""d"" represents its diameter. That is to say, you can find the circumference of a circle just by multiplying the diameter by pi. Plugging π into your calculator will give you its numerical value, which is a closer approximation of 3.14.

,

Example problem: You have a circle tub with a diameter of 8 feet, and you want to build a white fence that creates a 6-foot wide space around the tub. To find the circumference of the fence that has to be created, you should first find the diameter of the tub and the fence which will be 8 feet + 6 feet + 6 feet, which will account for the entire diameter of the tub and fence. The diameter is 8 + 6 + 6, or 20 feet. Now plug it into the formula, plug π into your calculator for its numerical value, and solve for the circumference:






C = πd
C = π x 20
C = 62.8 feet

"
"
Write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle using the radius.,
Plug the given radius into the equation and solve.",How to Calculate the Circumference of a Circle3," The radius is half as long as the diameter, so the diameter can be thought of as 2r. Keeping this in mind, you can write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle given the radius: C = 2πr. In this formula, ""r"" represents the radius of the circle. Again, you can plug π into your calculator to get its numeral value, which is a closer approximation of 3.14.

, For this example, let's say you're cutting out a decorative strip of paper to wrap around the edge of a pie you've just made. The radius of the pie is 5 inches (12.7 cm). To find the circumference that you need, just plug the radius into the equation:


C = 2πr
C = 2π x 5
C = 10π
C = 31.4 inches (79.8 cm).

Set up the formula for finding the sum of the interior angles.,
Count the number of sides in your polygon.,
Plug the the value of n{\displaystyle n} into the formula.,
Solve for n{\displaystyle n}.",How to Calculate the Sum of Interior Angles1," The formula is sum=(n−2)×180{\displaystyle sum=(n-2)\times 180}, where sum{\displaystyle sum} is the sum of the interior angles of the polygon, and n{\displaystyle n} equals the number of sides in the polygon.The value 180 comes from how many degrees are in a triangle. The other part of the formula, n−2{\displaystyle n-2} is a way to determine how many triangles the polygon can be divided into. So, essentially the formula is calculating the degrees inside the triangles that make up the polygon.This method will work whether you are working with a regular or irregular polygon. Regular and irregular polygons with the same number of sides will always have the same sum of interior angles, the difference only being that in a regular polygon, all interior angles have the same measurement.In an irregular polygon, some of the angles will be smaller, some of the angles will be larger, but they will still add up to the same number of degrees that are in the regular shape.
;
, Remember that a polygon must have at least three straight sides.

For example, if you want to know the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon, you would count 6 sides.


, Remember, n{\displaystyle n} is the number of sides in your polygon.

For example, if you are working with a hexagon, n=6{\displaystyle n=6}, since a hexagon has 6 sides. So, your formula should look like this:sum=(6−2)×180{\displaystyle sum=(6-2)\times 180}


, To do this, subtract 2 from the number of sides, and multiply the difference by 180. This will give you, in degrees, the sum of the interior angles in your polygon.

For example, to find out the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon, you would calculate:sum=(6−2)×180{\displaystyle sum=(6-2)\times 180}sum=(4)×180{\displaystyle sum=(4)\times 180}sum=(4)×180=720{\displaystyle sum=(4)\times 180=720}So, the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is 720 degrees.

Plug all the known values into the formula.,
Set up an equation to find the missing angle.,
Find the sine of the known angle.,
Isolate the missing sine and simplify the equation.,
Find the inverse sine.",How to Use the Laws of Sines and Cosines2," To use the law of sines to find a missing angle, you need to know at least two side lengths and one angle.For example, you might have a triangle that has one side that is 10 cm long. Another side is 8 cm long, and the angle opposite is 50 degrees. You need to find the angle opposite the side that is 10 cm long.


, The convention is that side lengths are labeled a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c}. The angle opposite each side is denoted by the capital letter of that side’s variable. For example, the angle opposite side a{\displaystyle a} is A{\displaystyle A}, the angle opposite side b{\displaystyle b} is B{\displaystyle B}, and the angle opposite side c{\displaystyle c} is C{\displaystyle C}.For example, in your triangle:a=8cm{\displaystyle a=8cm}; A=50degrees{\displaystyle A=50\;{\text{degrees}}}b=10cm{\displaystyle b=10cm}; B=?{\displaystyle B=?}c=?{\displaystyle c=?}; C=?{\displaystyle C=?}

Since you want to find the angle opposite the 10 cm side, you are looking for angle B.




, The formula is asinA=bsinB=csinC{\displaystyle {\frac {a}{\sin {A}}}={\frac {b}{\sin {B}}}={\frac {c}{\sin {C}}}}. The formula shows that the ratio of one side of the triangle to the sine of the opposite angle is equal to the ratio of all other sides to their opposite angles., Take care to substitute the values correctly, so that the side lengths are in the numerators of the formula, and their opposite angles are in the corresponding denominators.

For example, 8sin50=10sinB=csinC{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{\sin {50}}}={\frac {10}{\sin {B}}}={\frac {c}{\sin {C}}}}.


, To do this, set the complete ratio equal to the ratio with the angle you are solving for. Take the reciprocal of each ratio, so that the side length is in the denominator, and the sine of the angle is in the numerator.For example, since you know side a{\displaystyle a} and angle A{\displaystyle A}, and are solving for angle B{\displaystyle B}, you would set up the ratio 8sin50=10sinB{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{\sin {50}}}={\frac {10}{\sin {B}}}}. Taking the reciprocals, you have sin508=sinB10{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin {50}}{8}}={\frac {\sin {B}}{10}}}.


, Use a calculator or trigonometry table to do this. Plug the decimal into the equation.

For example, sin50=0.766{\displaystyle \sin {50}=0.766}. So, the equation should now look like this: 0.7668=sinB10{\displaystyle {\frac {0.766}{8}}={\frac {\sin {B}}{10}}}


, To do this, multiply each side of the equation by the unknown angle’s denominator, then simplify the remaining ratio.

For example:sin508=sinB10{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin {50}}{8}}={\frac {\sin {B}}{10}}}(0.7668)(10)=(sinB10)(10){\displaystyle ({\frac {0.766}{8}})(10)=({\frac {\sin {B}}{10}})(10)}0.766×108=sinB{\displaystyle {\frac {0.766\times 10}{8}}=\sin {B}}7.668=sinB{\displaystyle {\frac {7.66}{8}}=\sin {B}}0.9575=sinB{\displaystyle 0.9575=\sin {B}}


, The inverse sine is shown by the SIN−1{\displaystyle SIN^{-1}} button on a calculator. The inverse sine will give you measurement of the missing angle.For example, the inverse sine of 0.9575 is 73.2358. So, angle B{\displaystyle B} is about 73.24 degrees.

Square the known side lengths.,
Find the difference.",How to Use the Laws of Sines and Cosines3," To find a missing side length using the law of cosines, you need to  know the length of the other two sides of the triangles, and the measurement of the angle between them.For example, you might have a triangle with sides that are 5 and 9 cm long, and the angle between them is 85 degrees. You need to find the length of the missing side.


, The convention is that side lengths are labeled a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c}. The angle opposite each side is denoted by the capital letter of that side’s variable. For example, the angle opposite side a{\displaystyle a} is A{\displaystyle A}, the angle opposite side b{\displaystyle b} is B{\displaystyle B}, and the angle opposite side c{\displaystyle c} is C{\displaystyle C}.For example, in your triangle:a=5cm{\displaystyle a=5cm}; A=?{\displaystyle A=?}b=9cm{\displaystyle b=9cm}; B=?{\displaystyle B=?}c=?{\displaystyle c=?}; C=85{\displaystyle C=85}

Since you want to find the side opposite the 85 degree angle, you are looking for side c{\displaystyle c}.




, The formula is c2=a2+b2−2abcosC{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos {C}}. In this formula, c{\displaystyle c} is the missing side length., Make sure you substitute the correct values for the correct variables. The side you are trying to find should be c{\displaystyle c}, and the angle you know should be C{\displaystyle C}.

For example, c2=52+92−2(5)(9)cos85{\displaystyle c^{2}=5^{2}+9^{2}-2(5)(9)\cos {85}}.


, Plug this value into the equation, and multiply.

For example, cos85=0.0872{\displaystyle \cos {85}=0.0872}. So, your equation should now look like this: c2=52+92−2(5)(9)(0.0872){\displaystyle c^{2}=5^{2}+9^{2}-2(5)(9)(0.0872)}.Multiplying, you get c2=52+92−7.844{\displaystyle c^{2}=5^{2}+9^{2}-7.844}.


, Remember that to square a number means to multiply the number by itself. Square the numbers, then add them together.

For example:c2=25+81−7.844{\displaystyle c^{2}=25+81-7.844}c2=106−7.844{\displaystyle c^{2}=106-7.844}


, This will give you the value of c2{\displaystyle c^{2}}. Then, you can take the square root of both sides of the equation to find c{\displaystyle c}.For example:c2=106−7.844{\displaystyle c^{2}=106-7.844}c2=98.156{\displaystyle c^{2}=98.156}c2=98.156{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c^{2}}}={\sqrt {98.156}}}c=9.9074{\displaystyle c=9.9074}Thus, side c{\displaystyle c} is about 9.91 cm long.

Draw the polygon whose angles you need to sum.,
Choose one vertex.,
Draw a straight line from Point A to each other vertex in the polygon.,
Multiply the number of triangles you created by 180.",How to Calculate the Sum of Interior Angles2," The polygon can have any number of sides and can be regular or irregular.

For example, you might want to find the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon, so you would draw a six-sided shape.


, Label this vertex A.

A vertex is a point where two sides of a polygon meet.


, The lines should not cross. You should create a number of triangles.

You do not have to draw lines to the adjacent vertices, since they are already connected by a side.

For example, for a hexagon you should draw three lines, dividing the shape into 4 triangles.


, Since there are 180 degrees in a triangle, by multiplying the number of triangles in your polygon by 180, you can find the sum of the interior angles of your polygon.

For example, since you divided your hexagon into 4 triangles, you would calculate 4×180=720{\displaystyle 4\times 180=720} to find a total of 720 degrees in the interior of your polygon.

Find the inverse cosine.",How to Use the Laws of Sines and Cosines4," To find the missing angle using the law of cosines, you need to know the length of all three sides of the triangle.For example, you might have a triangle with sides measuring 14, 17, and 20 cm. You need to find the angle opposite the 20 cm side.


, The convention is that side lengths are labeled a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c}. The angle opposite each side is denoted by the capital letter of that side’s variable. For example, the angle opposite side a{\displaystyle a} is A{\displaystyle A}, the angle opposite side b{\displaystyle b} is B{\displaystyle B}, and the angle opposite side c{\displaystyle c} is C{\displaystyle C}.For example, in your triangle:a=14cm{\displaystyle a=14cm}; A=?{\displaystyle A=?}b=17cm{\displaystyle b=17cm}; B=?{\displaystyle B=?}c=20cm{\displaystyle c=20cm}; C=?{\displaystyle C=?}

Since you want to find the side opposite the 20 cm side, you are looking for side c{\displaystyle c}.




, The formula is c2=a2+b2−2abcosC{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos {C}}. In this formula, C{\displaystyle C} is the angle you are trying to find., Make sure you substitute the correct values for the correct variables. The angle you are trying to find should be C{\displaystyle C}. This means that c{\displaystyle c} should be the side opposite the angle you are trying to solve.

For example, 202=142+172−2(14)(17)cosC{\displaystyle 20^{2}=14^{2}+17^{2}-2(14)(17)\cos {C}}.


, First, find the squares of the side lengths. Then, make the appropriate multiplications. Then, add.

For example:202=142+172−2(14)(17)cosC{\displaystyle 20^{2}=14^{2}+17^{2}-2(14)(17)\cos {C}}400=196+289−2(14)(17)cosC{\displaystyle 400=196+289-2(14)(17)\cos {C}}400=196+289−(476)cosC{\displaystyle 400=196+289-(476)\cos {C}}400=485−(476)cosC{\displaystyle 400=485-(476)\cos {C}}


, To do this, subtract the sum of the squares of sides a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} from each side of the equation. Then, divide each side by the cosine’s coefficient.

For example:400=485−(476)cosC{\displaystyle 400=485-(476)\cos {C}}400−485=485−485−(476)cosC{\displaystyle 400-485=485-485-(476)\cos {C}}−85=(−476)cosC{\displaystyle -85=(-476)\cos {C}}−85−476=(−476)cosC−476{\displaystyle {\frac {-85}{-476}}={\frac {(-476)\cos {C}}{-476}}}0.1786=cosC{\displaystyle 0.1786=\cos {C}}


, Use the COS−1{\displaystyle COS^{-1}} key on a calculator to do this. The inverse cosine will give you the measurement of the missing angle.For example, the inverse cosine of 0.1786 is 79.7134. So, angle C{\displaystyle C} is about 79.71 degrees.

Fortunately, with something geographical like world capitals, you've got the visual aids built right in.Try printing off a blank map of the world, and write in the capitals and country names while looking at another map. Color in the map to help your visual memory. You can also draw in details related to the country, such as adding a picture of the country's flag or national flower.Next, try filling in a new map without looking at another map., Mnemonic devices are tricks to help you remember or learn something. For instance, say you wanted to remember to get bananas, beef, and flour at the store. You might try visualizing a cow eating a banana with a sack of flour balanced on his head. More appropriately for world capitals, try making a visual map in your head, also known as the Method of Loci.With this mnemonic device, you imagine a place you know and visualize items in that place. The items help you remember what you need to. If this method sounds good to you, try visualizing an item that reminds you of the capital and country. For instance, for London, England, you might think of a plate of fish and chips.However, for world capitals, it might be better to imagine a world map. Visualize a world map in your head, large enough that you can stomp from country to country in one step. As you walk through the world, visualize the capital and name of each country., Rhymes and rhythms help things stick in your memory. That's why nursery rhymes and kids' songs are so easy to remember.You could try singing the world capitals to a current popular tune, one that you already like a lot.You could also try a world capital's song that's already out there, such as the expanded version of the Animaniacs' state capitals song that includes world capitals., For example, the capital of Ecuador is just ""taquito"" without the ""ta"" at the beginning. That makes ""Quito""! The capital of France is the word ""pairs"" with the ""r"" and ""I"" swapped. That makes ""Paris""!

, Use these phrases to memorize the capitals.


The capital of Portugal is the phrase ""no basil"" spelled backwards without the space between ""no"" and ""basil"", and without the ""a"" in the word ""basil"". That makes ""Lisbon""!
Another example: to find the capital of Armenia, you can use the phrase ""yer van"", which means ""your van"". Then, add an ""e"" in the middle and remove the spaces. Now you have ""Yerevan!""

, Try to find a homophone for as many capital cities as you can. For example, the capital of Taiwan is Taipei. Taipei is a homophone of the personality type ""Type A"".

, Studying with friends can make study time more fun and engaging, as long as you stay mostly on topic. Have your friends quiz you by asking you what world capital belongs with what country.Keep your group small. Too many people can be distracting. Don't have more than 4 or 5 people in your study group.Don't forget to return the favor and quiz your friends, too. It will also help reinforce the information for you, too, as you're still going over the material., Put the capital on one side and the country on the other side. Go through the stack, trying to remember the other side without looking. Try to come up with the answer before you peek.

, Write the name of a capital on one card and the name of the country on another. Repeat until you have all the capitals and countries on individual cards. Lay them face down on a table. Turn one over, and turn another one over. Only keep the set if the country and capital match up. You can play by yourself or against another person.

, World news often talks about the capitals of other countries. You'll be more informed overall, but you'll also start picking up on facts about the capitals. You'll associate the capitals with real people and real events, which will help you remember them. However, if you're under 18, make sure to ask your parents if it's okay for you to watch, as news channels can be graphic.

, Geography board games or online games can reinforce what you've learned. In addition, they make learning more fun, so you won't get as bored as easily.One place to quiz yourself on geography is Free Rice. Just be sure to select ""World Capitals,"" which you'll find under ""Geography"" on the ""Subjects"" page.In addition to helping you learn the game, Free Rice also donates rice to people who are hungry., If you don't review what you've learned, you'll gradually lose it. If you don't want to forget your world capitals, continue to go over the material so it sticks with you."

Know the formula for the area of a square.,
Find the square root of the area.,
Multiply the side length by 4 to find the perimeter.",How to Calculate the Perimeter of a Square2," The area of any rectangle (remember, squares are special rectangles) is defined as its base times its height.Since the base and the height of a square are the same length, the area of a square with side length s is s*s, or A = s2.

, The square root of the area will give you the length of one of the sides of the square. For most numbers, you will need to use a calculator to find the square root, by first typing in the value of the area, followed by the square root (√) key. You can also learn to Calculate a Square Root by Hand!


If the area of your square is 20, then the side length s =√20, or 4.472.
If the area of the square is 25, then s = √25, or 5.

, Take the side length s you just calculated and plug it into the perimeter formula, P = 4s. The result will be the perimeter of your square!


For the square with area 20 and side length 4.472, the perimeter P = 4 * 4.472, or 17.888.
For the square with area 25 and side length 5, P = 4 * 5, or 20.

Understand what an inscribed square is.,
Recognize the relationship between the radius of the circle, and the side length of the square.,
Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the side length of the square.,
Multiply the side length of the square by four to find the perimeter.,
Solve an example equation.",How to Calculate the Perimeter of a Square3," Inscribed shapes come up fairly often on standardized tests like the GMAT and GRE, so it is important to know what they are. A square inscribed in a circle is a square that is drawn inside of the circle, so that all four vertices (corners) lie on the edge of the circle., The distance from the center of an inscribed square to each of its corners is equal to the radius of the circle. To find the length of s, we must first imagine cutting the square in half diagonally to form two right triangles. Each of these triangles will have equal sides a and b and hypotenuse c, which we know is equal to two times the radius of the circle, or 2r.

, The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right triangle with sides a and b and hypotenuse c, a2 + b2 = c2 . Since sides a and b are equal (remember, we are still dealing with a square!) and we know that c = 2r, we can write out the equation and simplify the equation to find the side length as follows:


a2 + a2 = (2r)2""', now simplify the expressions:

2a2 = 4(r)2, now divide both sides by 2:

(a2) = 2(r)2, now take the square root of each side:

a = √(2r). Our side length s for the inscribed square = √(2r).

, In this case, the perimeter of the square P = 4√(2r). Because of the distributive properties of exponents, which tells us that 4√(2r) is equal to 4√2 * 4√r, we can simplify this to the following equation: the perimeter of any square inscribed in a circle with radius r is defined as P = 5.657r!, Consider a square inscribed in a circle with radius 10. That means that the diagonal of this square = 2(10), or 20. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that 2(a2) = 202, so 2a2 = 400. Now divide both sides in half to find that a2 = 200. Then take the square root of each side to find that a = 14.142. Multiply this by 4, and you will find the perimeter of your square: P = 56.57.


Notice that you could have found the same thing by simply multiplying the radius, 10, by 5.657. 10 * 5.567 = 56.57, but that might be hard to remember on a test, so it's better to memorize the process we used to get there.

Write down the circumference formula.,
Solve for r. Use algebra to change the circumference formula until r (radius) is alone on one side of the equation:


C=2πr{\displaystyle C=2\pi r}C2π=2πr2π{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{2\pi }}={\frac {2\pi r}{2\pi }}}C2π=r{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{2\pi }}=r}r=C2π{\displaystyle r={\frac {C}{2\pi }}}


,
Plug the circumference into the formula.,
Round to a decimal answer.",How to Calculate the Radius of a Circle1," The formula is C=2πr{\displaystyle C=2\pi r}, where C{\displaystyle C} equals the circle’s circumference, and r{\displaystyle r} equals its radius.The symbol pi{\displaystyle pi} (""pi"") is a special number, roughly equal to 3.14. You can either use that estimate (3.14) in calculations, or use the pi{\displaystyle pi} symbol on a calculator.
;
,, Whenever a math problem tells you the circumference C of a circle, you can use this equation to find the radius r. Replace C in the equation with the circumference of the circle in your problem:

For example, if the circumference is 15 centimeters, your formula will look like this: r=152π{\displaystyle r={\frac {15}{2\pi }}} centimeters.


, Enter your result in a calculator with the π{\displaystyle \pi } button and round the result. If you don't have a calculator, calculate it by hand, using 3.14 as a close estimate for π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example, r=152π={\displaystyle r={\frac {15}{2\pi }}=} about 7.52∗3.14={\displaystyle {\frac {7.5}{2*3.14}}=} approximately 2.39 centimeters.

Place yourself at a good vantage point.,
Estimate the horizontal length of the object.,
Hold your right arm out in front of you.,
Close your right eye.,
Align the left edge of your right thumb with the right edge of the object.,
Switch eyes.,
Estimate how far the left edge of your thumb jumped.,
Multiply that number (the jump) by 10.",How to Estimate Distances (by Using Your Thumb and Eyes)," To estimate distance, you need a clear line of sight. Try to stand in a high place, like atop a hill or a few floors up in a building. If this isn’t possible, try to find a spot where no other objects are in between you and the object you are focusing on.;
, Here are some standard lengths that may help you:


Most average-sized cars are between 12 and 15 feet long.
Mailboxes are usually around 1.5 feet long.
Mature tree trunks are typically between 1 and 2 feet wide.
The standard length of a trailer pulled by a semi-truck is 50 to 65 feet long.

, Aim your arm toward the object, and try to keep it as straight as possible. Point your thumb up.

, Keep standing as still as possible.

, Try to keep your head and arm perfectly still., Keeping perfectly still, close your left eye and look through the right eye. Your thumb will appear to have “jumped” to the left. This “jumping” phenomenon is called “parallax.”, Did your thumb jump 3 times the length of the object? Half the length? Keep this number in mind. For example:


If your thumb jumped 3 times the length of a building that you believe is 100-feet-long, then it jumped 300 feet.
If your thumb jumped half the length of a 14-foot-long car, then it jumped 7 feet.

, This will give you the approximate distance you're looking for. For example:


If your thumb jumped 3 times the length of a 100-foot building, or about 300 feet (91 m), then you would multiply 300 by 10 to conclude that the building is about 3,000 feet (914 m) away from you.
If your thumb moved half the length of a 14-foot-long car, or about 7 feet (2 m), then you would multiply 7 by 10 to conclude that the car is about 70 feet (21 m) away from you. "

Draw a line parallel to side BC of the triangle that passes through the vertex A. Label the line PQ.,
Write the equation angle PAB + angle BAC + angle CAQ = 180 degrees.,
State that angle PAB = angle ABC and angle CAQ = angle ACB.,
Substitute angle PAB and angle CAQ in Equation 1 for angle ABC and angle ACB (as found in Equation 2 and Equation 3) respectively.,
Define the angle sum property.,
Study examples.,
Use the theorem to solve for an unknown angle.",How to Prove the Angle Sum Property of a Triangle," Construct this line parallel to the bottom of the triangle., Remember, all of the angles that comprise a straight line must be equal to 180°. Because angle PAB, angle BAC, and angle CAQ combine together to make line PQ, their angles must sum to 180°. Call this Equation 1., Because you constructed line PQ parallel to side BC of the triangle, the alternate interior angles (PAB and ABC) made by the transversal line (line AB) are congruent. Similarly, the alternate interior angles (CAQ and ACB) made by the transversal line AC are also congruent.Equation 2: angle PAB = angle ABC
Equation 3: angle CAQ = angle ACB
It is a geometric theorem that alternate interior angles of parallel lines are congruent., Knowing that the alternate interior angles are equal lets you substitute the angles of the triangle for the angles of the line.Thus we get, Angle ABC + angle BAC + angle ACB = 180°.
In other words, in the triangle ABC, angle B + angle A + angle C = 180°. Thus, the sum of all the angles of a triangle is 180°.

, The angle sum property of a triangle states that the angles of a triangle always add up to 180°.Every triangle has three angles and whether it is an acute, obtuse, or right triangle, the angles sum to 180°.


For example, in triangle ABC, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°.
This theorem is useful for finding the measure of an unknown angle when you know the other two.

, To really grasp this concept, it can be helpful to study some examples. Look at a right triangle, where one of the angles is 90° and the other angles each measure 45°. Summing 90° + 45° + 45° = 180°. Study other triangles of various shapes and sizes and sum their angles. You will see that they always add up to 180°.For the right triangle example: angle A = 90°, angle B = 45°, and angle C = 45°. The theorem states that angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°. Adding the angles gives you 90° + 45° + 45° = 180°. Therefore, left hand side (L.H.S.) equals right hand side (R.H.S.).

, Using simple algebra, you can use the angle sum theorem to solve for an unknown angle if you know the other two angles of the triangle. Rearrange the basic equation to solve for the unknown angle.


For example, in triangle ABC, angle A = 67° and angle B = 43°, but angle C is unknown.
angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°
67° + 43° + angle C = 180°
angle C = 180° - 67° - 43°
angle C = 70°

Define the formula for slope.,
Identify the X and Y coordinates of two points on each line.,
Plug the points for each line into the slope formula.,
Compare the slopes of each line.",How to Figure out if Two Lines Are Parallel1," The slope of a line is defined by (Y2 - Y1)/(X2 - X1) where X and Y are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of points on the line. You must define two points on the line to calculate this formula. The point closer to the bottom of the line is (X1, Y1) and the point higher on the line, above the first point, is (X2, Y2).This formula can be restated as the rise over the run. It is the change in vertical difference over the change in horizontal difference, or the steepness of the line.
If a line points upwards to the right, it will have a positive slope.
If the line is downwards to the right, it will have a negative slope.;
, A point on a line is given by the coordinate (X, Y) where X is the location on the horizontal axis and Y is the location on the vertical axis. To calculate the slope, you need to identify two points on each of the lines in question.Points are easily determined when you have a line drawn on graphing paper.
To define a point, draw a dashed line up from the horizontal axis until it intersects the line. The position that you started the line on the horizontal axis is the X coordinate, while the Y coordinate is where the dashed line intersects the line on the vertical axis.
For example: line l has the points (1, 5) and (-2, 4) while line r has the points (3, 3) and (1, -4).

, To actually calculate the slope, simply plug in the numbers, subtract, and then divide. Take care to plug in the coordinates to the proper X and Y value in the formula.


To calculate the slope of line l: slope = (5 – (-4))/(1 – (-2))
Subtract: slope = 9/3
Divide: slope = 3
The slope of line r is: slope = (3 – (-4))/(3 - 1) = 7/2

, Remember, two lines are parallel only if they have identical slopes. Lines may look parallel on paper and may even be very close to parallel, but if their slopes are not exactly the same, they aren’t parallel.In this example, 3 is not equal to 7/2, therefore, these two lines are not parallel.

Set up the formula for the area of a circle.,
Solve for the radius.,
Plug the area into the formula.,
Divide the area by π{\displaystyle \pi }.,
Take the square root.",How to Calculate the Radius of a Circle2," The formula is A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the circle, and r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius., Use algebra to get the radius r alone on one side of the equation:

Divide both sides by π{\displaystyle \pi }:A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}Aπ=r2{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\pi }}=r^{2}}

Take the square root of both sides:Aπ=r{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {A}{\pi }}}=r}r=Aπ{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {\frac {A}{\pi }}}}


, Use this formula to find the radius when the problem tells you the area of the circle. Substitute the area of the circle for the variable A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if the area of the circle is 21 square centimeters, the formula will look like this: r=21π{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {\frac {21}{\pi }}}}.


, Begin solving the problem by simplifying the portion under the square root (Aπ){\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\pi }})}. Use a calculator with a π{\displaystyle \pi } key if possible. If you don't have a calculator, use 3.14 as an estimate for π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example, if using 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }, you would calculate:r=213.14{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {\frac {21}{3.14}}}}r=6.69{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {6.69}}}

If your calculator allows you to enter the whole formula on one line, that will give you a more accurate answer.


, You will likely need a calculator to do this, because the number will be a decimal. This value will give you the radius of the circle.

For example, r=6.69=2.59{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {6.69}}=2.59}. So, the radius of a circle with an area of 21 square centimeters is about 2.59 centimeters.

Areas always use square units (like square centimeters), but the radius always uses units of length (like centimeters). If you keep track of units in this problem, you'll notice that cm2=cm{\displaystyle {\sqrt {cm^{2}}}=cm}.

Check the problem for a diameter.,
Divide the diameter by two.",How to Calculate the Radius of a Circle3," If the problem tells you the diameter of the circle, it's easy to find the radius. If you are working with an actual circle, measure the diameter by placing a ruler so its edge passes straight through the circle's center, touching the circle on both sides.If you're not sure where the circle center is, put the ruler down across your best guess. Hold the zero mark of the ruler steady against the circle, and slowly move the other end back and forth around the circle's edge. The highest measurement you can find is the diameter.

For example, you might have a circle with a diameter of 4 centimeters.


, A circle's radius is always half the length of its diameter.For example, if the diameter is 4 cm, the radius equals 4 cm ÷ 2 = 2 cm.

In math formulas, the radius is r and the diameter is d. You might see this step in your textbook as r=d2{\displaystyle r={\frac {d}{2}}}.

Set up the formula for the area of a sector.,
Plug the sector’s area and central angle into the formula.,
Divide the central angle by 360.,
Isolate (π)(r2){\displaystyle (\pi )(r^{2})}.,
Divide both sides of the equation by π{\displaystyle \pi }.,
Take the square root of both sides.",How to Calculate the Radius of a Circle4," The formula is Asector=θ360(π)(r2){\displaystyle A_{sector}={\frac {\theta }{360}}(\pi )(r^{2})}, where Asector{\displaystyle A_{sector}} equals the area of the sector, θ{\displaystyle \theta } equals the central angle of the sector in degrees, and r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius of the circle., This information should be given to you. Make sure you have the area of the sector, not the area for the circle. Substitute the area for the variable Asector{\displaystyle A_{sector}} and the angle for the variable θ{\displaystyle \theta }.

For example, if the area of the sector is 50 square centimeters, and the central angle is 120 degrees, you would set up the formula like this: 50=120360(π)(r2){\displaystyle 50={\frac {120}{360}}(\pi )(r^{2})}.


, This will tell you what fraction of the entire circle the sector represents.

For example, 120360=13{\displaystyle {\frac {120}{360}}={\frac {1}{3}}}. This means that the sector is 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}} of the circle. Your equation should now look like this: 50=13(π)(r2){\displaystyle 50={\frac {1}{3}}(\pi )(r^{2})}


, To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the fraction or decimal you just calculated.

For example:50=13(π)(r2){\displaystyle 50={\frac {1}{3}}(\pi )(r^{2})}5013=13(π)(r2)13{\displaystyle {\frac {50}{\frac {1}{3}}}={\frac {{\frac {1}{3}}(\pi )(r^{2})}{\frac {1}{3}}}}150=(π)(r2){\displaystyle 150=(\pi )(r^{2})}


, This will isolate the r{\displaystyle r} variable. For a more precise result, use a calculator. You can also round π{\displaystyle \pi } to 3.14.

For example:150=(π)(r2){\displaystyle 150=(\pi )(r^{2})}150π=(π)(r2)π{\displaystyle {\frac {150}{\pi }}={\frac {(\pi )(r^{2})}{\pi }}}47.7=r2{\displaystyle 47.7=r^{2}}


, This will give you the radius of the circle.

For example:47.7=r2{\displaystyle 47.7=r^{2}}47.7=r2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {47.7}}={\sqrt {r^{2}}}}6.91=r{\displaystyle 6.91=r}So, the radius of the circle is about 6.91 centimeters.

Know the equation of a circle.,
Find the center of your circle.,
Find the radius of the circle.,
Plot the radius points on the coordinate plane.,
Connect the dots.",How to Graph a Circle," The center is the point inside the circle that is at an equal distance from all of the points on the line.






;
, The radius is the common and constant distance from all points on the line to the center of the circle. In other words, it is any line segment that joins the center of the circle with any point on the curved line.








, The diameter is the length of a line segment that connects two points on a circle and passes through the center of the circle. In other words, it represents the fullest distance across the circle.









The diameter will always be twice the radius. If you know the radius, you can multiply by 2 to get the diameter; if you know the diameter; you can divide by 2 to get the radius.
Remember that a line that connects two points on the circle (also known as a chord) but does not pass through the center will not give you the diameter; it will have a shorter distance.

, Circles are defined primarily by their centers, so in mathematics, a circle’s symbol is a circle with a dot in the center. To denote a circle at a particular location on a graph, simply put the location of the center after the symbol.









A circle located at point 0 would look like this: ⊙O.

, The standard form for the equation of a circle is (x – a)2 + (y – b)2 = r2. The symbols a and b represent the center of the circle as a point on an axis, with a as the horizontal displacement and b as the vertical displacement. The symbol r represents the radius.









As an example, take the equation x2 + y2 = 16.

, Remember that the center of the circle is shown as a and b in the circle equation. If there are no brackets – as in our example – that means that a = 0 and b = 0.









In the example, note that you can write (x – 0)2 + (y – 0)2 = 16. You can see that a = 0 and b = 0, and the center of your circle is therefore at the origin, at point (0, 0).

, Recall that the r represents the radius. Be careful: if the r part of your equation does not include a square, you will have to figure out your radius.









So, in our example, you have a 16 for r, but there is no square. To get the radius, write r2 = 16; you can then solve to see that the radius is 4. Now you can write the equation as x2 + y2 =42.

, For whatever number you have for the radius, count that number is all four directions from the center: left, right, up, and down.









In the example, you would count 4 in all directions to plot the radius points, since our radius is 4.

, To graph the circle, connect the points using a round curve.

Define the slope-intercept formula of a line.,
Rewrite the formula of the line in slope-intercept form.,
Compare the slopes of each line.",How to Figure out if Two Lines Are Parallel2," The formula of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope, b is the y-intercept, and x and y are variables that represent coordinates on the line; generally, you will see them remain as x and y in the equation. In this form, you can easily determine the slope of the line as the variable ""m"".For example. Rewrite 4y - 12x = 20 and y = 3x -1. The equation 4y - 12x = 20 needs to be rewritten with algebra while y = 3x -1 is already in slope-intercept form and does not need to be rearranged.

, Oftentimes, the formula of the line you are given will not be in slope-intercept form. It only takes a little math and rearranging of variables to get it into slope-intercept.


For example: Rewrite line 4y-12x=20 into slope-intercept form.
Add 12x to both sides of the equation: 4y – 12x + 12x = 20 + 12x
Divide each side by 4 to get y on its own: 4y/4 = 12x/4 +20/4
Slope-intercept form: y = 3x + 5.

, Remember, when two lines are parallel to each other, they will have the exact same slope. Using the equation y = mx + b where m is the slope of the line, you can identify and compare the slopes of two lines.


In our example, the first line has an equation of y = 3x + 5, therefore it’s slope is 3. The other line has an equation of y = 3x – 1 which also has a slope of 3. Since the slopes are identical, these two lines are parallel.
Note that if these equations had the same y-intercept, they would be the same line instead of parallel."

Define the point-slope equation.,
Determine the slope of the first line.,
Identify a point on the new line.,
Write the equation of the new line with the point-slope form.,
Simplify the equation.",How to Figure out if Two Lines Are Parallel3," Point-slope form allows you to write the equation of a line when you know its slope and have an (x, y) coordinate. You would use this formula when you want to define a second parallel line to an already given line with a defined slope. The formula is y – y1= m(x – x1) where m is the slope of the line, x1 is the x coordinate of a point given on the line and y1 is the y coordinate of that point. As in the slope-intercept equation, x and y are variables that represent coordinates on the line; generally, you will see them remain as x and y in the equation.The following steps will work through this example: Write the equation of a line parallel to the line y = -4x + 3 that goes through point (1, -2).

, When writing the equation of a new line, you must first identify the slope of the line you want to draw yours parallel to. Make sure the equation of the original line is in slope-intercept form and then you know the slope (m).


The line we want to draw parallel to is y = -4x + 3. In this equation, -4 represents the variable m and therefore, is the slope of the line.

, This equation only works if you have a coordinate that passes through the new line. Make sure you don’t choose a coordinate that is on the original line. If your final equations have the same y-intercept, they are not parallel, but the same line.


In our example, we will use the coordinate (1, -2).

, Remember the formula is y – y1= m(x – x1). Plug in the slope and coordinates of your point to write the equation of your new line that is parallel to the first.


Using our example with slope (m) -4 and (x, y) coordinate (1, -2): y – (-2) = -4(x – 1)

, After you have plugged in the numbers, the equation can be simplified into the more common slope-intercept form. This equation's line, if graphed on a coordinate plane, would be parallel to the given equation.


For example: y – (-2) = -4(x – 1)
Two negatives make a positive: y + 2 = -4(x -1)

Distribute the -4 to x and -1: y + 2 = -4x + 4.
Subtract -2 from both side: y + 2 – 2 = -4x + 4 – 2
Simplified equation: y = -4x + 2

Add up the two known angle measurements.,
Subtract this number from 180°.,
Write down your answer.",How to Find the Third Angle of a Triangle1," All you have to know is that all of the angles in a triangle always add up to 180°. This is true 100% of the time. So, if you know two of the three measurements of the triangle, then you're only missing one piece of the puzzle. The first thing you can do is add up the angle measurements you know. In this example, the two angle measurements you know are 80° and 65°. Add them up (80° + 65°) to get 145°.;
, The angles in a triangle add up to 180°. Therefore, the remaining angle must make the sum up the angles up to 180°. In this example, 180° - 145° = 35°.

, You now know that the third angle measures 35°. If you're doubting yourself, just check your work. The three angles should add up to 180° for the triangle to exist. 80° + 65° + 35° = 180°. You're all done.

Print a blank flexagon template.,
Decorate the template according to the numbered patterns.,
Try different shape variations.",How to Make a Flexagon," Search online for “flexagon”, “hexaflexagon”, or “tri-hexaflexagon” templates. Any of these searches should yield many patterned templates to choose from. Pick the patterns that you like the best and then print out the template.You can also print a blank template and color it the way you would like.

, Using scissors, carefully cut along the outside lines of the pattern. Try to cut as straight as possible and directly on the lines. Precision in the cuts is important to make the correct folds.Adult supervision is recommended while using the scissors.

, Once the template has been cut out, you will make a series of specific folds to complete the flexagon. The first fold is along the centerline of the template. Score the centerline with an empty ballpoint pen by aligning a ruler on the line and running the pen along it. Scoring makes it easier to fold.Fold the template so that the pattern is facing up.
Once the fold has been made, run the ruler along the fold to make the edge sharp.
Glue along the shorter half of the template with a glue stick to stick it down to the longer half.

, When the two sides have been glued together, score the edge of each triangle. Fold back and forth along each edge of solid black lines.Having the edges pre-folded will make the rest of the assembly easier.

, At this point, you should have the smaller side facing upright. You should see two white triangles at either end with eight patterned triangles in between. Count four triangles from the right side of the paper and fold along the far edge of the fourth triangle (this is actually the third patterned triangle because there is a blank triangle on the end).Make the fold downward so that the crease of the fold points upward.

, Flip the entire paper over and count four triangles from the left side of the template. Fold the paper up so that it begins to resemble a hexagon. If you have done the fold correctly so far, you should see only one pattern making the hexagon with one extra triangle flap sticking out.If you have misfolded at a step, simply unfold what you have done and begin again.

, Take the blank flap that sticks out and fold it over the other blank triangle. You should now see a hexagon with six identical faces. Glue the flap in place.If you flip the flexagon over you should see another pattern with six identical faces on it.
The third pattern is hidden on the back sides of the two visible patterns. When you “flex” the flexagon, you will see the third pattern.

, Manipulating the flexagon takes a little bit of practice, but is made much easier if you fold and unfold the creases a few times. Make folds along all three diagonals of the hexagon and fold them back and forth a few times.You don’t absolutely have to do this step, but it makes it much easier to play with the flexagon if you do.

, Fold two triangles together so that the fold goes toward the inside of the flexagon. The other two sides should flatten against each other.The more you play with the flexagon, the easier it will be to manipulate.

, With the two triangles pinched towards the center, the flexagon should almost fall open into a new pattern. Grab the top corners in the center of the flexagon and pull them open, revealing the new pattern.Practice flipping the flexagon and see if you can see all three patterns.

, Make sure the template is numbered to indicate which triangles will make up the same pattern. The template will have a series of triangles that are numbered according to the side with which they correspond.A tri-hexaflexagon will have triangles numbered 1, 2, and 3.
A hexa-hexaflexgon will have triangles numbered 1-6 because there are six different patterns that will form.

, You can decorate the template however you would like. Make sure you color each triangle with the same number in the same way. You can also print a patterned picture and cut it into triangles then glue them on the template.For example: All triangles numbered 1 get colored red, all triangles numbered 2 get colored green, and all triangles numbered 3 get colored blue.

, There are many different types of flexagons that can be made. You can make flexagons with different numbers of sides and patterns. Describing all of the possible shapes is beyond the scope of this article, but you can make any shape a flexagon by printing out a template and folding it correctly.Pentaflexagons, kite hexaflexagons, square tetraflexagons, and heptaflexagons are all fun shapes to make and play with.

Start with two possible statements.,
Write down what you know is true.,
Assume one of the statements is true.,
Draw logical conclusions and look for contradictions.,
Conclude that your assumption was incorrect.,
Infer that the other statement must be correct.",How to Write an Indirect Proof1," Indirect proofs work if you can describe the situation in two possible ways. Since there are only two options, once you prove one statement wrong, you will know the other one is correct. These are usually just two opposites: ""A is true"" and ""A is not true.""

'Example:' Think of a suspect in a police investigation. There are two possible explanations: the suspect is innocent; or the suspect is guilty. If we can rule out the idea that he's guilty, we automatically know he is innocent.;
, These statements are often called ""axioms"" or ""givens"" (as in, the information given to you). You don't have to write down every fact you know, but it may help to write down related, proven statements. These can help you draw logical conclusions.

Example: ""The person who committed the crime was at the crime scene."" and ""A person cannot be in two places at once."" are two examples of real-life ""givens."" These should be so obvious you can include them in your proof without needing evidence.

, Pick the one you think you can disprove most easily. Start with the idea ""what if this statement is actually true?"" This is called a postulate. The goal of the indirect proof is to show where this postulate leads.

Example: Assume the suspect is guilty. It might not be true, but that's what this proof will tell us.

, Why is it useful to assume something that might not be true? The goal is not to find out the truth, but to look for contradictions. If your assumption leads to two contradictory statements, or if it contradicts one of your ""givens,"" it means your assumption must be wrong.

Example: If the suspect is guilty, as you've assumed, he must have been present while the crime was committed.
Witnesses saw the suspect in a different city on the day of the crime.
These two facts contradict each other.
If you fail to find any contradictions, it does not mean your assumption was correct, only that it is possible.

, If you found a contradiction, and there are no faults with your logic, your initial assumption must have been wrong.

Example: The suspect could not have committed the crime and been in a different city at the same time. Therefore, the assumption that the suspect was guilty must be incorrect.

, Now you know one statement is incorrect. Since there is only one other possible statement, that one must be right. You have now proved this statement indirectly.

Example: Since the suspect cannot be guilty, he must be innocent.
Notice that you do not need to spend any time investigating the other statement.

Draw a ""radius"" on the circle.,

Understand π (""pi"").,
Write down the definition of π as an algebra problem.,
Change this problem so you are solving for C, circumference.,
Plug in the numbers to solve for C. Now we know that 2πr = C. Look back at the original math problem to see what r (the radius) equals.",How to Work out the Circumference of a Circle1," Draw a line from the center of the circle to anywhere on the circle's edge. This line is the ""radius"" of the circle, often written as just r in math equations and formulas.



Note: if your math problem doesn't tell you the length of the radius, you might be looking at the wrong section. Check whether the sections for Diameter or Area make more sense for your problem.;
, Extend the line you just drew so it reaches the circle edge on the other side. You've just drawn a second radius. The two radii stuck together have a length of ""2 x the radius,"" written as 2r. The length of this line is the ""diameter"" of the circle, often written d.

, The π symbol, also written as pi. It isn't a magical number that just happens to work in this kind of math problem. Actually, the number π was originally ""discovered"" by measuring circles: if you measure the circumference of any circle (for instance with a tape measure), and then divide by the diameter, you'll always end up with the same number. This number is unusual because it can't be written out as a simple fraction or decimal. Instead, we can round to a ""close enough"" number like 3.14.


Even the π button on a calculator doesn't use the exact value of π, although it is close enough.

, As explained above, π just means ""the number you get when you divide the circumference by the diameter."" In the form of a math formula: π = C / d. Since we know the diameter equals 2 x the radius, we can also write this as π = C / 2r.


C is just a shorter way of writing ""circumference.""

, We want to find out what the circumference is, which is C in this math problem. If you multiply both sides by 2r you get π x 2r = (C / 2r) x 2r, which is the same as 2πr = C


You might have written the left side as π2r, which is also correct. People like to move the numbers in front of the symbols just so the equation is easier to read, and this doesn't change the result of the equation.
In a math equation, you can always multiple the left side and the right side by the same amount and still end up with a correct equation.

, Then replace π with 3.14, or use a calculator's π button to get a more accurate answer. Multiply 2πr together using these numbers. The answer you get is the circumference.


For example, if the radius is 2 units long, then 2πr = 2 x (3.14) x (2 units) = 12.56 units = the circumference.
In the same example, but using a calculator's π button for better accuracy, you'll get 2 x π x 2 units = 12.56637... units but unless instructed otherwise by your teacher, you can round the number to 12.57 units.

Approximate the measure of your angle.,
Place the origin over the center point, or vertex, of the angle you want to measure.,
Rotate the protractor to align one leg of the angle with the baseline.,
Follow the opposite leg of the angle up to the measurements on the protractor's arc.",How to Use a Protractor1," Angles can be classified in three ways: acute, obtuse, and right. Acute angles are narrow (less than 90 degrees), obtuse angles are wide (greater than 90 degrees), and right angles are exactly 90 degrees (two lines perpendicular to each other).You can easily identify by eye, the category of angle you are trying to measure. Doing this step first helps you identify which scale to use on the protractor.


At a glance, we can tell this angle is acute because it is less than 90 degrees.;
, The small hole in the middle of the base of the protractor is the origin. Align the vertex of the angle with the center of the cross in the origin.








, Maintain the vertex of the angle in the origin and gently rotate the protractor so that one of the legs of the angle falls on the baseline of the protractor.








The baseline is parallel to the edge, but is not the flat edge of the protractor. It is aligned with the center of the origin and the line projects to the start of the scale on either side.

, If the line does not pass through the protractor’s arc, extend the angle's line until it does. Alternatively, you can align the edge of a piece of paper with the angle’s leg to pass beyond the edge of the protractor, continuing the line of the angle. The number the line passes through is the angle's measurement in degrees.









In the above example, the angle measure is 30 degrees. We know to use the smaller scale because we determined that our angle was less than 90 degrees in the first step. If the angle was obtuse, we would use the scale that indicated an angle larger than 90 degrees.
Initially, the measurement scale may seem confusing. Most protractors have two opposing ruler grids, one on the inner side of the arc and one on the outer. This makes the tool handy for measuring angles originating from either direction.

Write down the problem.,
Add up all of the measurements.,
Subtract the measurements from 180°.,
Solve for x.,
Check your work.",How to Find the Third Angle of a Triangle2," Sometimes, instead being lucky enough to know the measurements of two of the angles of a triangle, you'll only be given a few variables, or some variables and an angle measurement. Let's say you're working with this problem: Find the measurements of angle ""x"" of the triangle whose measurements are ""x,"" ""2x,"" and 24. First, just write it down.

, It's the same principle that you would follow if you did know the measurements of the two angles. Simply add up the measurements of the angles, combining the variables. So, x + 2x + 24° = 3x + 24°.

, Now, subtract these measurements from 180° to get closer to solving the problem. Make sure you set the equation equal to 0. Here's what it would look like:


180° - (3x + 24°) = 0
180° - 3x - 24° = 0
156° - 3x = 0

, Now, just put the variables on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. You'll get 156° = 3x. Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get x = 52°. This means that the measurement of the third angle of the triangle is 52°. The other angle, 2x, is 2 x 52°, or 104°.

, If you want to make sure that this is a valid triangle, just add up the three angle measurements to make sure that they add up to 180°. That's 52° + 104° + 24° = 180°. You're all done.

Find the third angle of an isosceles triangle.,
Find the third angle of an equilateral triangle.,
Find the third angle of a right triangle.",How to Find the Third Angle of a Triangle3," Isosceles triangles have two equal sides and two equal angles. The equal sides are marked by one hash mark on each of them, indicating that the angles across from each side are equal. If you know the angle measurement of one equal angle of an isosceles triangle, then you'll know the measurement of the other equal angle. Here's how to find it:


If one of the equal angles is 40°, then you'll know that the other angle is also 40°. You can find the third side, if needed, by subtracting 40° + 40° (which is 80°) from 180°. 180° - 80° = 100°, which is the measurement of the remaining angle.

, An equilateral triangle has all equal sides and all equal angles. It will typically be marked by two hash marks in the middle of each of its sides. This means that the angle measurement of any angle in an equilateral triangle is 60°. Check your work. 60° + 60° + 60° = 180°.

, Let's say you know you have a right triangle, with one of the other angles being 30°. If it's a right triangle, then you know that one of the angles measures exactly 90°. The same principles apply. All you have to do is add up the measurements of the sides you know (30° + 90° = 120°) and subtract that number from 180°. So, 180° - 120° = 60°. The measurement of that third angle is 60°.

Draw conclusions.",How to Write an Indirect Proof2," Here's a more mathematical example. The two statements are ""A triangle can have more than one right angle"" and ""A triangle cannot have more than one right angle."" Only one of these statements can be correct., In this case, the information needed for this proof is ""the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees."" This is usually proven earlier in the math textbook, or provided as a truthful statement., This is the statement that seems easiest to disprove, so this is where to start. Imagine a triangle with two right angles (angles a and b), and one unknown angle (angle c)., Each right angle is 90 degrees. Angles a and b are both right angles, so a + b = 90 + 90 = 180 degrees., Our given information states that all three angles add up to 180 degrees. This means angles a + b + c = 180 degrees. Solve for c:

'a + b + c = 180

We already found that a + b = 180, therefore 180 + c = 180.

c = 180 - 180 = 0.

, The solution that angle c is 0 degrees is impossible, since a triangle with a zero degree angle is impossible., Since you found a contradiction, the assumption ""a triangle can have more than one right angle"" must be false. Therefore, by indirect proof, the other statement must be correct. A triangle cannot have more than one right angle."

Look back at the original word problem to see what the diameter equals, and replace the d in this equation with that number.",How to Work out the Circumference of a Circle2," Put your pencil down on the circle's edge. Draw a line through the center of circle and hitting the edge on the other side. This line is the ""diameter"" of the circle, often written d in math problems.


The line goes through the exact center of the circle, not just anywhere within the circle.

Note: If the word problem doesn't tell you how long the diameter is, use a different method instead.

, The ""radius"" of the circle, also written as r, is the distance halfway across the circle. Since the diameter extends all the way across the circle, the diameter is equal to two radii. A simple way to write this is d = 2r. This means you can always replace a d with a 2r in a math problem, or the other way around.


We'll be using d, not 2r, since your math problem tells you what d equals. However, it's important to understand this step, so you aren't confused if your teacher or math book uses 2r where you would expect a d.

, The π symbol, also written as pi, isn't a magical number that just happens to work in this kind of math problem. Actually, the number π was originally ""discovered"" by measuring circles: if you measure the circumference of any circle (for instance with a tape measure), and then divide by the diameter, you'll always end up with the same number. This number is unusual because it can't be written out as a simple fraction or decimal. Instead, we can round to a ""close enough"" number like 3.14.


Even the π button on a calculator doesn't use the exact value of π, although it is extremely close.

, As explained above, π just means ""the number you get when you divide the circumference by the diameter."" In the form of a math equation: π = circumference / diameter or π = C / d.

, We want to find out what the circumference is, so we need to get C alone on one side. Do this by multiplying each side of the equation by d:


π x d = (C / d) x d
πd = C

, Replace π with an estimate such as 3.14, or use the π button on your calculator for a more accurate result. Multiple the values for π and d together, and you get C, the circumference.


For example, if the diameter was 6 units long, you'll get (3.14) x (6 units) = 18.84 units.
In the same example, but using a calculator's π button for more accuracy, you'll get π x 6 units = 18.84956... but unless instructed otherwise, you can round the number to 18.85 units.

Change the circumference formula using what you found.,
Plug in the numbers to find the circumference.",How to Work out the Circumference of a Circle3," Most of the time, people don't measure the area (A) of a circle directly. Instead, they measure the radius (r) of the circle, then calculate the area using the formula A = πr2. The reason why this formula makes sense is a little tricky, but you can find out more here if you are interested and willing to tackle some tougher algebra.



Note: If the math problem does not tell you the area of the circle, you may need to use a different method on this page.

, The circumference (C) is the distance around the circle. Typically, you find it with the formula C=2πr, but because we don't yet know what the radius (r) is, we'll have to spend some time figuring out the value of r before we can solve it.

, Since A = πr2, we can rearrange this formula to solve for r instead. If the steps below are difficult for you to follow, you might want to start on some easier algebra problems or try some techniques for understanding algebra.


A = πr2

A / π = πr2 / π = r2

√(A/π) = √(r2) = r
r = √(A/π)

, Any time you have an equation, such as r = √(A/π), you can replace one side of the equation with the other. Let's use this technique to alter the circumference formula above, C=2πr. For this problem, we don't know the value of r, but we do know the value of A. Let's change it like this to make the problem solvable:


C = 2πr
C = 2π(√(A/π))

, Use the area given by the problem to solve for the circumference. For instance, if the area (A) of a circle is 15 square units, enter 2π(√(15/π)) into your calculator. Remember to include the parentheses.


The answer for this example is 13.72937... but unless instructed otherwise you can round to 13.73.

Use this method to measure real circular objects.,
Find a piece of string and a ruler.,
Wrap the string around the circle once.,
Mark or cut the string.,
Unravel the string and measure it with a ruler.",How to Work out the Circumference of a Circle4," You can measure the circumference of circles you find in the real world, not just in word problems. Try it out on a bicycle wheel, a pizza, or a coin.

, The string must be long enough to wrap around the circle once, and flexible enough that it can wrap tightly. You'll need something to measure the string with later, such as a ruler or tape measure. The string will be easier to measure if the ruler is longer than the piece of string.

, Start by placing one end of the string against the edge of the circle. Loop the string around the circle and pull it tight. If you are measuring a coin or other thin object, you might not be able to pull the string tight around it. Lay the circular object flat instead and arrange the string around it, as close to it as you can get.


Be careful not to wrap more than once. You should end up with a single loop of string, so there is no part of the circle with two lengths of string next to it.

, Find the place on the string that completes the loop, touching the end of the string that you started with. Mark this place with a permanent marker, or use a pair of scissors to cut it at this points

, Take the loop of string and measure it on a ruler. If you used a marker, only measure from the end of the string to the colored mark. This is the part of the string that was wrapped around the circle, and since a circle's circumference is just the distance around the circle, you've found the answer! The length of this string is the same as the circumference of the circle.

It will be used to determine the position at which you draw the second leg of the angle. It's generally easiest to draw the straight line in a horizontal position on the paper.


You can use the flat edge of your protractor to draw this line.
The length of the line doesn’t matter.

, This point will be your angle's vertex. Mark the paper where the vertex is placed.You don’t have to place the point at the edge of the line. It can be placed anywhere on the line, but is easier just to use the end of the line.

, Align your reference line with the protractor's baseline and mark the paper at the degree of measurement. If you are drawing an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), use the scale with the smaller numbers. For obtuse angles (greater than 90 degrees), use the scale with larger numbers.









Remember, the baseline is parallel to the edge, but is not the flat edge of the protractor. It is aligned with the center of the origin and the line projects to the start of the scale on either side.
In the above example, the angle is 40 degrees.

, Using a ruler, the flat edge of your protractor or another straight edge, connect the vertex with the marked degree, drawing the second leg. This second leg completes your angle. To verify you’ve drawn the angle accurately, use the protractor to measure it.

Usually the right angle is denoted by a small box.
;
, The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle, and will be opposite the right angle., The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the lengths of the other sides of the triangle., Remember, these are represented by the variables a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the triangle has side lengths of 3 and 4 cm, your formula will look like this: 32+42=c2{\displaystyle 3^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}.


, Plug these new values into the formula.

For example:32+42=c2{\displaystyle 3^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}9+16=c2{\displaystyle 9+16=c^{2}}


, This sum is equal to the length of the hypotenuse squared (c2{\displaystyle c^{2}}).

For example:9+16=c2{\displaystyle 9+16=c^{2}}25=c2{\displaystyle 25=c^{2}}


, This will give you the length of your hypotenuse.

For example:25=c2{\displaystyle 25=c^{2}}25=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}5=c{\displaystyle 5=c} So, the length of a hypotenuse of a triangle with side lengths of 3 and 4 cm is 5 cm.


, If you know the hypotenuse and one side of the triangle, you can still use the theorem by substituting for the appropriate values.

For example, if you know a right triangle has a hypotenuse measuring 5 cm in length, and one side measuring 3 cm in length, your formula will look like this: a2+32=52{\displaystyle a^{2}+3^{2}=5^{2}}. You would then solve the equation for a{\displaystyle a} instead of c{\displaystyle c}:a2+32=52{\displaystyle a^{2}+3^{2}=5^{2}}a2+9=25{\displaystyle a^{2}+9=25}a2=16{\displaystyle a^{2}=16}a2=16{\displaystyle {\sqrt {a^{2}}}={\sqrt {16}}}a=4{\displaystyle a=4}

Think about the parts of the proof logically and determine step-by-step how to get from the givens to the final conclusion.For example: Using the following givens, prove that triangle ABC and CDE are congruent: C is the midpoint of AE, BE is congruent to DA. If C is the midpoint of AE, then AC must be congruent to CE because of the definition of a midpoint. This allows you prove that at least one of the sides of both of the triangles are congruent.
If BE is congruent to DA then BC is congruent to CD because C is also the midpoint of AD. You now have two congruent sides.
Also, because BE is congruent to DA, angle BCA is congruent to DCE because vertical angles are congruent.

, There are five theorems that can be used to prove that triangles are congruent. Once you have identified all of the information you can from the given information, you can figure out which theorem will allow you to prove the triangles are congruent.Side-side-side (SSS): both triangles have three sides that equal to each other.
Side-angle-side (SAS): two sides of the triangle and their included angle (the angle between the two sides) are equal in both triangles.
Angle-side-angle (ASA): two angles of each triangle and their included side are equal.
Angle-angle-side (AAS): two angles and a non-included side of each triangle are equal.
Hypotenuse leg (HL): the hypotenuse and one leg of each triangle are equal. This only applies to right triangles.
For example: Because you were able to prove that two sides with their included angle were congruent, you would use side-angle-side to prove that the triangles are congruent.

, The most common way to set up a geometry proof is with a two-column proof. Write the statement on one side and the reason on the other side. Every statement given must have a reason proving its truth. The reasons include it was given from the problem or geometry definitions, postulates, and theorems., The easiest step in the proof is to write down the givens. Write the statement and then under the reason column, simply write given. You can start the proof with all of the givens or add them in as they make sense within the proof.Write down what you are trying to prove as well. If you want to prove that triangle ABC is congruent to XYZ, write that at the top of your proof. This will also be the conclusion of your proof.

, When developing a proof, you need a solid foundation in geometry before you can begin. Knowing the relevant theorems, definitions, and postulates is essential. A working knowledge of these will help you to find reasons for your proof.Some good definitions and postulates to know involve lines, angles, midpoints of a line, bisectors, alternating and interior angles, etc.
You cannot prove a theorem with itself. If you're trying to prove that base angles are congruent, you won't be able to use ""Base angles are congruent"" as a reason anywhere in your proof.

, When constructing a proof, you want to think through it logically. Try to order all of your steps so that they naturally follow each other. Sometimes it helps to work the problem backwards: start with the conclusion and work your way back to the first step.Every step must be included even if it seems trivial.
Read through the proof when you are done to check to see if it makes sense.

Learn the theorems that apply to triangles.",How to Understand Euclidean Geometry," If you have two points, A and B, you can draw a line segment connecting those two points. Only one line segment can ever be made by connecting the two points., Once you have constructed a line segment between two points, you can extend this line segment into a line. You can do this by extending either end of the segment infinitely in the same direction., Stated another way, a circle can be constructed from any line segment. This postulate holds true no matter the length of the line segment., A right angle is equal to 90°. Every single right angle is congruent, or equal. If an angle is not equal to 90°, then it is not a right angle., Another way of stating this postulate is to say if two lines intersect with a third line so that the sum of the inner angles of one side is less than two right angles, the two lines will eventually intersect. Those two lines are not parallel to each other.This last postulate cannot be proven as a theorem. In non-Euclidean geometry, this “parallel” postulate does not hold true.

, A line extends infinitely in either direction and is denoted with arrows on its ends to indicate this. A line segment is finite and only exists between two points. A ray is a hybrid between a line and a line segment: it extends infinitely in one direction from a defined point.A single line always has a measure of 180°.
Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope and never intersect.
Perpendicular lines are two lines that come together to form a 90° angle.
Intersecting lines are any two lines that cross each other at any point. Parallel lines can never intersect, but perpendicular lines can.

, There are three types of angles: acute, obtuse, and right. An acute angle is any angle that measure less than 90°. An obtuse angle is a wide angle and is defined as any angle that measures greater than 90°. A right angle measures exactly 90°.Being able to identify the various types of angles is an essential part to understanding geometry.
Two lines that make a right angle are also perpendicular to each other. They form a perfect corner.
You may also see a straight angle which is simply a line. The measure of this angle is 180°.
For example: A square or rectangle has four 90° angles while a circle has no angles.

, There are two ways to identify a triangle: by the size of its angles (acute, obtuse, and right) or by how many sides and angles are equal (equilateral, isosceles, and scalene). In an acute triangle, all angles have a measure less than 90°; obtuse triangles have one angle that is greater than 90°; and a right triangle has one 90° angle.Equilateral triangles have three equal sides and three angles that all measure exactly 60°.
Isosceles triangles have two equal sides and two equal angles.
Scalene triangles have no equal sides and no equal angles.

, Squares, rectangles, circles, triangles, etc. are all shapes that you will need to know how to calculate perimeter and area for. The perimeter of an object is the measure of all of the sides of the object while the area is the measure of the amount of space the object takes up.The equations for perimeter and area for the most common shapes are:The perimeter of a circle is called the circumference and is equal to 2πr where “r” is the radius.
The area of a circle is πr2 where “r” is the radius.
The perimeter of a rectangle is 2l + 2w where “l” is the length and “w” is the width.
The area of a rectangle is l x w where “l” is the length and “w” is the width.
The perimeter of a triangle is a + b + c where each variable denotes one side of the triangle.
The area of a triangle is ½bh where “b” is the base of the triangle and “h” is the vertical height.

, Just as you can calculate perimeter and area of a 2D object, you can find the total surface are and volume of a 3D object. Objects such as spheres, rectangular prisms, pyramids, and cylinders all have special equations to do this. The surface area is the total area of every surface of the object while the volume is the total amount of space that object occupies.The surface area of a sphere is equal to 4πr2, where “r” is the radius of the sphere.
The volume of a sphere is equal to (4/3)πr3, where “r” is the radius of the sphere.
The surface area of a rectangular prism is 2lw + 2lh + 2hw, where “l” is the length, “w” is the width, and “h” is the height.
The volume of the rectangular prism is l x w x h, where “l” is the length, “w” is the width, and “h” is the height.

, When a line intersects two other lines, it is called a transversal. Angle pairs are formed by these lines. Corresponding angles are the two angles in matching corners against the transversal.Alternate interior angles are the two angles that are inside the two lines but on opposite sides of the transversal.Alternate exterior angles are the two angles that are outside of the two lines, but on opposite sides of the transversal.Angle pairs are equal to each other if two of the lines are parallel.There is a fourth angle pair: consecutive interior angles. These are the two angles on the inside of the lines and on the same side of the transversal. When the two lines are parallel, the consecutive interior angles always add up to 180°., The Pythagorean Theorem is a handy way to determine the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. It is defined as a2 + b2 = c2, where “a” and “b” are the length and height (straight lines) of the triangle and “c” is the hypotenuse (angled line). If you know any two sides of a triangle, you can calculate the third side with this equation.For example: If you have a right triangle with side a = 3 and b = 4, you can find the hypotenuse:
a2 + b2 = c2

32 + 42 = c2

9 + 16 = c2

25 = c2

c = √25
c = 25; the hypotenuse of the triangle is 5.

, Read through the problem and sketch a diagram to illustrate it. Label all of the given information including all angles, lines that are parallel or perpendicular, and lines that intersect. You may need to draw everything a second time after you have a basic sketch of the problem. The second drawing can fix the scale of everything and make sure all angles are drawn approximately correctly.Label all of the unknowns as well.
A clearly drawn diagram is the easiest way to understand the problem.

, If you are given a line segment, but there are angles coming out of the line segment, you know that the measure of all the angles must sum to 180°. Write this information on the diagram or in the margins. This a good way to think about what the question is asking.


For example: Angle ABC and angle DBE make a line, ABE. Angle ABC = 120°. What is the measure of angle DBE?
Since the sum of angle ABC and DBE must equal 180°, then angle DBE = 180° - angle ABC.
Angle DBE = 180° - 120° = 60°.

, There are many individual theorems that describe the properties of triangles, intersecting and parallel lines, and circles that can be used to solve a problem. Identify the geometric shapes in the problem and find the theorems that apply. Use old proofs and problems as a guide to see if there are similarities between them. Here are some of the general geometric theorems you will need:The reflexive property: A variable is equal to itself. x = x.
The addition postulate: When equal variables are added to equal variables, all of the sums are equal. A + B + C = A + C + B.
The subtraction postulate: This is similar to the addition postulate, all variables subtracted from equal variables have equal differences. A – B – C = A – C – B.
The substitution postulate: If two quantities are equal, you may substitute one for the other in any expression.
The partition postulate: any whole is equal to the sum of all of its parts. Line ABC = AB + BC.

, Many problems in geometry will have triangles and knowing the properties of triangles will help you solve them. Use these theorems to form geometric proofs. Here are a few of the most important ones for triangles:CPCTC: corresponding parts of the congruent triangle are congruent
SSS: side-side-side: if three sides of one triangle are congruent to three sides of a second triangle, then the triangles are congruent
SAS: side-angle-side: if two triangles have a congruent side-angle-side, then the two triangles are congruent
ASA: angle-side-angle: if two triangles have a congruent angle-side-angle, then the two triangles are congruent
AAA: angle-angle-angle: triangles with congruent angles are similar, but not necessarily congruent

Understand a definition of Euclid's Intersecting Chords Theorem.,
Prove the similarity of triangles ABP and CDP that is a consequence of their angles since


1) BAD = BCD because inscribed angles subtended by the same chord BD are equal ;






2) ABC = ADC because inscribed angles subtended by the same chord AC are equal ; and






3) APB = CPD because they are a pair of vertical angles (vertical angles are formed by the same intersecting lines).







,
Prove that from the similarity of triangles ABP and CDP are obtained these identities and proportions: 1) AP/PC = BP/PD = AB/CD.,
Prove that the first identity above, AP/PC = BP/PD, leads directly to the Intersecting Chords Theorem, by cross-multiplying: AP*PD = BP*PC.,
Research and find out that the proof given by Euclid is much longer and more involved, and uses the Pythagorean Theorem, which is a fairly lengthy proof in itself.",How to Understand the Beautiful Crossing Chords Theorem of Euclid," The Intersecting Chords Theorem asserts the following very useful fact: Given a point P in the interior of a circle with two lines passing through P, AD and BC, then AP*PD = BP*PC -- the two rectangles formed by the adjoining segments are, in fact, equal. I will teach you in a few steps to prove how this is true.;
,, That is fundamentally how similar triangles are related.

, That is how the Theorem was arrived at, both geometrically and mathematically, for these two products are indeed rectangles.

Note the corresponding clockwise and counterclockwise rotations.,
Find the coordinates of the original vertices.,
Set up the formula for rotating a shape 90 degrees.,
Plug the coordinates into the formula.,
Draw the new shape.",How to Rotate a Shape1," Rotating a shape 90 degrees is the same as rotating it 270 degrees clockwise.The convention is that when rotating shapes on a coordinate plane, they rotate counterclockwise, or towards the left.You should assume this, unless it is noted in the problem that you need to rotate clockwise.

For example, if the problem states, “Rotate the shape 90 degrees around the origin,” you can assume you are rotating the shape counterclockwise. 

You would complete this problem the same way you complete a problem that asks “Rotate the shape 270 degrees clockwise around the origin.”

You might also see, “Rotate this shape -270 degrees around the origin.”  


;
, If these aren’t already provided, determine the coordinates using the graph. Remember that coordinates of points are shown using the (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} formula, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the point on the horizontal, or x-axis, and y{\displaystyle y} equals the point on the vertical, or y-axis.

For example, you might have a triangle with points (4, 6), (1, 2), and (1, 8).


, The formula is (x,y)→(−y,x){\displaystyle (x,y)\rightarrow (-y,x)}.This formula shows that you are reflecting the shape, then flipping it., Make sure that you keep your x and y-coordinates straight. In this formula, you take the negative of the y value, and then switch the order of the coordinates.

For example, the points (4, 6), (1, 2), and (1, 8) become (-6, 4), (-2, 1), and (-8, 1).


, Plot the new vertex points on the plane. Connect your points using a straightedge. The resulting shape shows the original shape rotated 90 degrees around the origin.

Ensure that you have the measurements for all three sides of the triangle.,
Write the formula for Pythagoras’s Theorem.,
Plug the length of the potential hypotenuse into the formula.,
Plug the values of the other two sides into the equation.,
Square all of the numbers.,
Add the square of the two sides.",How to Solve Pythagoras Theorem Questions2," If you do not have all three side lengths, you cannot use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine whether the triangle is right.

For example, you might be given a triangle with side lengths of 8, 9, and 12 cm, and you need to determine whether the triangle is right. 


, The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the lengths of the other sides of the triangle., The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle, so whatever measurement is largest will stand for the variable c{\displaystyle c}.

For example, if the side lengths of a triangle are are 8, 9, and 12 cm, you would use the measurement of 12 for the potential hypotenuse, because it’s the longest side. So, your formula will look like this: a2+b2=122{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=12^{2}}.


, It does not matter which value is a{\displaystyle a} and which value is b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the other two side lengths are 8 and 9 centimeters, your formula will look like this: 82+92=122{\displaystyle 8^{2}+9^{2}=12^{2}}.


, Remember that squaring a number means to multiply it by itself.

For example:82+92=122{\displaystyle 8^{2}+9^{2}=12^{2}}64+81=144{\displaystyle 64+81=144}


, If this sum is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, the triangle is right. If the two sides of the equation are not equal, the triangle is not right.For example:64+81=144{\displaystyle 64+81=144}145=144{\displaystyle 145=144}Since the equation is not true, the triangle is not right.

For example, you might be asked to use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the diagonal of a 6-inch by 4-inch rectangle.


, Since the diagonal of a rectangle divides the shape into two congruent right triangles, you can use Pythagoras’s Theorem to find its length.

The length of the diagonal will equal the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangles.


, The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the lengths of the other sides of the triangle., Make sure you substitute for the variables a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}. It doesn’t matter which variable is the length and which is the width.

For example, for a 6-inch by 4-inch rectangle, the formula will look like this: 62+42=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}.


, Remember that squaring means to multiply a number by itself.

For example:62+42=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}36+16=c2{\displaystyle 36+16=c^{2}}


, This sum will give you the value of the hypotenuse, or diagonal, squared.

For example:36+16=c2{\displaystyle 36+16=c^{2}}52=c2{\displaystyle 52=c^{2}}


, This will give you the value of c{\displaystyle c}, which is the length of the right triangle’s hypotenuse, and also the length of the rectangle’s diagonal.

For example:52=c2{\displaystyle 52=c^{2}}52=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {52}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}7.21=c{\displaystyle 7.21=c}So, the diagonal of a 6-inch by 4-inch rectangle is 7.21 inches.

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. This straight line creates a hypotenuse of a right triangle, with one side 80 feet long and the other side 60 feet long.

The formula for Pythagoras’s theorem is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the lengths of the other two sides.

Since you know the lengths of the two sides, plug the values of a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} into the formula: 802+602=c2{\displaystyle 80^{2}+60^{2}=c^{2}}.

Square the lengths of the sides: 6400+3600=c2{\displaystyle 6400+3600=c^{2}}.

Add the squared side lengths: 10,000=c2{\displaystyle 10,000=c^{2}}.

Find the square root of both sides of the equation:10,000=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {10,000}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}100=c{\displaystyle 100=c}.

The length of hypotenuse, and the shortest distance back to the fountain, is 100 ft.


, For instance, find the length of x{\displaystyle x}, given a right triangle with a hypotenuse measuring 10 cm and one side measuring 6 cm.

The formula for Pythagoras’s theorem is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the lengths of the other two sides.

Since you know the lengths of the hypotenuse and one side, plug the values of a{\displaystyle a} and c{\displaystyle c} into the formula: 62+b2=102{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10^{2}}.

Square the known measurements: 36+b2=100{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=100}.

Subtract the squared value of a{\displaystyle a} from both sides of the equation: b2=64{\displaystyle b^{2}=64}.

Find the square root of both sides of the equation: b2=64{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {64}}}b=8{\displaystyle b=8}

The length of x{\displaystyle x} is 8 cm.


, For instance, determine whether the triangle is right, given side lengths of 9, 12, and 15 cm.

The formula for Pythagoras’s theorem is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the lengths of the other two sides.

The longest side length is the potential hypotenuse. Plug this value in for c{\displaystyle c}: a2+b2=152{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=15^{2}}.

Plug the values of the other two sides into the equation: 92+122=152{\displaystyle 9^{2}+12^{2}=15^{2}}.

Square all of the numbers: 81+144=225{\displaystyle 81+144=225}.

Add the square of the two sides: 225=225{\displaystyle 225=225}.

Since the equation is true, the triangle is right.

The formula for Pythagoras’s theorem is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the lengths of the other two sides.

Since you know the width and the diagonal of the rectangle, plug the values of a{\displaystyle a} and c{\displaystyle c} into the formula: 242+b2=272{\displaystyle 24^{2}+b^{2}=27^{2}}.

Square the known measurements: 576+b2=729{\displaystyle 576+b^{2}=729}.

Subtract the squared value of a{\displaystyle a} from both sides of the equation: b2=153{\displaystyle b^{2}=153}.

Find the square root of both sides of the equation: b2=153{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {153}}}b=12.37{\displaystyle b=12.37}

, These will likely be given. If not, you should be able to deduce them from looking at the coordinate graph. Remember to note the coordinates of each vertex’s point using the (x, y) convention.

For example, you might have a rhombus with points (4, 6), (-4, 6), (-2, -1), and (2, -1).


, The formula is (x,y)→(−x,−y){\displaystyle (x,y)\rightarrow (-x,-y)}.This formula shows that you are reflecting the shape twice., Take care to plug the correct coordinate into the correct position of the new ordered pair.

Draw four congruent right triangles.,
Arrange the triangles so that they form a square with sides a+b.,
Rearrange the same four triangles such that they form two equal rectangles inside a larger square.,
Recognize that the area not formed by the triangles is equal in both arrangements.,
Set the areas of each arrangement equal to each other.",How to Prove the Pythagorean Theorem1," Congruent triangles are ones that have three identical sides. Designate the legs of length a and b and hypotenuse of length c. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of squares of the two legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, so we need to prove a2 + b2 = c2.


Remember, the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.;
, With the triangles placed in this way, they will form a smaller square (in green) inside the larger square with four equal sides of length c, the hypotenuse of each triangle.The larger square has sides of length a+b.


You can rotate (turn) the entire arrangement by 90 degrees and it will be exactly the same. You can repeat this as many times as you like. This is only possible because the four angles at the corners are equal.

, Again, the larger square will have sides of length a+b, but in this configuration there are two rectangles (in grey) of equal size and two smaller squares within the larger square. The larger of the smaller squares (in red) has sides of length a, while the smaller square (in blue) has sides of length b.The hypotenuse of the original triangles is now the diagonal of the two rectangles formed by the triangles.

, In both cases, you have a large square with sides of a+b. Given this, the areas of both of the large squares are equal. Looking at both arrangements, you can see that the total area of the green square must equal the areas of the red and blue squares added together in the second arrangement.


In both arrangements we partially covered the surface with exactly the same amount, four grey triangles that didn't overlap. This means that also the area left out by the triangles must be equal in both arrangements.
Therefore, the area of the blue and the red square taken together must be equal to the area of the green square.

, The blue area is a2, the red area, b2 and the green area, c2. The red and blue squares must be added together to equal the area of the green square; therefore, blue area + red area = green area: a2 + b2 = c2.This finishes the proof.

Write the proof.",How to Prove Similar Triangles," Two triangles can be proved similar by the angle-angle theorem which states: if two triangles have two congruent angles, then those triangles are similar.This theorem is also called the angle-angle-angle (AAA) theorem because if two angles of the triangle are congruent, the third angle must also be congruent. This is because the angles of a triangle must sum to 180°.;
, Using a protractor, measure the degree of at least two angles on the first triangle. Label the angles on the triangle to keep track of them.


Choose any two angles on the triangle to measure.
Example: Triangle ABC has two angles that measure 30° and 70°.

, Again, use a protractor to measure two of the angles on the second triangle. If both angles are identical on both triangles, then the triangles are similar to each other.


Remember, if two angles of a triangle are equal, then all three are equal.
Example: The second triangle, DEF, also has two angles that measure 30° and 70°.

, Once you have identified the congruent angles, you can use this theorem to prove that the triangles are similar. State that the measures of the angles between the two triangles are identical and cite the angle-angle theorem as proof of their similarity.It is possible for a triangle with three identical angles to also be congruent, but they would also have to have identical side lengths.
Example: Because both triangles have two identical angles, they are similar.
Note: If the two triangles did not have identical angles, they would not be similar. For example: Triangle ABC has angles that measure 30° and 70° and triangle DEF has angles that measure 35° and 70°. Because 30° does not equal 35°, the triangles are not similar.

, When a triangle has two sides that are in the same proportion to another triangle and their included angle is equal, these triangles are similar.Be careful not to confuse this theorem with the Side-Angle-Side theorem for congruence. For congruence, the two sides with their included angle must be identical; for similarity, the proportions of the sides must be same and the angle must be identical.For example: Triangle ABC and DEF are similar is angle A = angle D and AB/DE = AC/DF.

, Using a ruler, measure two sides of triangle ABC and label them with that measure. Make sure triangle DEF is oriented in the same direction and measure the same two sides. Label these sides as well.Example: Measures of triangle ABC; side AB = 4 cm and side AC = 8 cm. Measures of triangle DEF; side DE = 2 cm and side DF = 4 cm.

, Using a protractor, measure the included angle, or, the angle between the two sides that you already measured. For this theorem, the measure of the angle should be identical in both triangles.Example: Angle A in triangle ABC is 26°. Angle D in triangle DEF is also 26°.

, To use the SAS theorem, the sides of the triangles must be proportional to each other. To calculate this, simply use the formula AB/DE = AC/DF.Example: AB/DE = AC/DF; 4/2 = 8/4; 2 = 2. The proportions of the two triangles are equal.

, Once you have determined that the proportions of two sides of a triangle and their included angle are equal, you can use the SAS theorem in your proof.


Example: Because AB/DE = AAC/DF and angle A = angle D, triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF.
Note: If angle A did not equal angle D, the triangles would not be similar. Also, if the proportions were not equal, the triangles would not be similar.

, Two triangles would be considered similar if the three sides of both triangles are of the same proportion. Sides measuring 2:4:6 and 4:8:12 would provide proof of similarity.Be careful not confuse this theorem with the Side-Side-Side theorem for congruence: when two triangles have three identical sides they are congruent. The theorem for similarity deals strictly with the proportions of the three sides.
For example: In triangle ABC and DEF, the triangles are similar if AB/DE = AC/DF = BC/EF.

, Using a ruler, measure all three sides of each triangle. Label each side to keep track of all the measurements. Be sure to use the same units for each measurement of the sides of the triangle.


Example: triangle ABC has sides AB = 10 cm, BC = 15 cm, AC = 20 cm and triangle DEF has sides DE = 2 cm, EF = 3 cm, and DF = 4 cm.

, For the SSS theorem to be applicable, the three sides of each triangle must be proportional to each other. Using the side measurements, calculate the proportions using the formula AB/DE = AC/DF = BC/EF.Example: AB/DE = AC/DF = BC/EF; 10/2 = 20/4 = 15/3; 5 = 5 = 5.

, If you have determined that the proportions of all three sides of the triangles are equal to each other, you can use the SSS theorem to prove that these triangles are similar.Example: Because AB/DE = AC/DF = BC/EF, triangle ABC and triangle DEF are similar.
Note: If AB/DE ≠ AC/DF ≠ BC/EF then the triangles would not be similar.

, A proof starts with a statement of given information which is known as the hypothesis statement. You will need to provide a list of relevant information as well as evidence to support each statement., You will need to make a chart, which generally has two columns. This first column will contain your statements, while the second will provide your evidence.Be sure that the final line in your statement column always matches the hypothesis statement. The middle rows will be where you show your work while you're solving the problem. All of the statements you provide, as well as your supporting evidence, should always refer back to the figures that are described by the hypothesis statement.

, Use all of the details that are supplied by the hypothesis. Be sure to draw the figure big enough so that you can easily make out these details. Label all of the points that are described and be sure to include any information from the statement regarding parallel lines or congruent angles.

, For any problem, you will be given some information about the measures of the angles and the sides of the two triangles you are trying to prove similar. The first step in identifying the correct theorem to use is writing down the information you already know.If no diagram is provided, draw the triangles and then label their angles and sides with the given information.

, Once you have written down your given information and learned the three possible theorems that could apply, choose the one that matches the information given. It’s okay if multiple theorems apply, just choose one for your proof.


If none of these theorems match the given information then the triangles are not similar.

, Devise a strategy to solve the proof. There are three different postulates, or mathematical theories, which apply to similar triangles. Any one of these will provide sufficient evidence to prove that the triangles in question are similar.


Gather your givens and relevant theorems and write the proof in a step-by-step fashion.

Cut a strip of paper about 6 inches (15 cm) long and 1.5 inches in width.,
Label the corners of the strip A, B, C, and D. In the top left corner of the strip, write a small letter A; in the top right corner, write a small B; the bottom left, the letter C; and the bottom right, the letter D. You will use these letters to align the strip after the twist.,
Twist the A-C side a half turn and bring it to the B-D side.,
Draw a line along the middle of the strip.,
Color the edge of the strip with a highlighter.,
Cut the Mobius strip along the central line you drew earlier.,
Cut the Mobius strip 1/3 of the way away from the edge.",How to Make a Mobius Strip," When cutting the strip, the measurements do not need to be accurate, these are just suggested. Try to keep the width even so that you have a long thin rectangle.To simplify the process, you can simply cut down the edge of a plain sheet of paper to make your strip.;
,


The size you make the letters doesn’t matter, but the position of each one is important for the twist step.

, Hold the two ends in your hands, give the A-C side of the strip a half twist and join it to the B-D side. Match the letters, A to D and B to C and tape the edges together. Once the edges are taped, you have completed the Mobius strip.You can twist the paper more than one time and still have a Mobius strip., Using a pen or pencil, start at any point in the middle of the strip and draw a line all the way around without lifting your pen. Eventually, the pen will end up back at the point you started drawing. You have drawn a line on both sides of the loop - but without lifting your pen or crossing any edge. How did this happen? The paper has only one side!Start at a different point in the Mobius strip and see if the same thing happens.

, Take a highlighter and start coloring the edge of the Mobius strip without lifting the highlighter from the strip. Continue with the marker until you reach the point at which you started. You'll find both edges are colored. This indicates that the Mobius strip has only one edge!

, With a pair of scissors, poke a hole into the middle of the Mobius strip and cut along the line until you reach the beginning cut. It does not, as you'd expect, fall apart into two separate loops; instead you now have a single, larger one-sided loop!, Like you did cutting through the center line, take the scissors and this time, cut about 1/3 of the way from the edge of the strip. Continue cutting until you reach the original cut.When you have finished cutting, you should have one small ring and one larger ring that are connected together.

Draw a trapezoid with base a+b and sides a and b.,
Divide the trapezoid into three right triangles, two of which are congruent.,
Calculate the area of the trapezoid using the area formula.,
Find the area by summing the areas of the three triangles.,
Set the different area calculations equal to each other.",How to Prove the Pythagorean Theorem2," Sketch a trapezoid with the following measurements: left side of height b, right side of height a, and base of length a+b. Simply connect the tops of the left and right sides to complete the trapezoid.

, Divide the base of the triangle into lengths a and b so that two right triangles of lengths a, b, and c is formed. The third triangle will have two sides of length c and a hypotenuse of length d.The two smaller triangles are congruent (identical).

, The area of a trapezoid is: A = ½(b1 + b2)h where b1 is one straight side of the trapezoid, b2 is the other straight side of the trapezoid, and h is the height of the trapezoid.For this trapezoid: b1 is a, b2 is b, and h is a+b.


The area of this trapezoid is A = ½(a +b)(a+b) .

Expanding the binomial yields: A = ½(a2 + 2ab + b2).

, The area of a right triangle is: A = ½bh where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height. This trapezoid has been broken into three different triangles; therefore, the areas need to be added together. First, find the area of each one and then add all three together.


Because two of the triangles are identical, you can simply multiply the area of the first triangle by two: 2A1 = 2(½bh) = 2(½ab) = ab.
The area of the third triangle is A2 = ½bh = ½c*c = ½c2.
The total area of the trapezoid is A1 + A2 = ab + ½c2.

, Because both of these calculations are equal to the total area of the trapezoid, you can set them equal to each other. Once they’re set equal to each other, you can reduce the equation to its simplest form.½(a2 + 2ab + b2) = ab + ½c2.
Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the ½: (a2 + 2ab + b2) = 2ab + c2.
Subtract out the 2ab: a2 + b2 = c2.
You’re left with the proof: a2 + b2 = c2.

Measure your height.,
Ask your friend to make a mark on the wall, level with the top of your head.

,
Step away from the wall and help your friend measure straight up from the floor to the mark, to get your height.,
Divide your reach measurement by your height to express your arm span as a ratio.,
Subtract your height measurement from your reach measurement to get a more concrete ""ape index"" result.",How to Measure Reach2," Stand in your stocking feet with your back flat against a wall.

,,


Make sure you use the same units of measurement (feet, inches, centimeters or meters) that you used to measure your reach.

, If the result is greater than 1 your reach is longer than your height, which is also known as having a positive ape index.

,


If the result is positive, your reach is longer than your height. This is usually expressed as a positive ape index, or a +1, +2, or so on ape index, with the number expressing the number of units your reach is longer than your height. (So a person with a +1 ape index might have a reach that is 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than his height.
A ""negative ape index"" is expressed similarly, but with a minus or negative sign instead of the plus.

Set up the formula for perimeter of a rhombus.,
Plug in the side length of the rhombus.,
Solve for P{\displaystyle P}.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Rhombus1," Since, by definition, all four sides of a rhombus are the same length, the formula is P=4S{\displaystyle P=4S}, where P{\displaystyle P} equals the perimeter, and S{\displaystyle S} equals the length of one side.You could also use the formula P=S+S+S+S{\displaystyle P=S+S+S+S} to find the perimeter, since the perimeter of any polygon is the sum of all its sides.If you know that not all sides are the same length, then you are not working with a rhombus, and you cannot use this formula.

If you don’t know the length of any side of the rhombus, you cannot use this method.

A square is a special type of rhombus, with four 90-degree angles.
;
, Make sure you are substituting for the variable S{\displaystyle S}.

For example, if you know one side of the rhombus is 4 meters long, your formula will look like this: P=4(4){\displaystyle P=4(4)}.


, To do this, multiply S{\displaystyle S} by 4.

For example:P=4(4){\displaystyle P=4(4)}P=16{\displaystyle P=16} So, the perimeter of the rhombus is 16m{\displaystyle 16m}.

Choose the best measuring tool for the task.,
Line up the “0” end with one side of the length to be measured.,
Extend the measuring tool down the length being measured.,
Read the previous inch value.,
Count the unnumbered lines past the previous inch value.,
Add the fraction to the inch value.",How to Measure in Inches1," You'll need a tool that measures length in inches. The usual options would be a ruler, yardstick, or tape measure.


Use a yardstick to measure objects that are longer than a feet(12 inches).
Use a measuring stick when you need to measure the length of a rigid straight edge or line. Rulers are best for short distances. Yard sticks are better for slightly longer distances.






Use a tape measure when you need to measure the distance around a curved object. Tape measures can bend, making them suitable for objects that are not perfectly flat or straight.





;
, Place the starting end of the measuring tool against one edge of the object you want to measure. The starting edge of the measuring tool and the starting edge of the object should be perfectly aligned.The starting edge may not be marked with a “0,” but you can identify the starting edge by locating the number “1.” The end that comes just before the “1” mark on your measuring tool is the “0” end.







, Bring the measuring tool out along the length of the object you're measuring. Keep the tool parallel to this length the entire way down it.

When using a measuring stick, the stick should lie flat against the edge or line being measured.






When using a measuring tape, the tape should wrap around the entire distance being measured.







, Locate the numbered value on the measuring tool that falls out immediately before the opposite end of the line, edge, or distance being measured. This numbered value is the number of whole inches in length.


The numbered values on a ruler, yardstick, or measuring tape all correspond to whole inches.






The shorter, unnumbered lines in between the numbered values are fractions of an inch.







, Identify the unnumbered line on the measuring tool that lands at the exact end of the distance being measured. Count the unnumbered lines in between the measured whole inch value and that final line, including the final line itself.


You also need to count the number of unnumbered lines in between numbered values to determine the fraction.






If there is one unnumbered line, the inches are broken down into halves.
If there are three unnumbered lines, the inches are broken down into quarters.
If there are seven unnumbered lines, the inches are broken down into eighths.
If there are 15 unnumbered lines, the inches are broken down into sixteenths., Add the fraction value you just counted onto the whole inch value you already measured. This should give you your final measurement.



Example: If the ruler has seven unnumbered lines in between numbered marks the inches are broken down into eighths. For a line that measures from the 0 edge to the fifth unnumbered line after the 3 mark, the length of the line is 3 inches plus 5/8 of an inch, or 3-5/8 inches.






If the end of the edge lands on a numbered line, there is no additional fraction to add on.


Example: If a line measures from the 0 edge to the 6 mark, that line is 6 inches long.

Identify the vertex of the angle.,
Identify one point on each line segment or ray.,
Draw the angle symbol.,
Label the angle using the vertex and the two points.",How to Name an Angle1," The vertex is the point where the two line segments or rays of the angle meet.If you are looking at an angle in a math book or worksheet, this point is likely already labeled. If you are drawing your own angle, you can label this point using any letter.

For example, you might have an angle with a vertex at point C.
;
, Usually these points are plotted near the end of the line or ray. Again, these will likely be labeled for you, but if you are creating the angle, you can label them however you like.

For example, on the top ray of the angle, you might have point A. On the bottom ray of the angle, you might have point B.


, This is simply a small representation of an angle (∠{\displaystyle \angle }). Using this symbol will help differentiate an angle from a triangle the angle might be a part of.
, The convention is that the vertex point is the middle letter in the angle label. So, if you are reading the name of an angle, you generally read it from the point on the top ray, to the vertex, to the point on the bottom ray. For example, an angle with a vertex C, and a point A on the top ray, and the point B on the bottom ray, would be labeled ∠ACB{\displaystyle \angle ACB}.

Find the radius if you know the diameter.,
Find the radius if you know the circumference.,
Calculate the radius if you know the volume of a sphere.,
Find the radius from the surface area.",How to Find the Radius of a Sphere1," The radius is half the diameter, so use the formula r = D/2. This is identical to the method used for calculating the radius of a circle from its diameter.If you have a sphere with a diameter of 16 cm, find the radius by dividing 16/2 to get 8 cm. If the diameter is 42, then the radius is 21.;
, Use the formula C/2π. Since the circumference is equal to πD, which is equal to 2πr, dividing the circumference by 2π will give the radius.If you have a sphere with a circumference of 20 m, find the radius by dividing 20/2π = 3.183 m.
Use the same formula to convert between the radius and circumference of a circle.

, Use the formula ((V/π)(3/4))1/3.The volume of a sphere is derived from the equation V = (4/3)πr3. Solving for the r variable in this equation gets ((V/π)(3/4))1/3 = r, meaning that the radius of a sphere is equal to the volume divided by π, times 3/4, all taken to the 1/3 power (or the cube root.)If you have a sphere with a volume of 100 inches3, solve for the radius as follows:

((V/π)(3/4))1/3 = r
((100/π)(3/4))1/3 = r
((31.83)(3/4))1/3 = r
(23.87)1/3 = r

2.88 in = r



, Use the formula r = √(A/(4π)). The surface area of a sphere is derived from the equation A = 4πr2. Solving for the r variable yields √(A/(4π)) = r, meaning that the radius of a sphere is equal to the square root of the surface area divided by 4π. You can also take (A/(4π)) to the 1/2 power for the same result.If you have a sphere with a surface area of 1,200 cm2, solve for the radius as follows:

√(A/(4π)) = r
√(1200/(4π)) = r
√(300/(π)) = r
√(95.49) = r

9.77 cm = r

Draw the second vector of the angle.,
Erase any unnecessary lines.",How to Make Angles in Math Using a Protractor," This horizontal line is at the bottom of the protractor. One vector of your angle should always line up with the base line.


Since a straight line is 180 degrees, the base line marks a 180-degree angle.;
, This is a small hole at the midpoint of the base line. You use this hole to create the vertex of the angle. The vertex is the point at which the two vectors meet, creating an angle.

, Most protractors have two sets of numbers, an outer set and an inner set. Which set of numbers you use will depend on whether your angle opens to the right, or opens to the left. The sets of numbers can be set up differently on each protractor, so you need to figure out for yourself which set of numbers to use. To determine which set of numbers to use, you need to understand right, acute, and obtuse angles., A right angle has a measurement of 90 degrees.A 90-degree angle will look like the corner of a square. The two vectors of the angle are perpendicular, and open exactly halfway towards a straight line (which is 180 degrees).


When you line up the base line of the protractor with one vector of a right angle, the other vector will line up with the 90-degree mark of the protractor. This is halfway between either side of the protractor. Both the inner and outer sets of numbers on the protractor will show 90 degrees at this point.

, An acute angle has a measurement of less than 90 degrees.This means that the two vectors will be closer together than they are in a 90-degree angle. They will open less than halfway towards a straight line. If the angle you are drawing is less than 90 degrees, make sure you use the set of numbers that gives you the smaller angle.


For example, a 45-degree angle is acute, because 45 is less than 90. If you line up the base line of the protractor with one vector of a 45-degree angle, the other vector will line up with the 45-degree mark and the 135-degree mark of the protractor. You will know which line to look at because you know it is an acute angle, and an acute angle should be less open than a 90-degree angle.

, An obtuse angle has a measurement of more than 90 degrees.The two vectors of an obtuse angle are farther apart than they are in a 90-degree angle. They will open more than halfway to a straight line. If the angle you are drawing is more than 90 degrees, make sure you use the set of numbers that gives you the larger angle.


For example, a 120-degree angle is obtuse, because 120 is greater than 90. If you line up the base line of the protractor with one vector of a 120-degree angle, the other vector will line up with the 120-degree mark and the 60-degree mark. If you know you are looking for an obtuse angle, you know to use the 120-degree mark, because an obtuse angle should be more open than a 90-degree angle.

, Whether an angle opens to the left or to the right does not affect whether it is right, acute, or obtuse. All that matters is the measurement of the angle in degrees. The way the angle opens only changes the set of numbers you will look at on your protractor.


For example, if a 45-degree angle opens to the right, you might have to look at the inner set of numbers. But if you were to turn that angle around so that it opens to the left, it would still measure 45 degrees, but this time when you measure it, you would have to look at the outer set of numbers.

, Note whether the angle is acute or obtuse.


For example, you might need to draw a 45 degree angle. Since 45 is less than 90, this is an acute angle. That means you will use the set of numbers that gives you the smaller angle, since the angle will open less than halfway towards a straight line.

, You can do this using a ruler or the straightedge of your protractor. This line will form the first vector of your angle.


The length of the line does not necessarily matter, but the longer it is, the easier it will be to line it up to the base line. The best method is to draw a line running the length of the protractor’s edge.

, Make sure that the base line of the protractor lines up with the line you drew.Draw a midpoint for your reference.

, Make this mark along the outside of the protractor by the appropriate degree mark. To make sure you are making the mark at the correct place, ask yourself the following questions:


Will my angle open to the right, or to the left?
Is my angle less (acute) or greater (obtuse) than 90 degrees?

, Use a ruler or straightedge to join the origin point on the base line to the degree mark.

, You will likely need to erase part of the base line you drew. Otherwise, you may have two angles drawn, and it may be unclear to another person which is your intended angle.

Since the triangles are congruent, it doesn’t matter which one you outline. 


, The two diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so the central angle of your triangle will be 90 degrees. , The hypotenuse is the side opposite a 90 degree angle.Traditionally, the hypotenuse is labeled c{\displaystyle c}.

The hypotenuse of your triangle is one side of the rhombus. So, if you find the length of c{\displaystyle c}, you will know the length of one side of the rhombus.


, Traditionally, these are labeled a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.
, To do this, divide the length of the diagonal that a{\displaystyle a} runs along by 2. Label the side length on your triangle.

Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, you know that the length on either side of their intersection will be equal.Since side a{\displaystyle a} is half the length of the diagonal, you can find its length by dividing the diagonal length in half.

For example, if side a{\displaystyle a} runs along a diagonal that is 12 meters long, you can find the length of side a{\displaystyle a} by calculating:a=122{\displaystyle a={\frac {12}{2}}}a=6{\displaystyle a=6} 


, To do this, divide the length of the diagonal that b{\displaystyle b} runs along by 2. Label the side length on your triangle.

For example, if side b{\displaystyle b} runs along a diagonal that is 16 meters long, you can find the length of side b{\displaystyle b} by calculating:b=162{\displaystyle b={\frac {16}{2}}}b=8{\displaystyle b=8}


, The theorem states that a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}. This is a basic geometric formula for finding the side lengths of a right triangle.
, Make sure you substitute for a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}, but the order doesn’t matter due to the commutative property.

For example, if a=6{\displaystyle a=6} and b=8{\displaystyle b=8}, your equation will look like this: 62+82=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+8^{2}=c^{2}}.


, To do this, you need to square a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}, add, then find the square root of the sum.

For example:62+82=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+8^{2}=c^{2}}36+64=c2{\displaystyle 36+64=c^{2}}100=c2{\displaystyle 100=c^{2}}100=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {100}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}10=c{\displaystyle 10=c}


, Since the hypotenuse is also the side of the rhombus, to find the perimeter of the rhombus, you need to plug the value of c{\displaystyle c} into the formula for the perimeter of a rhombus, which is P=4S{\displaystyle P=4S}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the length of one side of the rhombus. In this case, it is the same value that we found for c{\displaystyle c}.

For example: P=4S{\displaystyle P=4S}P=4(10){\displaystyle P=4(10)}P=40{\displaystyle P=40}


, Don’t forget to include the correct unit of measurement.

For example, a rhombus that has diagonals measuring 12 and 16 meters long has a perimeter of 40 meters.

, Outline one of these triangles. You will use it to find the length of one side of the rhombus.

Since the triangles are congruent, it doesn’t matter which one you outline; however, for simplicity you should outline a triangle that shares a known angle of the rhombus.

For example, I know that angle DAB{\displaystyle DAB} of the rhombus is 70 degrees, so I would outline a triangle that includes point A.


, The two diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so the central angle of your triangle will be 90 degrees. If this angle is not already labeled, label it E{\displaystyle E}.
, Remember that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect its vertices.So, if you know the measurement of angle DAB{\displaystyle DAB} of the rhombus, divide it in half to find the measurement of angle EAB{\displaystyle EAB} of the triangle. Label the degrees for this angle on your triangle.

This method will not work if you do not know the measurement of at least one vertex of your rhombus.

For example, you know angle DAB{\displaystyle DAB} of the rhombus is 70 degrees, so the angle EAB{\displaystyle EAB} of the triangle is half that, or 35 degrees. 


, Remember, the interior degrees of a triangle will add up to 180.So, if you know the measurement of two angles, you can subtract to find the measurement of the third angle. Label the degrees for this angle on your triangle.

For example, you know that angle AEB{\displaystyle AEB} is 90 degrees, and angle EAB{\displaystyle EAB} is 35 degrees. To find the third angle, sum the two angles you already know, then subtract that sum from 180.90+35=125{\displaystyle 90+35=125}180−125=55{\displaystyle 180-125=55}So, the measurement of angel ABE{\displaystyle ABE} is 55 degrees. 


, To do this, divide the length of the diagonal that the side runs along by 2. Label the side length on your triangle.

Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, you know that the length on either side of their intersection will be equal.This method will not work if you do not know the length of at least one diagonal of your rhombus.

For example, if you know that diagonal AC{\displaystyle AC} is 16 centimeters, you can divide 16 in half to find the length of side AE{\displaystyle AE} of your triangle. 16÷2=8{\displaystyle 16\div 2=8}, so side AE{\displaystyle AE} is 8cm{\displaystyle 8cm}.


, Whether you use sine or cosine will depend on which side and angle measurements of your triangle you know. For more information, read Use Right Angled Trigonometry.

If you know the length of the side opposite to your angle, use sine. Set up the ratio sin⁡(θ)=Oppositeh{\displaystyle \sin(\theta )={\frac {Opposite}{h}}}, where θ{\displaystyle \theta } is the measurement of the angle, “Opposite” is the length of the opposite side, and h{\displaystyle h} is the length of the hypotenuse.

If you know the length of the side adjacent to your angle, use cosine. Set up the ratio cos⁡(θ)=Adjacenth{\displaystyle \cos(\theta )={\frac {Adjacent}{h}}}. Where θ{\displaystyle \theta } is the measurement of the angle, “Adjacent” is the length of the adjacent side, and h{\displaystyle h} is the length of the hypotenuse.

For example, if you know that angle EAB{\displaystyle EAB} of your triangle is 35 degrees, and the adjacent side is 8 centimeters, you should use cosine:cos⁡(35)=8h{\displaystyle \cos(35)={\frac {8}{h}}}


, The length of the hypotenuse is also the length of one side of your rhombus, so you need this measurement to find the perimeter of the rhombus.

For example:cos⁡(35)=8h{\displaystyle \cos(35)={\frac {8}{h}}}.819=8h{\displaystyle .819={\frac {8}{h}}}.819h=8{\displaystyle .819h=8}.819h.819=8.819{\displaystyle {\frac {.819h}{.819}}={\frac {8}{.819}}}h=9.768{\displaystyle h=9.768}So, the length of the hypotenuse, side AB{\displaystyle AB} is about 9.768.


, Since the hypotenuse is also the side of the rhombus, to find the perimeter of the rhombus, you need to plug the value of h{\displaystyle h} into the formula for the perimeter of a rhombus, which is P=4S{\displaystyle P=4S}, where S{\displaystyle S} equals the length of one side of the rhombus. In this case, it is the same value that we found for h{\displaystyle h}.

For example:P=4S{\displaystyle P=4S}P=4(9.768){\displaystyle P=4(9.768)}P=39.072{\displaystyle P=39.072}


, Your answer will be approximate since you rounded the sine or cosine measurement. Don’t forget to include the correct unit of measurement.

For example, a rhombus that has angle DAB{\displaystyle DAB} measuring 70 degrees, and diagonal AC{\displaystyle AC} measuring 16 centimeters long, the perimeter is about 39 centimeters.

Find an object roughly an inch in length.,
Trace the length to be measured on a sheet of paper.,
Place the inch-long object at the beginning of the line.,
Shift the inch-long object down the full length of the line.,
Add the spaces together.",How to Measure in Inches2," The most common object used to estimate inches is the adult thumb. On average, the width of an adult thumb is about 1 inch.The distance between the top knuckle of the thumb to the tip of the thumb on an adult's hand is also about 1 inch long.






Other options may include a water bottle cap, a detachable pencil eraser, the width of a standard rubber eraser, the length of a paperclip, and the length of a standard small sewing pin.







, Place the edge you want to measure on a blank sheet of white paper. Use a pencil to trace the length of the edge from one end to the other.


The line you trace onto the paper should be the exact same length as the edge you want to measure. After tracing the edge, you can remove it from the paper.
Make sure that you use white or light colored paper so that you can clearly see the marks you make.







, Align one end of the measuring object to the start point of the line you traced. Mark the other end of the measuring object with a pencil.


For example, if you are using the width of a rubber eraser to estimate inches, place the width of the eraser flat and parallel against the line. One long side of the eraser should lie perpendicular and flush against the start point of the line. The other long side should lie perpendicular to the line, somewhere inside along the length of that line. Use a pencil to mark the position of the second long side as it falls out in comparison to the line.







, Move the measuring object over so that the starting edge now lies on the previous mark. As before, make another mark on the second edge of the measuring object.


Continue down the entire line in this manner until you reach the end.
Each time you shift the position of the measuring object, make sure that the measuring edge lies parallel to the line.

, After reaching the end of the line, remove the measuring object. Count the number of gaps in between your marks. This number is a rough estimate of the number of inches.


Count the spaces in between lines, not the lines themselves.
Make sure that you count the space before the first line and the space after the last line, as well.
If the space after the last line is significantly smaller than the rest, use your eye to judge how much shorter that line is and add that to your estimate. For instance, if the final space is half as long as the others, count it as half an inch.

Measure the angle.,

Identify a reflex angle.,
Get help.",How to Name an Angle2," If the angle’s measurement is not already given, you need to measure it  using a protractor. Angles are classified by their size, and so before you can classify the angle, you need to know its degree measurement.
, A right angle is created by two perpendicular lines or rays and is exactly 90 degrees. Right angles are often shown by a box in the corner of the angle., Acute angles are less than 90 degrees (that is, 0 to 89 degrees.)Many people remember the term for an acute angle, because these angles are small, and so you can say to yourself, “My, what a cute little angle!” There is no symbol that denotes an acute angle; the only way to know if an angle is acute is if you measure it, or if the measurement is given.

For example, ∠DEF{\displaystyle \angle DEF} measures 40 degrees. Since 40 is less than 90, it is an acute angle.


, Obtuse angles are between 90 and 180 degrees (that is, 91 to 179 degrees).You can remember the term for an obtuse angle by linking the word “obtuse” with “obese,” since obtuse angles are larger than acute and right angles. There is no symbol that denotes an obtuse angle.

For example, ∠IHJ{\displaystyle \angle IHJ} measures 125 degrees. Since 125 is between 90 and 180, it is an obtuse angle.


, A straight angle is a straight line. It measures exactly 180 degrees.Note that 180 is half of 360, which is the measurement of a complete turn, or circle. So a straight angle is an angle that is open exactly halfway.


, A reflex angle is an angle that is greater than 180 degrees.You need to be careful when identifying these types of angles, because they can look like acute or obtuse angles.

Think of an angle opening to a complete rotation. When it is open half way, it is a straight angle. If the angle opens beyond that, it is a reflex angle.

Take, for example, a right angle. A right angle really makes two angles. One is the 90 degree angle inside the square corner. However, if you think of the angle opening the opposite way, you can see that it could also makes a 270 degree angle.


, If you are struggling with angles, don't be afraid to ask your teacher for additional instruction. If your teacher is unavailable, he or she will likely have an anchor chart in the classroom that describes the type of angles and shows examples of them. If not, your textbook will explain these, and you can always look for more information online. If you still struggle with angles, you might need to find a tutor.

Some good online resources include Math is Funand Khan Academy.To find a tutor, speak to your school counselor. You can also find a tutor online through sites like WyzAntand Varsity Tutors."

Identify the basic measurements of a sphere.,
Use various measurements to find the radius.",How to Find the Radius of a Sphere2," The radius (r) is the distance from the exact center of the sphere to any point on the surface of the sphere. Generally speaking, you can find the radius of a sphere if you know the diameter, the circumference, the volume, or the surface area.



Diameter (D): the distance across the sphere – double the radius. Diameter is the length of a line through the center of the sphere: from one point on the outside of the sphere to a corresponding point directly across from it. in other words, the greatest possible distance between two points on the sphere.

Circumference (C): the one-dimensional distance around the sphere at its widest point. In other words, the perimeter of a spherical cross section whose plane passes through the center of the sphere.

Volume (V): the three-dimensional space contained inside the sphere. It is the ""space that the sphere takes up.""Surface Area (A): the two-dimensional area on the outside surface of the sphere. The amount of flat space that covers the outside of the sphere.

Pi (π): a constant that expresses the ratio of the circle's circumference to the circle's diameter. The first ten digits of Pi are always 3.141592653, although it is usually rounded to 3.14.

, You can use the diameter, circumference, volume, and surface area to calculate the radius of a sphere. You can also calculate each of these numbers if you know the length of the radius itself. Thus, in order to find the radius, try reversing the formulas for these components' calculations. Learn the formulas that use the radius to find diameter, circumference, volume, and surface area.



D = 2r. As with circles, the diameter of a sphere is twice the radius.

C = πD or 2πr. As with circles, the circumference of a sphere is equal to π times the diameter. Since the diameter is twice the radius, we can also say that the circumference is twice the radius times π.

V = (4/3)πr3. The volume of a sphere is the radius cubed (times itself twice), times π, times 4/3.A = 4πr2. The surface area of a sphere is the radius squared (times itself), times π, times 4. Since the area of a circle is πr2, it can also be said that the surface area of a sphere is four times the area of the circle formed by its circumference.

Know that, in general cases, r = √((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 + (z2 - z1)2).",How to Find the Radius of a Sphere3," One way to think of the radius of a sphere is as the distance between the point at the center of the sphere and any point on the surface of the sphere. Because this is true, if you know the coordinates of the point at the center of the sphere and of any point on the surface, you can find the radius of the sphere simply by calculating the distance between the two points with a variant of the basic distance formula. To begin, find the coordinates of the sphere's center point. Note that because spheres are three-dimensional, this will be an (x,y,z) point rather than an (x,y) point.


This process is easier to understand by following along with an example. For our purposes, let's say that we have a sphere centered around the (x,y,z) point (4, -1, 12). In the next few steps, we'll use this point to help find the radius.

, Next, you'll need to find the (x,y,z) coordinates of a point on the surface of the sphere. This can be any point on the surface of the sphere. Because the points on the surface of a sphere are equidistant from the center point by definition, any point will work for determining the radius.


For the purposes of our example problem, let's say that we know that the point (3, 3, 0) lies on the surface of the sphere. By calculating the distance between this point and the center point, we can find the radius.

, Now that you know the center of the sphere and a point on the surface, calculating the distance between the two will find the radius. Use the three-dimensional distance formula d = √((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 + (z2 - z1)2), where d equals distance, (x1,y1,z1) equals the coordinates of the center point, and (x2,y2,z2) equals the coordinates of the point on the surface to find the distance between the two points.


In our example, we would plug in (4, -1, 12) for (x1,y1,z1) and (3, 3, 0) for (x2,y2,z2), solving as follows:

d = √((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 + (z2 - z1)2)
d = √((3 - 4)2 + (3 - -1)2 + (0 - 12)2)
d = √((-1)2 + (4)2 + (-12)2)
d = √(1 + 16 + 144)
d = √(161)

d = 12.69. This is the radius of our sphere.



, In a sphere, every point on the surface of the sphere is the same distance from the center point. If we take the three-dimensional distance formula above and replace the ""d"" variable with the ""r"" variable for radius, we get a form of the equation that can can find the radius given any center point (x1,y1,z1) and any corresponding surface point (x2,y2,z2).


By squaring both sides of this equation, we get r2 = (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 + (z2 - z1)2. Note that this is essentially equal to the basic sphere equation r2 = x2 + y2 + z2 which assumes a center point of (0,0,0).

Recall the formula for the area of a triangle.,
Look at your triangle and determine which variables you know.,
Plug your values into the equation A=1/2bh and do the math.",How to Find the Height of a Triangle1," The formula for the area of a triangle is A=1/2bh.A = Area of the triangle

b = Length of the base of the triangle

h = Height of the base of the triangle;
, In this case, you already know the area, so assign that value to A. You should also know the value of one side length; assign that value to ""'b'"". If you do not know both the Area and the length of one side, you will need to try a different method.


Any side of a triangle can be the base, regardless of how the triangle is drawn. To visualize this, just imagine rotating the triangle until the known side length is at the bottom.
For example, if you know that the area of a triangle is 20, and one side is 4, then: A = 20 and b = 4.

, First multiply the base (b) by 1/2, then divide the area (A) by the product. The resulting value will be the height of your triangle!


In our example: 20 = 1/2(4)h
20 = 2h
10 = h

Solve the equation for h{\displaystyle h}.",How to Find The Height Of a Prism1," The volume for any prism can be found by using the formula V=Ah{\displaystyle V=Ah},where V{\displaystyle V} equals the volume of the prism, A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of one base, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the prism.

The base of a prism is one of its congruent sides. Since all opposite sides of a rectangular prism are congruent, any side can be used as the base, as long as you are consistent in your calculations.
;
, If you do not know the volume, you cannot use this method.

For example, if you know the volume of the prism is 64 cubic meters (m3{\displaystyle m^{3}}), then your formula will look like this:64=Ah{\displaystyle 64=Ah}


, To find the area, you need to know the length and width of the base (or of one side, if the base is a square). Use the formula A=lw{\displaystyle A=lw}. To find the area of a rectangle.

For example, if the base is a rectangle with a length of 8 meters and a width of 2 meters, to find the area you would calculate:A=(8)(2){\displaystyle A=(8)(2)}A=16m2{\displaystyle A=16m^{2}}


, Make sure you are substituting for the variable A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if you found the area of the base to be 16 square meters, then your formula will look like this:64=16h{\displaystyle 64=16h}


, This will give you the height of your prism.

For example, if your equation is 64=16h{\displaystyle 64=16h}, you would need to divide each side by 16 to find h{\displaystyle h}.Thus:6416=16h16{\displaystyle {\frac {64}{16}}={\frac {16h}{16}}}4=h{\displaystyle 4=h}So, the height of your rectangular prism would be 4 meters.

For example, if you have a trapezoid with a top base of 2 cm, a bottom base of 3 cm, and two side lengths of 1 cm, your formula will look like this:P=2+3+1+1{\displaystyle P=2+3+1+1}


, This will give you the perimeter of your trapezoid.

For example:P=2+3+1+1{\displaystyle P=2+3+1+1}P=7{\displaystyle P=7}So, the perimeter of the trapezoid is 7 cm.

Find and add the lengths of all the polygon's sides.,
Multiply the lengths of equal sides by the number of equal sides.,
Multiply a regular polygon's side length by the number of sides.,
Alternatively, use the area and apothem of a regular polygon to find its perimeter.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Polygon," The perimeter of any polygon can be calculated by finding the length of each side individually, then adding all of these lengths together. This is the most straightforward way to find a polygon's perimeter and, in shapes where no two of the sides are equal, it is usually the only accurate way to do so.


As a simple example, an irregular polygon with side lengths of 5, 5, 4, 3, and 3, would have a perimeter of 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 20

If one or more of the side lengths in your polygon is unknown, the process of calculating the perimeter can become difficult and may require more advanced knowledge of geometry. For instance, if your polygon is a right triangle (or can be divided into right triangles, trigonometry can be a useful tool for finding the lengths of unknown sides which are are preventing you from finding the perimeter of the shape itself.;
, Certain types of polygons have two or more equal sides. For instance, isosceles triangles and isosceles trapezoids have 2 of the sides of the same length, while parallelograms and rectangles have 2 pairs of opposing sides with equal length. In these cases, when if you know the length of one of the identical sides, you can multiply this length by the number of sides which share this length, then add the lengths of any unequal sides to find the perimeter of the overall shape.


For example, let's consider an isosceles triangle that has two sides with a length of 5 inches (12.7 cm) and one side with a length of 4 inches (10.2 cm). Here, to find the perimeter, we would take the length of the equal sides (5) and multiply it by the number of equal sides (2), then add the lengths of the remaining unequal side. (5 × 2) + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 inches (35.6 cm).
As an example of a shape with multiple pairs of equal sides, let's consider a parallelogram with 2 sides with a length of 5 inches (12.7 cm) and 2 with a length of 4. To find the perimeter, we would multiply the length of the longer side by 2 and the length of the shorter side by, then add the products together. (2 × 5) + (2 × 4) = 10 + 8 = 18 inches (45.7 cm).
Note that this method can also be used for squares and rhombuses, which, along with rectangles, are special cases of parallelograms.

, Polygons whose sides are all equal in length and whose angles are all the same size are called regular polygons. For example, squares and equilateral triangles are regular polygons, as are perfect pentagons (as exemplified by the Chrysler logo) and octagons (as exemplified by stop signs). If a shape is a regular polygon, finding its perimeter is a simple matter of multiplying the length of one side by the number of sides in the shape.


For example, the perimeter of a perfect square with a side length of 4 inches (10.2 cm) is 4 × 4 (because a square has 4 sides), or 16 inches (40.6 cm), while the perimeter of an equilateral triangle with a side length of 4 inches (10.2 cm) is 4 × 3, or 12 inches (30.5 cm).
This same basic process also works for non-regular polygons whose sides all have equal lengths. For instance, although a rhombus is not a regular polygon because its angles are not all the same size, you can find its perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by the number of sides because all 4 of its sides are the same length.

, Though simply multiplying the length of one of a regular polygon's sides by the number of sides in the polygon is the easiest way to find its perimeter, it's not the only way. The distance from the center of the polygon to the exact middle of one of its sides, called the apothem, is part of an equation that allows you to find its perimeter, provided you also know the polygon's area. Inserting known values for area and apothem into the equation (Area) = (Perimeter) × (Apothem)/2 allows you to solve for the polygon's area using simple algebra.


For example, the square with a side length of 4 inches (10.2 cm) in the above example has an area of 16 inches2 and an apothem of 2 inches (5.1 cm). Using our new equation, we solve for perimeter as follows:

16 = (perimeter) × 2/2
16 = (perimeter) × 1
16 = perimeter. The square's perimeter is 16 inches (40.6 cm) - this is the same answer that we got above with the standard method.

Write down the basic formula for finding the perimeter of a rectangle.,

Add the length and width.After you identify your length and width, you want to plug them into the “l” and “w” slots in the perimeter equation.,
Multiply the sum of the length and width by two.,
Add l + l + w + w. Instead of adding two sides of your rectangle and multiplying by two, you can simply add all four sides together directly to find the perimeter of your rectangle.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Rectangle1," This formula will help guide you as you calculate the perimeter of your own rectangle. The basic formula is: P = 2 * (l + w).Perimeter is always the total distance around the outside edge of any shape, whether it is simple or compound.
In this equation, P stands for “perimeter,” l refers to the length of the rectangle, and w refers to the width of the rectangle.
Length always has a greater value than width.
Because opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, both lengths will be the same and both widths will be the same. This is why you write the equation as a multiplication of the sum of the length and width by 2.
You can also write the equation as P = l + l + w + w to make this very clear.;
, For a basic math problem at school, the length and width of the rectangle will be provided in the problem. These are usually next to the figure of the rectangle.


If you are calculating the perimeter of a rectangle in real life, use a ruler, yardstick, or tape measure to find the length and width of the area that you are trying to measure. If you’re measuring outdoors, measure all sides to see if the opposites are truly congruent.
For example, l = 14 centimeter (5.5 in), w = 8 centimeter (3.1 in).

,


When you are working out your perimeter equations, note that according to the order of operations, mathematical expressions contained inside brackets or parentheses are solved before those outside of the parentheses.So, you’ll begin solving your equation by adding the length and width.
For example, P = 2 * (l + w) = 2 * (14 + 8) = 2 * (22).

, When you’re looking the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, the “(l + w)” is multiplied by two. Once you’ve completed this multiplication, you have the perimeter of your rectangle.


This multiplication takes into account the other two sides of your rectangle. When you added together the width and length, you only added together two sides of the shape.
Since the other two sides of the rectangle are equal to the two already added together, you can simply multiply this measurement by two in order to find the total sum of all four sides.
For example, P = 2 * (l + w) = 2 * (14 + 8) = 2 * (22) = 44 centimeter (17.3 in).

,


If you struggle with the concept of perimeter, this is a great place to start.
For example, P = l + l + w + w = 14 + 14 + 8 + 8 = 44 centimeter (17.3 in).

If you cut an equilateral triangle in half, you will end up with two congruent right triangles. In this example, we will be using an equilateral triangle with side lengths of 8.

, The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right triangle with sides of length a and b, and hypotenuse of length c: a2 + b2 = c2. We can use this theorem to find the height of our equilateral triangle!, Side a will be equal to 1/2 the side length, and side b is the height of the triangle that we need to solve.


Using our example equilateral triangle with sides of 8, c = 8 and a = 4.

, First square c and a by multiplying each number by itself. Then subtract a2 from c2.


42 + b2 = 82

16 + b2 = 64
b2 = 48

, Use the square root function on your calculator to find Sqrt(2. The answer is the height of your equilateral triangle!


b = Sqrt (48) = 6.93

Determine what variables you know.,
Use Heron's formula if you have all three sides.,
Use the area given two sides and an angle formula if you have a side and an angle.",How to Find the Height of a Triangle3," The height of a triangle can be found if you have an angles and a side, if the angle is between the base and the side you have, or all three sides. We'll call the sides of the triangle a, b, and c, and the angles, A, B, and C.


If you have all three sides, you'll use Heron's formula, and the formula for the area of a triangle.
If you have two sides and an angle, you'll use the formula for the area given two angles and a side. A = 1/2ab(sin C)., Heron's formula has two parts. First, you must find the variable s, which is equal to half of the perimeter of the triangle. This is done with this formula: s = (a+b+c)/2.So for a triangle with sides a = 4, b = 3, and c = 5, s = (4+3+5)/2. Which is s = (12)/2. Which is s = 6.
Then you can use the second part of Heron's formula, Area = sqr(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c). Replace Area in the equation with it's equivalent in the area formula: 1/2bh (or 1/2ah or 1/2ch).
Do the math to solve for h. For our example triangle this looks like 1/2(3)h = sqr(6(6-4)(6-3)(6-5). Which is 3/2h = sqr(6(2)(3)(1). Which is 3/2h = sqr(36). Use a calculator to calculate the square root, which in this case makes it 3/2h = 6. Therefore, height is equal to 4, using side b as the base.

, Replace area in the formula with it's equivalent in the area of a triangle formula: 1/2bh. This gives you a formula that looks like 1/2bh = 1/2ab(sin C). This can be simplified to h = a(sin C), thereby eliminating one of the side variables.Solve the equation with your given variables. For example, with a = 3, and C = 40 degrees, the equation looks like this: h = 3(sin 40). Use your calculator to finish the equation, which in our example, makes h roughly 1.928.

The base of a prism is one of its congruent sides. The base of a triangular prism will be a triangle. The sides will be rectangles.


, If you do not know the volume, you cannot use this method.

For example, if you know the volume of the prism is 840 cubic meters (m3{\displaystyle m^{3}}), then your formula will look like this:840=Ah{\displaystyle 840=Ah}


, To find the area, you need to know the length of the triangle’s base and the height of the triangle. Use the formula A=12(b)(h){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(b)(h)} to find the area of a triangle.

Alternatively, if you know the length of all three sides of a triangle, you can find the area using Heron’s formula. Read Calculate the Area of a Triangle for complete instructions.

For example, if the base of the triangle is 12 meters, and the height of the triangle is 7 meters, to find the area you would calculate:A=12(12)(7){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(12)(7)}A=12(84){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(84)}A=42{\displaystyle A=42}


, Make sure you are substituting for the variable A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if you found the area of the base to be 42 square meters, then your formula will look like this:840=42h{\displaystyle 840=42h}


, This will give you the height of your prism.

For example, if your equation is 840=42h{\displaystyle 840=42h}, you would need to divide each side by 42 to find h{\displaystyle h}.Thus:84042=42h42{\displaystyle {\frac {840}{42}}={\frac {42h}{42}}}20=h{\displaystyle 20=h}

So, the height of your triangular prism would be 20 meters.

, To find the perimeter of a rectangle, add up the length of all four sides, or, for a square, multiply the length of one side by 4.

Remember that opposite sides of a rectangle have the same length. For example, if the base is a rectangle with a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 2 centimeters, to find the perimeter you would calculate:P=8+2+8+2{\displaystyle P=8+2+8+2}P=20{\displaystyle P=20}


, Make sure you are substituting for the letter P{\displaystyle P}.

For example, if you found the perimeter of the base to be 20, your formula will look like this:1460=32+20h{\displaystyle 1460=32+20h}


, This will give you the height of your prism.

For example, if your equation is 1460=32+20h{\displaystyle 1460=32+20h}, you would first need to subtract 32 from each side, then divide each side by 20.

Add up all the side lengths of the trapezoid.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Trapezoid2," To do this, draw the height from both top vertices.

If you cannot form two right triangles because one side of the trapezoid is perpendicular to the base, just note that this side will have the same measurement as the height, and divide the trapezoid into one rectangle and one right triangle.


, Since these are opposite sides of a rectangle, they will be the same length.For example, if you have a trapezoid with a height of 6 cm, you should draw a line from each top vertex extending down to the bottom base. Label each line 6 cm. 


, (This is the bottom side of the rectangle.) The length will equal the length of the top base (the top side of the rectangle), because opposite sides of a rectangle are of equal length.If you do not know the length of the top base, you cannot use this method.

For example, if the top base of the trapezoid is 6 cm, then the middle section of the bottom base is also 6 cm.


, The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle (the side opposite the right angle), a{\displaystyle a} is the height of the right triangle, and b{\displaystyle b} is the length of the base of the triangle., Make sure you plug in the side length of the trapezoid for c{\displaystyle c}. Plug in the height of the trapezoid for a{\displaystyle a}.

For example, if you know the height of the trapezoid is 6 cm, and the length of the side (hypotenuse) is 9 cm, your equation will look like this:62+b2=92{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=9^{2}}


, Then, subtract to isolate the b{\displaystyle b} variable.

For example, if the equation is 62+b2=92{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=9^{2}}, you would square 6 and 9, then subtract the square of 6 from the square of 9:62+b2=92{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=9^{2}}36+b2=81{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=81}b2=45{\displaystyle b^{2}=45}


, (For complete instructions on how to simplify square roots, you can read Simplify a Square Root.) The result will give you the value of the missing base of your first right triangle. Label this length on the base of your triangle.

For example:b2=45{\displaystyle b^{2}=45}b=45{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {45}}}b=45{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {45}}}b=35{\displaystyle b=3{\sqrt {5}}}So, you should label 35{\displaystyle 3{\sqrt {5}}} on the base of your first triangle.


, To do this, set up the Pythagorean Theorem formula for the second triangle, and follow the steps to find the length of the missing side. If you are working with an isosceles trapezoid, which is a trapezoid in which the two non-parallel sides are the same length,the two right triangles are congruent, so you can simply carry the value from the first triangle over to the second triangle.

For example, if the second side of the trapezoid is 7 cm, you would calculate:a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}62+b2=72{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=7^{2}}36+b2=49{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=49}b2=13{\displaystyle b^{2}=13}b=13{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {13}}}So, you should label 13{\displaystyle {\sqrt {13}}} on the base of your second triangle.


, The perimeter of any polygon is the sum of all sides: P=T+B+L+R{\displaystyle P=T+B+L+R}. For the bottom base, you will add the bottom side of the rectangle, plus the bases of the two triangles. You will likely have square roots in your answer. For complete instructions on how to add square roots, you can read the article Add Square Roots. You can also use a calculator to convert the square roots to decimals.

For example, 6+(6+35+13)+9+7=28+35+13{\displaystyle 6+(6+3{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {13}})+9+7=28+3{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {13}}}Converting the square roots to decimals, you have 6+(6+6.708+3.606)+9+7=38.314{\displaystyle 6+(6+6.708+3.606)+9+7=38.314}So, the approximate perimeter of your trapezoid is 38.314 cm.

, (This is the bottom side of the rectangle.) This length will be equal to the length of the top base, because opposite sides of a rectangle are of equal length.For example, if the top base of the trapezoid is 6 cm, then the middle section of the bottom base is also 6 cm.


, The ratio is sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}, where θ{\displaystyle \theta } is the measure of the interior angle, opposite{\displaystyle {\text{opposite}}} is the height of the triangle, and hypotenuse{\displaystyle {\text{hypotenuse}}} is the length of the hypotenuse.

Using this ratio will allow you to find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle, which is also the trapezoid's first side length.

The hypotenuse is the side across from the 90 degree angle of a right triangle.


, Make sure you use the height of the triangle as the length of the opposite side in the formula. You will solve for H.

For example, if the given interior angle is 35 degrees, and the height of the triangle is 6 cm, your formula will look like this:sin⁡(35)=6H{\displaystyle \sin(35)={\frac {6}{H}}}


, Do this by using the SIN button on a scientific calculator. Plug this value into the ratio.

For example, by using a calculator you will find that the sine of a 35 degree angle is .5738 (rounded). So your formula will now be:.5738=6H{\displaystyle .5738={\frac {6}{H}}}


, Or, you can simply divide the height of the triangle by the angle sine.

For example:.5738=6H{\displaystyle .5738={\frac {6}{H}}}.5738H=6{\displaystyle .5738H=6}.5738H.5738=6.5738{\displaystyle {\frac {.5738H}{.5738}}={\frac {6}{.5738}}}H=10.4566{\displaystyle H=10.4566}So, the length of the hypotenuse, and the first missing side of the trapezoid, is about 10.4566 cm.


, Set up the sine ratio (sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}) for the second given interior angle. This will give you the length of the hypotenuse, which is also the first side of the trapezoid.

For example, if the given interior angle is 45 degrees, you would calculate:sin⁡(45)=6H{\displaystyle \sin(45)={\frac {6}{H}}}.7071=6H{\displaystyle .7071={\frac {6}{H}}}.7071H=6{\displaystyle .7071H=6}.7071H.7071=6.7071{\displaystyle {\frac {.7071H}{.7071}}={\frac {6}{.7071}}}H=8.4854{\displaystyle H=8.4854}So, the length of the hypotenuse, and the second missing side of the trapezoid, is about 8.4854 cm.


, The Pythagorean Theorem formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where the length of the hypotenuse is c{\displaystyle c}, and the height of the triangle is a{\displaystyle a}.
, Make sure you plug in the hypotenuse length for c{\displaystyle c} and the height for a{\displaystyle a}.

For example, if the first right triangle has a hypotenuse of 10.4566, and a height of 6, your formula will be:62+b2=10.45662{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10.4566^{2}} 


, This will give you the length of base of the first right triangle, and the first missing section of the trapezoid’s bottom base.

For example:62+b2=10.45662{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10.4566^{2}}36+b2=109.3405{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=109.3405}b2=109.3405−36{\displaystyle b^{2}=109.3405-36}b2=73.3405{\displaystyle b^{2}=73.3405}b2=73.3405{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {73.3405}}}b=8.5639{\displaystyle b=8.5639}So, the base of the triangle, and the first missing section of the bottom base of the trapezoid, is about 8.5639 cm.


, Use the Pythagorean Theorem formula (a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}) to do this. Plug in the length of the hypotenuse for c{\displaystyle c}, and the height for a{\displaystyle a}. Solving for b{\displaystyle b} will give you the length of the second missing section of the trapezoid’s bottom base.

For example, if the second right triangle has a hypotenuse of 8.4854, and a height of 6, you would calculate:62+b2=8.48542{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=8.4854^{2}}36+b2=72{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=72}b2=72−36{\displaystyle b^{2}=72-36}b2=36{\displaystyle b^{2}=36}b2=36{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {36}}}b=6{\displaystyle b=6}So, the base of the second triangle, and the second missing section of the bottom base of the trapezoid, is 6 cm.


, The perimeter of any polygon is the sum of all sides: P=T+B+L+R{\displaystyle P=T+B+L+R}. For the bottom base, you will add the bottom side of the rectangle, plus the bases of the two triangles.

For example, 6+(8.5639+6+6)+10.4566+8.4854=45.5059{\displaystyle 6+(8.5639+6+6)+10.4566+8.4854=45.5059}So, the approximate perimeter of your trapezoid is 45.5059 cm.

Write down the formula for area and the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.Even though you already know the area of the rectangle in this problem, you will still need to use the area formula to find missing information.,
Divide the total area by the side measurement you know.,
Add the length and width.,
Multiply the sum of the length and width by two.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Rectangle2,"


The area of a rectangle is a measurement of the two-dimensional space within the rectangle, or the number of square units within the rectangle.The formula used to find the area of a rectangle is A = l * w.
The formula used to find the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2 * (l + w)

In the above formulas, A stands for “area,” P stands for “perimeter,” l refers to the length of the rectangle, and w refers to the width of the rectangle.

, This will allow you to find the measurement of the missing side of your rectangle, whether it is the length or the width. Finding this missing piece of information will then allow you to calculate perimeter.


Because you multiply the length and width together to find the area, dividing the area by the width will give you the length. Likewise, dividing the area by the length will give you the width.
For example, A = 112 centimeter (44.1 in) squared, l = 14 centimeter (5.5 in)

A = l * w
112 = 14 * w
112/14 = w
8 = w



, Now that you have measurements for both the length and width, you can plug them into the formula for rectangular perimeter.


In this problem, you add length and width together first because this part of the equation occurs in parentheses.
According to the order of operations, you always do the part of the equation in parentheses first., Once you’ve added the length and width of your rectangle together, you can find its perimeter by multiplying by two. This takes into account the additional two sides of your rectangle.


You are able to find the perimeter of the rectangle by adding length and width and multiplying by two because the opposite sides of a rectangle are equal in length.
Both lengths of the rectangle are the same, and both widths are the same.
For example, P = 2 * (14 + 8) = 2 * (22) = 44 centimeter (17.3 in).

Write down the basic formula for perimeter.Perimeter is the sum total of all outer sides of any given shape, including irregular and compound shapes.,
Find the measurement of each side.,
Add all the sides together.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Rectangle3,"


A standard rectangle has four sides. The two sides composing the length are equal to each other, and the two sides composing the width are equal to each other. Therefore, the perimeter is the sum of those four sides.
A compound rectangle has at least six sides. Think of a capital “L” or “T” shape. The top “branch” can be separated into one rectangle and the bottom “bar” can be separated into another. The perimeter of this shape, however, does not rely on breaking up the compound rectangle into two separate rectangles. Instead, the perimeter is simply: P = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6.
Each “s” represents a different side of your compound rectangle.

, In a standard educational math problem, the measurement of all sides should be provided.


This example uses the abbreviations L, W, l1, l2, w1, and w2. The uppercase L and W stand for the full lengths and widths of the shape. The lowercase ls and ws stand for the smaller lengths and widths.
As such, the formula P = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 equals P = L + W + l1 + l2 + w1 + w2.
Variables, like “w” or “l” are simply placeholders for unknown numeric values.Example: L = 14 centimeter (5.5 in), W = 10 centimeter (3.9 in), l1 = 5 centimeter (2.0 in), l2 = 9 centimeter (3.5 in), w1 = 4 centimeter (1.6 in), w2 = 6 centimeter (2.4 in)

Note that l1 and l2 will equal L. Similarly, w1 and w2 will equal W.



, By plugging the numeric values of the sides into your equations, you’ll be able to find the perimeter of your compound shape.


P = L + W + l1 + l2 + w1 + w2 = 14 + 10 + 5 + 9 + 4 + 6 = 48 centimeter (18.9 in)

Organize the information you do have.,
Use the measurements you have to find the missing side measurements.,
Add your sides together.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Rectangle4," You can still find the perimeter of a compound rectangle as long as you have at least one full length or full width and at least three of the minor width or length measurements.For an “L”-shaped compound rectangle, use the formula P = L + W + l1 + l2 + w1 + w2

In this formula, P stands for “perimeter.” The uppercase L and W stand for the full lengths and widths of the entire compound shape. The lowercase ls and ws stand for the smaller lengths and widths in the compound shape.
Example: L = 14 centimeter (5.5 in), l1 = 5 centimeter (2.0 in), w1 = 4 centimeter (1.6 in), w2 = 6 centimeter (2.4 in); missing: W, l2

, In this example, the full length, L, will be equal to the sum of l1 and l2. Likewise, the full width, W, will be equal to the sum of w1 and w2. Using this knowledge, add and subtract the measurements you do have to find the two missing measurements.


Example: L = l1 + l2; W = w1 + w2

L = l1 + l2
14 = 5 + l2
14 – 5 = l2
9 = l2
W = w1 + w2
W = 4 + 6
W = 10



, Once you have subtracted to find your missing measurements, you can add all of your sides together to find the perimeter of the compound rectangle. Now, you’ll use the original perimeter formula.


P = L + W + l1 + l2 + w1 + w2 = 14 + 10 + 5 + 9 + 4 + 6 = 48 centimeter (18.9 in)

Determine the shape you want to measure.,
Draw a rectangle on a piece of paper.,
Find the length of one side of your rectangle.,
Find the width of one side of your rectangle.,
Write down the correct measurements on the opposing sides of your rectangle.,
Add all your sides together.,
Adjust your approach for different shapes.,
Determine the dimensions of your shape.,
Understand the true meaning of area.,
Multiply the length of your rectangle by the width.,
Change your formula according to shape.",How to Find Area and Perimeter," Perimeter is the outside boundary around a closed geometric figure, and different shapes will require different approaches. If the shape that you want to find the perimeter of is not a closed shape, the perimeter cannot be taken.


If this is the first time you are calculating perimeter, try a rectangle or a square. These regular shapes will make finding the perimeter easier.;
, You will use this rectangle as a practice shape and will find its perimeter. Make sure that the opposite sides of your rectangle are the same length., You can do this with a ruler, measuring tape, or by making up your own example. Write down this number by the side it represents so you don't forget its length. As a guided example, imagine that the length of one side of your rectangle is 3 feet.


For small shapes you may want to use centimeters or inches, while feet, meters or miles will work better for larger perimeters.
Since the opposite sides of rectangles are equal, you will only have to measure one of each set of opposing sides., You can measure the width with a ruler, measuring tape, or by creating your own example. Write down the value for your width next to the horizontal side of your rectangle it represents.


Continuing with the guided example, imagine that in addition to a length of 3 feet, that the width of your rectangle is 5 feet.

, Rectangles have four sides, but the length of opposite sides will be the same.This is also true for your rectangle's width. Add the length and width used in the guided example (3 feet and 5 feet respectively) to the opposite sides of your rectangle.

, One a piece of scratch paper, or on the paper you have written the guided example, write: length + length + width + width.


So, for the guided example, you would add 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 to get a perimeter of 16 feet (4.9 m).You can also use the formula 2(length + width) for rectangles, since the length and width values are doubled. In our example you would multiply 2 by 8 to get 16 feet (4.9 m).

, Unfortunately, different shapes will require different formula for you to solve for perimeter. In real life examples, you can measure the outside boundary of any closed geometric shape to find its perimeter measurement. But you can also use the following formulas to find the perimeters of other common shapes:


Square: length of any side x 4
Triangle: side 1 + side 2 + side 3
Irregular polygon: add all sides
Circle: 2 x π x radius OR π x diameter.The π symbol stands for Pi (pronounced like pie). If you have a π key on your calculator, you can use it to be more accurate when using this formula. If not, you can approximate the value of π as 3.14.The term ""radius"" refers to the distance between the center of a circle and its outside boundary (perimeter), while ""diameter"" refers to the length between any two opposite points on the perimeter of a circle that pass through the circle's center., Draw a rectangle or use the same rectangle you drew while finding perimeter. In this guided example, you will be using the height and the width of your rectangle to find the area.


You can use a ruler, measuring tape, or come up with your own example. For the purposes of this guided example, the length and width will be the same as the previous example used to find perimeter: 3 and 5, respectively.

, Finding the area inside a perimeter is like dividing that empty space inside your shape into 1 unit by 1 unit squares. The area can be smaller or larger than the perimeter depending on the shape.


You can divide your diagram into one-unit (feet, cm, miles) segments vertically and horizontally if you want to visualize how the area measurement will look.

, For the guided example, you will multiply 3 by 5 to get an area of 15 square feet. The unit of measure for area should always be written in square units (square miles, square yards, etc.).


You can write the ""square units/units squared"" notation shorthand as:

Feet²/ft²
Miles²/mi²
Kilometers²/km²



, Unfortunately, different geometric shapes will require you to take a different approach to solve for area. You can use the following formulas for finding the area of some common shapes:


Parallelogram: base x height
Square: side 1 x side 2
Triangle: ½ x base x height.

Some mathematicians use the notation: A=½bh.


Circle: π x radius²

The term ""radius"" refers to the distance between the center of a circle and its outside boundary (perimeter), and the raised two (referred to as the ""squared"" notation) indicates that the value being squared must be multiplied by itself."

Draw a circle with the compass.,
Draw a second circle whose center is the edge of the first circle.,
Use the intersection of the first and second circle to draw a third circle.,
Draw a fourth circle using the intersection of the main circle and the third circle.,
Draw three more circles using the next intersection of each circle.,
Use a ruler to draw a straight line through the center of the circle.,
Draw another straight line one flower petal (or 60 degrees) clockwise from the first.,
Draw your final straight line one more flower petal (or 60 degrees) clockwise from the last.",How to Divide a Circle Into 6 Equal Parts1," Align the pencil tip with the tip of the needle. Place the point of the compass down on the paper. Set the distance between the pencil and needle equal to the radius of the circle that you would like and draw. Swing the compass around 360° to complete the circle.Make sure the hinge is tight so it doesn’t slip while drawing.
Also make sure the pencil is securely in its holder so it also doesn’t move while drawing.
This first circle is the main circle that you will be dividing.;
, Place the needle of the compass at any point along the edge of the main circle. Keep the distance between the needle and pencil the same as the first circle. Swing the compass around to complete the second circle.The second circle should overlap with the first circle and the edge should cross through the center of the first circle.
If the distance between the needle and the pencil changes at all, the circle will not be divided equally.

, Place the needle at the intersection of the first and second circle. There are two intersections and you can use either one; this will be the center of a third circle. Use the compass to complete the third circle.Again, keep the compass at the same distance for every circle you draw.
At this point you should have three overlapping circles. You should notice that the two outer circles overlap with the center of the first main circle.

, Just as you did to draw the second and third circle, use the intersection of the third circle with the main circle as the center point. Remember, going clockwise around the circle, you will use the intersection to the left of the circle. Place the compass on that intersection and draw a fourth circle.You are halfway done with drawing circles.

, Using the intersection of the previously drawn circle with the main circle as the center, draw the next circle. Continue the next three circles until you have a total of six circles all around the main circle.The inside of your original circle should now look like a 6 petaled flower.

, This is the first of three lines you will need to draw to divide the circle into 6 parts. Every line, including this one, should cross the exact center of the circle and divide two of the six inner ""flower petals"" of your drawing in half.

, This line will bisect two opposite flower petals and will go through the exact center of the circle., You now have a circle divided into 6 equal parts.

Set up the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.,
Plug the width and height into the formula.,
Add the length and width, and multiply by 2.,
Use the formula P=4x{\displaystyle P=4x} to find the perimeter of a square.,
Find the perimeter given other information.",How to Find Perimeter1," The formula is P=2(w+h){\displaystyle P=2(w+h)}, where P{\displaystyle P}  equals the perimeter of the rectangle, w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the triangle.If you don’t know the length of the width and height of the rectangle, you cannot use this formula.

You can also use the formula P=a+b+c+d{\displaystyle P=a+b+c+d}, where each variable is equal to the length of one side of the rectangle.
;
, Due to the commutative property, it doesn’t matter which measurement you use for the width, and which you use for the height. The width and height are two adjacent sides. If the rectangle is not a square, these to side lengths must be different.

For example, if a rectangle has a width of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm, your formula will look like this: P=2(5+10){\displaystyle P=2(5+10)}.


, Make sure you follow the order of operations and complete the calculation in parentheses before multiplying. The resulting value will give you the perimeter of your rectangle.

For example:P=2(5+10){\displaystyle P=2(5+10)}P=2(15){\displaystyle P=2(15)}P=30{\displaystyle P=30}So, the perimeter of the rectangle is 30 cm.


, In this formula x{\displaystyle x} is equal to the length of one side of the square. A square has 4 equal sides, so to find its perimeter, you only need to multiply the length of one side by 4.For example, if a square has one side that is 3 cm long, to find the perimeter, you would calculate P=4(3)=12{\displaystyle P=4(3)=12}. So, the perimeter is 12 cm.


, Often you will not be given the length of all sides, or even the length of any side. It still may be possible to  find the perimeter of a rectangle.

If you know the area of the rectangle, and the length of one side, you can find the perimeter by finding the missing width or height using the area formula. Set up the formula A=wh{\displaystyle A=wh}.Plug in the values you know, then solve for the missing variable. Now you know the length and width, so you can use the perimeter formula.

If you know one side length and the length of the diagonal, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side length. Set up the formula a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}. Substitute the length of the diagonal for c{\displaystyle c}, and the side length for a{\displaystyle a}. Solve for b{\displaystyle b}. Now you know the length and width, so you can use the perimeter formula."

Draw a straight line.,
Span the segment with your compass.,
Trace a quarter-circle arc.,
Switch the compass around.,
Draw a second arc.,
Mark the point where the two arcs cross.,
Finish the triangle.",How to Draw an Equilateral Triangle1," Lay your ruler on the paper, then trace a pencil along the straight edge. This line segment will form one side of your equilateral triangle, which means that you will need to draw two more lines of exactly the same length, each reaching toward a point at a 60° angle from the first line. Make sure that you have plenty of room to draw all three sides!, Slide a pencil into your compass, and make sure that it's sharp! Put the point of your compass at one end of the segment, and set the pencil point at the other.

, Do not adjust the point of the compass, and do not change the set ""width"" of the tool from the compass point to the pencil point. Swing the pencil-point of the compass in a quarter-circle up and away from the line segment., Without changing the width of the compass spread, move the point of the compass to the other end.

, Carefully swing the pencil-point of the compass so that the new arc crosses over the first arc that you drew.

, This is the apex (the ""top"" point) of your triangle. It should lie at the exact center of the line segment that you've drawn. You can now draw two straight lines leading to this point: one from each end of the ""bottom"" line segment., Use a ruler to draw two more straight line segments: the remaining sides of the triangle. Connect each end of the original line segment to the point at which the arcs cross. Make sure that the lines are straight. To finish the job, erase the arcs that you drew so that only the triangle remains!Consider tracing this triangle onto another page. This way, you can start fresh with a clean shape.
If you need a bigger or a smaller triangle, repeat the process but adjust the length of the original line segment. The longer the sides, the bigger the triangle!

Get an idea of what polygon you want to draw.,
Figure out if you want/need to construct a regular polygon.",How to Draw a Polygon1," There are many different types of polygons. Polygons are usually classified by the number of sides they have.For example, a pentagon has five sides, a hexagon has six, and an octagon has eight. Mathematicians use the term ""n-gon"" to refer to a polygon with ""n"" sides. There is no end to the number of sides a polygon can have, and a polygon can be a simple polygon, meaning that its sides don't cross one another, or a star polygon, meaning that they do., A regular polygon is one where all the angles are equal in measure and all the sides are equal in length. While most people may think of polygons in this way, not all polygons are regular. Drawing a regular polygon is more challenging than drawing any old polygon; if you want to make one along these lines, you can learn more at How to Construct Regular Polygons Using a Circle

Draw your square.,
Find the center of the square.,
Divide the square by drawing lines through the midsection.",How to Divide a Square Into Eight Equal Parts1," Draw a square with four equal sides. You can use a ruler to measure each side equally. If you are working off a square that your teacher gave you, you can skip this step.


It is helpful to draw this square in pencil in case you make a mistake and need to start over.;
, To find the center, lightly draw a diagonal line from the left upper corner of the square to the opposite lower right corner (it helps to use a ruler and pencil to do this). Draw another diagonal line from the upper right corner to the opposite lower left corner. Both diagonal lines should interest at one point. This point is the center of the square that will be the key to dividing all the sides of your square equally.


Notice that you have already created four triangles.

, Draw a vertical (meaning from top to bottom) line crossing the midsection (or the center) of the square. Next, draw a horizontal (meaning side to side) line through the midsection. Doing this should divide the square into 8 equal triangles.


If you want to, you can go over all of the lines you have made with a ruler and pen, so that the lines stand out against the paper.

Gather your tools.,
Check the instructions for your math problem.,
Draw a line using the ruler.,
Mark the length of one side.,
Position your protractor.,
Measure the angle.,
Draw the next side of the parallelogram.,
Repeat for the next side.,
Connect the two upper corners.",How to Draw a Parallelogram1," You'll need a ruler and a protractor to draw a parallelogram with specific side lengths and angles. If you don't have a protractor, you can print one out from an online picture, or make your own out of paper.;
, The steps below tell you how to make a parallelogram with certain side lengths and angles. If your problem only tells you an angle, or only one length instead of two, the rest is up to you. For example, if a step below tells you to draw a line of the specified length, and the problem you are following doesn't mention a specific length, just draw the line as long as you like.

, Put your ruler flat against the paper and draw a line across its edge with your pencil. Make this a long line, but don't bother measuring it yet. A longer line will make some of the later steps easier.

, Move the ruler to the center of the line. If your parallelogram is supposed to be 10 centimeters (4 inches) long, make two pencil marks, next to the 0 line and the 10 cm line on the ruler. These mark the two lower corners of your parallelogram.

, Put the protractor down so the flat side is along the line (this is where a longer line will help guide you). Move it from side to side so the dot in the center of the protractor is over the left pencil mark that represents a corner of the parallelogram.

, The edge of the protractor is labeled with numbers from 0 to 180. These are the degrees in the angle. If you are trying to draw a parallelogram with a 75º angle, find the line labeled 75, or estimate where the line would be halfway between the 70 mark and the 80 mark. Draw a pencil line at the edge of the protractor, continuing the line you found.


If your protractor has two sets of numbers, use the one that has ""0"" on the line between your two pencil marks.
If your protractor has one set of numbers and the line between your pencil marks is labeled ""180,"" move the protractor to the right pencil mark instead and count from there.

, Move the protractor out of the way and arrange your ruler between the corner where the protractor was placed, and the pencil mark you just drew using the protractor. Connect these two marks by running your pencil along the ruler edge. Measure the length this side is supposed to be with the ""0"" of the ruler on the lower pencil mark. Make yet another pencil mark to show where the side ends.

, The left and right sides of a parallelogram are always parallel, meaning they are at the same angle. Position the protractor on the other corner of the parallelogram, and mark the same angle using the method described above. When you have both the left and right sides drawn, they should be parallel to each other and exactly the same length.

, Position your ruler between the two top corners of the parallelogram, where the left and right sides end. Draw a straight line between them, and your parallelogram is finished.

Set a compass to the width of the side length.,
Draw the center point of the hexagon.,
Draw a circle around the center point.,
Mark the six vertices of the hexagon.,
Draw a line connecting each vertex.",How to Divide a Hexagon Into Three Equal Parts," If the center is not marked, you can locate it using a straightedge. Draw a line (diagonal), connecting any vertex to the opposite vertex. Draw a second diagonal connecting to different vertices. The intersection of these diagonals is the center point of the hexagon.Erase the diagonals after you draw them.;
, You can begin with any vertex. Use a straightedge to draw the line.

, You should skip every other vertex, so that you have three lines, with one vertex between each.


Drawing a line to each vertex creates six equilateral triangles, which is six equal areas.By drawing a line to every other vertex, you create half as many equal areas (3 equal areas).

, Each part is a rhombus, which is a four-sided figure with equal side lengths and two sets of parallel sides., A regular hexagon has six equal side lengths.If the side length is specified, use a ruler to draw a line of the correct length. If no side length is specified, you can draw the line to be any length.


For example, you might draw line AB 5 centimeters long.

, To do this, place the point of the compass on one of the line’s endpoints, and stretch it so that the pencil tip touches the other endpoint., To do this, place the point of the compass at the first endpoint, and draw a small arc above the line. Then, place the point of the compass on the other endpoint, and draw another small arc, intersecting the first arc. The point at which these two arcs intersect is the center point of the hexagon.Do not change the width of the compass.

, Keeping the same compass width, move the point of the compass to the center point of the hexagon, and swing the compass around to draw a circle., The first two vertices are already marked by the endpoints of the original line that you drew. Place the compass on the first endpoint of the line. With the pencil, mark a point on the edge of the circle. This is the third vertex. Move the compass point to this new vertex. Mark another point on the edge of the circle. This is the fourth vertex. Complete this process until you have all six vertices marked.Be careful not the change the compass width.

, To tidy up your hexagon, erase the circle and any extra markings. Keep the center point of the hexagon, as you will need it to divide the shape into three equal parts.

Draw a line through the center of the circle.,
Draw two more lines that divide one half of the circle into thirds.,
Extend those lines into the other half of the circle.",How to Divide a Circle Into 6 Equal Parts2," The first step to dividing the circle is cutting it directly in half. Choose a point anywhere along the circle and draw a line through the center of the circle to the opposite end. The circle is now divided into two equal pieces.


This method works well if you are trying to cut a pie or a cake.

, Next, you want to draw two lines that cut the half into thirds. You can approximate this by dividing one half of the cake into three equal pieces.


Get as close to three equal pieces as possible. Again, this method is just an approximation.

, Continue both of those lines through the center of the circle to the opposite side of the circle. If done correctly, the circle should now be divided into six approximately equal parts.


This method is not exact, but is an easy way to divide the circle into six equal parts by eye.

Set up the formula for finding the circumference of a circle.,
Plug the length of the radius into the formula.,
Multiply the radius by 2π{\displaystyle 2\pi }.,
Find the perimeter given the area.",How to Find Perimeter2," The circumference is the distance around the circle, and is thus the same as its perimeter. The formula is C=2π⋅r{\displaystyle C=2\pi \cdot r}, where C{\displaystyle C} equals the circumference and r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius. Since the radius is half the diameter, you can use the formula C=π(d){\displaystyle C=\pi (d)} if you have the diameter instead of the radius., Make sure you substitute for the variable r{\displaystyle r}. If you are using the diameter formula, substitute for d{\displaystyle d}. The length of the radius or diameter should be given, or you should be able to measure it. If you do not have this information, you can’t use these formulas.

For example, if the radius of the circle is 6 cm, your formula will look like this:C=2π⋅6{\displaystyle C=2\pi \cdot 6}.


, You can use 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }, but if you are using a calculator you can use the π{\displaystyle \pi } key for a more precise answer. The product of these three values is equal to the circumference, or perimeter, of the circle.

For example: C=2π⋅6=37.7{\displaystyle C=2\pi \cdot 6=37.7}. So the circumference of the circle is 37.7 cm.


, The area of a circle is given by the formula A=π⋅r2{\displaystyle A=\pi \cdot r^{2}}. So, if you plug the area into the formula, you can solve for r{\displaystyle r}. Once you have r{\displaystyle r}, you can use the circumference formula to find the circumference.For example, if you are told that the area of a circle is 64 square centimeters, you would set up the formula 64=π⋅r2{\displaystyle 64=\pi \cdot r^{2}}. Then, use the  rules of algebra to solve for r{\displaystyle r}:64=π⋅r2{\displaystyle 64=\pi \cdot r^{2}}64π=π⋅r2π{\displaystyle {\frac {64}{\pi }}={\frac {\pi \cdot r^{2}}{\pi }}}20.37=r2{\displaystyle 20.37=r^{2}}20.37=r2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {20.37}}={\sqrt {r^{2}}}}4.51=r{\displaystyle 4.51=r}So, the radius of the circle is about 4.51 cm. Now you can plug this value into the perimeter formula and solve.

Set up the formula for finding the perimeter of a triangle.,
Find the perimeter of a right triangle with a missing side length.,
Find the perimeter of an isosceles triangle with a missing side length.",How to Find Perimeter3," The formula is P=a+b+c{\displaystyle P=a+b+c}, where the variables equal the three sides of the triangle. This formula is the same whether or not the triangle is right. You must have all side lengths to use this formula. If you know that you have an equilateral triangle, you only need one side length, since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides.For example, if a triangle has sides that are 5, 7, and 12 cm in length, you simply add up all the side lengths to find the perimeter: P=5+7+12=24{\displaystyle P=5+7+12=24}. So, the perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm.


, Sometimes you might be presented with a right triangle that only has two side lengths given. In this case, set up the Pythagorean formula to find the missing side length. The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the other two side lengths. Solve for the missing variable, and this will give you your missing side length.For example, if you have a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 10 cm, and one side length of 6 cm, set up the Pythagorean formula like this: 62+b2=102{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10^{2}}

Solve for b{\displaystyle b}:36+b2=100{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=100}36+b2−36=100−36{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}-36=100-36}b2=64{\displaystyle b^{2}=64}b2=64{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {64}}}b=8{\displaystyle b=8}

Now that you have all three side lengths, you can add them up to find the perimeter: 10+6+8=24{\displaystyle 10+6+8=24}. So, the perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm.


, Since the height, or altitude, of an isosceles triangle bisects the base, if you know the height and base of the triangle, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side lengths.For example, if an isosceles triangle has a height of 10 cm and a base of 6 cm, you can think of the height creating two right triangles. Since the height bisects the base, one side length of the right triangle will be 3 cm. The other side length will be equal to the height: 10 cm. The missing side length is the hypotenuse.

Set up the Pythagorean formula, plugging in the side lengths: 102+32=c2{\displaystyle 10^{2}+3^{2}=c^{2}}.

Make the necessary calculations to find the missing side length:100+9=c2{\displaystyle 100+9=c^{2}}109=c2{\displaystyle 109=c^{2}}109=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {109}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}10.44=c{\displaystyle 10.44=c}.

Remember that an isosceles triangle has two equal sides. So, the perimeter of the triangle is equal to 2x+b{\displaystyle 2x+b}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the length of one side, and b{\displaystyle b} equals the base. So, if you know the length of the base and one side, you can find the perimeter of an isosceles triangle: P=2(10.44)+6=26.88{\displaystyle P=2(10.44)+6=26.88}. So, the perimeter of the triangle is 26.88 cm.

Find the length of one side.,
Set up the formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon.,
Plug the values of x{\displaystyle x} and n{\displaystyle n} into the formula.",How to Find Perimeter4," This information might be given to you. If it isn’t, you can find the length of one side if you know the length of the polygon’s apothem or radius. The apothem is the distance between the center of the polygon to the midpoint of any side, and the radius is the distance between the center of the polygon and any vertex.

To find a side length given the apothem, use the formula x=2Atan(180n){\displaystyle x=2A{\text{tan}}({\frac {180}{n}})}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the side length and A{\displaystyle A} equals the apothem.To find the side length given the radius, use the formula x=2rsin(180n){\displaystyle x=2r{\text{sin}}({\frac {180}{n}})}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the side length and r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius.For example, if the radius of a hexagon is 5 cm, to find the side length, you would calculate:x=2(5)sin(1806){\displaystyle x=2(5){\text{sin}}({\frac {180}{6}})}x=2(5)sin(30){\displaystyle x=2(5){\text{sin}}(30)}x=2(5)(.5){\displaystyle x=2(5)(.5)}x=5{\displaystyle x=5}


, The formula is P=nx{\displaystyle P=nx}, where n{\displaystyle n} is the number of sides the polygon has, and x{\displaystyle x} is the length of one side., Multiply these two values to find the perimeter of the polygon.

For example, if a regular hexagon has a side length of 5 cm, you would calculate P=(6)(5)=30{\displaystyle P=(6)(5)=30}. So, the perimeter of the hexagon is 30 cm.

Choose your circular object.,
Draw the first side.,
Use the circular object to trace an arc.,
Trace another arc.,
Complete the triangle.",How to Draw an Equilateral Triangle2," Use almost any cylindrical object with a circular base, like a bottle or a soup can. Try using a circular roll of tape or a CD. If you are going to substitute the arc of this object for the arc of a compass tracer, you'll need to choose an object of the right size. In this method, each side of the equilateral triangle will be as long as the radius (half the diameter) of the circular object.


If you use a CD as your object: imagine an equilateral triangle that fits into the top-right quadrant of a CD.

, It should be exactly as long as the radius of the circular object – the distance halfway across. Make sure that it is perfectly straight!


If you have a ruler: simply measure the diameter of the object and draw a line that is half as long.
If you don't have a ruler: place the circular object onto a sheet of paper, then carefully trace the circumference with your pencil. Remove the object, and you should have a perfect circle. Use a straight edge to draw a line across the exact center of the circle: the point that is completely equidistant from any point around the circumference of the circle.

, Place the object over the line segment, with the edge of the circle resting at one end of the line. For accuracy, make sure that the line cleaves through the exact center of the circle. Use your pencil to trace an arc: roughly one-quarter of the way around the perimeter of the circle., Now, shift the circular object so that the edge touches the other end of the line segment. Make sure that the line segment runs through the exact center of the circle. Draw another quarter-arc that crosses the first arc at a point directly above the line segment. This point is the apex of your triangle.

, Draw the remaining sides of the triangle: two more straight lines will connect the apex with the two open ends of the line segment. Now, you should have a perfectly equilateral triangle!

,, Measure out a new line segment that is equal in length to the first. Start it at one end of the original line segment, where you measured the 60° angle. Start from the vertex (the point) of the angle, and trace the straight edge of the protractor until you reach the next ""point."", Use the straight edge of your protractor to trace out the final side of the triangle. Connect the point at the end of the second line segment to the unattached end of the first line segment. You should now have an equilateral triangle.

Make the task easy, if you want.,
Always close the shape.,
Get fancy with your calculations, if you'd like.",How to Draw a Polygon2," A polygon doesn't have to be regular to be a polygon. If you want to keep your drawing process easy, just use a straight edge and pencil and draw several line segments that interact to form a closed shape. In itself, that's a polygon!While most people think of regular polygons when they hear the terms ""hexagon,"" ""octagon,"" etc, these terms don't always indicate that the polygon is regular. A ""hexagon"" just has to have six sides; a ""regular hexagon"" has to have six sides of equal length, with equal interior angles.;
, Whether you decide to do a simple polygon or a star polygon, the segments do have to be in a circuit, meaning there's no opening on one side. Keep it closed, and keep every line straight, and you're good to go!, If you want to know more about your polygon, you can take it a step further: find the perimeter or the area of your polygon.

Understand what makes a polygon ""regular"".,
Decide what kind of regular polygon to draw.",How to Draw a Polygon3," A regular polygon is one where all of the sides and all of the angles are the same length. Perhaps the easiest regular polygons to identify are the equilateral triangle (with three sides of the same length and internal angles of 60 degrees each) and the square (with four sides of the same length and internal angles of 90 degrees each). However, you can make regular polygons far more complicated than that!

, In drawing a regular polygon (or a polygon of any kind, for that matter), you have many choices. For example:


You can draw a regular polygon using a circle.
You can draw a square.
You can draw a regular pentagon, with five equal sides/angles.
You can draw a regular hexagon, with six equal sides/angles.
You can draw a regular octagon, with eight equal sides/angles.
You can draw a polygon with as many sides/angles as you want! See the next method and How to Construct Regular Polygons Using a Circle for more details.

"
"
Draw a circle on the paper by tracing the protractor.,
Figure out how many angles/sides you want.

,
Calculate the central angle between lines from the center to adjacent vertices.,
Use a protractor to draw dots on the circle, at every one of these angle measurements.,
Join each dot with a straight line.,
Erase the lines and circle.",How to Draw a Polygon4," Since a protractor is semi-circle, you need to start with it against one line, marking the middle and each end with dots. Then trace the protractor's edge to make a semi-circle, before turning it around (matching the center and edge dots on the other side) and re-tracing it again.

,, The total degrees contained in a circle is 360, so you just need to divide 360 by the number of sides which is the same as the number of vertices. This value will be the measurement of the angle between any lines drawn from the center of the circle to each corner of the polygon.


For example, if you're drawing a hexagon, this value will be 60 degrees.

, In other words, you'll want to pick a point to start, and then work your way around the circle, drawing a dot at each successive degree measurement.


For example, if you're trying to draw a hexagon, you'll pick a point to draw you first dot; then you'll draw your next dot 60 degrees over from that point, and so on, until you've drawn all six points.

, You'll want to use a ruler for this, and make sure your lines don't overlap. It's a good idea to draw the lines lightly so that you can erase any mistakes or overlaps.

, And you've done it! If you want to be sure that your polygon is definitely regular, double-check that all your line segments are the same length as each other.

Prepare your square.,
Figure out the center of the top and bottom side of the square.,
Make a vertical line in the center of the square.,
Find the midsection of both of the rectangles.,
Draw vertical lines connecting the marks you made at the top and bottom of each rectangle.,
Repeat this process to create eight equal rectangles.,
Draw vertical lines to make your eight equal rectangles.",How to Divide a Square Into Eight Equal Parts2," Try to make sure that the sides are all equal. Using a ruler can help you to do this. You might also want to consider drawing the eight parts in pencil so that you can erase if you make a mistake.

, In order to break up the square into equal rectangles, you will need to find the center of the top and bottom sides of the square. To do this, measure the halfway point of each side of the square and make a little mark where the center of each side is.


For example, if you have a square where each side of the square is 4 inches (10.2 cm), the halfway point will be 2 inches (5.1 cm). Start at the top left corner and measure along the length of the top side of the square. When you get to two inches, make a mark with your pencil. Do this for the bottom side of the square, starting at the bottom left corner.

, Once you have made your marks along the sides of the square, draw a straight line from the mark on the top side of the square to the mark on the bottom side of the square. This will create a vertical (top to bottom) line through the center of the square.


When you draw this vertical line, you will cut your square into two equal rectangles.

, Now that you have two rectangles, you will need to find both of their midsections (or centers). This is the same process as what you just did to find the centers of the top and bottom sides of the square.


For example, if you started out with a square that had 4-inch sides, you now have two rectangles that have 2-inch top and bottom sides. Measure the halfway point of the top of each rectangle (you should measure in 1 inch because half of 2 inches is 1 inch). Make a mark 1 inch (2.5 cm) in. Do the same for the bottom.

, Now that you have found the centers of the top and bottom sides of each rectangle, draw a vertical line through the center of each rectangle. This will effectively give you four equal rectangles.

, Find the centers of the tops and bottoms of each of the four rectangles you have created. To continue with our example 4 by 4 square:


Each rectangle should have a top and bottom that are both one inch long. That means the center of each rectangle will be ½ inch in from the top corner of each rectangle and the bottom corner of each rectangle. Make a mark in the center of the top and bottom sides of each rectangle.

, Now that you have made marks that show where the center of each top and bottom side of each rectangle are, you can connect the marks in each rectangle. Again, using a ruler is the best way to do this. When you are finished connecting each top mark to each bottom mark, you should have eight equal rectangles.

Examine the square that you need to divide.,
Calculate ∆l.,
Divide the square into four equal rectangles.,
Draw a horizontal line through the middle of the square.",How to Divide a Square Into Eight Equal Parts3," Make sure it is actually a square: it should have four sides of equal length, with adjacent sides that are mutually perpendicular to one another.


As an example, say you have a square with sides measuring 4m.

, Before you can divide the square evenly, you need to find ∆l – the length that will divide a side of the square into four equal parts. To do that, divide the length by 4.


In the example above, you would divide 4m by 4 to get 1m.

, Once you know what the length of your segments should be, draw three vertical lines in regular increments of that length. You will now have four equal rectangles.


In the example above, you would draw three vertical lines, spaced 1m apart.

, Because all the sides of a square are equal, you know how to divide all sides equally. Once you have four rectangles, you can simply draw one horizontal line through the center of the square, dividing it into eight equal rectangles.


In the example above, you would draw a horizontal line from the 2m mark of the left side to the 2m mark of the right side to get eight equal rectangles.

For each of the methods below, we'll call the horizontal part of the L the bottom of the parallelogram and the vertical or angled part of the L the left side of the parallelogram.

, We're talking about the drawing tool, not the magnetic navigation compass. The drawing compass has one end with a spike, and one end with a pencil, connected by a hinge.

, The top and bottom sides of a parallelogram are always equal, and the left and right sides of a parallelogram are always equal. We can use this information to finish the parallelogram.

, Set your compass to the exact length of the bottom side, by placing the spike end on the bottom left corner and the pencil end on the bottom right.

, Move the compass without moving the hinge, so the spike rests at the top left corner. With the spike fixed in place, draw an arc along the paper by moving the pencil back and forth. You could draw a straight line from the spike to any point on this arc, and it would be the same length as the bottom side – but don't try that yet.

, Remember, the left and right sides are also the same length, so we can repeat this step again. Set the compass to the length of the left side, then move it so the spike rests at the bottom right corner. Draw another arc with the pencil, overlapping the first arc.

, The point where the two arcs cross is the top right corner of the parallelogram. This is the only place where you can connect a right side that's the correct length starting from the bottom right corner, and you can connect a top side that's the correct length starting from the top left corner.

, Connect the top right corner to the lower right and the top left corners with a straightedge.

Know how to spot an invalid triangle.",How to Determine if Three Side Lengths Are a Triangle," This theorem simply states that the sum of two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. If this is true for all three combinations, then you will have a valid triangle. You'll have to go through these combinations one by one to make sure that the triangle is possible. You can also think of the triangle as having the side lengths a, b, and c and the theorem being an inequality, which states: a+b > c, a+c > b, and b+c > a.For this example, a = 7, b = 10, and c = 5.;
, In this case, you can add the sides a and b, or 7 + 10, to get 17, which is greater than 5. You can also think of it as 17 > 5.

, Now, just see if the sum of sides a and c are greater than the side b. This means you should see if 7 + 5, or 12, is greater than 10. 12 > 10, so it is.

, You need to see if the sum of side b and side c is greater than side a. To do this, you'll need to see if 10 + 5 is greater than 7. 10 + 5 = 15, and 15 > 7, so the triangle passes on all sides.

, Now that you've checked the side combinations one by one, you can double check that the rule is true for all three combinations. If the sum of any two side lengths is greater than the third in every combination, as it is for this triangle, then you've determined that the triangle is valid. If the rule is invalid for even just one combination, then the triangle is invalid. Since the following statements are true, you've found a valid triangle:



a + b > c = 17 > 5

a + c > b = 12 > 10

b + c > a = 15 > 7

, Just for practice, you should make sure you can spot a triangle that doesn't work as well. Let's say you're working with these three side lengths: 5, 8, and 3. Let's see if it passes the test:


5 + 8 > 3 = 13 > 3, so one side passes.
5 + 3 > 8 = 8 > 8. Since this is invalid, you can stop right here. This triangle is not valid.

Measure the angle.,
Divide the number of degrees in half.,
Draw a point marking the measurement of the bisector.,
Draw a line from the vertex to the point.",How to Construct a Bisector of a Given Angle1," Place the origin hole of the compass on the angle’s vertex, lining up the base line with one of the angle’s rays. Look at the degree mark where the other ray falls. This will tell you the degree measurement of the angle.

For example, you might measure an angle that is 160 degrees wide.

Remember that protractors have two sets of numbers. To know which set of numbers to look at, think about the size of the angle. Obtuse angles are greater than 90 degrees, and acute angles are less than 90 degrees. 
;
, An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts.So, to find where the angle bisector lays, divide the number of degrees in the angle by 2.For example, if the angle is 160 degrees, you would calculate 1602=80{\displaystyle {\frac {160}{2}}=80}. So, the angle bisector is at the 80-degree mark of the angle.


, Again, line up the origin hole with the angle’s vertex, and line up the base line with one of the rays. Find the halfway point using the protractor. Mark this point in the angle’s interior.

For example, if the bisector of a 160-degree angle lies at the 80-degree point, you would find the 80-degree mark on the protractor and and draw a point at this location in the angle’s interior.


, Use the straightedge of the protractor to connect the vertex to the halfway point of the angle. The line you draw is the angle’s bisector."

, This information should be given, or you should be able to measure the radius. If you do not know the length of the radius, you cannot use this method.

For example, the circumference of a circle with a radius of 4cm is shown by 2π4{\displaystyle 2\pi 4}cm.


, To do this, multiply the three values together. If you are not using a calculator, substitute 3.14 for the value of π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example, 2×3.14×4=25.12{\displaystyle 2\times 3.14\times 4=25.12}. So the circumference, or perimeter, of the circle is 25.12cm.


, The formula is P=4s{\displaystyle P=4s}, where P{\displaystyle P} equals the perimeter of the square and s{\displaystyle s} equals the side length of the square., You are substituting the circumference for P{\displaystyle P}, since the circumference of the circle and the perimeter of the square are supposed to be equal.

For example, 25.12=4s{\displaystyle 25.12=4s}.


, To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 4. This will give you the side length of the square.

For example:25.12=4s{\displaystyle 25.12=4s}25.124=4s4{\displaystyle {\frac {25.12}{4}}={\frac {4s}{4}}}6.28=s{\displaystyle 6.28=s}.So the circumference of a circle with a radius of 4 cm is equal to the perimeter of a square with side lengths of 6.28cm.

For example, 4×4=16{\displaystyle 4\times 4=16}. So the perimeter of the square is 16 cm.

, To do this, divide each side by 2π{\displaystyle 2\pi }. If you are not using a calculator, substitute 3.14 for the value of π{\displaystyle \pi }. This will give you the radius of the circle.

If using a given line segment instead of a measurement, draw the base by setting the compass to the width of the provided base. Make an endpoint, then use the compass to draw the other endpoint. Connect the endpoints using a straightedge., To do this, open the compass to the width of the equal side lengths.

If you are given the measurement, use a ruler. If you are given a line segment, set the compass so that it spans the length of the line.

For example, if the side lengths are 6 cm, open the compass to this length. Or, if provided a line segment, set the compass to the segment's length.

, To do this, place the tip of the compass on one of the base’s endpoints. Sweep the compass in the space above the base, drawing an arc.


Make sure the arc passes at least halfway across the base.

, Without changing the width of the compass, place the tip on the other endpoint of the base. Draw an arc that intersects the first one.

, Use a ruler to draw lines connecting the point where the arcs intersect to either endpoint of the base. The resulting figure is an isosceles triangle."

Assess what you know.,
Draw the angle.,
Set the compass.,
Draw an arc.,
Draw the base.",How to Construct an Isosceles Triangle2," To use this method, you need to know the length of the two equal sides, and the measurement of the angle between these two sides. You can also use this method if you are given a line segment representing the side length instead of the measurement.

For example, you might know that the isosceles triangle has two equal sides of 7 cm, or you might be given a line segment representing the side length. You also know that the angle between the sides is 50 degrees.

, Use a protractor to construct the angle of the given measurement. Ensure that each of its vectors is longer than the given side length.


For example, you might need to draw a 50-degree angle. Since the sides of the triangle are 7 cm, the vectors should be a little longer than 7 cm long. You can use a ruler or your compass set to the appropriate length to measure.

, If you know the measurement of the side lengths, use a ruler to open the compass to that length. If you are given a line segment instead of a measurement, use it to set the compass to the appropriate width.


For example, if you know that the side lengths are 7 cm, then use a ruler to open your compass 7 cm wide.

, To do this, place the tip of the compass on the vertex of the angle (where the two vectors meet). Draw one long arc that intersects each vector of the angle. You can also draw two small arcs, each one intersecting one of the vectors.

, Using a straightedge, draw a line connecting the points where the arc intersects the two vectors. The resulting figure is an isosceles triangle.

Assess what you know.,
Draw the base.,
Draw the first angle.,
Draw the second angle.",How to Construct an Isosceles Triangle3," To use this method, you need to know the length of the base, or you need to be provided with a line segment that represents the base. You also need to know the measurement of the two angles adjacent to the base. Remember that the two angles adjacent to the base of an isosceles triangle will be equal. For example, you might know that an isosceles triangle has a base measuring 9 cm, with two adjacent 45-degree angles.

, If you know the measurement of the base, use a ruler to draw it the appropriate length. Make sure to measure exactly, and to create a straight line.


You can also draw the base by setting the compass to the same width as a provided line segment. Draw an endpoint. Make the other endpoint using the compass. Then use a straightedge to connect the two endpoints.

, Use a protractor to draw the angle on the left side of the base. The vector should pass a little more than halfway over the base, so that it will intersect with the other side of the triangle.

, Use a protractor to draw the angle on the right side of the base. Make sure the second vector intersects the first. Where the two lines intersect creates the apex of the triangle. The resulting figure is an isosceles triangle.

Assess what you know.,
Draw the base.,
Draw a line bisecting the base.,
Set the compass.,
Draw an arc across the altitude.,
Draw the triangle.",How to Construct an Isosceles Triangle4," To use this method, you need to know the length of the triangle’s base, and the height, or altitude, of the triangle. You can also use this method if you are given line segments representing the base and altitude instead of the measurements.

For example, you might have an isosceles triangle with a base of 5 cm and a height of 2.5 cm.

, If you know the measurement, use a ruler. For example, if you know that the base is 5 cm long, use a ruler to draw a line that is exactly 5 cm long.


If using a line segment instead of a measurement, draw the base by setting the compass to the width of the base. Draw an endpoint. Use the compass to draw the second endpoint. Then, connect the endpoints using a straightedge., This means a line that cuts the line in half. You can use a compass and the method described here. Draw the line at least as long as the triangle’s altitude.


You can also use a ruler and a protractor to bisect the line. Divide the length of the base in half. Use the ruler to draw a midpoint. Then, use a protractor to draw a line at this midpoint that intersects the base at a 90-degree angle.

, If you know the measurement of the altitude, use a ruler to open the compass to this exact length (for example, 2.5 cm). If you are given a line segment, open the compass to the length of the provided line.

, Place the tip of the compass on the midpoint of the base. Draw an arc across the bisecting line. You need to draw the arc only on one side of the base.

, Connect the point where the altitude and arc intersect with either endpoint of the base. The resulting figure will be an isosceles triangle.

Use a protractor to measure each of the 3 interior angles of the given triangle.

,
Record the measurement of each angle in degrees.,
Distinguish if the angles are right, acute or obtuse according to their measurements.

,
Classify the triangle according to the measurement and the type of angles.",How to Classify Triangles2,",


The 3 angles inside a triangle will always have a sum of 180 degrees.

,,


Name the triangle as an obtuse triangle if any of the angles are greater than 90 degrees. An obtuse triangle will only have 1 obtuse angle.
Classify the triangle as a right triangle if the triangle possess a right angle of 90 degrees. A right triangle will only have 1 right angle.
Categorize the triangle as acute if all 3 of its angles are less than 90 degrees.
Determine that the triangle is equilateral if all 3 of its angles, (which would have to be acute), are congruent. In an equilateral triangle, all 3 of the angles will be 60 degrees, because the sum of the 3 interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

In optimization problems, we typically set the derivatives to 0 and go from there. But in this case, we cannot do that, since the max value of x3y{\displaystyle x^{3}y} may not lie on the ellipse.

Clearly, f(x,y)=x3y{\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{3}y} and g(x,y)=3x2+y2=6.{\displaystyle g(x,y)=3x^{2}+y^{2}=6.}
;
, Setting it to 0 gets us a system of two equations with three variables.


∇f+λ∇g=0{\displaystyle \nabla f+\lambda \nabla g=0}


{3x2y+λ6x=0x3+λ2y=0{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}3x^{2}y+\lambda 6x&=0\\x^{3}+\lambda 2y&=0\end{cases}}}


, Since we are not concerned with it, we need to cancel it out. Here, we multiply the first equation by y{\displaystyle y} and the second equation by 3x.{\displaystyle 3x.}


{3x2y2+λ6xy=03x4+λ6xy=0{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}3x^{2}y^{2}+\lambda 6xy&=0\\3x^{4}+\lambda 6xy&=0\end{cases}}}


3x2y2−3x4=0x2(y2−x2)=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}3x^{2}y^{2}-3x^{4}&=0\\x^{2}(y^{2}-x^{2})&=0\end{aligned}}}


, In the above equation, we see that when x≠0, y2−x2=0.{\displaystyle x\neq 0,\ y^{2}-x^{2}=0.} This gets us the relation below.


y=x{\displaystyle y=x}


, Now that we have derived this useful relation, we can finally find values for x{\displaystyle x} and y.{\displaystyle y.}


g=3x2+x2=6x=y=±32{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}g&=3x^{2}+x^{2}=6\\x&=y=\pm {\sqrt {\frac {3}{2}}}\end{aligned}}}


, We have found the maximum value of the function x3y{\displaystyle x^{3}y} on the ellipse 3x2+y2=6.{\displaystyle 3x^{2}+y^{2}=6.}


x3y=94{\displaystyle x^{3}y={\frac {9}{4}}}


, Recall the distance as x2+y2+z2.{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}.} This is the function that we are trying to optimize, with the constraint function as x2yz−1=0.{\displaystyle x^{2}yz-1=0.} This is a somewhat difficult expression to work with, however. In this case, we can remove the square root and optimize x2+y2+z2{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}} instead, since we are working in the same domain (only positive numbers), so the numbers will turn out to be the same. We just have to remember that the function to be optimized is the expression with the square root. 


L(x,y,z;λ)=(x2+y2+z2)+λ(x2yz−1){\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(x,y,z;\lambda )=(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})+\lambda (x^{2}yz-1)}

, Here, multiply the first equation by x,{\displaystyle x,} the second equation by 2y,{\displaystyle 2y,} and the third equation by 2z.{\displaystyle 2z.}


{2x2+λ2x2yz=04y2+λ2x2yz=04z2+λ2x2yz=0{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}2x^{2}+\lambda 2x^{2}yz&=0\\4y^{2}+\lambda 2x^{2}yz&=0\\4z^{2}+\lambda 2x^{2}yz&=0\end{cases}}}


, Let's use y,{\displaystyle y,} though x{\displaystyle x} and z{\displaystyle z} are fine too.


x2=2y2=2z2{\displaystyle x^{2}=2y^{2}=2z^{2}}

The equation above gives us all the information we need to optimize the distance now.

, The surface S{\displaystyle S} bounds a sphere of radius 3. Our boundaries in Cartesian coordinates are therefore symmetric. When we are integrating odd functions over symmetric boundaries, we can cross them out, as they evaluate to 0. Because we can treat each variable separately, any expression that has an odd function in it gets annihilated. The second term cancels because z is  an odd function, and the third term cancels because y is odd too. The expressions with quadratic terms in them do not get annihilated because they are even functions. This step is crucial in simplifying the integral to be evaluated.

, Since we are finding the volume ∫VdV{\displaystyle \int _{V}{\mathrm {d} }V} and not the flux, we are free to choose our vector field such that it satisfies that condition. Since the k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }} component of dS{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {S} }} is the simplest, let's choose F=zk,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=z{\mathbf {k} },} remembering that z=3cos⁡u,{\displaystyle z=3\cos u,} and compute the resulting dot product F⋅dS.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {S} }.} In this example, the surface integral is the easier one to do, since we picked a simple vector field and have already computed the surface element.

, Our boundaries both go from 0{\displaystyle 0} to 2π,{\displaystyle 2\pi ,} because we need to go all the way around (which closes the hole in the center) and up-and-over (which makes the surface rounded) for both parameters. It is useful to recognize that ∫02πsin⁡udu=0,{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }\sin u{\mathrm {d} }u=0,} which allows us to annihilate that term.

, This is a problem that uses not only the divergence theorem, but also Jacobian change of variables. It is recommended that you are familiar with this topic in order to follow this example. F{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }} is given as below.


F=(2x3+xy3+y4z3)i+(y3+x2y2)j+(2x2+y2+x2z)k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=(2x^{3}+xy^{3}+y^{4}z^{3}){\mathbf {i} }+(y^{3}+x^{2}y^{2}){\mathbf {j} }+(2x^{2}+y^{2}+x^{2}z){\mathbf {k} }}

Draw a diagram of this problem. The surface is an elliptic paraboloid in the shape of a hill, whose axis of symmetry is the z-axis. This is an open surface - the divergence theorem, however, only applies to closed surfaces. In order to use the divergence theorem, we need to close off the surface by inserting the region on the xy-plane ""inside"" the paraboloid, which we will call D.{\displaystyle D.} Keep in mind that this region is an ellipse, not a circle.

As the problem is concerned with the flux above the xy plane, we will need to subtract the contribution obtained with the region on the plane at the end. How do we do this without getting thrown off by the signs? The flux through D{\displaystyle D} points upwards by convention. However, when we closed off the paraboloid surface using D,{\displaystyle D,} we were concerned with the outward flux penetrating a closed surface. The flux contribution of D{\displaystyle D} will therefore be negative.

, We recognize that in this region, z=0.{\displaystyle z=0.} Therefore, 5x2+4y2≤20.{\displaystyle 5x^{2}+4y^{2}\leq 20.} Verify that this parameterization satisfies the inequality. It is important that we recognize that 0≤r≤1.{\displaystyle 0\leq r\leq 1.}


x=2rcos⁡θ{\displaystyle x=2r\cos \theta }

y=5rsin⁡θ{\displaystyle y={\sqrt {5}}r\sin \theta }

, Because our region is on the xy-plane, we find that the flux through D{\displaystyle D} only relies on the k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }} component of F.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }.} But on D,z=0,{\displaystyle D,\,z=0,} so we need to evaluate −∫D(2x2+y2)dA.{\displaystyle -\int _{D}(2x^{2}+y^{2}){\mathrm {d} }A.} Remember that this negative sign exists because positive flux when analyzing D{\displaystyle D} alone points in the opposite direction of outwards flux regarding surface S.{\displaystyle S.}


Use a Jacobian change of variables to transform from physical space into parameter space. First, calculate partial derivatives.


∂x∂r=2cos⁡θ;   ∂y∂r=5sin⁡θ{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial x}{\partial r}}=2\cos \theta ;\ \ \ {\frac {\partial y}{\partial r}}={\sqrt {5}}\sin \theta }


∂x∂θ=−2rsin⁡θ;   ∂y∂θ=5rcos⁡θ{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial x}{\partial \theta }}=-2r\sin \theta ;\ \ \ {\frac {\partial y}{\partial \theta }}={\sqrt {5}}r\cos \theta }



Calculate the determinant of the Jacobian matrix. Those familiar with Jacobians should recognize the extra r{\displaystyle r} that results with the conversion from Cartesian to polar coordinates. However, r{\displaystyle r} and θ{\displaystyle \theta } are, while polar, non-physical parameters. 

dA=|∂x∂r∂y∂r∂x∂θ∂y∂θ|drdθ=25rdrdθ{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathrm {d} }A&={\begin{vmatrix}{\dfrac {\partial x}{\partial r}}&{\dfrac {\partial y}{\partial r}}\\{\dfrac {\partial x}{\partial \theta }}&{\dfrac {\partial y}{\partial \theta }}\end{vmatrix}}{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta \\&=2{\sqrt {5}}r{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta \end{aligned}}}



, Now that we have converted into parameter space, we can convert into polar coordinates without worry. The extra 25{\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {5}}} resulting from the Jacobian is crucial in obtaining the correct answer. Substitute the integrand using the parameterization that we made earlier in step 2.
−∫D(2x2+y2)dA=−25∫01rdr∫02πdθ=−25∫01r3dr∫02π(8cos2⁡θ+5sin2⁡θ)=−25(14)(13π)=−1352π{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}-\int _{D}(2x^{2}+y^{2}){\mathrm {d} }A&=-2{\sqrt {5}}\int _{0}^{1}r{\mathrm {d} }r\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\mathrm {d} }\theta \\&=-2{\sqrt {5}}\int _{0}^{1}r^{3}{\mathrm {d} }r\int _{0}^{2\pi }(8\cos ^{2}\theta +5\sin ^{2}\theta )\\&=-2{\sqrt {5}}\left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)(13\pi )\\&=-{\frac {13{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}\pi \end{aligned}}}
This result only gives us the flux through D.{\displaystyle D.} We still need the flux through the paraboloid.

, In this problem, we wish to evaluate using the volume integral, because the paraboloid shape is easy to evaluate in cylindrical coordinates. 

∇⋅F=7x2+y3+3y2+2x2y{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {F} }=7x^{2}+y^{3}+3y^{2}+2x^{2}y}

, Since we are integrating over symmetric x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} boundaries, we can look for odd functions of both of these variables and cross them out. Here, the second and fourth terms cancel because of the presence of the y3{\displaystyle y^{3}} and y{\displaystyle y} in those terms.

∫V(7x2+y3+3y2+2x2y)dV{\displaystyle \int _{V}(7x^{2}+{\cancel {y^{3}}}+3y^{2}+{\cancel {2x^{2}y}}){\mathrm {d} }V}

, Then evaluate using any means possible. We recognize that for the z{\displaystyle z} integral, our bounds are 0{\displaystyle 0} and 20−5x2−4y2.{\displaystyle 20-5x^{2}-4y^{2}.} That integral will be trivial. Do not forget the Jacobian, as the substitution we make means that we are working in parameter space.

This evaluation may seem long, but if we had not done the necessary simplifications along the way, it would've been hopelessly complicated.

While this might not seem useful at first, calculus is one of the most widely used branches of mathematics in the world. Imagine having the tools to examine how quickly your business is growing at any time, or plotting the course of a spaceship and how fast it is burning fuel. Calculus is an important tool in engineering, economics, statistics, chemistry, and physics, and has helped create many real-world inventions and discoveries.

, Functions are rules for how numbers relate to one another, and mathematicians use them to make graphs. In a function, every input has exactly one output. For example, in y=2x+4,{\displaystyle y=2x+4,} every value of x{\displaystyle x} gives you a new value of y.{\displaystyle y.} If x=2,{\displaystyle x=2,} then y=8.{\displaystyle y=8.} If x=10,{\displaystyle x=10,} then y=24.{\displaystyle y=24.}All calculus studies functions to see how they change, using functions to map real-world relationships.

Functions are often written as f(x)=x+3.{\displaystyle f(x)=x+3.} This means that the function f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} always adds 3 to the number you input for x.{\displaystyle x.} If you want to input 2, write f(2)=(2)+3,{\displaystyle f(2)=(2)+3,} or f(2)=5.{\displaystyle f(2)=5.} 

Functions can map complex motions too. NASA, for example, has a function that describes how fast a rocket will go based on how much fuel it burns, the wind resistance, and the weight of the rocket itself.


, Infinity is when you repeat a process over and over again. It is not a specific place (you can’t go to infinity), but rather the behavior of a number or equation if it is done forever. This is important to study change: you might want to know how fast your car is moving at any given time, but does that mean how fast you were at that current second? Millisecond? Nanosecond? You could find infinitely smaller amounts of time to be extra precise, and that is where calculus comes in.
, A limit tells you what happens when something is near infinity. Take the number 1 and divide it by 2. Then keep dividing it by 2 again and again. 1 would become 1/2, then 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, and so on. Each time, the number gets smaller and smaller, getting “closer” to zero. But where would it end? How many times do you have to divide by 1 by 2 to get zero? In calculus, instead of answering this question, you set a limit. In this case, the limit is 0.

Limits are easiest to see on a graph – are the points that a graph almost touches, for example, but never does?

Limits can be a number, infinity, or not even exist. For example, if you add 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + ... forever, your final number would be infinitely large. The limit would be infinity.


, Calculus builds on many of the forms of math you’ve been learning for a long time. Knowing these subjects completely will make it much easier to learn and understand calculus. Some topics to refresh include:


Algebra. Understand different processes and be able to solve equations and systems of equations for multiple variables. Understand the basic concepts of sets. Know how to graph equations.


Geometry. Geometry is the study of shapes. Understand the basic concepts of triangles, squares, and circles and how to calculate things like area and perimeter. Understand angles, lines, and coordinate systems


Trigonometry. Trigonometry is branch of maths which deals with properties of circles and right triangles. Know how to use trigonometric identities, graphs, functions, and inverse trigonometric functions.


, Calculus is not easy to understand without seeing what you are doing. Graphing calculators take functions and display them visually for you, allowing you to better comprehend the equations you are writing and manipulating. Oftentimes, you can see limits on the screen and calculate derivatives and functions automatically.

Many smartphones and tablets now offer cheap but effective graphing apps if you do not want to buy a full calculator.


, For example, calculus tells you not only the speed of your car, but how much that speed is changing at any given moment. This is one of the simplest uses of calculus, but it is incredibly important. Imagine how useful that knowledge would be for the speed of a spaceship trying to get to the moon! Finding instantaneous change is called differentiation. Differential calculus is the first of two major branches of calculus.


, A ""derivative"" is a fancy sounding word that inspires anxiety. The concept itself, however, isn't that hard to grasp -- it just means ""how fast is something changing."" The most common derivatives in everyday life relate to speed. You likely don’t call it the “derivative of speed,” however – you call it ""acceleration.""

Acceleration is a derivative – it tells you how fast something is speeding up or slowing down, or how the speed is changing.


, This is one of the key findings of calculus. The rate of change between two points is equal to the slope of the line connecting them. Think of a basic line, such as the equation y=3x.{\displaystyle y=3x.} The slope of the line is 3, meaning that for every new value of x,{\displaystyle x,} y{\displaystyle y} changes by 3. The slope is the same thing as the rate of change: a slope of three means that the line is changing by 3 for every change in x.{\displaystyle x.} When x=2,y=6;{\displaystyle x=2,y=6;} when x=3,y=9.{\displaystyle x=3,y=9.}

The slope of a line is the change in y divided by the change in x.

The bigger the slope, the steeper a line. Steep lines can be said to change very quickly.


Review how to find the slope of a line if your memory is hazy.


, Finding the slope of a straight line is relatively straightforward: how much does y{\displaystyle y} change for each value of x?{\displaystyle x?} Yet complex equations with curves, like y=x2{\displaystyle y=x^{2}} are much harder to find. However, you can still find the rate of change between any two points – simply draw a line between them and calculate the slope.

For example, in y=x2,{\displaystyle y=x^{2},} you can take any two points and get the slope. Take (1,1){\displaystyle (1,1)} and (2,4).{\displaystyle (2,4).} The slope between them would equal 4−12−1=42=2.{\displaystyle {\frac {4-1}{2-1}}={\frac {4}{2}}=2.} This means that the rate of change between x=1{\displaystyle x=1} and x=2{\displaystyle x=2} is 2. 


, The closer your two points, the more accurate your answer. Say you want to know how much your car accelerates right when you step on the gas. You don’t want to measure the change in speed between your house and the grocery store, you want to measure the change in speed the second after you hit the gas. The closer your measurement is to that split-second moment, the more accurate your reading will be.

For example, scientists study how quickly some species are going extinct to try to save them. However, more animals often die in the winter than the summer, so studying the rate of change across the entire year is not as useful – they would find the rate of change between closer points, like from July 1st to August 1st.


, This is where calculus often becomes confusing, but this is actually the result of two simple facts.  First, you know that the slope of a line equals how quickly it is changing. Second, you know that closer the points of your line are, the more accurate the reading will be. But how can you find the rate of change at one point if slope is the relationship of two points? The answer: you pick two points infinitely close to one another.

Think of the example where you keep dividing 1 by 2 over and over again, getting 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc. Eventually you get so close to zero, the answer is ""practically zero."" Here, your points get so close together, they are ""practically instantaneous."" This is the nature of derivatives.


, There are a lot of different techniques to find a derivative depending on the equation, but most of them make sense if you remember the basic principles of derivatives outlined above. All derivatives are is a way to find the slope of your ""infinitely small"" line. Now that your know the theory of derivatives, a large part of the work is finding the answers.
, Using derivatives to find the rate of change at one point is helpful, but the beauty of calculus is that it allows you to create a new model for every function. The derivative of y=x2,{\displaystyle y=x^{2},} for example, is y′=2x.{\displaystyle y^{\prime }=2x.} This means that you can find the derivative for every point on the graph y=x2{\displaystyle y=x^{2}} simply by plugging it into the derivative. At the point (2,4),{\displaystyle (2,4),} where x=2,{\displaystyle x=2,} the derivative is 4, since y′=2(2).{\displaystyle y^{\prime }=2(2).}

There are different notations for derivatives. In the previous step, derivatives were labeled with a prime symbol – for the derivative of y,{\displaystyle y,} you would write y′.{\displaystyle y^{\prime }.} This is called Lagrange's notation. 

There is also another popular way of writing derivatives. Instead of using a prime symbol, you write ddx.{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}.} Remember that the function y=x2{\displaystyle y=x^{2}} depends on the variable x.{\displaystyle x.} Then, we write the derivative as dydx{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}} – the derivative of y{\displaystyle y} with respect to x.{\displaystyle x.} This is called Leibniz's notation.


, The easiest example is based on speed, which offers a lot of different derivatives that we see every day. Remember, a derivative is a measure of how fast something is changing. Think of a basic experiment. You are rolling a marble on a table, and you measure both how far it moves each time and how fast it moves. Now imagine that the rolling marble is tracing a line on a graph – you use derivatives to measure the instantaneous changes at any point on that line.

How fast does the marble change location? What is the rate of change, or derivative, of the marble’s movement? This derivative is what we call “speed.”

Roll the marble down an incline and see how fast in gains speed. What is the rate of change, or derivative, of the marble’s speed? This derivative is what we call “acceleration.”

Roll the marble along an up and down track like a roller coaster. How fast is the marble gaining speed down the hills, and how fast is it losing speed going up hills? How fast is the marble moving exactly halfway up the first hill? This would be the instantaneous rate of change, or derivative, of that marble at its one specific point. 


, Calculus allows you to measure complex shapes that are normally too difficult. Think, for example, about trying to find out how much water is in a long, oddly shaped lake – it would be impossible to measure each gallon of water separately or use a ruler to measure the shape of the lake. Calculus allows you to study how the edges of the lake change, and use that information to learn how much water is inside.

Making geographic models and studying volume is using integration. Integration is the second major branch of calculus.


, Integration is used to measure the space underneath any line, which allows you to find the area of odd or irregular shapes. Take the equation y=4−x2,{\displaystyle y=4-x^{2},} which looks like an upside-down “U.” You might want to find out how much space is underneath the U, and you can use integration to find it. While this may seem useless, think of the uses in manufacturing – you can make a function that looks like a new part and use integration to find out the area of that part, helping you order the right amount of material.
, You cannot just integrate an entire function. For example, y=x{\displaystyle y=x} is a diagonal line that goes on forever, and you cannot integrate the whole thing because it would never end. When integrating functions, you need to choose an area, such as all points between x=2{\displaystyle x=2} and x=5.{\displaystyle x=5.}
, Imagine you have a flat line above a graph, like y=4.{\displaystyle y=4.} To find the area underneath it, you would be finding the area of a rectangle between y=0{\displaystyle y=0} and y=4.{\displaystyle y=4.} This is easy to measure, but it will never work for curvy lines that cannot be turned into rectangles easily.
, If you zoom in very close to a curve, it looks flat. This happens every day – you cannot see the curve of the earth because we are so close to its surface. Integration makes an infinite number of little rectangles under a curve that are so small they are basically flat, which allows you to measure them. Add all of these together to get the area under a curve.

Imagine you are adding together a lot of little slices under the graph, and the width of each slice is ‘’almost’’ zero.


, Integrals come with 4 parts. A typical integral looks like this:∫f(x)dx{\displaystyle \int f(x){\mathrm {d} }x}


The first symbol, ∫,{\displaystyle \int ,} is the symbol for integration (it is actually an elongated S). 

The second part, f(x),{\displaystyle f(x),} is your function. When it is inside the integral, it is called the integrand. 

Finally, the dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} at the end tells you what variable you are integrating with respect to. Because the function f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} depends on x,{\displaystyle x,} that is what you should integrate with respect to.

Remember, the variable you are integrating is not always going to be x,{\displaystyle x,} so be careful what you write down.


, Integration comes in many forms, and you will need to learn a lot of different formulas to integrate every function. However, they all follow the principles outlined above: integration sums up an infinite number of things.


Integrate by substitution.


Calculate indefinite integrals.


Integrate by parts.


, This is an ironclad rule of calculus that is so important, it has its own name: the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Since integration and differentiation are so closely related, a combination of the two of them can be used to find rate of change, acceleration, speed, location, movement, etc. no matter what information you have.

For example, remember that the derivative of speed is acceleration, so you can use speed to find acceleration. But if you only know the acceleration of something (like objects falling due to gravity), you can integrate it to find the speed! 


, Spinning a flat shape around is a way to create 3D solids. Imagine spinning a coin on the table in front of you – notice how it appears to form a sphere as it spins. You can use this concept to find volume in a process known as “volume by rotation.”

This lets you find the volume of any solid in the world, as long as you have a function that mirrors it. For example, you can make a function that traces the bottom of a lake, and then use that to find the volume of the lake, or how much water it holds.


"
"
Find the bottom (denominator).,Take the negative derivative of the denominator; that becomes the numerator of the new derivative.,
Divide by the bottom denominator squared.,
Square the denominator to obtain x^4, and the final result is f'(x) = dx/dy = 1/3 (-2x/x^4).",How to Take the Derivative of a Reciprocal (the Reciprocal Rule)," This is the only major factor in the derivative.
,,

Note: Taking the negative derivative and dividing it by the bottom denominator squared might seem like a load of mumbo jumbo but it is dx/dy 1/f = -f'/f^2 where f' is the derivative of f. Examples:

If a coefficient is there, multiply by the coefficient. For example, f (x) = 1/f , f'(x) = -f' / f^2.
As a more complicated example, let's set f(x) = 3x^2. Then the reciprocal is 1/(3x^2).
The negative derivative of the denominator is -2x because first we pull out the coefficient, 1/3; -2x becomes the new numerator.
The denominator is squared, leaving us so far with dx/dy f(x) = 1/3 (-2x)/(x^2).



,

This can be simplified to 1/3 (-2/x^3), or -2/(3x^3).

Recall that the linear function is of the form y=mx+b.{\displaystyle y=mx+b.} To find the slope m{\displaystyle m} of this function, two points on the line are taken, and their coordinates are plugged into the relation m=y2−y1x2−x1.{\displaystyle m={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.} Of course, this can only be used with linear graphs. 

For nonlinear functions, the line will be curved, so taking the difference of two points can only give the average rate of change between them. The line that intersects these two points is called the secant line, with a slope m=f(x+Δx)−f(x)Δx,{\displaystyle m={\frac {f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}},} where Δx=x2−x1{\displaystyle \Delta x=x_{2}-x_{1}} is the change in x,{\displaystyle x,} and we have replaced y{\displaystyle y} with f(x).{\displaystyle f(x).} This is the same equation as the one before. 


 
 

The concept of the derivatives comes in when we take the limit Δx→0.{\displaystyle \Delta x\to 0.} When this happens, the distance between the two points shrinks, and the secant line better approximates the rate of change of the function. When we do send the limit to 0, we end up with the instantaneous rate of change and obtain the slope of the tangent line to the curve (see animation above). Then, we end up with the definition of the derivative, where the prime symbol denotes the derivative of the function f.{\displaystyle f.}


f′(x)=limΔx→0f(x+Δx)−f(x)Δx{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=\lim _{\Delta x\to 0}{\frac {f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}}}



Finding the derivative from this definition stems from expanding the numerator, canceling, and then evaluating the limit, since immediately evaluating the limit will give a 0 in the denominator. 
;
, There are two common notations for the derivative, though there are others. 


Lagrange's Notation. In the previous step, we used this notation to denote the derivative of a function f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} by adding a prime symbol.


f′(x){\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)} 

This notation is pronounced ""f{\displaystyle f} prime of x.{\displaystyle x.}"" To form higher order derivatives, simply add another prime symbol. When derivatives of fourth or higher order are taken, the notation becomes f(4)(x),{\displaystyle f^{(4)}(x),} where this represents the fourth derivative.




Leibniz's Notation. This is the other commonly used notation, and we will use it in the rest of the article.


dfdx{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}}

(For shorter expressions, the function can be placed in the numerator.) This notation literally means ""the derivative of f{\displaystyle f} with respect to x.{\displaystyle x.}"" It may be helpful to think of it as ΔyΔx{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}} for values of x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} that are infinitesimally different from each other. When using this notation for higher derivatives, you must write d2fdx2,{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}f}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}},} where this represents the second derivative.

(Note that there ""should"" be parentheses in the denominator, but no one ever writes them, since everyone understands what we mean without them anyway.)




,  For this example, we will define f(x)=2x2+6x.{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x.}


f(x+Δx)=2(x+Δx)2+6(x+Δx)=2(x2+2xΔx+(Δx)2)+6x+6Δx=2x2+4xΔx+2(Δx)2+6x+6Δx.{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f(x+\Delta x)&=2(x+\Delta x)^{2}+6(x+\Delta x)\\&=2(x^{2}+2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^{2})+6x+6\Delta x\\&=2x^{2}+4x\Delta x+2(\Delta x)^{2}+6x+6\Delta x.\end{aligned}}}


, Then evaluate the limit.


ddxf(x)=limΔx→0(2x2+4xΔx+2(Δx)2+6x+6Δx)−(2x2+6x)Δx=limΔx→04xΔx+2(Δx)2+6ΔxΔx=limΔx→0Δx(4x+2Δx+6)Δx=limΔx→04x+2Δx+6=4x+6.{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}f(x)&=\lim _{\Delta x\to 0}{\frac {(2x^{2}+4x\Delta x+2(\Delta x)^{2}+6x+6\Delta x)-(2x^{2}+6x)}{\Delta x}}\\&=\lim _{\Delta x\to 0}{\frac {4x\Delta x+2(\Delta x)^{2}+6\Delta x}{\Delta x}}\\&=\lim _{\Delta x\to 0}{\frac {\Delta x(4x+2\Delta x+6)}{\Delta x}}\\&=\lim _{\Delta x\to 0}4x+2\Delta x+6\\&=4x+6.\end{aligned}}}

This is a lot of work for such a simple function. We will see that there are plenty of derivative rules to skirt past this type of evaluation.

You can find the slope anywhere on the function f(x)=2x2+6x.{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x.} Simply plug in any x value into the derivative df(x)dx=4x+6.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f(x)}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=4x+6.}


,

The formula is ddx(xn)=nxn−1.{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}(x^{n})=nx^{n-1}.}

Although the intuitive method seems to only apply to natural number exponents, it can be generalized to all real numbers; that is, n∈R.{\displaystyle n\in {\mathbb {R} }.}


, f(x)=2x2+6x.{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x.} Remember that x=x1.{\displaystyle x=x^{1}.}


f(x)=2x2+6xddxf(x)=(2)2x2−1+(1)6x1−1=4x+6.{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f(x)&=2x^{2}+6x\\{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}f(x)&=(2)2x^{2-1}+(1)6x^{1-1}\\&=4x+6.\end{aligned}}}

We have used the property that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives (technically, the reason why we can do this is because the derivative is a linear operator). Obviously, the power rule makes finding derivatives of polynomials much easier. 

Before going on, it is important to note that the derivative of a constant is 0, because the derivative measures the rate of change, and no such change exists with a constant.


, Taking a higher order derivative of a function just means you take the derivative of the derivative (for order of 2). For example, if it asks you to take the third derivative, just differentiate the function three times. For polynomial functions of degree n,{\displaystyle n,} the n+1{\displaystyle n+1} order derivative will be 0.
,


ddxf(x)=4x+6d2dx2f(x)=4d3dx3f(x)=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}f(x)&=4x+6\\{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}f(x)&=4\\{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{3}}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{3}}}f(x)&=0\end{aligned}}}

In most applications of derivatives, especially in physics and engineering, you will at most differentiate twice, or perhaps three times.


, In general, the derivative of a product does not equal the product of the derivatives. Rather, each function ""gets its turn"" to differentiate.


ddx(fg)=dfdxg+fdgdx{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}(fg)={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}g+f{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }g}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}}


, As with products in general, the derivative of a quotient does not equal the quotient of the derivatives.


ddx(fg)=gdfdx−fdgdxg2{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}\left({\frac {f}{g}}\right)={\frac {g{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}-f{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }g}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}}{g^{2}}}} 

A useful mnemonic for the numerator of the derivative is ""Down-dee-up, up-dee-down,"" since the minus sign means the order matters. 

For example, consider the function f(x)=x2+2x−21x−3.{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {x^{2}+2x-21}{x-3}}.} Let g(x)=x2+2x−21{\displaystyle g(x)=x^{2}+2x-21} and h(x)=x−3.{\displaystyle h(x)=x-3.} Then use the quotient rule.


ddx(gh)=(x−3)(2x+2)−(x2+2x−21)(1)(x−3)2=x2−6x+15(x−3)2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}\left({\frac {g}{h}}\right)&={\frac {(x-3)(2x+2)-(x^{2}+2x-21)(1)}{(x-3)^{2}}}\\&={\frac {x^{2}-6x+15}{(x-3)^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}



Make sure your algebra is up to par. Derivatives involving quotients like these can quickly become cumbersome in terms of the algebra involved. This means you should be comfortable with factoring out constants and keeping track of negative signs.


, For example, consider the scenario where z(y){\displaystyle z(y)} is a differentiable function of y{\displaystyle y} and y(x){\displaystyle y(x)} is a differentiable function of x.{\displaystyle x.} Then there is a composite function z(y(x)),{\displaystyle z(y(x)),} or z{\displaystyle z} as a function of x,{\displaystyle x,} that we can take the derivative of.


ddxz(y(x))=dzdydydx{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}z(y(x))={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}}

As with the product rule, this works with any number of functions; hence the ""chain"" rule. Here, an easy way to see how this works is if one imagines a dydy{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}} inserted between dzdx.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}.}


, Notice that this function can be decomposed into two elementary functions, g(x)=2x4−x{\displaystyle g(x)=2x^{4}-x} and h(g)=g3.{\displaystyle h(g)=g^{3}.} Then, we want to find the derivative of the composition f(x)=h(g(x)).{\displaystyle f(x)=h(g(x)).} 

Use the chain rule ddxh(g(x))=dhdgdgdx.{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}h(g(x))={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }h}{{\mathrm {d} }g}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }g}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}.} We have now written the derivative in terms of derivatives that are easier to take. Then,


ddxh(g(x))=3(2x4−x)2(8x3−1).{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}h(g(x))=3(2x^{4}-x)^{2}(8x^{3}-1).}

With practice, you will see that applying the chain rule is easiest if you ""peel away the onion."" The first layer is everything inside the parentheses, cubed. The second layer is the function inside the parentheses. When dealing with more complex functions, this way of thinking helps to keep yourself on track and not get lost in what functions are taken with respect to what variables, etc.


, Understanding the chain rule is a must in order to implicitly differentiate.

In other words, ∂∂y∂∂x=∂∂x∂∂y.{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}={\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}.} Note that these are second derivatives.
;
,  For our convenience, let's label P=2xy2−y2+2x{\displaystyle P=2xy^{2}-y^{2}+2{x}} and Q=2x2y−5−2xy.{\displaystyle Q=2x^{2}y-5-2xy.}


F=(2xy2−y2+2x)i+(2x2y−5−2xy)j{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=(2xy^{2}-y^{2}+2{x}){\mathbf {i} }+(2x^{2}y-5-2xy){\mathbf {j} }}

If this function satisfies Clairaut's theorem, then we should expect that ∂P∂y=∂Q∂x.{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial P}{\partial y}}={\frac {\partial Q}{\partial x}}.} These are second derivatives, because we are going off the assumption that F{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }} is conservative, and therefore F=∇f{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=\nabla f} - in other words, F{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }} is itself a gradient of a scalar potential function.


,


∂P∂y=4xy−2y{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial P}{\partial y}}=4xy-2y} 


∂Q∂x=4xy−2y{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial Q}{\partial x}}=4xy-2y}


, Our example obviously does. Our vector function is continuous (well-behaved), so this field is conservative. Most fields that you will deal with, especially in physics, will only need to satisfy Clariaut's theorem to be conservative. However, in pure math, this is not always quite the case.
, Conservative vector fields are irrotational, which means that the field has zero curl everywhere: ∇×F=0.{\displaystyle \nabla \times {\mathbf {F} }=0.} Because the curl of a gradient is 0, we can therefore express a conservative field as such provided that the domain of said function is simply-connected.


∇×∇f=0{\displaystyle \nabla \times \nabla f=0}

The last condition highlights an important limitation for functions that are not well-behaved. Although all conservative fields are irrotational, the converse is not true. Even if the function satisfies Clairaut's theorem, it may still not be conservative if there exists discontinuities or other singular points. 


, Above is a visualization of the vortex.


v=−yi+xj+0kx2+y2{\displaystyle {\mathbf {v} }={\frac {-y{\mathbf {i} }+x{\mathbf {j} }+0{\mathbf {k} }}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}}

For our convenience, let P=−yx2+y2{\displaystyle P={\frac {-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}} and Q=xx2+y2.{\displaystyle Q={\frac {x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}.}


, It is worth noting that the calculations in this step are equivalent to checking if the function is irrotational. Both methods involve the evaluation of the quantity ∂P∂y−∂Q∂x,{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial P}{\partial y}}-{\frac {\partial Q}{\partial x}},} or the k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }} component of the curl.


∂P∂y=(x2+y2)(−1)+y(2y)(x2+y2)2=y2−x2(x2+y2)2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial P}{\partial y}}&={\frac {(x^{2}+y^{2})(-1)+y(2y)}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}}\\&={\frac {y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}


∂Q∂x=(x2+y2)(1)−x(2x)(x2+y2)2=y2−x2(x2+y2)2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial Q}{\partial x}}&={\frac {(x^{2}+y^{2})(1)-x(2x)}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}}\\&={\frac {y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}

This calculation should've shown that our vortex is a conservative vector field. However, our intuition should've thought that this vortex has a non-zero curl, because of how the field seems to be circulating around the origin. Something is wrong with this function.


, If this field is indeed conservative, then we can say that a loop integral enclosing any part of the domain is 0. Consider the path of the unit circle in this field.

Set up the integral.


∮Cv⋅dr{\displaystyle \oint _{C}{\mathbf {v} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }}



Reparameterize the variables in terms of t.{\displaystyle t.}


x=cos⁡t{\displaystyle x=\cos t}


y=sin⁡t{\displaystyle y=\sin t}



Reparameterize the differential element in terms of t.{\displaystyle t.}


dr=dxi+dyj=−sin⁡tdti+cos⁡tdtj{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }&={\mathrm {d} }x{\mathbf {i} }+{\mathrm {d} }y{\mathbf {j} }\\&=-\sin t{\mathrm {d} }t{\mathbf {i} }+\cos t{\mathrm {d} }t{\mathbf {j} }\end{aligned}}}



Set up the integral in terms of t.{\displaystyle t.} Substitute and set the boundaries from 0{\displaystyle 0} to 2π,{\displaystyle 2\pi ,} since we are going around the circle.


∫02π(−sin⁡ti+cos⁡tj)⋅(−sin⁡tdti+cos⁡tdtj){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }(-\sin t{\mathbf {i} }+\cos t{\mathbf {j} })\cdot (-\sin t{\mathrm {d} }t{\mathbf {i} }+\cos t{\mathrm {d} }t{\mathbf {j} })}



Evaluate the integral.  We used the identity sin2⁡t+cos2⁡t=1{\displaystyle \sin ^{2}t+\cos ^{2}t=1} to simplify the dot product.


∫02πdt=2π{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }{\mathrm {d} }t=2\pi }



Because this loop integral does not evaluate to 0, this vector field is not conservative. The reason why this is the case is because our domain is not simply-connected.


, 

In order for a domain to just be connected, any two points must be able to be connected by a continuous line. The vortex satisfies this, so its domain is connected. 

To be simply-connected, every closed loop in the domain must also have its interior in the domain as well. The vortex fails this. Since the function is not defined at the origin, the unit circle we made as the closed loop does not have all of its interior within the function's domain. 

Another way of saying this is that any closed loop of an arbitrary shape in the domain can be topologically deformed to a point in the domain. In other words, we can squeeze the loop down to a point. Because the origin is not in the domain of the vortex function, the domain is not simply-connected. 

We have given an example of a function that satisfies Clairaut's theorem, but ended up failing path-independence anyway. So for a function to be conservative, its domain must also be simply-connected as well.

Review another example.",How to Use the Product Rule1," Differentiating works, at the first level, with equations that consist of a single function. The derivative (the result of differentiating) represents the instantaneous slope of the function at a given selected point.

Some easy examples of single functions and their derivatives are:


f(x)=x3{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}}………….. f′(x)=3x2{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=3x^{2}} 


g(x)=6x−4{\displaystyle g(x)=6x-4}………….g′(x)=6{\displaystyle g^{\prime }(x)=6}


h(x)=sin⁡x{\displaystyle h(x)=\sin x}………….h′(x)=cos⁡x{\displaystyle h^{\prime }(x)=\cos x}



If you need to review finding these single derivatives, you may want to read Take Derivatives.
;
, It is quite common for an equation to involve the product of two functions. This requires a special form to find the derivative. You cannot simply apply the “regular” rules of differentiating to a product.

Some product functions include the following:


f(x)=x3cos⁡x{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}\cos x}.....g(x)=x2(2x+3){\displaystyle g(x)=x^{2}(2x+3)}.....h(x)=sin⁡xex{\displaystyle h(x)=\sin xe^{x}}....., The product rule is a format for finding the derivative of the product of two or more functions. The product rule is formally stated as follows:If y=uv,{\displaystyle y=uv,} then dydx=dudxv+udvdx.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }u}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}v+u{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }v}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}.}

Another way to write this rule uses the shorthand notation f′{\displaystyle f^{\prime }} (read as “f-prime”), where the “prime” (apostrophe) represents the derivative of the function. With this notation, the product rule can be viewed as:

If y=uv,{\displaystyle y=uv,} then y′=u′v+uv′{\displaystyle y^{\prime }=u^{\prime }v+uv^{\prime }}



In short, the derivative of a product of two functions can be found by finding the derivatives of each function independently. You then multiply the derivative of the first function times the second original function, and add that to the product of the derivative of the second function time the first original function.


, For the equation you are trying to differentiate, the first step is to identify the two functions that form the product. It is helpful to identify them with separate variables, such as u{\displaystyle u} and v{\displaystyle v}.For example, given the equation y=x3cos⁡x{\displaystyle y=x^{3}\cos x}, you can separate the two functions as:


u=x3{\displaystyle u=x^{3}}


v=cos⁡x{\displaystyle v=\cos x}




, Once you have separated your original equation into its two parts, you then need to find the two separate derivatives.For the example y=x3cos⁡x{\displaystyle y=x^{3}\cos x}, these will be:


u′=3x2{\displaystyle u^{\prime }=3x^{2}}


v′=−sin⁡x{\displaystyle v^{\prime }=-\sin x}




, After you have found the separate derivatives, the next step is just to put the pieces together in the correct order. Recall that the product rule is:y′=u′v+uv′{\displaystyle y'=u'v+uv'}

Using the parts for this sample function, substitute the terms for u{\displaystyle u}, v{\displaystyle v}, u′{\displaystyle u^{\prime }} and v′{\displaystyle v^{\prime }} as follows:


y′=u′v+uv′{\displaystyle y^{\prime }=u^{\prime }v+uv^{\prime }}


y′=3x2cos⁡x+x3−sin⁡x{\displaystyle y^{\prime }=3x^{2}\cos x+x^{3}-\sin x}




, Occasionally, the product rule will result in a polynomial that can be simplified by combining like terms. With this example, that is not the case. The final result is:y′=3x2cos⁡x+x3−sin⁡x{\displaystyle y^{\prime }=3x^{2}\cos x+x^{3}-\sin x}


, Consider another example that was mentioned above, g(x)=x2(2x+3){\displaystyle g(x)=x^{2}(2x+3)}, and apply the product rule to find the derivative as follows:

Identify the two separate functions:


u=x2{\displaystyle u=x^{2}}


v=2x+3{\displaystyle v=2x+3}



Find the two derivatives:


u′=2x{\displaystyle u^{\prime }=2x}


v′=2{\displaystyle v^{\prime }=2}



Combine the parts together according the product rule:


g′(x)=2x(2x+3)+x2(2){\displaystyle g^{\prime }(x)=2x(2x+3)+x^{2}(2)}



Combine and simplify terms:


g′(x)=2x(2x+3)+x2(2){\displaystyle g^{\prime }(x)=2x(2x+3)+x^{2}(2)}


g′(x)=4x2+6x+2x2{\displaystyle g^{\prime }(x)=4x^{2}+6x+2x^{2}}


g′(x)=6x2+6x{\displaystyle g^{\prime }(x)=6x^{2}+6x}

Let f(x) = sqrt(x) and a = 1 and b = 4.


 


Subdivide the interval into n subintervals by a partition P, and choose n points wi, one in each subinterval. Draw n approximating rectangles with base and altitude f(wi), i = 1, 2, 3, ... , n; a typical one of these rectangles is shown in the diagram as Rect HGFE.
Revolve the region R about the x-axis to generate a solid of revolution, using the n rectangles to sweep out n right circular cylinders. The cylinders swept out by the typical rectangle, eg. Rect HGFE, is shown in the following Diagram; since the radius of its base is f(wi) and its altitude is ∆xi, its volume is ∆Vi = π*^2 *∆xi.





Note that if you want to create a washer type of form, the formula changes to π * ∫ba *dx -- so it is a definite integral of the difference of the squares of the external function, f(x), and the internal (hole) function, g(x).
Note also that you may let f be a continuous function on and if the region bounded by y = f(x), the x-axis, and the lines x = a and x = b lies in the first quadrant, the volume of the solid of revolution generated by revolving this region about the y-axis is V = 2π * ∫ba x*f(x)*dx, another definite integral.

, If the arc of the curve y = f(x), from the point (a, f(a)) to the point (b, f(b)) is revolved about the x-axis, a surface of revolution S is swept out.

Find the area of the surface of revolution by first partitioning into n intervals , i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n.
Let Qi be the point on the curve whose coordinates are (xi,f(xi)), and denote the point (a, f(a)) by Q0.
Then let the broken line formed by the n chords Qi-1Qi of the curve be revolved about the x-axis; it sweeps out a surface which approximates S, and this approximation improves as the norm |P| of the partition decreases.
Consider that the lateral area of a frustum of a cone, having slant height s and radius of its bases r1 and r2, is π*(r1 + r2)*s. Thus each chord Qi-1Qi, as it revolves about the x-axis, sweeps out the lateral surface of a frustum of a cone whose area is π**|Qi-1*Qi|.
Consider that, because of the formula for the arc distance (see the article Approximate Arc Length Using the Distance Formula), this may be re-written and defined as follows:

Let f and f' be continuous on with f(x) ⩾ 0 for a ⩽ x ⩽ b. The area of the surface of revolution swept out by revolving about the x-axis the segment of the curve y = f(x), from the point (a, f(a)) to the point (b, f(b)) is: 2π * ∫ba f(x)*sqrt(1+f'(x)^2)*dx.

Example: Find the area of the surface of revolution generated by revolving about the x-axis the segment of the curve y = sqrt(x) from (1,1) to (4,2).
Solution: By substituting f(x) = sqrt(x) and f '(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)) in the above formula, you get: 2π * ∫41 x^.5 * sqrt(1+(1/(2*sqrt(x)))^2)*dx =

∫05x3(25−x2)dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{5}x^{3}(25-x^{2}){\mathrm {d} }x}

Nothing is stopping you from expanding the integrand out and evaluating from there, but do you really want to deal with the huge numbers afterwards?
;
, This does a few things. First, the upper bound is set to unity. Second, this works out very nicely, because we see that there is a 25 in the integrand, a number divisible by 5. Fives are now being factored out from the integral. 


∫0153u3(25−52u2)5du{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}5^{3}u^{3}(25-5^{2}u^{2})5{\mathrm {d} }u}

We can clearly see that 56{\displaystyle 5^{6}} can be factored out of the integral. In fact, with practice, we can see this from the very start just by adding the exponents and remembering to add 1 for the dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} as well. Remember, dx=5du.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x=5{\mathrm {d} }u.}


56∫01u3(1−u2)du{\displaystyle 5^{6}\int _{0}^{1}u^{3}(1-u^{2}){\mathrm {d} }u}




,


56∫01u3(1−u2)du=56(14−16)=56224=56223{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}5^{6}\int _{0}^{1}u^{3}(1-u^{2}){\mathrm {d} }u&=5^{6}\left({\frac {1}{4}}-{\frac {1}{6}}\right)\\&=5^{6}{\frac {2}{24}}\\&={\frac {5^{6}}{2^{2}3}}\end{aligned}}}

Through this evaluation, we dealt with very small and simple numbers. By integrating normally, we would've dealt with numbers in the thousands and ten-thousands. 


, We have a nested exponent and a 3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}} in the upper bound now, but that does not dissuade us from scaling.


∫03x6(3−x2)3dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\sqrt {3}}x^{6}(3-x^{2})^{3}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, The nested exponent counts for 6, because the quantity inside counts for 2, and that is being cubed. Adding the factors up, we get 313/2{\displaystyle 3^{13/2}} outside of the integral.


313/2∫01u6(1−u2)3du{\displaystyle 3^{13/2}\int _{0}^{1}u^{6}(1-u^{2})^{3}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, Integrals that allow for scaling substitution can often yield multiple fractions with non-common denominators, so your arithmetic skills are put to the test.


313/2∫01u6(1−u2)3du=313/2∫01u6(1−3u2+3u4−u6)du=313/2(17−39+311−113)=313/2(327⋅11−163⋅13)=313/224(27⋅11−13⋅13)=313/224(78−773⋅7⋅11⋅13)=311/2247⋅11⋅13{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}3^{13/2}\int _{0}^{1}u^{6}(1-u^{2})^{3}{\mathrm {d} }u&=3^{13/2}\int _{0}^{1}u^{6}(1-3u^{2}+3u^{4}-u^{6}){\mathrm {d} }u\\&=3^{13/2}\left({\frac {1}{7}}-{\frac {3}{9}}+{\frac {3}{11}}-{\frac {1}{13}}\right)\\&=3^{13/2}\left({\frac {32}{7\cdot 11}}-{\frac {16}{3\cdot 13}}\right)\\&=3^{13/2}2^{4}\left({\frac {2}{7\cdot 11}}-{\frac {1}{3\cdot 13}}\right)\\&=3^{13/2}2^{4}\left({\frac {78-77}{3\cdot 7\cdot 11\cdot 13}}\right)\\&={\frac {3^{11/2}2^{4}}{7\cdot 11\cdot 13}}\end{aligned}}}


, We will show that scaling substitution can still work to an extent when there is not a good factor in the integrand. In this case, we have a 40 instead of a 36.


∫06x4(40−x2)(6+x)dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{6}x^{4}(40-x^{2})(6+x){\mathrm {d} }x}


,


∫06x4(40−x2)(6+x)dx=66∫01u4(40−36u2)(1+u)du=6622∫01u4(10−9u2)(1+u)du{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{0}^{6}x^{4}(40-x^{2})(6+x){\mathrm {d} }x&=6^{6}\int _{0}^{1}u^{4}(40-36u^{2})(1+u){\mathrm {d} }u\\&=6^{6}2^{2}\int _{0}^{1}u^{4}(10-9u^{2})(1+u){\mathrm {d} }u\end{aligned}}}


, Although we were not able to factor out a 62,{\displaystyle 6^{2},} we were  still able to get a 22{\displaystyle 2^{2}} out, which is a simplification. Note that 211 is a prime number.


6622∫01u4(10−9u2+10u−9u3)du=6622(105−97+106−98)=6622(21−97+53−98)=6622(113−1357⋅8)=6622(616−4057⋅3⋅23)=3525⋅2117{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}6^{6}2^{2}\int _{0}^{1}u^{4}(10-9u^{2}+10u-9u^{3}){\mathrm {d} }u&=6^{6}2^{2}\left({\frac {10}{5}}-{\frac {9}{7}}+{\frac {10}{6}}-{\frac {9}{8}}\right)\\&=6^{6}2^{2}\left({\frac {2}{1}}-{\frac {9}{7}}+{\frac {5}{3}}-{\frac {9}{8}}\right)\\&=6^{6}2^{2}\left({\frac {11}{3}}-{\frac {135}{7\cdot 8}}\right)\\&=6^{6}2^{2}\left({\frac {616-405}{7\cdot 3\cdot 2^{3}}}\right)\\&={\frac {3^{5}2^{5}\cdot 211}{7}}\end{aligned}}}

If this evaluation seems scary to you, consider that the numerator of the answer is greater than one million.

Apply the product rule to this first stage, so you will get:


f′(x)=u′(vw)+u(vw)′{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=u^{\prime }(vw)+u(vw)^{\prime }}



Now you need to apply the product rule a second time to break out the derivative of (vw){\displaystyle (vw)}:


f′(x)=u′(vw)+u(vw)′{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=u^{\prime }(vw)+u(vw)^{\prime }}


f′(x)=u′(vw)+u{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=u^{\prime }(vw)+u}


f′(x)=u′vw+uv′w+uvw′{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=u^{\prime }vw+uv^{\prime }w+uvw^{\prime }}




, As with the two-factor product rule, the first step in finding the derivative of the function is to define the separate functions that make up the whole. For clarity, you should write them out with individual variables. (Remember that these variables do not represent individual terms but are taking the place of full functions.)Work with the example given above, f(x)=x2exsin⁡x{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}e^{x}\sin x}. This can be broken into its three factors as follows:


u=x2{\displaystyle u=x^{2}}


v=ex{\displaystyle v=e^{x}}


w=sin⁡x{\displaystyle w=\sin x}




, Write them out separately as well.Continuing with the given example, the derivatives are:


u′=2x{\displaystyle u^{\prime }=2x}


v′=ex{\displaystyle v^{\prime }=e^{x}}  (remember that the derivative of the exponential function is itself)


w′=cos⁡x{\displaystyle w^{\prime }=\cos x}




, Apply the revised product rule for three factors and put the pieces together.Continue working with the given example:


f′(x)=u′vw+uv′w+uvw′{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=u^{\prime }vw+uv^{\prime }w+uvw^{\prime }}


f′(x)=2xexsin⁡x+x2exsin⁡x+x2excos⁡x{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=2xe^{x}\sin x+x^{2}e^{x}\sin x+x^{2}e^{x}\cos x}




, In this case, the only term that exists throughout the result is ex{\displaystyle e^{x}}, so simplifying doesn’t help very much. Just leave the final derivative as it is:f′(x)=2xexsin⁡x+x2exsin⁡x+x2excos⁡x{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=2xe^{x}\sin x+x^{2}e^{x}\sin x+x^{2}e^{x}\cos x}

∫0∞xs−1ex−1dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{s-1}}{e^{x}-1}}{\mathrm {d} }x}
;
, This allows us to rewrite the integral in terms of a power series 11−e−x=∑k=0∞e−kx.{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1-e^{-x}}}=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }e^{-kx}.}


∫0∞xs−1e−x1−e−xdx=∑k=0∞∫0∞xs−1e−(k+1)xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{s-1}e^{-x}}{1-e^{-x}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{s-1}e^{-(k+1)x}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, Then we see that the integral is simply the Gamma function after pulling the terms with k{\displaystyle k} out of the integral. Furthermore, the sum is simply the Riemann zeta function.


∑k=0∞∫0∞us−1(k+1)s−1e−uk+1du=(∑k=0∞1(k+1)s)Γ(s)=Γ(s)ζ(s){\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{\infty }\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {u^{s-1}}{(k+1)^{s-1}}}{\frac {e^{-u}}{k+1}}{\mathrm {d} }u=\left(\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(k+1)^{s}}}\right)\Gamma (s)=\Gamma (s)\zeta (s)}

This is a result that can be used to evaluate any types of integrals of this form. Furthermore, we can introduce additional parameters and differentiate under the integral to yield even more results, which we explore in part 2.


, These integrals can directly be evaluated using the Riemann zeta function and should be considered trivial.

∫0∞x3ex−1dx=π415{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{3}}{e^{x}-1}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi ^{4}}{15}}}


, We introduce an additional constant α,{\displaystyle \alpha ,} allowing us to determine some more integrals. Make sure that you verify this integral using u-substitution.


∫0∞xs−1eαx−1dx=Γ(s)ζ(s)αs{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{s-1}}{e^{\alpha x}-1}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\Gamma (s)\zeta (s)}{\alpha ^{s}}}}


, If you are familiar with differentiating under the integral, you will recognize that doing so will negate both the integral and the result, so the answers will stay positive no matter how many times we differentiate.

After simplifying, we get these results.


∫0∞xseαx(eαx−1)2dx=Γ(s+1)ζ(s)αs+1{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{s}e^{\alpha x}}{(e^{\alpha x}-1)^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\Gamma (s+1)\zeta (s)}{\alpha ^{s+1}}}}

For each of these integrals, we can set α=1{\displaystyle \alpha =1} to obtain these results.


∫0∞xsex(ex−1)2dx=Γ(s+1)ζ(s){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{s}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\Gamma (s+1)\zeta (s)}

We can also combine these results to obtain another integral. This identity can be verified by writing the right side in integral form and multiplying the top and bottom of the right integral by (ex−1).{\displaystyle (e^{x}-1).}


∫0∞xs(ex−1)2dx=Γ(s+1)(ζ(s)−ζ(s+1)){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{s}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\Gamma (s+1)(\zeta (s)-\zeta (s+1))}




, This introduces some more integrals involving logarithms. However, it also introduces derivatives of the Gamma function and the Riemann zeta function. Obviously, more of these can be found simply by repeatedly differentiating with respect to either α{\displaystyle \alpha } or s.{\displaystyle s.}

, Using the techniques discussed in this section, as well as u-substitution, we can evaluate these classes of integrals.

, In this section, we consider a related function to the Riemann zeta function whose terms alternate signs - the Dirichlet eta function. This relation can be derived in a similar manner as before. It converges whenever Re⁡(s)>0.{\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (s)>0.}


∫0∞xs−1ex+1dx=Γ(s)η(s)=Γ(s)2s−1−12s−1ζ(s){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{s-1}}{e^{x}+1}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\Gamma (s)\eta (s)=\Gamma (s){\frac {2^{s-1}-1}{2^{s-1}}}\zeta (s)}


, The same differentiation under the integral that was performed on the Riemann zeta function can be done on the Dirichlet eta function as well. We write some of these integrals below, where we set α=1{\displaystyle \alpha =1} at a convenient time.


∫0∞xsex(ex+1)2dx=Γ(s+1)η(s){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{s}e^{x}}{(e^{x}+1)^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\Gamma (s+1)\eta (s)}

, It turns out that the Dirichlet eta function is also useful in certain fields of physics, which is why we go over them in this article.

x(t)=5cos⁡t−2sin⁡2t+3cos⁡3t{\displaystyle x(t)=5\cos t-2\sin 2t+3\cos 3t}


y(t)=5sin⁡t+2cos⁡2t−3cos⁡3t{\displaystyle y(t)=5\sin t+2\cos 2t-3\cos 3t}

The graph above shows the curve in question. Using the normal techniques of calculus, we would have to split the integral into several smaller integrals - a needlessly tedious task. Using Green's theorem, however, we recognize that the area enclosed by the curve is completely determined by the values on the curve. 
;
, This is a problem that is easier done using the loop integral instead of the area integral. Since Green's theorem equates these two, what we find is that by setting this quantity to 1, the loop integral equals the area enclosed by the curve.

Let's choose F=xj.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=x{\mathbf {j} }.} Other choices work as well (see the tips), but we want our vector field to be as simple as possible. Then Green's theorem equates the two integrals below.


∫DdA=∮Cxdy{\displaystyle \int _{D}{\mathrm {d} }A=\oint _{C}x{\mathrm {d} }y}




, This differential is easy to find - we simply take the derivative of y(t){\displaystyle y(t)} as defined above. This step parameterizes the integral in terms of t{\displaystyle t} with bounds at 0{\displaystyle 0} and 2π.{\displaystyle 2\pi .}


dy=(5cos⁡t−4sin⁡2t+9sin⁡3t)dt{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }y=(5\cos t-4\sin 2t+9\sin 3t){\mathrm {d} }t}


∫02π(5cos⁡t−2sin⁡2t+3cos⁡3t)(5cos⁡t−4sin⁡2t+9sin⁡3t)dt{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }(5\cos t-2\sin 2t+3\cos 3t)(5\cos t-4\sin 2t+9\sin 3t){\mathrm {d} }t}


, Instead of multiplying everything out and evaluating manually, we use the identities listed in the Preliminaries section of this article to speed things up. These identities allow us to quickly judge which integrals go to 0 and which do not. Cosines want to match up with cosines, sines want to match up with sines, and the coefficient inside the argument must be the same too.

For example, the term 5cos⁡t{\displaystyle 5\cos t} is present in both parentheses. This means that it will contribute to the integral. The contribution depends on the product of their coefficients. In this case, it is 25, so this contribution will be 25π.{\displaystyle 25\pi .} 

The same type of evaluation can be seen with −2sin⁡2t{\displaystyle -2\sin 2t} and −4sin⁡2t.{\displaystyle -4\sin 2t.} We see that sin⁡2t{\displaystyle \sin 2t} is present in both of these expressions, so the contribution from this is 8π.{\displaystyle 8\pi .}

The other terms do not match up with any other terms. Therefore, the integral will simply be the sum of these individual contributions.

Γ(1+ϵ)=∫0∞xϵe−xdx=∑n=0∞ϵnn!∫0∞lnn⁡xe−xdx{\displaystyle \Gamma (1+\epsilon )=\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{\epsilon }e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{n}}{n!}}\int _{0}^{\infty }\ln ^{n}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x}
;
, See the tips for the derivation. Notice that we are writing out the logarithm of the Gamma function. Below, γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is the Euler-Mascheroni constant and ζ(j){\displaystyle \zeta (j)} is the Riemann zeta function.


ln⁡Γ(1+ϵ)=−γϵ+∑j=2∞(−1)jζ(j)jϵj{\displaystyle \ln \Gamma (1+\epsilon )=-\gamma \epsilon +\sum _{j=2}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{j}\zeta (j)}{j}}\epsilon ^{j}}

The goal of using these two different expressions is to equate the coefficients of ϵ.{\displaystyle \epsilon .} Because ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } is a small number, we can safely neglect any higher order terms. We can then evaluate the integral because the integral is part of the coefficient of an ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } term.


, For certain integrals that require an expansion of Γ(1/2+ϵ),{\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2+\epsilon ),} we can use a duplication formula to obtain expressions for Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma } for which we do know the expansions of.Below, we write out the formula explicitly.


Γ(1/2+ϵ)=π22ϵΓ(1+2ϵ)Γ(1+ϵ){\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2+\epsilon )={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2^{2\epsilon }}}{\frac {\Gamma (1+2\epsilon )}{\Gamma (1+\epsilon )}}}

This formula will be used in Example 2.


, The digamma function is the logarithmic derivative of the Gamma function, which is more generally used to evaluate the types of integrals discussed in this article.


Ψ(z)=ddzln⁡Γ(z)=Γ′(z)Γ(z){\displaystyle \Psi (z)={\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }z}}\ln \Gamma (z)={\frac {\Gamma ^{\prime }(z)}{\Gamma (z)}}}

We can then use this function to find coefficients of ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } in Taylor series expansions around points other than 1. We will use this in Example 3.


, As seen by the discussion above, the most relevant integrals on which we can use Gamma function expansions are integrals with a decaying exponential term and a logarithmic function raised to some positive integer power.


∫0∞x3ln2⁡xe−xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{3}\ln ^{2}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, The addition of the x3{\displaystyle x^{3}} term means that we must make a slight modification. We will need to use x3+ϵ{\displaystyle x^{3+\epsilon }} instead.


∫0∞x3+ϵe−xdx=Γ(4+ϵ)=(3+ϵ)(2+ϵ)(1+ϵ)Γ(1+ϵ)=∑n=0∞ϵnn!∫0∞x3lnn⁡xe−xdx{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{3+\epsilon }e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x&=\Gamma (4+\epsilon )=(3+\epsilon )(2+\epsilon )(1+\epsilon )\Gamma (1+\epsilon )\\&=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{n}}{n!}}\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{3}\ln ^{n}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x\end{aligned}}}


, Because ln2⁡x{\displaystyle \ln ^{2}x} in the integrand is being taken to the 2nd order, we want to find the coefficient of ϵ2{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{2}} while neglecting all higher-order terms. Because of the factorial in the integral expression, we will eventually multiply our answer by 2!=2.{\displaystyle 2!=2.} For now, we first expand.


Γ(4+ϵ)=(3+ϵ)(2+ϵ)(1+ϵ)Γ(1+ϵ)≈6(1+116ϵ+ϵ2)e−γϵ+ζ(2)2ϵ2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Gamma (4+\epsilon )&=(3+\epsilon )(2+\epsilon )(1+\epsilon )\Gamma (1+\epsilon )\\&\approx 6\left(1+{\frac {11}{6}}\epsilon +\epsilon ^{2}\right)e^{-\gamma \epsilon +{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}}\end{aligned}}}


, Again, we are neglecting all higher-order exponents, so we do not need to include those terms.


e−γϵ+ζ(2)2ϵ2≈1+(−γϵ+ζ(2)2ϵ2)+12!(−γϵ+ζ(2)2ϵ2)2≈1−γϵ+ζ(2)2ϵ2+γ22ϵ2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}e^{-\gamma \epsilon +{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}}&\approx 1+\left(-\gamma \epsilon +{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}\right)+{\frac {1}{2!}}\left(-\gamma \epsilon +{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}\right)^{2}\\&\approx 1-\gamma \epsilon +{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}+{\frac {\gamma ^{2}}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}\end{aligned}}}


, Again, neglect higher-order terms.


Γ(1+ϵ)≈6(1+116ϵ+ϵ2)(1−γϵ+ζ(2)2ϵ2+γ22ϵ2)≈6(1+(−γ+116)ϵ+(ζ(2)2+γ22−11γ6+1)ϵ2)≈6+(11−6γ)ϵ+(3ζ(2)+3γ2−11γ+6)ϵ2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Gamma (1+\epsilon )&\approx 6\left(1+{\frac {11}{6}}\epsilon +\epsilon ^{2}\right)\left(1-\gamma \epsilon +{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}+{\frac {\gamma ^{2}}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}\right)\\&\approx 6\left(1+\left(-\gamma +{\frac {11}{6}}\right)\epsilon +\left({\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}+{\frac {\gamma ^{2}}{2}}-{\frac {11\gamma }{6}}+1\right)\epsilon ^{2}\right)\\&\approx 6+(11-6\gamma )\epsilon +(3\zeta (2)+3\gamma ^{2}-11\gamma +6)\epsilon ^{2}\end{aligned}}}


, Remembering to multiply the coefficient of ϵ2{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{2}} by 2 because of the factorial, we arrive at our answer. 


∫0∞x3ln2⁡xe−xdx=6ζ(2)+6γ2−22γ+12{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{3}\ln ^{2}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=6\zeta (2)+6\gamma ^{2}-22\gamma +12}

Our answer also gives us the integrals of lower powers of the logarithm for free.


∫0∞x3ln⁡xe−xdx=11−6γ{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{3}\ln xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=11-6\gamma }


∫0∞x3e−xdx=6{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{3}e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=6}




, Using the example above, verify the following integrals by keeping terms up to ϵ4.{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{4}.} The other integrals should come out as a result of obtaining the first integral. You can leave your answers in terms of ζ.{\displaystyle \zeta .} It is interesting to note that the last integral in this list comes up while calculating the Laplace transform of the natural logarithm.


∫0∞ln4⁡xe−xdx=6ζ(4)+8γζ(3)+3ζ2(2)+6γ2ζ(2)+γ4{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\ln ^{4}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=6\zeta (4)+8\gamma \zeta (3)+3\zeta ^{2}(2)+6\gamma ^{2}\zeta (2)+\gamma ^{4}}

∫0∞ln⁡xe−xdx=−γ{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\ln xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=-\gamma }


, This example is an excellent example of an integral from which we cannot directly apply our techniques, because we don't have an expansion for Γ(1/2+ϵ).{\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2+\epsilon ).}


∫0∞xln2⁡xe−xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\sqrt {x}}\ln ^{2}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We start out by applying the standard treatment.


∫0∞x1/2+ϵe−xdx=∑n=0∞ϵnn!∫0∞xlnn⁡xe−xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/2+\epsilon }e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{n}}{n!}}\int _{0}^{\infty }{\sqrt {x}}\ln ^{n}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x}


∫0∞x1/2+ϵe−xdx=Γ(32+ϵ)=(12+ϵ)Γ(12+ϵ){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/2+\epsilon }e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=\Gamma \left({\frac {3}{2}}+\epsilon \right)=\left({\frac {1}{2}}+\epsilon \right)\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{2}}+\epsilon \right)}

As we can see, our calculation involves Γ(1/2+ϵ),{\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2+\epsilon ),} which we don't have an expansion for.


, The way we get around this is by using the duplication formula. Only then do we write these Gamma functions to the 2nd order. We also change the base of 22ϵ{\displaystyle 2^{2\epsilon }} to e2ln⁡2ϵ{\displaystyle e^{2\ln 2\epsilon }} in order to make the algebra simpler.


Γ(12+ϵ)≈πe−γ(2ϵ)+ζ(2)2(2ϵ)2e2ln⁡2ϵe−γϵ+ζ(2)2ϵ2≈πe−γϵ−2ln⁡2ϵ+32ζ(2)ϵ2≈π(1−γϵ−2ln⁡2ϵ+32ζ(2)ϵ2+12(γ+2ln⁡2)2ϵ2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{2}}+\epsilon \right)&\approx {\frac {{\sqrt {\pi }}e^{-\gamma (2\epsilon )+{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}(2\epsilon )^{2}}}{e^{2\ln 2\epsilon }e^{-\gamma \epsilon +{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}}}}\\&\approx {\sqrt {\pi }}e^{-\gamma \epsilon -2\ln 2\epsilon +{\frac {3}{2}}\zeta (2)\epsilon ^{2}}\\&\approx {\sqrt {\pi }}\left(1-\gamma \epsilon -2\ln 2\epsilon +{\frac {3}{2}}\zeta (2)\epsilon ^{2}+{\frac {1}{2}}(\gamma +2\ln 2)^{2}\epsilon ^{2}\right)\end{aligned}}}


, Then after simplifying and multiplying by 2 to account for the factorial, we arrive at the answer below.


∫0∞xln2⁡xe−xdx=π2(3ζ(2)+γ2+4γln⁡2+4ln2⁡2−4γ−8ln⁡2){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\sqrt {x}}\ln ^{2}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2}}(3\zeta (2)+\gamma ^{2}+4\gamma \ln 2+4\ln ^{2}2-4\gamma -8\ln 2)}

As usual, we also obtain two additional integrals as a result of our work. The latter, of course, is simply Γ(3/2).{\displaystyle \Gamma (3/2).}


∫0∞xln⁡xe−xdx=π(1−γ2−ln⁡2){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\sqrt {x}}\ln xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x={\sqrt {\pi }}\left(1-{\frac {\gamma }{2}}-\ln 2\right)}


∫0∞xe−xdx=π2{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\sqrt {x}}e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2}}}




, The exponent on the power term is 1/3 instead of 1/2, which means that we cannot use Legendre's duplication formula.


∫0∞x1/3ln⁡xe−xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/3}\ln xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, As usual, we consider the alternate integral and rewrite it as part of a Taylor series. Since the power on the log is 1, we need to find the coefficient of ϵ.{\displaystyle \epsilon .}


∫0∞x1/3+ϵe−xdx=∑n=0∞ϵnn!∫0∞lnn⁡xe−xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/3+\epsilon }e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{n}}{n!}}\int _{0}^{\infty }\ln ^{n}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x}


∫0∞x1/3+ϵe−xdx=(13+ϵ)Γ(13+ϵ){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/3+\epsilon }e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=\left({\frac {1}{3}}+\epsilon \right)\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{3}}+\epsilon \right)}


, This is easy - we simply expand using the Taylor series, making note of the fact that Γ′(1/3)=Γ(1/3)Ψ(1/3).{\displaystyle \Gamma ^{\prime }(1/3)=\Gamma (1/3)\Psi (1/3).}


Γ(1/3+ϵ)≈Γ(1/3)+(Γ(1/3)Ψ(1/3))ϵ{\displaystyle \Gamma (1/3+\epsilon )\approx \Gamma (1/3)+\left(\Gamma (1/3)\Psi (1/3)\right)\epsilon }


(1/3+ϵ)Γ(1/3+ϵ)≈13Γ(1/3)+ϵ{\displaystyle (1/3+\epsilon )\Gamma (1/3+\epsilon )\approx {\frac {1}{3}}\Gamma (1/3)+\left\epsilon }

It turns out that there are methods of calculating exact values for some rational arguments of the digamma function. However, we will not go into them here. The specific value of Ψ(1/3){\displaystyle \Psi (1/3)} can be found exactly and is given below.


Ψ(1/3)=−γ−3π6−32ln⁡3{\displaystyle \Psi (1/3)=-\gamma -{\frac {{\sqrt {3}}\pi }{6}}-{\frac {3}{2}}\ln 3}




, Notice we get the integral with the lower power for free. Of course, by definition, the integral equals Γ(4/3).{\displaystyle \Gamma (4/3).}


∫0∞x1/3ln⁡xe−xdx=13Γ(1/3)Ψ(1/3)+Γ(1/3){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/3}\ln xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{3}}\Gamma (1/3)\Psi (1/3)+\Gamma (1/3)}


∫0∞x1/3e−xdx=Γ(1/3)3{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/3}e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\Gamma (1/3)}{3}}}

Evaluate the integral in terms of the Gamma function.",How to Integrate Using the Gamma Function," The most important thing to check before doing the integral is to check that the integral actually converges. This integral certainly converges because the exponential decay term dominates for large x.{\displaystyle x.} This integral is one example of a more general integral which always converges, which we will evaluate next.


∫0∞x1/3e−3xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/3}e^{-3x}{\mathrm {d} }x}

Notice that no amount of integration by parts will solve this integral. 
;
, This allows the integral to be written with a e−u{\displaystyle e^{-u}} term, which is what the Gamma function demands. It doesn't matter what the exponent on the power term is. Each time we u-sub, we also have to back-sub in order to rewrite the power term in terms of u.{\displaystyle u.}


∫0∞x1/3e−3xdx=134/3∫0∞u1/3e−udu{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/3}e^{-3x}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{3^{4/3}}}\int _{0}^{\infty }u^{1/3}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u} 


, Instead of directly evaluating, we use the Gamma function to write our answer in terms of that function. Since the argument is shifted by 1, the integral will equal Γ(4/3).{\displaystyle \Gamma (4/3).}


134/3∫0∞u1/3e−udu=Γ(4/3)34/3{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3^{4/3}}}\int _{0}^{\infty }u^{1/3}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {\Gamma (4/3)}{3^{4/3}}}}


, It may seem pointless to write our answer in terms of this function, when we do not have a way of determining the actual value. However, there are methods to do so via other definitions. It is for this reason that we simplify our answer this way, so that we can allow computers to determine these specific values to extreme accuracy. The specific value Γ(1/3){\displaystyle \Gamma (1/3)} has been proven to be transcendental, so there is no way to write this number algebraically.


Γ(43)=13Γ(13){\displaystyle \Gamma \left({\frac {4}{3}}\right)={\frac {1}{3}}\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{3}}\right)}


Γ(4/3)34/3=Γ(1/3)37/3{\displaystyle {\frac {\Gamma (4/3)}{3^{4/3}}}={\frac {\Gamma (1/3)}{3^{7/3}}}}


, We assume that a,{\displaystyle a,} m,{\displaystyle m,} and n{\displaystyle n} are real numbers. Because this is a generalization, we have to be careful for which values that the integral fails to converge.


∫0∞xme−axndx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{m}e^{-ax^{n}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We can use the same technique used to evaluate the previous integral.


∫0∞xme−axndx=1an∫0∞(u1/na1/n)m−n+1e−udu{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{m}e^{-ax^{n}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{an}}\int _{0}^{\infty }\left({\frac {u^{1/n}}{a^{1/n}}}\right)^{m-n+1}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, Of course, we pull out constants. For our answer to be consistent with where the Gamma function converges, we must put the qualifier that m+1n>0.{\displaystyle {\frac {m+1}{n}}>0.}


∫0∞xme−axndx=1na1+mn−1+1nΓ(mn+1n)=Γ(m+1n)nam+1n{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{m}e^{-ax^{n}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{na^{1+{\frac {m}{n}}-1+{\frac {1}{n}}}}}\Gamma \left({\frac {m}{n}}+{\frac {1}{n}}\right)={\frac {\Gamma \left({\frac {m+1}{n}}\right)}{na^{\frac {m+1}{n}}}}}


, The integral is a product of three functions which also converges because the exponential decay term still dominates. The way we integrate this is to use Euler's formula and then to take the real part of our result.


∫0∞x2xe−xcos⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{2}{\sqrt {x}}e^{-x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x}


, Our u-sub will be u=(1−i)x{\displaystyle u=(1-i)x} from the way we have set up our integral. Every complex number should be rewritten in polar form in order to simplify the algebra.


∫0∞x2xe−(1−i)xdx=1(1−i)7/2∫0∞u5/2e−udu{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{2}{\sqrt {x}}e^{-(1-i)x}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{(1-i)^{7/2}}}\int _{0}^{\infty }u^{5/2}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, We then use the recursion relation to get the argument between 0 and 1. After simplifying further, we multiply by (−1)eiπ,{\displaystyle (-1)e^{i\pi },} or 1, in order to get the angle in the exponent to something more manageable.


1(1−i)7/2∫0∞u5/2e−udu=Γ(7/2)(2e−iπ/4)7/2=−15π8⋅27/4e−iπ/8{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{(1-i)^{7/2}}}\int _{0}^{\infty }u^{5/2}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {\Gamma (7/2)}{({\sqrt {2}}e^{-i\pi /4})^{7/2}}}=-{\frac {15{\sqrt {\pi }}}{8\cdot 2^{7/4}}}e^{-i\pi /8}}


, We can evaluate cosπ8{\displaystyle \cos {\frac {\pi }{8}}} using the half-angle identity.


∫0∞x2xe−xcos⁡xdx=−15π8⋅27/4cosπ8=−152π642+1{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{2}{\sqrt {x}}e^{-x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x=-{\frac {15{\sqrt {\pi }}}{8\cdot 2^{7/4}}}\cos {\frac {\pi }{8}}=-{\frac {15{\sqrt {2\pi }}}{64}}{\sqrt {{\sqrt {2}}+1}}}

We can take the imaginary part as well to obtain the sine integral for free. This is the benefit to working with trigonometric functions.


∫0∞x2xe−xsin⁡xdx=152π642−1{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{2}{\sqrt {x}}e^{-x}\sin x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {15{\sqrt {2\pi }}}{64}}{\sqrt {{\sqrt {2}}-1}}}


, We cannot directly use the Gamma function because our bounds are from 0 to 1 and there exists a logarithm inside a square root.


∫01x3xln1xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{3}{\sqrt {x\ln {\frac {1}{x}}}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, This has the effect of changing the bounds, which are then negated because of the differential du=−1xdx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=-{\frac {1}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x.} It works out nicely that the back-sub puts the exponential function into the integrand, allowing the Gamma function to do its work.


∫01x3xln1xdx=∫0∞u1/2e−9u/2du{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{3}{\sqrt {x\ln {\frac {1}{x}}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int _{0}^{\infty }u^{1/2}e^{-9u/2}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, Another u-sub should be used. The value Γ(32)=π2{\displaystyle \Gamma \left({\frac {3}{2}}\right)={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2}}} occurs often enough that you may as well memorize it. Otherwise, going back to the recursion relation is a good way to check your work. As standard, if you can write the value in terms of constants, do so. Otherwise, just leave it in terms of the Gamma function.


∫0∞u1/2e−9u/2du=(29)3/2Γ(32)=2π27{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }u^{1/2}e^{-9u/2}{\mathrm {d} }u=\left({\frac {2}{9}}\right)^{3/2}\Gamma \left({\frac {3}{2}}\right)={\frac {\sqrt {2\pi }}{27}}}


, The integral below is divergent. You can verify this by using the u-sub u=x.{\displaystyle u={\sqrt {x}}.} However, there is a method by which we can assign a value to this integral in a way that makes sense. This is called regularization. The standard method is by introducing a term e−ϵf(x),{\displaystyle e^{-\epsilon f(x)},} where f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} is a positive function on the interval [0,∞).{\displaystyle [0,\infty ).}


∫0∞cosxdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\cos {\sqrt {x}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, The integral changes to taking the limit as ϵ→0+.{\displaystyle \epsilon \to 0^{+}.} Because this is an exponential term, it does not matter what function we choose in the exponent, as long as it is a positive function. We simply chose x{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}} for convenience.


∫0∞cosxdx=limϵ→0+∫0∞e−ϵxcosxdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\cos {\sqrt {x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\lim _{\epsilon \to 0^{+}}\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-\epsilon {\sqrt {x}}}\cos {\sqrt {x}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, This allows us to rewrite the integral in terms of the Gamma function.


limϵ→0+∫0∞e−ϵxcosxdx=2limϵ→0+∫0∞ue−ϵucos⁡udu{\displaystyle \lim _{\epsilon \to 0^{+}}\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-\epsilon {\sqrt {x}}}\cos {\sqrt {x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=2\lim _{\epsilon \to 0^{+}}\int _{0}^{\infty }ue^{-\epsilon u}\cos u{\mathrm {d} }u}


∫0∞ue−(ϵ−i)udu{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }ue^{-(\epsilon -i)u}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, Remember to set ϵ=0{\displaystyle \epsilon =0} at the earliest convenient time.


2limϵ→0+∫0∞ue−(ϵ−i)udu=2limϵ→0+1(ϵ−i)2=−2{\displaystyle 2\lim _{\epsilon \to 0^{+}}\int _{0}^{\infty }ue^{-(\epsilon -i)u}{\mathrm {d} }u=2\lim _{\epsilon \to 0^{+}}{\frac {1}{(\epsilon -i)^{2}}}=-2}

Finally, we take the real part of our answer. The handling of these integrals must be done very carefully because of the divergence. 


limϵ→0+∫0∞e−ϵxcosxdx=−2{\displaystyle \lim _{\epsilon \to 0^{+}}\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-\epsilon {\sqrt {x}}}\cos {\sqrt {x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=-2}



We can also figure out the corresponding sine integral simply by taking the imaginary part of our result.


limϵ→0+∫0∞e−ϵxsinxdx=0{\displaystyle \lim _{\epsilon \to 0^{+}}\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-\epsilon {\sqrt {x}}}\sin {\sqrt {x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=0}

If you are working with a square in the real world, use a ruler or piece of measuring tape to find the length. Since all four sides of the square are the same length, you can use any side of the square. If you do not know the length of one side of the square, you cannot use this method.

For example, you might want to find the length of the diagonal of a square that has sides 5 centimeters long.
;
, In the formula d{\displaystyle d} equals the length of the diagonal and s{\displaystyle s} equals one side of the square.This formula is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem (a2+b2=c2){\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2})}. A diagonal divides a square into two congruent right triangles, thus, you can use the side lengths of the square to find the length of the diagonal (which would be the hypotenuse of the right triangle).


, Make sure you are substituting for the variable s{\displaystyle s}.

For example, if the square has a side length of 5 centimeters, set up the formula like this:d=52{\displaystyle d=5{\sqrt {2}}}


, This will give you the length of the diagonal. It’s best to perform the calculation on a calculator, so that you can get a more precise result. If you don’t have a calculator, you can round 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} to 1.414.

For example, if you are calculating the diagonal of a 5-centimeter square, your formula will look like this:d=52{\displaystyle d=5{\sqrt {2}}}d=7.07{\displaystyle d=7.07}So, the diagonal of the square is 7.07 centimeters long.

To find the length of the diagonal, you must first find the length of one side of the square, so you need to set up the perimeter formula and solve for s{\displaystyle s}. 


, Make sure you are substituting for the variable P{\displaystyle P}.

For example, if the perimeter of the square is 20 centimeters, your formula will look like this:20=4s{\displaystyle 20=4s}


, To do this, divide each side of the equation by 4. This will give you the length of one side of the square.

Ask questions in class. Your teacher is there to make sure you have a solid grasp on the material. If you have a question, don’t hesitate to ask it. Some of the other students in the class likely have the same question.
Prepare for class by reading the lesson you are going to cover ahead of time and know the formulas, theorems, and postulates by heart.
Pay attention to your teacher while you are in class. You can talk to your classmates at break or after school.;
, Geometry is the math of shapes and angles.To understand geometry, it is easier to visualize the problem and then draw a diagram. If you're asked about some angles, draw them. Relationships like vertical angles are much easier to see in a diagram; if one isn't provided, draw it yourself.


Understanding the properties of shapes and visualizing them is essential to succeeding in geometry.
Practice recognizing shapes in various orientations and based on their geometric properties ( the measure of angles, number of parallel and perpendicular lines, etc).

, Study groups are a good way to learn the material and clarify concepts you don’t understand. Having a group that meets on a regular schedule will also force you to stay on top of the material and try your best to comprehend it. Studying with classmates is useful when you come to more difficult topics. You can work through them together to figure them out.


One of your study mates may understand something that you don’t and help you out with it. You might also be able to help them understand something and learn it better by teaching them.

, A protractor is a semicircle-shaped tool used to measure the degree of an angle. It can also be used to draw angles. Knowing how to properly use a protractor is an essential skill in geometry. To measure the degree of an angle:


Align the center hole of the protractor over the vertex (center point) of the angle.
Rotate the protractor until the baseline is on top of one leg of the angle.
Extend the angle up to the arc of the protractor and record the degree it falls upon. This is the measurement of the angle.

, Homework is assigned because it helps you learn all of the concepts in the material. Doing the homework teaches you what you really understand and what topics you might need to put more time into.


If you come across a topic in your homework that you are struggling with, focus on that topic until you understand it. Ask you classmates or your teacher to help you out.

, When you have a firm understanding of a topic or concept, you should be able to teach it to someone else. If you can’t explain it to them so that they also understand, you likely don’t get it as well as you thought either. Teaching material to others is also a good way to enhance your own memory or recall of the topic.Try teaching your sibling or parent some geometry.
Take the lead in a study group to explain something you know really well.

, Geometry is as much a skill as a branch of knowledge. Simply studying the rules of geometry will not be enough to get an A, you need to practice solving problems. This means doing your homework and working extra problems for any trouble areas.


Make sure to do as many practice problems as you can from other sources. Similar problems may be worded in a different way that might make more sense to you.
The more problems you solve, the easier it will be to solve them in the future.

, Sometimes going to class and talking to your teacher just isn’t enough. You might need to find a tutor who has more time to focus specifically on what you are struggling with. Working with someone one-on-one can be very useful in understanding difficult material.


Ask your teacher if there are tutors available through the school.
Attend any extra tutoring sessions held by your teacher and ask your questions.

, Geometry is founded upon the basis of five postulates put together by the ancient mathematician, Euclid.Knowing and understanding these five statements will help you understand many of the concepts in geometry.


1: A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.
2: Any straight line segment can be continued in either direction indefinitely in a straight line.
3. A circle can be drawn around any line segment with one end of the line segment serving as the center point and the length of the line segment serving as the radius of the circle.
4. All right angles are congruent (equal).
5. Given a single line and a single point, only one line can be drawn directly through the point that will be parallel to the first line.

, When you first start learning geometry, the various symbols can seem overwhelming. Learning what each of them means and being able to immediately recognize them will make things easier. Here are some of the most common geometry symbols you will come across:A small triangle refers to the properties of a triangle.
A small angle shape refers to the properties of an angle.
Letters with a line over them refer to the properties of a line segment.
Letters with a line over them with arrows at each end refer to the properties of a line.
One horizontal line with a vertical line in the middle means that two lines are perpendicular to each other.
Two vertical lines mean two lines are parallel to each other.
An equal sign with a squiggly line on top means that two shapes are congruent.
A squiggly line means that two shapes are similar.
Three dots forming a triangle means “therefore”.

, A line is straight and extends infinitely in both directions. Lines are drawn with an arrow at the end to indicate that they continue on. A line segment has a beginning and an end point. Another form of a line is called a ray: it only extends infinitely in one direction. Lines can be parallel, perpendicular, or intersecting.When two lines are parallel they never intersect with each other.
Perpendicular lines are two lines that form a 90° angle.
Intersecting lines are two lines that cross each other. Intersecting lines can be perpendicular, but can never be parallel.

, There are three different types of angles: obtuse, acute, and right. An obtuse angle is one that measures greater than 90°; an acute angle is on that measures less than 90°, and a right angle is one the measures exactly 90°.Being able to identify angles is an important part of geometry.


A 90° angle is also a perpendicular angle: the lines make a perfect corner.

, The Pythagorean Theorem states that a2 + b2 = c2.It is the formula that allows you to calculate the length of the side of a right triangle if you know the lengths of the other two sides. A right triangle is a triangle with one 90° angle. In the theorem, a and b are the opposite and adjacent (straight) sides of the triangle, while c is the hypotenuse (angled line) of the triangle.


For example: Find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with side a = 2 and b =3.
a2 + b2 = c2

22 + 32 = c2

4 + 9 = c2

13 = c2

c = √13
c = 3.6

, There are three different types of triangle: scalene, isosceles, and equilateral. A scalene triangle has no congruent (identical) sides and no congruent angles. An isosceles triangle has, at least, two congruent sides and two congruent angles. An equilateral triangle has three identical sides and three identical angles. Knowing these types of triangles helps you identify properties and postulates associated with them.Remember, that an equilateral triangle is technically also an isosceles triangle because it does have two congruent sides. All equilateral triangles are isosceles, but not all isosceles triangles are equilateral.
Triangles can also be classified by their angles: acute, right, and obtuse. Acute triangles have angles that are all less than 90°; right triangles have one 90° angle; obtuse triangles have one angle that is greater than 90°.

, Similar shapes are those that have identical corresponding angles and corresponding sides that are proportionally smaller or larger than each other. In other words, the polygon will have the same angles, but different side lengths. Congruent shapes are identical; they are the same shape and size.Corresponding angles are identical angles in two shapes. In a right triangle, the 90-degree angles in both triangles are corresponding. The shapes do not have to be the same size for their angles to be corresponding.

, Complementary angles are those angles which add together to make 90 degrees, supplementary angles add to 180 degrees. Remember that vertical angles are always congruent; similarly, alternate interior and alternate exterior angles are also always congruent. Right angles are 90 degrees, while straight angles are 180.


Vertical angles are the two angles formed by two intersecting lines that are directly opposite each other.Alternate interior angles are formed when two lines intersect a third line. They are on opposite sides of the line they both intersect, but on the inside of each individual line.Alternate exterior angles are also formed when two lines intersect a third line. They are on opposite sides of the line they both intersect, but on the outside of each individual line., SOHCAHTOA is a mnemonic device used to remember the formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent in a right triangle. When you want to find the sine, cosine, or tangent of an angle, you use the following formulas: Sine = Opposite/Hypotenuse, Cosine = Adjacent/Hypotenuse, and Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent.For example: Find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the 39° angle of a right triangle with side AB = 3, BC = 5 and AC = 4.
sin(39°) = opposite/hypotenuse = 3/5 = 0.6
cos(39°) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 4/5 = 0.8
tan(39°) = opposite/adjacent = 3/4 = 0.75

, Sometimes the problem will be provided without an image and you will have to diagram it yourself to visualize the proof. Once you have a rough sketch that matches the givens in a problem, you might need to re-draw the diagram so that you can read everything clearly and the angles are approximately correct.


Make sure to label everything very clearly based on the information provided.
The clearer your diagram, the easier it will be to think through the proof.

, Label right angles and equal lengths. If lines are parallel to each other, mark that down as well. If the problem does not explicitly state two lines are equal, can you prove that they are? Make sure you can prove all of your assumptions.


Write down the relationships between various lines and angles that you can conclude based on your diagram and assumptions.
Write down the givens in the problem. In any geometric proof, there is some information that is given by the problem. Writing them down first can help you think through the process needed for the proof.

, When you are proving something in geometry, you are given some statements about the shapes and angles, then asked to prove why these statements are true. Sometimes the easiest way to do this is to start with the end of the problem.


How does the problem come to that conclusion?
Are there a few obvious steps that must be proved to make this work?

, In order to make a solid proof, you have to make a statement and then give the geometric reason that proves the truth of that statement. Underneath the statement column, you will write a statement such as angle ABC = angle DEF. Under the reason, you will write the proof for this. If it is given, simply write given, otherwise, write the theorem that proves it.

, There are many individual theorems in geometry that can be used for your proof. There are many properties of triangles, intersecting and parallel lines, and circles that are the basis for these theorems. Determine what geometric shapes you are working with and find the ones that apply to your proof. Reference previous proofs to see if there are similarities. There are too many theorems to list, but here are a few of the most important ones for triangles:CPCTC: corresponding parts of the congruent triangle are congruent
SSS: side-side-side: if three sides of one triangle are congruent to three sides of a second triangle, then the triangles are congruent
SAS: side-angle-side: if two triangles have a congruent side-angle-side, then the two triangles are congruent
ASA: angle-side-angle: if two triangles have a congruent angle-side-angle, then the two triangles are congruent
AAA: angle-angle-angle: triangles with congruent angles are similar, but not necessarily congruent

, Write down a quick sketch of your proof outline. Write down the reasons for each step. Add the given statements where they belong, not just all at once in the beginning. Re-order the steps if necessary.


The more proofs you do, the easier it will be to order the steps properly.

, The final step should complete your proof, but it still needs a reason to justify it. When you have finished the proof, look it over and make sure there are no gaps in your reasoning. Once you have determined that the proof is sound, write QED at the bottom right corner to signify it is complete.

Sometimes it's easier to draw a half-circle in one direction, and then to come back and draw another half-circle in the other direction.;
, Move it towards the top of the circle. Do not change the angle or settings of the compass.

, Make it distinct, but not too dark -- you'll be erasing it later. Remember to maintain the angle you've set for the compass.

, Place the point right on the mark.

, This should create a second mark a distance away from the first mark. If you’ve been moving clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle, continue to do so.

, You should end up back at the mark where you originally started. If you don’t, it’s likely that the angle of your compass changed while you worked, possibly from squeezing it too firmly or letting it loosen a bit.

, The six places where your marks cross the edge of the circle are the six points of your hexagon. Use your ruler and a pencil to draw a straight line segment that connects the adjacent dots.

, These include your original circle, the marks along the edges, and any other marks you made along the way. Once you've erased your guiding lines, your perfect hexagon should be complete.

Count the number of sides in the polygon.,
Find the total measure of all angles in the polygon.,
Determine if the polygon is a regular polygon.,
Add the measures of the known angles of the polygon together, then subtract it from the total angle measure of the polygon.",How to Calculate Angles1,";
, The formula for finding the total measure of all interior angles in a polygon is (‘’n’’ – 2) x 180, where ‘’n’’ is the number of sides, as well as the number of angles, the polygon has.Some common polygon total angle measures are as follows:


The angles in a triangle (a 3-sided polygon) total 180 degrees.
The angles in a quadrilateral (a 4-sided polygon) total 360 degrees.
The angles in a pentagon (a 5-sided polygon) total 540 degrees.
The angles in a hexagon (a 6-sided polygon) total 720 degrees.
The angles in an octagon (an 8-sided polygon) total 1080 degrees.

, A regular polygon is a polygon whose sides are all the same length and whose angles all have the same measure. Equilateral triangles and squares are examples of regular polygons, while the Pentagon in Washington DC is an example of a regular pentagon and a stop sign is an example of a regular octagon.


If the polygon is a regular polygon, simply divide the total measure of all its angles by the number of its angles.Thus, the measure of each angle in an equilateral triangle is 180/3, or 60 degrees, and the measure of each angle in a square is 360/4, or 90 degrees. (Although a rectangle is not a regular polygon, by definition, all its angles are also right angles, measuring 90 degrees each.)
If the polygon is not a regular polygon, you need to know the measures of the other angles in the polygon to calculate the measure of an unknown angle. Proceed to the next step.

, Most geometry problems of this nature work with triangles or quadrilaterals, because there are fewer numbers to work with, so we’ll do likewise.


If two of the angles of a triangle have measures of 60 and 80 degrees, add the numbers together to get a sum of 140. Then, subtract this sum from the total angle measure for a triangle, which is 180 degrees: 180 – 140 = 40 degrees. (This kind of triangle, where all the angles have different measures, is called a scalene triangle.)
You can write the above method out as a formula: ‘’a’’ = 180 – (‘’b’’ + ‘’c’’), where ‘’a’’ is the angle whose measure you’re trying to find, and ‘’b’’ and ‘’c’’ are the angles whose measures you already know. For polygons with more than 3 sides, simply replace “180” with the total angle measure of the polygon and add another term for each additional known angle.
Some polygons offer “cheats” to help you figure out the measure of the unknown angle. An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two sides of equal length and two angles of equal measure. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite sides of equal lengths and angles diagonally opposite each other of equal measure.

For example, you might draw points A, B, and C in any position you'd like.;
, Noncollinear means that they are not on the same line. You can draw a circle from any three points, as long as they are not on the same line.If you aren’t sure whether the points are collinear, lay a straightedge across them. If the straightedge passes through all three points, the points are collinear, and you cannot use them to draw a circle.

, Use a straightedge to connect all of the points.For example, you might draw line segments AB and BC.

, To do this, place the compass tip on the first endpoint. Open the compass to a little more than halfway across the line segment. Draw an arc across the line segment., Without changing the width of the compass, place the compass tip on the second endpoint. Draw a second arc across the line segment.The two arcs should intersect above and below the line.

, Line up a straightedge with the intersection of the arcs above the line, and the intersection of the arcs below the line. Draw a line connecting these two points. The line you draw is a perpendicular bisector. It bisects the line at a right angle., Use a compass and straightedge to construct the bisectors as you did with the first line segment.Extend the bisectors long enough that they intersect. The point of their intersection is the center of the circle., The radius of a circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle’s edge.To set the width, place the tip of the compass on the center of the circle, and open the compass to any one of your original points.For example, you might set the tip of the compass on the circle center, and reach the pencil to point B.

, Swing the compass around 360 degrees so that it draws a complete circle. The circle should pass through all three points.

, For a neat circle, make sure to erase your line segments, arcs, and perpendicular bisectors.

π=3.14{\displaystyle \pi =3.14}


r=radius{\displaystyle r={\text{radius}}}


;
, The radius of a sphere is the measure from the center of the sphere to the outer edge. If you are given a problem to calculate volume, you will probably be given the radius. Otherwise, the radius can be difficult to measure because you cannot accurately reach the center of a solid object.Suppose you are told that a sphere exists with a radius of 10 cm. Find the volume as follows:


Volume=43πr3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}}


Volume=43∗(3.14)∗103{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}*(3.14)*10^{3}}


Volume=4.18667∗1000{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4.18667*1000}


Volume=4186.67cm3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4186.67{\text{cm}}^{3}}




, Alternatively, a given situation may provide you with the diameter of a sphere. The diameter is equal to double the radius. In more concrete terms, the diameter is the distance that passes from one edge of the sphere through the center to the opposite edge. To calculate volume beginning with the diameter (d), revise the formula as follows:Volume=43π(d2)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {d}{2}})^{3}}

As an example of this calculation, find the volume of a sphere whose diameter is 10 cm.


Volume=43π(d2)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {d}{2}})^{3}}


Volume=43π(102)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {10}{2}})^{3}}


Volume=43∗(3.14)∗(53){\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}*(3.14)*(5^{3})}


Volume=4.18667∗125{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4.18667*125}


Volume=523.3cm3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=523.3{\text{cm}}^{3}}




, The circumference of a sphere is probably the easiest one for you to measure directly. You can use a tape measure, wrap it carefully around the widest part of the sphere, and take the measurement. Alternatively, you may be provided the circumference in a stated problem. To find the volume beginning with the circumference (C), revise the formula as follows:Volume=43πr3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}}


Volume=43π∗(C2π)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi *({\frac {C}{2\pi }})^{3}}


Volume=43π∗(C38π3){\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi *({\frac {C^{3}}{8\pi ^{3}}})}


Volume=C36π2{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {C^{3}}{6\pi ^{2}}}}


, Suppose you are given a sphere and you measure the circumference to be 32 cm. Find its volume:


Volume=C36π2{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {C^{3}}{6\pi ^{2}}}}


Volume=3236∗3.142{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {32^{3}}{6*3.14^{2}}}}


Volume=32,76859.158{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {32,768}{59.158}}}


Volume=553.9cm3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=553.9{\text{cm}}^{3}}


, A final, practical method for measuring volume is to submerge the sphere into water. You need to have a beaker large enough to hold the sphere, with accurate volume measurement markings.Pour enough water into the beaker to cover the sphere. Make note of the measurement.

Place the sphere into the water. Notice that the water level rises. Make note of the new measurement.

Subtract the first measurement from the second. The result is the volume of the sphere.

For example, suppose your water level rises from 100 ml to 625 ml when you submerge the sphere. The volume is therefore 525 ml. Note that 1 ml=1 cm3.




, To calculate mass from volume, you must know the density of the object. Different materials have different densities. Consider a sphere made of styrofoam, for example, and compare its weight to a sphere the same size made of iron. Iron has a much greater density and will therefore have a greater mass.

You can find densities of many solid materials by looking up density tables online, in textbooks or in other industry catalogs.

For example, here are the recorded densities of some solid materials:Aluminum = 2700 kg/m3

Butter = 870 kg/m3

Lead = 11,350 kg/m3

Pressed wood = 190 kg/m3




, The units you used in calculating volume must match the volume units in the density measurement. If they do not, then you must convert them.

All of the examples in the previous section resulted in volumes measured in cubic centimeters. However, the cited density table provides densities based on cubic meters. Because there are 100 centimeters in a meter, there are 106 cubic centimeters in a cubic meter. Divide the given densities by 106 to represent the density in units of kg/cm3. (You can do this most easily by just moving the decimal point 6 spaces to the left.)

For the four sample materials, the converted densities are as follows:

Aluminum = 2700 kg/m3 = 0.0027 kg/cm3

Butter = 870 kg/m3 = 0.00087 kg/cm3

Lead = 11,350 kg/m3 = 0.01135 kg/cm3

Pressed wood = 190 kg/m3 = 0.00019 kg/cm3




, Recall that the formula for density is Density=MassVolume{\displaystyle {\text{Density}}={\frac {\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}}}. Rearranging this to find the mass, the equation becomes Density∗Volume=Mass{\displaystyle {\text{Density}}*{\text{Volume}}={\text{Mass}}}.Using the four sample materials, aluminum, butter, lead and pressed wood, find the mass of a sphere that has a volume of 500 cm3.


Aluminum:500 cm3∗0.0027kgcm3=1.35 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Aluminum}}:500{\text{ cm}}^{3}*0.0027{\frac {\text{kg}}{{\text{cm}}^{3}}}=1.35{\text{ kg}}}


Butter:500 cm3∗0.00087kgcm3=0.435 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Butter}}:500{\text{ cm}}^{3}*0.00087{\frac {\text{kg}}{{\text{cm}}^{3}}}=0.435{\text{ kg}}}


Lead:500 cm3∗0.01135kgcm3=5.675 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Lead}}:500{\text{ cm}}^{3}*0.01135{\frac {\text{kg}}{{\text{cm}}^{3}}}=5.675{\text{ kg}}}


Pressed wood:500 cm3∗0.00019kgcm3=0.095 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Pressed wood}}:500{\text{ cm}}^{3}*0.00019{\frac {\text{kg}}{{\text{cm}}^{3}}}=0.095{\text{ kg}}}




, When answering problems about mass calculations, you need to read the full problem carefully. As you read, it may help to highlight the given data. Read the whole problem carefully to see what you are being asked to solve. For example, consider the following problem:


A large sphere made of solid brass has a diameter of 1.2 m. Find the mass of the sphere.


, Reading the problem carefully, you should identify that you are given the diameter, so you will use the adjusted formula:


Volume=43π(d2)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {d}{2}})^{3}}

You should also notice that the sphere is made of brass. You will need to look up the density of brass from a density table online. 

From the website, EngineeringToolbox.com, you can find that the density of brass is 8480 kg/m3. Because the diameter of the sphere was given in meters, its volume will be calculated in cubic meters, so you do not need to convert the density.




, To calculate the volume, set up the correct formula, fill in the data you know and perform the calculations as follows:


Volume=43π(d2)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {d}{2}})^{3}}


Volume=43π(1.22)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {1.2}{2}})^{3}}


Volume=4.18667∗0.63{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4.18667*0.6^{3}}


Volume=4.18667∗0.216{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4.18667*0.216}


Volume=0.90432 m3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=0.90432{\text{ m}}^{3}}


, Recall that Mass=Density∗Volume{\displaystyle {\text{Mass}}={\text{Density}}*{\text{Volume}}}.Insert the values that you know to find the mass:


Mass=Density∗Volume{\displaystyle {\text{Mass}}={\text{Density}}*{\text{Volume}}}


Mass=8480 kg m3∗0.90432 m3{\displaystyle {\text{Mass}}=8480{\frac {\text{ kg}}{{\text{ m}}^{3}}}*0.90432{\text{ m}}^{3}}


Mass=7668.6 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Mass}}=7668.6{\text{ kg}}}

, You can use a ruler, book, or any straight edge to do this. If you do have a ruler, you can find the halfway mark by measuring the vertical length of the circle and splitting it in half.

, Since you already have a line running down the middle of the circle, the X will have to be taller than it is wide to keep the pieces even. Just think of this as slicing a pizza into 6 equal pieces.

, To do this, simply use a ruler to draw a straight line under the curved part of each section, connecting it to the other two straight lines to form a triangle. Repeat this process six times. You can think of this as forming a ""crust"" around your pizza slices.

, The diagonal line on the left side should be opening up toward the left, and the diagonal line on the right side should be opening up toward the right. You can think of each of these lines forming a 120 degree angle with the horizontal line.

, They should create a mirror-image of the first two diagonal lines. The line on the bottom left should look like a reflection of the line on the top left, and the line on the bottom right should look like a reflection of the line on the top right. While the top lines were moving outward from the top horizontal line, the bottom lines should move inward from the bottom edges of the top lines, toward the space where the base will be.

, This will form the base of the hexagon. It should ideally be parallel to the top horizontal line. This will complete your hexagon.

Assess what you already know.,
Determine the right trigonometric function to use.,
Find the ratio of the two known sides.,
Find the angle that corresponds to the trig function ratio.",How to Calculate Angles2," A right triangle is so named because one of its angles is a right angle. You can find the measure of one of the other angles if you know either of these things:


The measure of the third angle. In this case, you add its measure to 90, the number of degrees in the right angle and subtract that total from 180.
The measure of any two of the triangle’s sides. In this case, you can find the measure of the angle using trigonometry., Trigonometric functions are ratios between two of the three sides of the triangle. Although there are six trigonometric functions, the following three are used most often:


If you know the length of the side opposite the angle and the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), you can use the sine function, which is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.
If you know the length of the side adjacent to the angle and the length of the hypotenuse, you can use the cosine function, which is the length of the adjacent side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.
If you know the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides, you can use the tangent function, which is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the adjacent side., For the purposes of this example, we’ll assume we know the side opposite the angle has a length of 5 units and the hypotenuse has a length of 10 units. Because we know the opposite and hypotenuse, the ratio we’re finding is the sine.


Dividing the opposite’s value of 5 by the hypotenuse’s value of 10 yields 5 / 10 = 0.5.

, Because we’re using the sine to find the angle measure, the angle we’re looking for is called the arcsine or inverse sine. There are two ways to find it:


In the days before calculators, you would consult a printed table of values for sines, cosines, and tangents for angles from 0 to 90 degrees. Read down the Sine column until you find the value “0.5” and then look at the angle measure corresponding to that sine value.
With a calculator with trig function capability, you input the sine value (if you didn’t already divide the opposite by the hypotenuse with the calculator to find it) and then press the appropriate key or keys. Depending on the brand of calculator you have, you may press a single key labeled “sin-1” or a key labeled “Inv,” “2ndF,” or “Shift” before pressing the “sin” key.Whichever method you use for this example, you should find the angle has a measure of 30 degrees.

α is the measured angle between lines drawn from the center of the circle to adjacent vertices.
For a dodecagon, n=12. A dodecagon has 12 sides and 12 vertices, so 360° divided by 12 comes out to be 30° and α=30°.

The function f(x,y){\displaystyle f(x,y)} is differentiable at the point (x0,y0){\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0})} if and only if it can be written in the form below, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are constants, and ξ{\displaystyle \xi } is an error term.


f(x,y)=f(x0,y0)+a(x−x0)+b(y−y0)⏟tangent plane+ξ(x,y)⏟error term{\displaystyle f(x,y)=\underbrace {f(x_{0},y_{0})+a(x-x_{0})+b(y-y_{0})} _{\text{tangent plane}}+\underbrace {\xi (x,y)} _{\text{error term}}}

Given any ϵ>0,{\displaystyle \epsilon >0,} there exists a δ>0{\displaystyle \delta >0} such that |ξ(x,y)|<ϵ(x−x0)2+(y−y0)2{\displaystyle |\xi (x,y)|<\epsilon {\sqrt {(x-x_{0})^{2}+(y-y_{0})^{2}}}} whenever 0<(x−x0)2+(y−y0)2<δ.{\displaystyle 0<{\sqrt {(x-x_{0})^{2}+(y-y_{0})^{2}}}<\delta .}



What does all this mean? Essentially, a function differentiable at a point can be written as a tangent plane with a correcting term. That means the function must be locally linear near the point. – If you zoom in on the function at that point, equivalent to choosing a smaller and smaller ϵ,{\displaystyle \epsilon ,} the function begins to look more and more like a plane.

So in order for this function to be differentiable, this error term must get smaller faster than a linear approach. If you approached the point linearly (or worse) from some distance (the reason why you see the distance square root), then you get something similar to the shape of an absolute value, or a cusp, and we know that the function at such a point is not differentiable. That is why we have the inequality involving |ξ(x,y)|.{\displaystyle |\xi (x,y)|.}
;
, If the function z=f(x,y){\displaystyle z=f(x,y)} is differentiable at the point (x0,y0):{\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0}):}

Then the partial derivative with respect to x{\displaystyle x} is intuitively the slope of the tangent line at (x0,y0){\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0})} parallel to the xz-axis, where x{\displaystyle x} approaches x0{\displaystyle x_{0}} (see the visual above, where the tangent line is on x=1{\displaystyle x=1}). In other words, it is the limit of difference quotients. Mathematically, we can write it as follows.


a=∂f∂x|(x0,y0)=limx→x0f(x,y0)−f(x0,y0)x−x0{\displaystyle a={\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}{\Bigg |}_{(x_{0},y_{0})}=\lim _{x\to x_{0}}{\frac {f(x,y_{0})-f(x_{0},y_{0})}{x-x_{0}}}}



The partial derivative with respect to y{\displaystyle y} works in a similar manner. The slope of the tangent line is now parallel to the yz-axis. 


b=∂f∂y|(x0,y0)=limy→y0f(x0,y)−f(x0,y0)y−y0{\displaystyle b={\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}{\Bigg |}_{(x_{0},y_{0})}=\lim _{y\to y_{0}}{\frac {f(x_{0},y)-f(x_{0},y_{0})}{y-y_{0}}}}



As with the ordinary derivative, using the definition is almost never the practical way to evaluate derivatives. Rather, several techniques are used to bypass the definition. It is important, though, that you understand the definition and how partials generalize ordinary derivatives to whatever the number of dimensions might be, not just two. 


, All of the properties of ordinary derivatives listed below carry over to partials as well. These properties are all theorems, but we will not prove them here. All properties assume that the derivative exists at a particular point.

The derivative of a constant times a function equals the constant times the derivative of the function, i.e. you can factor scalars out. When dealing with partial derivatives, not only are scalars factored out, but variables that we are not taking the derivative with respect to are as well.


ddxcf(x)=cddxf(x){\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}cf(x)=c{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}f(x)}



The derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. This and the previous property both stem from the fact that the derivative is a linear operator, which by definition must satisfy exactly these two types of conditions. 


ddx(f(x)+g(x))=ddxf(x)+ddxg(x){\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}(f(x)+g(x))={\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}f(x)+{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}g(x)}



If a function is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous at that point. The converse is obviously not true: If you completely understood step 1 you would realize that a function containing a cusp is continuous at, but is not differentiable at the cusp.


,


f(x,y)=2x2y3−3x4y2{\displaystyle f(x,y)=2x^{2}y^{3}-3x^{4}y^{2}}


, Use the power rule ddxxn=nxn−1{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}x^{n}=nx^{n-1}} for x{\displaystyle x} only.


∂f∂x=2⋅2x2−1y3−4⋅3x4−1y2=4xy3−12x3y2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}&=2\cdot 2x^{2-1}y^{3}-4\cdot 3x^{4-1}y^{2}\\&=4xy^{3}-12x^{3}y^{2}\end{aligned}}}


, Second order partial derivatives can either be ""pure"" or mixed. 

The notation for pure second derivatives is straightforward. 


fxx(x0,y0)=∂2f∂x2=limx→x0fx(x,y0)−fx(x0,y0)x−x0{\displaystyle f_{xx}(x_{0},y_{0})={\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}}=\lim _{x\to x_{0}}{\frac {f_{x}(x,y_{0})-f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})}{x-x_{0}}}}


fyy(x0,y0)=∂2f∂y2=limy→y0fy(x0,y)−fy(x0,y0)y−y0{\displaystyle f_{yy}(x_{0},y_{0})={\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial y^{2}}}=\lim _{y\to y_{0}}{\frac {f_{y}(x_{0},y)-f_{y}(x_{0},y_{0})}{y-y_{0}}}}



Mixed derivatives are when the second (or higher) derivative is being taken with respect to a variable other than the first. The subscript notation consists of higher derivatives written to the right, while Leibniz's notation has the higher derivatives written to the left. Be careful of the order.


fxy(x0,y0)=∂2f∂y∂x=limy→y0fx(x0,y)−fx(x0,y0)y−y0{\displaystyle f_{xy}(x_{0},y_{0})={\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial y\partial x}}=\lim _{y\to y_{0}}{\frac {f_{x}(x_{0},y)-f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})}{y-y_{0}}}}


fyx(x0,y0)=∂2f∂x∂y=limx→x0fy(x,y0)−fy(x0,y0)x−x0{\displaystyle f_{yx}(x_{0},y_{0})={\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x\partial y}}=\lim _{x\to x_{0}}{\frac {f_{y}(x,y_{0})-f_{y}(x_{0},y_{0})}{x-x_{0}}}}




, Pay attention to what variables you are taking the partial with respect to, and in what order you are taking them in. 

Let's find the derivative of the result we got in the previous section with respect to y.{\displaystyle y.} In other words, we are finding fxy.{\displaystyle f_{xy}.}


∂f∂x=4xy3−12x3y2{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}=4xy^{3}-12x^{3}y^{2}}


∂2f∂y∂x=12xy2−24x3y{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial y\partial x}}=12xy^{2}-24x^{3}y}



Now let's find the other mixed derivative, or fyx.{\displaystyle f_{yx}.}


∂f∂y=6x2y2−6x4y{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}=6x^{2}y^{2}-6x^{4}y}


∂2f∂x∂y=12xy2−24x3y{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x\partial y}}=12xy^{2}-24x^{3}y}



Notice that the mixed derivatives are the same! This is sometimes known as Clairaut's theorem: if fxy{\displaystyle f_{xy}} and fyx{\displaystyle f_{yx}} are continuous at (x0,y0),{\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0}),} then they are equal. The requirement that the derivatives be continuous means that this theorem only applies for smooth, well-behaved functions.


, The single-variable product rule carries over naturally to multivariable calculus; each function ""gets its turn"" to differentiate.


∂∂xf(x,y)g(x,y)=∂f∂xg+f∂g∂x{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}f(x,y)g(x,y)={\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}g+f{\frac {\partial g}{\partial x}}}


,


z=xexy2{\displaystyle z=xe^{x}y^{2}}


, Let f(x,y)=x{\displaystyle f(x,y)=x} and g(x,y)=exy2.{\displaystyle g(x,y)=e^{x}y^{2}.}


∂z∂x=exy2+xexy2{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial z}{\partial x}}=e^{x}y^{2}+xe^{x}y^{2}}


, The single-variable quotient rule carries over naturally as well. However, it is generally easier to convert a function so that you can use the product rule instead.


∂∂xf(x,y)g(x,y)=g∂f∂x−f∂g∂xg2{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}{\frac {f(x,y)}{g(x,y)}}={\frac {g{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}-f{\frac {\partial g}{\partial x}}}{g^{2}}}}


,


z=2x2yxy2+1{\displaystyle z={\frac {2x^{2}y}{xy^{2}+1}}}


,


∂z∂y=(xy2+1)(2x2)−(2x2y)(2xy)(xy2+1)2=2x2(1−xy2)(xy2+1)2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial z}{\partial y}}&={\frac {(xy^{2}+1)(2x^{2})-(2x^{2}y)(2xy)}{(xy^{2}+1)^{2}}}\\&={\frac {2x^{2}(1-xy^{2})}{(xy^{2}+1)^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}


, Here, f(x,y){\displaystyle f(x,y)} is a function of x{\displaystyle x} and y,{\displaystyle y,} which are in turn written in terms of two other variables s{\displaystyle s} and t.{\displaystyle t.} In other words, we are dealing with a composition of functions f(x(s,t),y(s,t)).{\displaystyle f(x(s,t),y(s,t)).}


f(x,y)=3x2y−4xy3{\displaystyle f(x,y)=3x^{2}y-4xy^{3}}


x(s,t)=st−3s2{\displaystyle x(s,t)=st-3s^{2}}


y(s,t)=s+t{\displaystyle y(s,t)=s+t}


, Because f{\displaystyle f} is not defined directly in terms of (s,t),{\displaystyle (s,t),} we need to use the chain rule. The multivariable analog of the chain rule involves taking partial derivatives with each of the variables that f{\displaystyle f} is written in terms of. Because we are dealing with several variables here, it is important to keep track of what is being held constant.


(∂f∂t)s=(∂f∂x)y(∂x∂t)s+(∂f∂y)x(∂y∂t)s{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}\right)_{s}=\left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}\right)_{y}\left({\frac {\partial x}{\partial t}}\right)_{s}+\left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}\right)_{x}\left({\frac {\partial y}{\partial t}}\right)_{s}}


,


(∂f∂x)y=6xy−4y3{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}\right)_{y}=6xy-4y^{3}}


(∂x∂t)s=s{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial x}{\partial t}}\right)_{s}=s}


(∂f∂y)x=3x2−12xy2{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}\right)_{x}=3x^{2}-12xy^{2}}


(∂y∂t)s=1{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial y}{\partial t}}\right)_{s}=1}


(∂f∂t)s=(6xy−4y3)s+3x2−12xy2{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}\right)_{s}=(6xy-4y^{3})s+3x^{2}-12xy^{2}}


, We use the function defined in the previous section (the chain rule). We are now holding the expression xy2{\displaystyle xy^{2}} constant. Few of the previous techniques will be of any use to us in solving this problem because of what is being held constant.


(∂f∂y)xy2{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}\right)_{xy^{2}}}


f(x,y)=3x2y−4xy3{\displaystyle f(x,y)=3x^{2}y-4xy^{3}}


, The goal here is to replace dx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x.}


df=(6xy−4y3)dx+(3x2−12xy2)dy{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }f=(6xy-4y^{3}){\mathrm {d} }x+(3x^{2}-12xy^{2}){\mathrm {d} }y}


d(xy2)=y2dx+2xydy{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }(xy^{2})=y^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x+2xy{\mathrm {d} }y}


, It is being held constant. Then evaluate for ∂x.{\displaystyle \partial x.}


y2∂x+2xy∂y=0{\displaystyle y^{2}\partial x+2xy\partial y=0}


∂x=−2xy∂y{\displaystyle \partial x=-{\frac {2x}{y}}\partial y}


,


∂f=(6xy−4y3)(−2xy∂y)+2xy∂y=(−12x2+8xy2)∂y+2xy∂y{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\partial f&=(6xy-4y^{3})\left(-{\frac {2x}{y}}\partial y\right)+2xy\partial y\\&=(-12x^{2}+8xy^{2})\partial y+2xy\partial y\end{aligned}}}


(∂f∂y)xy2=2xy−12x2+8xy2{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}\right)_{xy^{2}}=2xy-12x^{2}+8xy^{2}}

;
, Differentiate u{\displaystyle u} to find du=2xdx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=2x{\mathrm {d} }x} and integrate dv{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v} to get v=−cos⁡x.{\displaystyle v=-\cos x.} We can drop the constant of integration from finding v{\displaystyle v} because it will eventually drop out in the end.

∫−∞∞sin⁡xxdx{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {\sin x}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x}

We see from the graph that sin⁡xx{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin x}{x}}} is an even function, which can be confirmed by looking at the function above. Then, we can factor out a 2.


2∫0∞sin⁡xxdx{\displaystyle 2\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {\sin x}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x}



The integral above with bounds of 0 to infinity is also known as the Dirichlet integral.
;
, The purpose of defining such a function with an argument t{\displaystyle t} is so that we can work with an integral that is easier to evaluate, whilst meeting the conditions of the sinc integral for appropriate values of t.{\displaystyle t.} In other words, putting the e−tx{\displaystyle e^{-tx}} term inside the integral is valid, since the integral converges for all t≥0,{\displaystyle t\geq 0,} while setting t=0{\displaystyle t=0} recovers the original integral. This reformulation means that we are ultimately evaluating G(0).{\displaystyle G(0).}


G(t)=∫0∞sin⁡xxe−txdx{\displaystyle G(t)=\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {\sin x}{x}}e^{-tx}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We can move the derivative under the integration sign because the integral is being taken with respect to a different variable. While we do not justify this operation here, it is widely applicable for a great many functions. Keep in mind that t{\displaystyle t} is to be treated as a variable throughout the evaluation, not a constant.

dGdt(1+t2)=(0−1)+(0−0){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }G}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}(1+t^{2})=(0-1)+(0-0)}


dGdt=−11+t2{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }G}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}=-{\frac {1}{1+t^{2}}}}


, This recovers G(t){\displaystyle G(t)} under a different variable. Since the integrand is the differential of a well-known function, this evaluation is trivial.


−∫11+t2dt=−tan−1⁡t+C{\displaystyle -\int {\frac {1}{1+t^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }t=-\tan ^{-1}t+C}

Here, we recognize that G(t)=0{\displaystyle G(t)=0} as t→∞{\displaystyle t\to \infty } for both this integral and the one defined in step 2. However, limt→∞tan−1⁡t=π2,{\displaystyle \lim _{t\to \infty }\tan ^{-1}t={\frac {\pi }{2}},} so C=π2{\displaystyle C={\frac {\pi }{2}}} as well.

Therefore, G(t)=−tan−1⁡t+π2.{\displaystyle G(t)=-\tan ^{-1}t+{\frac {\pi }{2}}.}


, Now that we have G(t),{\displaystyle G(t),} where t≥0,{\displaystyle t\geq 0,} we can substitute 0 for t{\displaystyle t} and find that G(0)=π2.{\displaystyle G(0)={\frac {\pi }{2}}.}


G(0)=∫0∞sin⁡xxdx=π2{\displaystyle G(0)=\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {\sin x}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{2}}}

Finally, we recall that to integrate over all the reals, we simply multiply by 2, as sinc⁡x{\displaystyle \operatorname {sinc} x} is an even function.

Those familiar with polar coordinates will understand that the area element dA=rdrdθ.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }A=r{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta .} This extra r stems from the fact that the side of the differential polar rectangle facing the angle has a side length of rdθ{\displaystyle r{\mathrm {d} }\theta } to scale to units of distance. A similar thing is occurring here in spherical coordinates.


, Choose a coordinate system that allows for the easiest integration. 

Notice that ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } has a range of ,{\displaystyle ,} not .{\displaystyle .} This is because θ{\displaystyle \theta } already has a range of ,{\displaystyle ,} so the range of ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } ensures that we don’t integrate over a volume twice.

In general, a good u-sub involves the derivative of u cancelling out part of the integrand. The easiest integrals are those where it includes a function ax{\displaystyle ax} (any multiple of x{\displaystyle x}) nested within another elementary function - in these cases, the nested function will be u.

Consider the integral ∫sin⁡(2x)dx.{\displaystyle \int \sin(2x){\mathrm {d} }x.}

Here, the function 2x{\displaystyle 2x} is nested inside another elementary function, the sine function. Because the derivative of 2x{\displaystyle 2x} is just a constant, we don't need to worry about introducing any unnecessary variables. Therefore, make the substitution u=2x.{\displaystyle u=2x.}
;
, Take the derivative of u with respect to x, and solve for du.


dudx=2du=2dx{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }u}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}&=2\\{\mathrm {d} }u&=2{\mathrm {d} }x\end{aligned}}}

As you improve your technique, you will eventually jump straight to the differential instead of solving for it. 


,


∫sin⁡(2x)dx=12∫sin⁡udu{\displaystyle \int \sin(2x){\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{2}}\int \sin u{\mathrm {d} }u}

Here, we wrote the integral using du by solving for dx and replacing it. This is why there is an extra 1/2 term (which we can factor out).

If you are left with a variable which is not u after replacing anything that you can with u and du, sometimes solving for that variable in terms of u and replacing it works. This is called back-substitution, and the supplementary example below will use such a substitution.


,


12∫sin⁡u=−12cos⁡u+C{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\int \sin u=-{\frac {1}{2}}\cos u+C}


, Replace u with what you set it equivalent to earlier.


−12cos⁡u+C=−12cos⁡(2x)+C{\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{2}}\cos u+C=-{\frac {1}{2}}\cos(2x)+C}

As we can see, u-substitution is just the analogue of the chain rule from differential calculus.


, This example demonstrates u-substitution of definite integrals and trigonometric functions.

Consider the integral ∫0πsin3⁡θdθ.{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi }\sin ^{3}\theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta .}

Notice that this function does not have a nested function within another function that we can use. If we consider this as a sine function cubed, the resulting u-sub will get us nowhere. However, using the trigonometric identity sin2⁡θ=1−cos2⁡θ,{\displaystyle \sin ^{2}\theta =1-\cos ^{2}\theta ,} we can rewrite the integrand as (1−cos2⁡θ)sin⁡θ.{\displaystyle (1-\cos ^{2}\theta )\sin \theta .}

Recall that ddθcos⁡θ=−sin⁡θ.{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\cos \theta =-\sin \theta .} Remember that in general, we want u so that its differential ends up canceling out part of the integrand. In this case, the sin⁡θ.{\displaystyle \sin \theta .}

Therefore, make the substitution u=cos⁡θ.{\displaystyle u=\cos \theta .}


, Take the derivative of u, and solve for du.

From above, du=−sin⁡θdθ.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=-\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta .}


, Make sure to change your boundaries as well, since you changed variables. To do so, simply substitute the boundaries into your u-substitution equation.


∫0π(1−cos2⁡θ)sin⁡θdθ=−∫1−1(1−u2)du{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi }(1-\cos ^{2}\theta )\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta =-\int _{1}^{-1}(1-u^{2}){\mathrm {d} }u}


, Now, recognize that swapping the boundaries negates the integral, so we end up with a positive integral in the end.


−∫1−1(1−u2)du=∫−11(1−u2)du{\displaystyle -\int _{1}^{-1}(1-u^{2}){\mathrm {d} }u=\int _{-1}^{1}(1-u^{2}){\mathrm {d} }u}


,

The integrand is an even function, and the boundaries are symmetric. Therefore, we can factor out a 2 and set the lower boundary to 0 to simplify calculations. 


∫−11(1−u2)du=2∫01(1−u2)du=2(1−13)=43{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{-1}^{1}(1-u^{2}){\mathrm {d} }u&=2\int _{0}^{1}(1-u^{2}){\mathrm {d} }u\\&=2\left(1-{\frac {1}{3}}\right)\\&={\frac {4}{3}}\end{aligned}}}

We did not need to do this simplification to get the correct answer, but for more complicated integrals, this technique is useful to prevent arithmetic mistakes.

Notice that we did not rewrite our integral in terms of the original variable. Since we changed our boundaries, the integrals are equivalent. Ultimately, the objective is to solve the problem in the easiest and most efficient way possible, so there's no need to spend more time on an extra step.


, This is a more advanced example that incorporates u-substitution. In part 1, recall that we said that an integral after performing a u-sub may not cancel the original variables, so solving for the variable in terms of u{\displaystyle u} and substituting may be required. That will also be necessary in this problem. 


∫02x2+4x+2dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2}{\frac {x^{2}+4}{x+2}}{\mathrm {d} }x}

We see that the derivative x2+4{\displaystyle x^{2}+4} is 2x,{\displaystyle 2x,} not x+2.{\displaystyle x+2.} If we try to immediately u-sub, we will end up with an increasingly complicated expression, because solving for x{\displaystyle x} in terms of u{\displaystyle u} will wind up with a square root. 


, Notice that the numerator just requires a 4x{\displaystyle 4x} to complete the square. If we just add and then subtract 4x,{\displaystyle 4x,} i.e. add 0, then we can reduce the problem to a more manageable one after simplifying.


∫02x2+4x+2dx=∫02x2+4+4x−4xx+2dx=∫02((x+2)2x+2−4xx+2)dx=∫02(x+2)dx−4∫02xx+2dx=6−4∫02xx+2dx{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{0}^{2}{\frac {x^{2}+4}{x+2}}{\mathrm {d} }x&=\int _{0}^{2}{\frac {x^{2}+4+4x-4x}{x+2}}{\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\int _{0}^{2}\left({\frac {(x+2)^{2}}{x+2}}-{\frac {4x}{x+2}}\right){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\int _{0}^{2}(x+2){\mathrm {d} }x-4\int _{0}^{2}{\frac {x}{x+2}}{\mathrm {d} }x\\&=6-4\int _{0}^{2}{\frac {x}{x+2}}{\mathrm {d} }x\end{aligned}}}

It is worth noting that this technique of adding 0 is a very useful one, especially in the context of completing the square. Since 0 is the additive identity, we have not actually changed the integral.


, The integral in the last line above is perhaps the simplest type of expression where this sort of ""back substitution"" is required - that is, solving for x{\displaystyle x} in terms of u{\displaystyle u} and plugging that in as well (x=u−2),{\displaystyle (x=u-2),} since the u-sub didn't cancel all the x{\displaystyle x} terms. Remember to change your boundaries. 


6−4∫02xx+2dx=6−4∫24u−2udu=6−4∫24(1−2u)du{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}6-4\int _{0}^{2}{\frac {x}{x+2}}{\mathrm {d} }x&=6-4\int _{2}^{4}{\frac {u-2}{u}}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&=6-4\int _{2}^{4}\left(1-{\frac {2}{u}}\right){\mathrm {d} }u\end{aligned}}}


,

First, it is related to the inverse tangent function, which allows for easy evaluation (make sure that you are able to evaluate this integral the standard way). Second, we introduce a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} as parameters independent of x,{\displaystyle x,} so that the integral depends on these two parameters.


∫−∞∞1ax2+bdx=πab{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {1}{ax^{2}+b}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{\sqrt {ab}}}}
;
, The trick here is that we can pull the differentiation operator under the integral. Since we differentiate our result as well, we are essentially turning an integration problem into a differentiation problem. Notice that as the integral gets negated, the result also negates because of the negative exponent, so the answers will stay positive.


dda∫−∞∞1ax2+bdx=∫−∞∞∂∂a1ax2+bdx{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }a}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {1}{ax^{2}+b}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {\partial }{\partial a}}{\frac {1}{ax^{2}+b}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


∫−∞∞x2(ax2+b)2dx=π2a3b{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {x^{2}}{(ax^{2}+b)^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{2{\sqrt {a^{3}b}}}}}

We can differentiate again and again until we get the integral we want. Now, we can easily evaluate integrals like the ones listed below without having to resort to residues.


∫−∞∞x2(x2+5)2dx=π25{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {x^{2}}{(x^{2}+5)^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{2{\sqrt {5}}}}}


∫−∞∞x4(x2+3)3dx=3π83{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {x^{4}}{(x^{2}+3)^{3}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {3\pi }{8{\sqrt {3}}}}}




, We can do the same thing here.


∫−∞∞1(ax2+b)2dx=π2ab3{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(ax^{2}+b)^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{2{\sqrt {ab^{3}}}}}}

This result allows us to obtain integrals listed below. The first one in particular is a standard example of an integral that can be evaluated by residues, but here, we need only keep differentiating a result that we already obtained. The second one, if done using residues, requires a lot of algebra, but by differentiating under the integral, we need only differentiate three times. 


∫−∞∞1(x2+1)2dx=π2{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(x^{2}+1)^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{2}}}


∫−∞∞1(x2+4)4dx=5π2048{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(x^{2}+4)^{4}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {5\pi }{2048}}}



In general, we can differentiate with respect to a{\displaystyle a} or b{\displaystyle b} any number of times, which allows us to evaluate integrals like the one below as well (differentiate w.r.t. a{\displaystyle a} twice, then differentiate w.r.t. b{\displaystyle b} twice). Notice that by differentiating with respect to a,{\displaystyle a,} we are increasing the degree of the numerator and denominator by 2, while differentiating with respect to b{\displaystyle b} only increases the degree of the denominator by 2. Recognition of this pattern allows for a quicker evaluation.


∫0∞x4(x2+9)5dx=π2834{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{4}}{(x^{2}+9)^{5}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{2^{8}3^{4}}}}




, The differential of the inverse tangent was a place where we could determine many integrals. Another good place to start is the general exponential function.


∫01xadx=11+a{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{a}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{1+a}}}


, The derivative of the general exponential function is xaln⁡x.{\displaystyle x^{a}\ln x.} The presence of the logarithm allows us to determine a host of integrals involving the logarithmic function. This is a very lucrative result, because even the simplest integral of its kind, the integral of the log function, requires an integration by parts. 


∫01xaln⁡xdx=−1(1+a)2{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{a}\ln x{\mathrm {d} }x=-{\frac {1}{(1+a)^{2}}}}

In general, with each derivative, the power of the logarithm inside the integral is increased by one. This process allows us to determine integrals like these very easily because it is very easy to take derivatives of the right side (if the bounds are from 0 to 1 - if the upper bound is different, then the derivatives will be a bit more work).


∫01x4ln⁡xdx=−125{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{4}\ln x{\mathrm {d} }x=-{\frac {1}{25}}}


∫01x5ln2⁡xdx=1108{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{5}\ln ^{2}x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{108}}}


∫01ln4⁡xdx=24{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\ln ^{4}x{\mathrm {d} }x=24}


∫06x3ln⁡xdx=81(4ln⁡6−1){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{6}x^{3}\ln x{\mathrm {d} }x=81(4\ln 6-1)}




, We can evaluate integrals where the integrand is of the form xnlnk⁡x{\displaystyle x^{n}\ln ^{k}x} by appealing to Taylor series and power series. 

We begin by considering a=n+ϵ{\displaystyle a=n+\epsilon } for some small number ϵ,{\displaystyle \epsilon ,} rewrite xϵ=eϵln⁡x,{\displaystyle x^{\epsilon }=e^{\epsilon \ln x},} and Taylor our expression around ϵ=0.{\displaystyle \epsilon =0.}


∫01xn+ϵdx=∫01xneϵln⁡xdx=∑k=0∞ϵkk!∫01xnlnk⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{n+\epsilon }{\mathrm {d} }x=\int _{0}^{1}x^{n}e^{\epsilon \ln x}{\mathrm {d} }x=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{k}}{k!}}\int _{0}^{1}x^{n}\ln ^{k}x{\mathrm {d} }x}


∫01xn+ϵdx=11+n+ϵ=11+n11+ϵn+1=1n+1∑k=0∞(−1)k(ϵn+1)k=∑k=0∞(−1)kϵk(n+1)k+1{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{0}^{1}x^{n+\epsilon }{\mathrm {d} }x&={\frac {1}{1+n+\epsilon }}={\frac {1}{1+n}}{\frac {1}{1+{\frac {\epsilon }{n+1}}}}\\&={\frac {1}{n+1}}\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }(-1)^{k}\left({\frac {\epsilon }{n+1}}\right)^{k}=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{k}\epsilon ^{k}}{(n+1)^{k+1}}}\end{aligned}}}

Equating the coefficients, we arrive at the general answer.


1k!∫01xnlnk⁡xdx=(−1)k(n+1)k+1{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{k!}}\int _{0}^{1}x^{n}\ln ^{k}x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {(-1)^{k}}{(n+1)^{k+1}}}}


∫01xnlnk⁡xdx=(−1)kk!(n+1)k+1{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{n}\ln ^{k}x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {(-1)^{k}k!}{(n+1)^{k+1}}}}



For this result to be defined, n>−1{\displaystyle n>-1} and k{\displaystyle k} must be a whole number, since it is the argument of the factorial function.


, This is a very conventional example where differentiating under the integral cancels out part of the integrand.


∫01x4−1ln⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}{\frac {x^{4}-1}{\ln x}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We can then differentiate under the integral with respect to a.{\displaystyle a.}


I(a)=∫01xa−1ln⁡xdx{\displaystyle I(a)=\int _{0}^{1}{\frac {x^{a}-1}{\ln x}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


dIda=dda∫01xa−1ln⁡xdx=∫01xadx=11+a{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }I}{{\mathrm {d} }a}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }a}}\int _{0}^{1}{\frac {x^{a}-1}{\ln x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int _{0}^{1}x^{a}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{1+a}}}


, This is an indefinite integral, so there will be a constant of integration. However, the constant vanishes because I(0)=0.{\displaystyle I(0)=0.}


I(a)=∫11+ada=ln⁡(1+a){\displaystyle I(a)=\int {\frac {1}{1+a}}{\mathrm {d} }a=\ln(1+a)}


, In our example, a=4.{\displaystyle a=4.} This result tells us information about the entire class of integrals, highlighting the power of this technique and its tendency to generalize results.


∫01x4−1ln⁡xdx=ln⁡5{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}{\frac {x^{4}-1}{\ln x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\ln 5}


, We can also use differentiation under the integral for more complicated expressions - expressions where it is actually hopeless from the perspective of finding an antiderivative (it certainly exists, but good luck finding it).


∫01ln4⁡xx(ln2⁡x+1)3dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}{\frac {\ln ^{4}x}{x(\ln ^{2}x+1)^{3}}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, By carefully examining the integral, we see that there exists an f(x)2+1{\displaystyle f(x)^{2}+1} term in the denominator. Furthermore, both the function and its derivative are present in the integral, so after doing the u-sub, the extra x{\displaystyle x} term vanishes. This changes the integral into one related to the inverse tangent integral, which we just discussed! The resulting integrand is even, so the evaluation over the negative reals is going to give the same result as the evaluation over the positive reals. 


∫01ln4⁡xx(ln2⁡x+1)3dx=∫−∞0u4(u2+1)3du=∫0∞u4(u2+1)3du{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}{\frac {\ln ^{4}x}{x(\ln ^{2}x+1)^{3}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int _{-\infty }^{0}{\frac {u^{4}}{(u^{2}+1)^{3}}}{\mathrm {d} }u=\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {u^{4}}{(u^{2}+1)^{3}}}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, Using our result from part 1, we differentiate w.r.t. a{\displaystyle a} twice to obtain our result by setting a=1{\displaystyle a=1} and b=1.{\displaystyle b=1.}


∫0∞1ax2+bdx=π2ab{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{ax^{2}+b}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{2{\sqrt {ab}}}}}


∫0∞u4(u2+1)3du=123π8=3π16{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {u^{4}}{(u^{2}+1)^{3}}}{\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {3\pi }{8}}={\frac {3\pi }{16}}}


, The (unnormalized) sinc function sin⁡xx{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin x}{x}}} is a classic function that does not possess an antiderivative that can be written in closed form, yet has an exact integral when integrating over all reals. There are many different methods to evaluate this function, but differentiating under the integral is one method. 


∫−∞∞sin⁡xxdx=π{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {\sin x}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\pi }

It is not necessary for a region to be formed solely by two curves and their intersections. More complex problems may ask for a region between curves and imposed boundaries such as y=0{\displaystyle y=0} and y=4.{\displaystyle y=4.}
;
, By rotating the area around an axis such as the x-axis or y-axis, you will create a 3D shape with a volume that you can calculate. If your region is not lying completely against the axis, the solid formed will be somewhat hollow which allows you to use the washer method.
, Do this by setting the two equations equal to each other and solving for x. For x2=x{\displaystyle x^{2}={\sqrt {x}}} it is simple to find that they intersect at x=0{\displaystyle x=0} and x=1.{\displaystyle x=1.}

If your region was rotated around a vertical axis, you will need to find the y values of the intersection points.

More complicated curves may require more work to find where they intersect.

The curves may intersect in two places, one place, or not at all. This is not a problem since the curves do not need to intersect. You can set the boundaries anywhere the problem asks for and find the intersection with those.


, Pay special attention to what curve makes up the outer radius of the shape, and what curve makes up the inner radius.

If rotating the region around a horizontal axis, the cross section will be a vertical circle.

If rotating the region around a vertical axis, the cross section will be horizontal and you will be required to change your equations to be in terms of y.


, Because you rotate a region around an axis, the shape will always be circular in nature. You want to find the area of the larger circle with the hole formed by the inner circle subtracted from it, so you want to use the equation A=πR2−πr2,{\displaystyle A=\pi R^{2}-\pi r^{2},} where R{\displaystyle R} is the distance from the outer curve to the axis, and r{\displaystyle r} is the distance from the inner curve to the axis.

You do not need to solve the area of the cross section, simply find the equation.

If your axis of rotation is simply the y or x-axis, you may just use the equation of the curve for R{\displaystyle R} or r.{\displaystyle r.}

If your rotational axis is not the x or y axis, the distance of your radius will be found differently. Depending on the problem, it could require using ""axis - equation"" or ""equation - axis"".


, The 3-dimensional shape is made of infinite sequences of the cross section each with a length dx,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x,} so by multiplying the area by dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} you get volume.


dV=(πR2−πr2)dx=(π(x)2−π(x2)2)dx{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathrm {d} }V&=(\pi R^{2}-\pi r^{2}){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=(\pi ({\sqrt {x}})^{2}-\pi (x^{2})^{2}){\mathrm {d} }x\end{aligned}}}

If rotating around a vertical axis and using equations in terms of y, use dy{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }y} instead.


, This will get you the total volume of the object.


V=∫01(π(x)2−π(x2)2)dx=π∫01(x−x4)dx=π(12−15)=3π10{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}V&=\int _{0}^{1}(\pi ({\sqrt {x}})^{2}-\pi (x^{2})^{2}){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\pi \int _{0}^{1}(x-x^{4}){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\pi \left({\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {1}{5}}\right)\\&={\frac {3\pi }{10}}\end{aligned}}}

If your region was rotated around a vertical axis and your cross sections are now horizontal, remember that since your equations are in terms of y now, the boundaries will be the values of y instead of x for the integral.

We begin from −a{\displaystyle -a} and traverse the real line to some small number −ϵ.{\displaystyle -\epsilon .} Then a semicircular arc γϵ{\displaystyle \gamma _{\epsilon }} with radius ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } goes clockwise to ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } on the real axis. This contour then goes to a,{\displaystyle a,} from which a semicircular arc γa{\displaystyle \gamma _{a}}with radius a{\displaystyle a} goes counterclockwise and back to −a.{\displaystyle -a.} The important thing to note here is that this integral does not have any singularities within the contour, and is therefore 0. We can therefore write the following.


∫−a−ϵeixxdx+∫ϵaeixxdx=−∫γϵeizzdz−∫γaeizzdz{\displaystyle \int _{-a}^{-\epsilon }{\frac {e^{ix}}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x+\int _{\epsilon }^{a}{\frac {e^{ix}}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=-\int _{\gamma _{\epsilon }}{\frac {e^{iz}}{z}}{\mathrm {d} }z-\int _{\gamma _{a}}{\frac {e^{iz}}{z}}{\mathrm {d} }z}


, Typically, for this integral to vanish, the degree of the denominator must be at least two greater than the degree of the numerator. Jordan's lemma says that if such a rational function is multiplied by an eiz{\displaystyle e^{iz}} term, then the degree of the denominator need only be at least one greater. Therefore, this integral vanishes.


∫γaeizzdz=0{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma _{a}}{\frac {e^{iz}}{z}}{\mathrm {d} }z=0}


, 

If you are familiar with contour integrals of 1z{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{z}}} involving circular arc contours, the example involves the fact that the integral depends on the angle that the arc traverses. In our example, the arc is being integrated from the angle π{\displaystyle \pi } to 0{\displaystyle 0} in a clockwise fashion. Such an integral will therefore equal −πi.{\displaystyle -\pi i.} 

We can generalize this result to arcs of any angle, but more importantly, for residues. See the tips for the theorem that this step uses. The residue at the origin is easily found to be Res⁡(0)=1.{\displaystyle \operatorname {Res} (0)=1.}


limϵ→0+∫γϵeizzdz=−πiRes⁡(0)=−πi{\displaystyle \lim _{\epsilon \to 0^{+}}\int _{\gamma _{\epsilon }}{\frac {e^{iz}}{z}}{\mathrm {d} }z=-\pi i\operatorname {Res} (0)=-\pi i}




, Because ϵ→0{\displaystyle \epsilon \to 0} and a→∞,{\displaystyle a\to \infty ,} negate our result (see step 2) to arrive at our answer.


∫−∞∞eixxdx=∫−a−ϵeixxdx+∫ϵaeixxdx=πi{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {e^{ix}}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int _{-a}^{-\epsilon }{\frac {e^{ix}}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x+\int _{\epsilon }^{a}{\frac {e^{ix}}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\pi i}


, The above result really gives us two real results. First of all, the integral of the sinc function immediately follows.


Im⁡∫−∞∞eixxdx=∫−∞∞sin⁡xxdx=π{\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {e^{ix}}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {\sin x}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\pi }

Second of all, the integral of a related function cos⁡xx{\displaystyle {\frac {\cos x}{x}}} follows as well if we take the real part of our result, which is 0. However, this is to be expected, as this function is odd.

, Rewrite the double integral in terms of u{\displaystyle u} and t.{\displaystyle t.} Now we see that the first integral is simply Γ(α+β).{\displaystyle \Gamma (\alpha +\beta ).}

Γ(α)Γ(β)Γ(α+β)=∫01tα−1(1−t)β−1dt{\displaystyle {\frac {\Gamma (\alpha )\Gamma (\beta )}{\Gamma (\alpha +\beta )}}=\int _{0}^{1}t^{\alpha -1}(1-t)^{\beta -1}{\mathrm {d} }t}

Below, we go through three examples that make direct use of the Beta function.


,


∫01x3x(1−x)dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{3}{\sqrt {x(1-x)}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We see that α=9/2{\displaystyle \alpha =9/2} and β=3/2{\displaystyle \beta =3/2} just from inspection.


∫01x3x(1−x)dx=Γ(9/2)Γ(3/2)Γ(6){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{3}{\sqrt {x(1-x)}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\Gamma (9/2)\Gamma (3/2)}{\Gamma (6)}}}


, Use the recursion relation to write the numerator in terms of π.{\displaystyle \pi .}


Γ(9/2)Γ(3/2)Γ(6)=1120725232π4=7π256{\displaystyle {\frac {\Gamma (9/2)\Gamma (3/2)}{\Gamma (6)}}={\frac {1}{120}}{\frac {7}{2}}{\frac {5}{2}}{\frac {3}{2}}{\frac {\pi }{4}}={\frac {7\pi }{256}}}


, We see that our integrand is not quite in the form that we want it to, but we can take advantage of the fact that α{\displaystyle \alpha } and β{\displaystyle \beta } are arbitrary parameters.


∫01x2(1−x4)3dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}(1-x^{4})}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, This gets the quantity inside the parentheses into the form that we want. We changed the exponent on the power term, but since α{\displaystyle \alpha } is arbitrary, we don't have to worry.


∫01x2(1−x4)3dx=14∫01u−7/12(1−u)1/3du{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}(1-x^{4})}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{4}}\int _{0}^{1}u^{-7/12}(1-u)^{1/3}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, Simplify using the recursion relation to get the arguments of the Gamma functions between 0 and 1. Make sure your arithmetic skills are up to par.


14∫01u−7/12(1−u)1/3du=Γ(5/12)Γ(4/3)4Γ(7/4)=Γ(5/12)Γ(1/3)9Γ(3/4){\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}\int _{0}^{1}u^{-7/12}(1-u)^{1/3}{\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {\Gamma (5/12)\Gamma (4/3)}{4\,\Gamma (7/4)}}={\frac {\Gamma (5/12)\Gamma (1/3)}{9\,\Gamma (3/4)}}}


, Of course, the Beta function can also directly be used to evaluate these types of integrals with logs attached to them.


∫01x(1−x)2ln⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x(1-x)^{2}\ln x{\mathrm {d} }x}


, This is standard procedure for an integral like this. We rewrite the power term so that e{\displaystyle e} is in the base and expand that into its Taylor series. Then we find the appropriate coefficient, neglecting higher-order terms because ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } is small (and therefore they go to 0 faster).


∫01x1+ϵ(1−x)2dx=∑n=0∞ϵnn!∫01x(1−x)2lnn⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{1+\epsilon }(1-x)^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{n}}{n!}}\int _{0}^{1}x(1-x)^{2}\ln ^{n}x{\mathrm {d} }x}


∫01x1+ϵ(1−x)2dx=Γ(2+ϵ)Γ(3)Γ(5+ϵ){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{1+\epsilon }(1-x)^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\Gamma (2+\epsilon )\Gamma (3)}{\Gamma (5+\epsilon )}}}

As seen above, we want to find the coefficient of ϵ.{\displaystyle \epsilon .}


, Since we are only finding the integral with the log to the first order, we can rewrite the terms in parentheses as exponential functions.


Γ(2+ϵ)Γ(3)Γ(5+ϵ)=2Γ(2+ϵ)(4+ϵ)(3+ϵ)(2+ϵ)Γ(2+ϵ)=24⋅3⋅21(1+ϵ/4)(1+ϵ/3)(1+ϵ/2)≈112e−(14+13+12)ϵ≈112(1−1312ϵ){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\Gamma (2+\epsilon )\Gamma (3)}{\Gamma (5+\epsilon )}}&={\frac {2\,\Gamma (2+\epsilon )}{(4+\epsilon )(3+\epsilon )(2+\epsilon )\Gamma (2+\epsilon )}}\\&={\frac {2}{4\cdot 3\cdot 2}}{\frac {1}{(1+\epsilon /4)(1+\epsilon /3)(1+\epsilon /2)}}\\&\approx {\frac {1}{12}}e^{-\left({\frac {1}{4}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{2}}\right)\epsilon }\\&\approx {\frac {1}{12}}\left(1-{\frac {13}{12}}\epsilon \right)\end{aligned}}}


, Our answer comes right out of our work. 


∫01x(1−x)2ln⁡xdx=−13144{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x(1-x)^{2}\ln x{\mathrm {d} }x=-{\frac {13}{144}}}

As usual, we get this integral for free, which can be evaluated the standard way.


∫01x(1−x)2dx=112{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x(1-x)^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{12}}}




, We set z=α=β.{\displaystyle z=\alpha =\beta .}


∫01tz−1(1−t)z−1dt=Γ2(z)Γ(2z){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}t^{z-1}(1-t)^{z-1}{\mathrm {d} }t={\frac {\Gamma ^{2}(z)}{\Gamma (2z)}}}


, 


Γ2(z)Γ(2z)=∫01tz−1(1−t)z−1dt=122z−1∫−11(1−u2)z−1du=122z−2∫01(1−u2)z−1du{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\Gamma ^{2}(z)}{\Gamma (2z)}}&=\int _{0}^{1}t^{z-1}(1-t)^{z-1}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&={\frac {1}{2^{2z-1}}}\int _{-1}^{1}(1-u^{2})^{z-1}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&={\frac {1}{2^{2z-2}}}\int _{0}^{1}(1-u^{2})^{z-1}{\mathrm {d} }u\end{aligned}}}


, Then we can get the integral into the form where we can directly use the Beta function.


Γ2(z)Γ(2z)=122z−2∫01(1−u2)z−1du=122z−1∫01s−1/2(1−s)z−1ds=π22z−1Γ(z)Γ(z+1/2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\Gamma ^{2}(z)}{\Gamma (2z)}}&={\frac {1}{2^{2z-2}}}\int _{0}^{1}(1-u^{2})^{z-1}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&={\frac {1}{2^{2z-1}}}\int _{0}^{1}s^{-1/2}(1-s)^{z-1}{\mathrm {d} }s\\&={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2^{2z-1}}}{\frac {\Gamma (z)}{\Gamma (z+1/2)}}\end{aligned}}}

This is Legendre's duplication formula. It allows us to evaluate certain integrals that give us a Γ(1/2+ϵ){\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2+\epsilon )} during our work.


, We can also use the Beta function to determine integrals like these.


∫01ln2⁡xln⁡(1−x)dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\ln ^{2}x\ln(1-x){\mathrm {d} }x}


, Since we have two logs, we need to introduce two parameters. 


∫01xϵ(1−x)δdx=∑m=0∞∑n=0∞ϵmm!δnn!∫01lnm⁡xlnn⁡(1−x)dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{\epsilon }(1-x)^{\delta }{\mathrm {d} }x=\sum _{m=0}^{\infty }\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{m}}{m!}}{\frac {\delta ^{n}}{n!}}\int _{0}^{1}\ln ^{m}x\ln ^{n}(1-x){\mathrm {d} }x}


∫01xϵ(1−x)δdx=Γ(1+ϵ)Γ(1+δ)Γ(2+ϵ+δ)=Γ(1+ϵ)Γ(1+δ)(1+ϵ+δ)Γ(1+ϵ+δ){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x^{\epsilon }(1-x)^{\delta }{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\Gamma (1+\epsilon )\Gamma (1+\delta )}{\Gamma (2+\epsilon +\delta )}}={\frac {\Gamma (1+\epsilon )\Gamma (1+\delta )}{(1+\epsilon +\delta )\Gamma (1+\epsilon +\delta )}}}

Our integral implies that we need to find the coefficient of ϵ2δ{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{2}\delta } in the expansion, setting m=2{\displaystyle m=2} and n=1.{\displaystyle n=1.} Furthermore, we must multiply the eventual result we obtain by the factorial of the power. In this case, 2!1!=2.{\displaystyle 2!1!=2.}


, We see that the terms including the Euler-Mascheroni constant vanish. Furthermore, the terms in the sum cancel in a way such that only the cross terms are left intact. (We break up the exponential function into two to save space.) The fraction is expanded into its power series. 


Γ(1+ϵ)Γ(1+δ)Γ(1+ϵ+δ)=exp∗exp=exp{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\Gamma (1+\epsilon )\Gamma (1+\delta )}{\Gamma (1+\epsilon +\delta )}}&=\exp \left\\&\ *\,\exp \left\\&=\exp \left\end{aligned}}}


11+ϵ+δ=1−(ϵ+δ)+(ϵ+δ)2−(ϵ+δ)3+⋯{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1+\epsilon +\delta }}=1-(\epsilon +\delta )+(\epsilon +\delta )^{2}-(\epsilon +\delta )^{3}+\cdots }


, We need only terms up to k=3,{\displaystyle k=3,} and the Taylor series of that exponential function only goes up to first-order. We will also need terms of the power series up to third order. Remember that we do not need to multiply everything out. We are only interested in the coefficients of ϵ2δ.{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{2}\delta .} Be sure to keep track of the signs.


ϵ2δ:ζ(3)+ζ(2)−3{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{2}\delta :\zeta (3)+\zeta (2)-3}

Remembering to multiply by 2 to account for the factorial on ϵ2,{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{2},} this immediately gets us the desired result.


∫01ln2⁡xln⁡(1−x)dx=2(ζ(3)+ζ(2)−3){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\ln ^{2}x\ln(1-x){\mathrm {d} }x=2(\zeta (3)+\zeta (2)-3)}


, We can also show similar integrals using this technique. For the first one, we find coefficients of ϵδ.{\displaystyle \epsilon \delta .} For the second one, we find coefficients of ϵ2δ2.{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{2}\delta ^{2}.} In principle, it is possible to evaluate integrals like these with any integer power on the logs. We would just have to keep more terms in our evaluation.


∫01ln⁡xln⁡(1−x)dx=2−ζ(2){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\ln x\ln(1-x){\mathrm {d} }x=2-\zeta (2)}


∫01ln2⁡xln2⁡(1−x)dx=24−8ζ(2)−8ζ(3)+2ζ2(2)−6ζ(4){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}\ln ^{2}x\ln ^{2}(1-x){\mathrm {d} }x=24-8\zeta (2)-8\zeta (3)+2\zeta ^{2}(2)-6\zeta (4)}


, In this section, we will show a u-sub that converts the Beta function into an integral from 0 to infinity, which will produce some very interesting results.


∫01tα−1(1−t)β−1dt{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}t^{\alpha -1}(1-t)^{\beta -1}{\mathrm {d} }t}


, This does two things. First, it allows us to directly evaluate integrals with 1+u{\displaystyle 1+u} in the denominator, which was previously not allowed. Second, it changes the boundaries. The way we now evaluate is to find β{\displaystyle \beta } first, and then find α,{\displaystyle \alpha ,} because of this substitution.


Γ(α)Γ(β)Γ(α+β)=∫01tα−1(1−t)β−1dt=∫0∞1(1+u)α+1(1−11+u)β−1du=∫0∞uβ−1(1+u)α+βdu{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\Gamma (\alpha )\Gamma (\beta )}{\Gamma (\alpha +\beta )}}&=\int _{0}^{1}t^{\alpha -1}(1-t)^{\beta -1}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(1+u)^{\alpha +1}}}\left(1-{\frac {1}{1+u}}\right)^{\beta -1}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&=\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {u^{\beta -1}}{(1+u)^{\alpha +\beta }}}{\mathrm {d} }u\end{aligned}}}


, This form of the Beta function allows direct access to another class of integrals otherwise only accessible via residues. We can use Euler's reflection formula to simplify integrals, particularly the second one listed.


∫0∞1x(1+x)3dx=2{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{\sqrt {x(1+x)^{3}}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=2}


∫0∞x2x4(x+1)4dx=152π128{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{2}{\sqrt{x}}}{(x+1)^{4}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {15{\sqrt {2}}\pi }{128}}}


, We replace the term in the denominator with xn+1,{\displaystyle x^{n}+1,} which after a u-sub, leads to more general results, since we can differentiate under the integral with respect to any of the three parameters. In particular, when we set α=1,{\displaystyle \alpha =1,} we arrive at a very attractive answer involving the cosecant function (which we use the reflection formula to derive).


∫0∞xm−1(xn+1)αdx=Γ(m/n)Γ(α−m/n)nΓ(α){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{m-1}}{(x^{n}+1)^{\alpha }}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\Gamma (m/n)\Gamma (\alpha -m/n)}{n\Gamma (\alpha )}}}


∫0∞xm−1xn+1dx=πncscmπn{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{m-1}}{x^{n}+1}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{n}}\csc {\frac {m\pi }{n}}}

These results can directly be used to evaluate more integrals. Verify these.


∫0∞x2x(x3+1)2dx=π9{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{2}{\sqrt {x}}}{(x^{3}+1)^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{9}}}


∫0∞1x4+1dx=π22{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{x^{4}+1}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{2{\sqrt {2}}}}}




, The above result with the cosecant is a very potent integral because we can also differentiate once and twice to obtain some more results involving logs.(We use a trig identity to simplify the result after differentiating twice.)


∫0∞xm−1ln⁡xxn+1dx=−π2n2cscmπncotmπn{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{m-1}\ln x}{x^{n}+1}}{\mathrm {d} }x=-{\frac {\pi ^{2}}{n^{2}}}\csc {\frac {m\pi }{n}}\cot {\frac {m\pi }{n}}}


∫0∞xm−1ln2⁡xxn+1dx=π3n3cscmπn(2csc2mπn−1){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{m-1}\ln ^{2}x}{x^{n}+1}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi ^{3}}{n^{3}}}\csc {\frac {m\pi }{n}}\left(2\csc ^{2}{\frac {m\pi }{n}}-1\right)}

Use these results to verify the integrals below. These integrals have extremely complicated antiderivatives, and there is virtually no hope of approaching them from the perspective of the fundamental theorem. However, these extremely simple answers only showcases the power of the Beta function - it makes the process of obtaining a simple answer, simple.


∫0∞x2ln⁡xx4+1dx=π2216{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{2}\ln x}{x^{4}+1}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi ^{2}{\sqrt {2}}}{16}}}


∫0∞ln2⁡xx3+1dx=10π3813{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {\ln ^{2}x}{x^{3}+1}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {10\pi ^{3}}{81{\sqrt {3}}}}}

, If you are familiar with the derivation of the Beta function, we start from the same place. However, we switch to polar and make a substitution to get a trigonometric integral.

, Recall that the area element dxdy=rdrdθ{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x{\mathrm {d} }y=r{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta } and the bounds for θ{\displaystyle \theta } are from 0{\displaystyle 0} to π/2{\displaystyle \pi /2} because we are integrating over only quadrant I.

, After substituting and simplifying, we obtain our desired result. Be careful of the extra 1/2.{\displaystyle 1/2.}


Γ(α)Γ(β)=2∫0∞uα+β−1e−udu∫0π/2cos2α−1⁡θsin2β−1⁡θdθ=2Γ(α+β)∫0π/2cos2α−1⁡θsin2β−1⁡θdθ{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Gamma (\alpha )\Gamma (\beta )&=2\int _{0}^{\infty }u^{\alpha +\beta -1}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u\int _{0}^{\pi /2}\cos ^{2\alpha -1}\theta \sin ^{2\beta -1}\theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta \\&=2\,\Gamma (\alpha +\beta )\int _{0}^{\pi /2}\cos ^{2\alpha -1}\theta \sin ^{2\beta -1}\theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta \end{aligned}}}

This is a very important result, and one that is very often used with integer powers, which provide very ""nice"" answers.


, These are daunting with reduction of power formulae and other techniques, but trivial from the perspective of the Beta function.


∫0π/2cos4⁡xsin5⁡xdx=8315{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}\cos ^{4}x\sin ^{5}x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {8}{315}}}

, The integral contains a composition of functions whose antiderivative cannot be written in terms of elementary functions. Nevertheless, the integral contains an exact solution.


∫0π/2lnsin⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}\ln \sin x{\mathrm {d} }x}


, As usual, we begin with the more general case of expanding into a series, neglecting higher-order terms, and finding the appropriate coefficient. These integrals will require the use of the duplication formula.


∫0π/2sinϵ⁡xdx=∑n=0∞ϵnn!∫0π/2lnnsin⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}\sin ^{\epsilon }x{\mathrm {d} }x=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{n}}{n!}}\int _{0}^{\pi /2}\ln ^{n}\sin x{\mathrm {d} }x}

, After using the duplication formula, we see that the ratio Γ(1+ϵ)Γ2(1+ϵ/2){\displaystyle {\frac {\Gamma (1+\epsilon )}{\Gamma ^{2}(1+\epsilon /2)}}} cancels up to the first order, leaving us with a very simple expansion.


Γ(1/2)Γ(1/2+ϵ/2)2Γ(1+ϵ/2)=π2⋅2ϵΓ(1+ϵ)Γ2(1+ϵ/2)≈π2e−ϵln⁡2≈π2(1−ϵln⁡2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\Gamma (1/2)\Gamma (1/2+\epsilon /2)}{2\,\Gamma (1+\epsilon /2)}}&={\frac {\pi }{2\cdot 2^{\epsilon }}}{\frac {\Gamma (1+\epsilon )}{\Gamma ^{2}(1+\epsilon /2)}}\\&\approx {\frac {\pi }{2}}e^{-\epsilon \ln 2}\\&\approx {\frac {\pi }{2}}(1-\epsilon \ln 2)\end{aligned}}}


, 


∫0π/2lnsin⁡xdx=−π2ln⁡2{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}\ln \sin x{\mathrm {d} }x=-{\frac {\pi }{2}}\ln 2}


, This technique can once again be used to evaluate the entire class of integrals.


∫0π/2sin⁡xlnsin⁡xdx=ln⁡2−1{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}\sin x\ln \sin x{\mathrm {d} }x=\ln 2-1}


∫0π/2sin2⁡xcos2⁡xlnsin⁡xdx=π64(1−4ln⁡2){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}\sin ^{2}x\cos ^{2}x\ln \sin x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{64}}(1-4\ln 2)}


, This is an example of an integral that converges, but we cannot directly apply our techniques to evaluate because the integral that we would've considered does not converge.

∫0π/2lnsin⁡xcos⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\frac {\ln \sin x}{\cos x}}{\mathrm {d} }x}

, We need to add a term δ{\displaystyle \delta } that ""tames"" the integral so that it converges. Otherwise, we would get a Γ(0){\displaystyle \Gamma (0)} term that is undefined. Here, δ{\displaystyle \delta } is a small number that is taken to be 0 at a convenient time.

∫0π/2sinϵ⁡xcos−1+δ⁡xdx=Γ(1+ϵ2)Γ(δ2)2Γ(12+ϵ+δ2){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}\sin ^{\epsilon }x\cos ^{-1+\delta }x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\Gamma \left({\frac {1+\epsilon }{2}}\right)\Gamma \left({\frac {\delta }{2}}\right)}{2\,\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {\epsilon +\delta }{2}}\right)}}}

, This gets our result into a form so that we can use a series expansion around Γ(1).{\displaystyle \Gamma (1).} Then we use the duplication formula.

Γ(1+ϵ2)Γ(δ2)2Γ(12+ϵ+δ2)=1δΓ(1+ϵ2)Γ(1+δ2)Γ(12+ϵ+δ2)=Γ(1+δ/2)δπΓ(1+ϵ)2ϵΓ(1+ϵ/2)πΓ(1+ϵ+δ)2ϵ+δΓ(1+ϵ+δ2)=2δδΓ(1+δ/2)Γ(1+ϵ)Γ(1+ϵ+δ2)Γ(1+ϵ/2)Γ(1+ϵ+δ){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\Gamma \left({\frac {1+\epsilon }{2}}\right)\Gamma \left({\frac {\delta }{2}}\right)}{2\,\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {\epsilon +\delta }{2}}\right)}}&={\frac {1}{\delta }}{\frac {\Gamma \left({\frac {1+\epsilon }{2}}\right)\Gamma \left(1+{\frac {\delta }{2}}\right)}{\Gamma \left({\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {\epsilon +\delta }{2}}\right)}}\\&={\frac {\Gamma (1+\delta /2)}{\delta }}{\frac {\frac {{\sqrt {\pi }}\,\Gamma (1+\epsilon )}{2^{\epsilon }\Gamma (1+\epsilon /2)}}{\frac {{\sqrt {\pi }}\,\Gamma (1+\epsilon +\delta )}{2^{\epsilon +\delta }\Gamma \left(1+{\frac {\epsilon +\delta }{2}}\right)}}}\\&={\frac {2^{\delta }}{\delta }}{\frac {\Gamma (1+\delta /2)\Gamma (1+\epsilon )\Gamma \left(1+{\frac {\epsilon +\delta }{2}}\right)}{\Gamma (1+\epsilon /2)\Gamma (1+\epsilon +\delta )}}\end{aligned}}}

, We are interested in the coefficient of ϵ,{\displaystyle \epsilon ,} but we need to find the coefficient of ϵδ{\displaystyle \epsilon \delta } here in order to cancel the δ{\displaystyle \delta } in front. Notice that any higher-order δ{\displaystyle \delta } terms will vanish.
⋯=eδln⁡2δexp≈1δ(1+δln⁡2)(1+ζ(2)2(ϵ2+(ϵ+δ2)2+(δ2)2−(ϵ2)2−(ϵ+δ)2)){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\cdots &={\frac {e^{\delta \ln 2}}{\delta }}\exp \left\\&\approx {\frac {1}{\delta }}(1+\delta \ln 2)\left(1+{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\left(\epsilon ^{2}+\left({\frac {\epsilon +\delta }{2}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {\delta }{2}}\right)^{2}-\left({\frac {\epsilon }{2}}\right)^{2}-(\epsilon +\delta )^{2}\right)\right)\end{aligned}}}
Notice that the δln⁡2{\displaystyle \delta \ln 2} term cannot contribute to the coefficient because there is no ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } term on the right. Therefore, the only terms that contribute are the cross terms.

ζ(2)2(12−2)ϵδ=−34ζ(2)ϵδ{\displaystyle {\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\left({\frac {1}{2}}-2\right)\epsilon \delta =-{\frac {3}{4}}\zeta (2)\epsilon \delta }



, We can write our answer in terms of π{\displaystyle \pi } by making use of ζ(2)=π26.{\displaystyle \zeta (2)={\frac {\pi ^{2}}{6}}.}

∫0π/2lnsin⁡xcos⁡xdx=−π28{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\frac {\ln \sin x}{\cos x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=-{\frac {\pi ^{2}}{8}}}

, The work that was done to evaluate the first integral can be recycled to evaluate this similar integral.

lim(x,y)→(4,5)(x2y3−5xy2)=(4)2(5)3−5(4)(5)2=1500{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{(x,y)\to (4,5)}(x^{2}y^{3}-5xy^{2})&=(4)^{2}(5)^{3}-5(4)(5)^{2}\\&=1500\end{aligned}}}

Another reason why substituting works here is that the function above is polynomial, and therefore is well-behaved across the reals for all x{\displaystyle x} and y.{\displaystyle y.}
;
,

Evaluate lim(x,y)→(0,0)ln⁡(1−5x2y2)12x2y2.{\displaystyle \lim _{(x,y)\to (0,0)}{\frac {\ln(1-5x^{2}y^{2})}{12x^{2}y^{2}}}.}

Substitute t=x2y2.{\displaystyle t=x^{2}y^{2}.} 


limt→0ln⁡(1−5t)12t{\displaystyle \lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {\ln(1-5t)}{12t}}}



Use L'Hôpital's rule, as currently we get a 00{\displaystyle {\frac {0}{0}}} if we evaluate too soon.


limt→0ln⁡(1−5t)12t=limt→011−5t(−5)12=−512.{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {\ln(1-5t)}{12t}}&=\lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {{\frac {1}{1-5t}}(-5)}{12}}\\&={\frac {-5}{12}}.\end{aligned}}} 




, As long as the limit either DNE or is different from these two directions, you are finished and the limit of the overall function DNE.

Evaluate lim(x,y)→(0,0)x2−y2x2+y2.{\displaystyle \lim _{(x,y)\to (0,0)}{\frac {x^{2}-y^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}.}

Approach from both sides vertically and horizontally. Set x=0{\displaystyle x=0} and y=0.{\displaystyle y=0.}


lim(0,y)→(0,0)x2−y2x2+y2=lim(0,y)→(0,0)(0)2−y2(0)2+y2=−1.{\displaystyle \lim _{(0,y)\to (0,0)}{\frac {x^{2}-y^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}=\lim _{(0,y)\to (0,0)}{\frac {(0)^{2}-y^{2}}{(0)^{2}+y^{2}}}=-1.}


lim(x,0)→(0,0)x2−y2x2+y2=lim(x,0)→(0,0)x2−(0)2x2+(0)2=1.{\displaystyle \lim _{(x,0)\to (0,0)}{\frac {x^{2}-y^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}=\lim _{(x,0)\to (0,0)}{\frac {x^{2}-(0)^{2}}{x^{2}+(0)^{2}}}=1.}



Since the two limits are different, the limit DNE.


, Multivariable limits are often easier when done in polar coordinates. In this case, x=rcos⁡θ{\displaystyle x=r\cos \theta } and y=rsin⁡θ.{\displaystyle y=r\sin \theta .} Let’s see how this works. 
,


lim(x,y)→(0,0)xy2x2+y2{\displaystyle \lim _{(x,y)\to (0,0)}{\frac {xy^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}}


, 


limr→0r3cos⁡θsin2⁡θr2=limr→0(rcos⁡θsin2⁡θ){\displaystyle \lim _{r\to 0}{\frac {r^{3}\cos \theta \sin ^{2}\theta }{r^{2}}}=\lim _{r\to 0}(r\cos \theta \sin ^{2}\theta )}


, Although the limit is taken as r→0,{\displaystyle r\to 0,} the limit depends on θ{\displaystyle \theta } as well. One might then naively conclude that the limit DNE. However, the limit does depend on r,{\displaystyle r,} so the limit may or may not exist.

Since |sin⁡θ|≤1{\displaystyle |\sin \theta |\leq 1} and |cos⁡θ|≤1,|cos⁡θsin2⁡θ|≤1{\displaystyle |\cos \theta |\leq 1,|\cos \theta \sin ^{2}\theta |\leq 1} as well. 

Then |rcos⁡θsin2⁡θ|≤r.{\displaystyle |r\cos \theta \sin ^{2}\theta |\leq r.}


, 

Since limr→0(−r)=limr→0(r)=0,{\displaystyle \lim _{r\to 0}(-r)=\lim _{r\to 0}(r)=0,} by the Squeeze Theorem, limr→0(rcos⁡θsin2⁡θ)=0.{\displaystyle \lim _{r\to 0}(r\cos \theta \sin ^{2}\theta )=0.}

Because of the r{\displaystyle r} dependency and the use of the Squeeze Theorem, the quantity in the above limit is said to be bounded. In other words, as r→0,{\displaystyle r\to 0,} the range of values of rcos⁡θsin2⁡θ{\displaystyle r\cos \theta \sin ^{2}\theta } shrinks to 0 as well, even though θ{\displaystyle \theta } is arbitrary.


,


lim(x,y)→(0,0)xyx2+y2{\displaystyle \lim _{(x,y)\to (0,0)}{\frac {xy}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}}

This example is only slightly different from the one in Example 1. 


, 


limr→0r2cos⁡θsin2⁡θr2=limr→0(cos⁡θsin2⁡θ){\displaystyle \lim _{r\to 0}{\frac {r^{2}\cos \theta \sin ^{2}\theta }{r^{2}}}=\lim _{r\to 0}(\cos \theta \sin ^{2}\theta )}

However, the quantity cos⁡θsin2⁡θ{\displaystyle \cos \theta \sin ^{2}\theta } can take on an arbitrary value after the limit is evaluated, and is said to be unbounded. 

Therefore, the limit DNE. This scenario is describing a limit being approached from arbitrary directions and getting different values.

The binomial series is the Taylor expansion for the expression (1+x)α{\displaystyle (1+x)^{\alpha }} for any real number α.{\displaystyle \alpha .} 


(1+x)α=∑m=0∞(αm)xm{\displaystyle (1+x)^{\alpha }=\sum _{m=0}^{\infty }{\alpha  \choose m}x^{m}}



We can then write the integrand as such by identifying x{\displaystyle x} and α,{\displaystyle \alpha ,} making sure to pull out any terms that are not dependent on ϕ.{\displaystyle \phi .}


K(k)=∫0π/2dϕ1−k2sin2⁡ϕ=∫0π/2∑m=0∞(−1/2m)(−1)mk2msin2m⁡ϕdϕ=∑m=0∞(−1/2m)(−1)mk2m∫0π/2sin2m⁡ϕdϕ{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}K(k)&=\int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\phi }{\sqrt {1-k^{2}\sin ^{2}\phi }}}\\&=\int _{0}^{\pi /2}\sum _{m=0}^{\infty }{-1/2 \choose m}(-1)^{m}k^{2m}\sin ^{2m}\phi {\mathrm {d} }\phi \\&=\sum _{m=0}^{\infty }{-1/2 \choose m}(-1)^{m}k^{2m}\int _{0}^{\pi /2}\sin ^{2m}\phi {\mathrm {d} }\phi \end{aligned}}}



Notice that we are evaluating this integral term-by-term.


,

First, expand the binomial coefficients in terms of the Gamma function if necessary. Otherwise, leave it in terms of factorials. Remember that m!=Γ(m+1).{\displaystyle m!=\Gamma (m+1).}


(−1/2m)=Γ(1/2)m!Γ(1/2−m){\displaystyle {-1/2 \choose m}={\frac {\Gamma (1/2)}{m!\,\Gamma (1/2-m)}}}



Second, recall the definition of the Beta function in terms of trigonometric functions.


Γ(α)Γ(β)2Γ(α+β)=∫0π/2cos2α−1⁡ϕsin2β−1⁡ϕdϕ{\displaystyle {\frac {\Gamma (\alpha )\Gamma (\beta )}{2\,\Gamma (\alpha +\beta )}}=\int _{0}^{\pi /2}\cos ^{2\alpha -1}\phi \sin ^{2\beta -1}\phi {\mathrm {d} }\phi }



We identify α=1/2{\displaystyle \alpha =1/2} and β=m+1/2.{\displaystyle \beta =m+1/2.}

,

Euler's reflection identity is stated below.


Γ(z)Γ(1−z)=πsin⁡(πz){\displaystyle \Gamma (z)\Gamma (1-z)={\frac {\pi }{\sin(\pi z)}}}



We can simplify our series using this formula if we let z=1/2+m.{\displaystyle z=1/2+m.}


Γ(1/2+m)Γ(1/2−m)=πsin⁡(π(1/2+m)){\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2+m)\Gamma (1/2-m)={\frac {\pi }{\sin(\pi (1/2+m))}}}



We simplify further by making the observation that (−1)msin⁡(π(1/2+m))=1{\displaystyle (-1)^{m}\sin(\pi (1/2+m))=1} for all m.{\displaystyle m.}


K(k)=π2∑m=0∞Γ2(1/2+m)π(m!)2k2m{\displaystyle K(k)={\frac {\pi }{2}}\sum _{m=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\Gamma ^{2}(1/2+m)}{\pi (m!)^{2}}}k^{2m}}




, 

The double factorial identity can be related to the Gamma function in the following manner.


(2m−1)!!=2mΓ(1/2+m)π{\displaystyle (2m-1)!!={\frac {2^{m}\Gamma (1/2+m)}{\sqrt {\pi }}}}



We can then simplify this series like so.


K(k)=π2∑m=0∞2k2m{\displaystyle K(k)={\frac {\pi }{2}}\sum _{m=0}^{\infty }\left^{2}k^{2m}}



This series can also be written only with double factorials when making use of the identity (2m)!!=2mm!,{\displaystyle (2m)!!=2^{m}m!,} which is sometimes encountered in the literature as well.


K(k)=π2∑m=0∞2k2m{\displaystyle K(k)={\frac {\pi }{2}}\sum _{m=0}^{\infty }\left^{2}k^{2m}}




,


K(k)=π2{\displaystyle K(k)={\frac {\pi }{2}}\left}

 The series has a few properties that immediately stand out. First, we can see that for small k,{\displaystyle k,} the higher-order terms are suppressed, mainly due to the factorials. This is the justification for the small-angle approximation when analyzing a pendulum.

Second, its region of convergence is |k|<1.{\displaystyle |k|<1.} When k=1,{\displaystyle k=1,} the integral diverges because the factorials cancel each other out in the large m{\displaystyle m} limit, although this divergence is very slow - K(0.9999)≈5.645,{\displaystyle K(0.9999)\approx 5.645,} for example. 

A physical example of when k=1{\displaystyle k=1} is when a pendulum is released from an angle of 180°, denoting an unstable equilibrium point. The period, being written in terms of this elliptic integral, then diverges, for the pendulum never falls down.


, Using the techniques presented in this article, the power series for this integral can also be found.


E(k)=π2∑m=0∞2k2m1−2m{\displaystyle E(k)={\frac {\pi }{2}}\sum _{m=0}^{\infty }\left^{2}{\frac {k^{2m}}{1-2m}}}

, 


dV=rdrdθdz{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }V=r{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta {\mathrm {d} }z}

Those familiar with polar coordinates will understand that the area element dA=rdrdθ.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }A=r{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta .} This extra r stems from the fact that the side of the differential polar rectangle facing the angle has a side length of rdθ{\displaystyle r{\mathrm {d} }\theta } to scale to units of distance.

Differentiate the x terms as normal.,
Differentiate the y terms and add ""(dy/dx)"" next to each.,
Use the product rule or quotient rule for terms with x and y.,
Isolate (dy/dx).",How to Do Implicit Differentiation1," When trying to differentiate a multivariable equation like x2 + y2 - 5x + 8y + 2xy2 = 19, it can be difficult to know where to start. Luckily, the first step of implicit differentiation is its easiest one. Simply differentiate the x terms and constants on both sides of the equation according to normal (explicit) differentiation rules to start off. Ignore the y terms for now.


Let's try our hand at differentiating the simple example equation above. x2 + y2 - 5x + 8y + 2xy2 = 19 has two x terms: x2 and -5x. If we want to differentiate the equation, we'll deal with these first, like this:



x2 + y2 - 5x + 8y + 2xy2 = 19
(Bring the ""2"" exponent in x2 down as a coefficient, remove the x in -5x, and change the 19 to 0)
2x + y2 - 5 + 8y + 2xy2 = 0



;
, As your next step, simply differentiate the y terms the same way as you differentiated the x terms. This time, however, add ""(dy/dx)"" next to each the same way as you'd add a coefficient. For instance, if you differentiate y2, it becomes 2y(dy/dx). Ignore terms with both x and y for now.


In our running example, our equation now looks like this: 2x + y2 - 5 + 8y + 2xy2 = 0. We would perform this next y-differentiating step as follows:



2x + y2 - 5 + 8y + 2xy2 = 0
(Bring the ""2"" exponent in y2 down as a coefficient, remove the y in 8y, and place a ""dy/dx"" next to each).
2x + 2y(dy/dx) - 5 + 8(dy/dx) + 2xy2= 0





, Dealing with terms that have both x and y in them is a little tricky, but if you know the product and quotient rules for differentiating, you're in the clear. If the x and y terms are multiplied, use the product rule ((f × g)' = f' × g + g × f'), substituting the x term for f and the y term for g.On the other hand, if the x and y terms are divided by each other, use the quotient rule ((f/g)' = (g × f' - g' × f)/g2), substituting the numerator term for f and the denominator term for g.In our example, 2x + 2y(dy/dx) - 5 + 8(dy/dx) + 2xy2 = 0, we only have one term with both x and y — 2xy2. Since the x and y are multiplied by each other, we would use the product rule to differentiate as follows:



2xy2 = (2x)(y2)— set 2x = f and y2 = g in (f × g)' = f' × g + g' × f
(f × g)' = (2x)' × (y2) + (2x) × (y2)'
(f × g)' = (2) × (y2) + (2x) × (2y(dy/dx))
(f × g)' = 2y2 + 4xy(dy/dx)





Adding this back into our main equation, we get 2x + 2y(dy/dx) - 5 + 8(dy/dx) + 2y2 + 4xy(dy/dx) = 0


, You're almost there! Now, all you need to do is solve the equation for (dy/dx). This looks difficult, but it's usually not — keep in mind that any two terms a and b that are multiplied by (dy/dx) can be written as (a + b)(dy/dx) due to the distributive property of multiplication.This tactic can make it easy to isolate (dy/dx) — just get all the other terms on the opposite side of the parentheses, then divide them by the terms in parentheses next to (dy/dx).


In our example, we might simplify 2x + 2y(dy/dx) - 5 + 8(dy/dx) + 2y2 + 4xy(dy/dx) = 0 as follows:



2x + 2y(dy/dx) - 5 + 8(dy/dx) + 2y2 + 4xy(dy/dx) = 0
(2y + 8 + 4xy)(dy/dx) + 2x - 5 + 2y2 = 0
(2y + 8 + 4xy)(dy/dx) = -2y2 - 2x + 5
(dy/dx) = (-2y2 - 2x + 5)/(2y + 8 + 4xy)
(dy/dx) = (-2y2 - 2x + 5)/(2(2xy + y + 4)

Review the power rule for derivatives.,
Rewrite the square root as an exponent.,
Apply the power rule.,
Simplify the result.",How to Differentiate the Square Root of X1," The first rule you probably learned for finding derivatives is the power rule. This rule says that for a variable x{\displaystyle x} raised to any exponent a{\displaystyle a}, the derivative is as follows:f(x)=xa{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{a}}


f′(x)=axa−1{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=ax^{a-1}}

For example, review the following functions and their derivatives:

If f(x)=x2{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}}, then f′(x)=2x{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=2x}

If f(x)=3x2{\displaystyle f(x)=3x^{2}}, then f′(x)=2∗3x=6x{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=2*3x=6x}

If f(x)=x3{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}}, then f′(x)=3x2{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=3x^{2}}

If f(x)=12x4{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{2}}x^{4}}, then f′(x)=4∗12x3=2x3{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=4*{\frac {1}{2}}x^{3}=2x^{3}}


;
, To find the derivative of a square root function, you need to remember that the square root of any number or variable can also be written as an exponent. The term below the square root (radical) sign is written as the base, and it is raised to the exponent of 1/2. Consider the following examples:x=x12{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}=x^{\frac {1}{2}}}


4=412{\displaystyle {\sqrt {4}}=4^{\frac {1}{2}}}


3x=(3x)12{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3x}}=(3x)^{\frac {1}{2}}}


, If the function is the simplest square root, f(x)=x{\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {x}}}, apply the power rule as follows to find the derivative:f(x)=x     {\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {x}}\ \ \ \ \ }(Write the original function.)


f(x)=x(12)     {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{({\frac {1}{2}})}\ \ \ \ \ }(Rewrite the radical as an exponent.)


f′(x)=12x(12−1)   {\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {1}{2}}x^{({\frac {1}{2}}-1)}\ \ \ }(Find derivative with the power rule.)


f′(x)=12x(−12)   {\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {1}{2}}x^{(-{\frac {1}{2}})}\ \ \ }(Simplify exponent.)




, At this stage, you need to recognize that a negative exponent means to take the reciprocal of what the number would be with the positive exponent. The exponent of −12{\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{2}}} means that you will have the square root of the base as the denominator of a fraction.Continuing with the square root of x function from above, the derivative can be simplified as:


f′(x)=12x−12{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {1}{2}}x^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}


f′(x)=12∗1x{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {1}{2}}*{\frac {1}{\sqrt {x}}}}


f′(x)=12x{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {1}{2{\sqrt {x}}}}}

Schedule yourself for building block classes.,
Master the basics of algebra.,
Study particularly hard in trigonometry.,
Gain comfort with exponents and logarithms.",How to Do Well in Calculus1," If you know, as a young student, that you will want to take calculus, either in high school or later in college, you should start with your class schedule. Tell your guidance counselor that you want to get into calculus and map out a schedule that will do this for you. You will need to take at least the basic preliminary classes of Algebra (sometimes taught in one or two years), Geometry, and Trigonometry (sometimes labeled as “Pre-Calculus”).

If your school offers different academic levels of math classes, such as basic, standard, honors, or so on, you should try to get into the highest level that you can. 
;
, Many students begin learning the basics of algebra in seventh or eighth grade. Some even begin getting some basic principles earlier than that. You need to work hard in these classes. Math is a subject that builds one class on another. If you have trouble with the basics that begin in algebra, you are likely to have even more difficulty later in calculus. In particular, here are some of the skills that you should develop:

Manipulation of equations

Quadratic equations

Powers and roots


, In most math programs, the subject that comes just before calculus is trigonometry. Trigonometry is based on the ratios of the sides of right triangles, particularly in connection with the unit circle. Trigonometric functions relate very well to describing motion, and calculus is based on measuring rates of change. Therefore, trigonometry is a key building block of calculus. In particular, you need to learn the following topics very thoroughly:Basic trigonometry functions: sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, cotangent

Inverse trigonometry functions: arcsine, arccosine, arctangent

Know substitute functions. A lot of trigonometry is based on substituting one function for another. You will need to be able to use these substitutions quickly and easily to do well in calculus.

Double angles like sin⁡2θ{\displaystyle \sin 2\theta }

Half angles, like sin2θ2{\displaystyle \sin ^{2}{\frac {\theta }{2}}}

Addition formulas, such as cos⁡(x+y){\displaystyle \cos(x+y)}




, Exponents and logarithms are key to manipulating equations and functions in calculus. These topics generally arise initially in algebra and pre-calculus classes. Exponents and logarithms are inverse operations of each other, and are key to many operations in calculus. You need to study these carefully. Go back and review these topics before your calculus class, if necessary.

 Perform the divergence test.,

Look for p-series.,
Perform the integral test.,
Perform the alternating series test for alternating series.,
Perform the ratio test.,
Perform the limit comparison test.,
Perform the comparison test.",How to Determine Convergence of Infinite Series," This test determines whether the series uk{\displaystyle u_{k}} is divergent or not, where k∈Z.{\displaystyle k\in {\mathbb {Z} }.}

If limk→∞uk≠0,{\displaystyle \lim _{k\to \infty }u_{k}\neq 0,} then uk{\displaystyle u_{k}} diverges.

The inverse is not true. If the limit of a series is 0, that does not imply that the series converges. We must do further checks.
;
, Geometric series are series of the form rk,{\displaystyle r^{k},} where r{\displaystyle r} is the ratio between two adjacent numbers in the series. These series are very easy to recognize and determine the convergence of.

If |r|<1,{\displaystyle |r|<1,} then rk{\displaystyle r^{k}} converges.

If |r|≥1,{\displaystyle |r|\geq 1,} then rk{\displaystyle r^{k}} diverges.

If r=−1,{\displaystyle r=-1,} then the test is inconclusive. Use the alternating series test.

For convergent geometric series, you can find the sum of the series as 11−r.{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1-r}}.}


, P-series are series of the form 1kp.{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{k^{p}}}.} They are sometimes called ""hyperharmonic"" series for the way they generalize the harmonic series, of which p=1.{\displaystyle p=1.}

If p>1,{\displaystyle p>1,} then the series converges.

If 0<p≤1,{\displaystyle 0<p\leq 1,} then the series diverges. Beware the less than or equals sign.

It is well-known that the harmonic series diverges, albeit very slowly, since p=1{\displaystyle p=1} just barely fulfills the second criteria. On the other hand, series such as 6k2{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{k^{2}}}} converge.


, This test works best when f{\displaystyle f} is easy to integrate. Note that f{\displaystyle f} must be decreasing, or the series automatically diverges.

Given a decreasing, continuous function f{\displaystyle f} where uk=f(k){\displaystyle u_{k}=f(k)} for all k≥a,{\displaystyle k\geq a,} then uk{\displaystyle u_{k}} and ∫a∞f(x)dx{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{\infty }f(x){\mathrm {d} }x} both converge or both diverge.

In other words, we can construct a continuous function out of a discrete series, where the terms between the series and the function are equal to one another. Then, we can simply evaluate the integral to check for divergence. If it is divergent, then the series is divergent as well.

Going back to the harmonic series, this series can be represented by the function f(x)=1x.{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{x}}.} Since ∫1∞1xdx=ln⁡(∞)−ln⁡(1)=∞{\displaystyle \int _{1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\ln(\infty )-\ln(1)=\infty } (because the logarithmic function is unbounded), the integral test is yet another way of showing the divergence of this series.


, These series usually contain a (−1)k{\displaystyle (-1)^{k}} term in it. All other tests in this article pertain to series with all positive terms.

If ak>0{\displaystyle a_{k}>0} for a sufficiently large k,{\displaystyle k,} then ak{\displaystyle a_{k}} converges if the following two conditions hold.


ak≥ak+1{\displaystyle a_{k}\geq a_{k+1}}


limk→∞ak=0{\displaystyle \lim _{k\to \infty }a_{k}=0}



Put more simply, if you have an alternating series, ignore the signs and check if each term is less than the previous term. Then check if the limit of the series goes to 0.

It is useful to note that series that converge via the alternating series test, but diverge when the (−1)k{\displaystyle (-1)^{k}} is removed, are deemed conditionally convergent. The alternating harmonic series (−1)k−1k{\displaystyle {\frac {(-1)^{k-1}}{k}}} is one such example, whose sum is ln⁡2.{\displaystyle \ln 2.}


, This test is useful for expressions with factorials or powers in them. Given an infinite series uk,{\displaystyle u_{k},} find uk+1{\displaystyle u_{k+1}} and compute uk+1uk.{\displaystyle {\frac {u_{k+1}}{u_{k}}}.} Now let ρ=limk→∞uk+1uk.{\displaystyle \rho =\lim _{k\to \infty }{\frac {u_{k+1}}{u_{k}}}.}

The series converges if ρ<1,{\displaystyle \rho <1,} diverges if ρ>1{\displaystyle \rho >1} or ρ=±∞,{\displaystyle \rho =\pm \infty ,} and is inconclusive if ρ=1.{\displaystyle \rho =1.}

The root test is a variant of the ratio test, where ρ=limk→∞ukk.{\displaystyle \rho =\lim _{k\to \infty }{\sqrt{u_{k}}}.} The same criteria from the ratio test are used for the root test.


, This test involves choosing a sufficient series bk{\displaystyle b_{k}} for which you know the convergence/divergence of, and compares it to a series ak{\displaystyle a_{k}} through a limit. This test is often used in evaluating the convergence of series defined by rational expressions.

Let ρ=limk→∞akbk.{\displaystyle \rho =\lim _{k\to \infty }{\frac {a_{k}}{b_{k}}}.} Then the series both converge if ρ{\displaystyle \rho } is finite, or both diverge if ρ=±∞.{\displaystyle \rho =\pm \infty .}

For example, if you were given a series 1k3+2k+1,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{k^{3}+2k+1}},} then it makes sense to compare it to 1k3,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{k^{3}}},} as the highest-ordered term increases/falls off the quickest, and you know the latter is convergent via the p-series test.


, This test is generally cumbersome, so use it as a last resort. Given two positive term series ak{\displaystyle a_{k}} and bk,{\displaystyle b_{k},} and the kth term of a{\displaystyle a} is less than the kth term of b,{\displaystyle b,} then the following are true.

If the bigger series bk{\displaystyle b_{k}} converges, then the smaller series ak{\displaystyle a_{k}} converges as well, since bk>ak.{\displaystyle b_{k}>a_{k}.}

If the smaller series ak{\displaystyle a_{k}} diverges, then the bigger series bk{\displaystyle b_{k}} diverges as well, since ak<bk.{\displaystyle a_{k}<b_{k}.}

For example, say we have the series 1k−1.{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{{\sqrt {k}}-1}}.} We can compare this to 1k,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {k}}},} because we can discard the constant terms without affecting the series' convergence/divergence. Because we know that 1k{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {k}}}} is divergent per the p-series test, and because 1k<1k−1,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {k}}}<{\frac {1}{{\sqrt {k}}-1}},} then it follows that 1k−1{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{{\sqrt {k}}-1}}} also diverges.

In this test, it is very important to recognize which series contains the larger or smaller terms. For example, if the smaller series ak{\displaystyle a_{k}} converges, that does not mean that the bigger series bk{\displaystyle b_{k}} converges as well.

Begin with a strong basis of the foundations of math.,
Study with a good teacher.,
Read books about calculus and its applications.",How to Enjoy Calculus1," It is possible to understand the general concepts behind calculus without knowing much other math, but a strong foundation will help. If you are setting out to understand and enjoy calculus, it will help if you have a strong understanding of algebra, geometry and trigonometry. The more you understand these concepts, the more you will be able to do with your work in calculus. If you study the building block subjects thoroughly, you will find calculus a much easier subject.If you are still in high school, you should work with your math teachers to make sure you understand the basics as much as possible.
Meet with your guidance counselor to plan your math classes. Map out a schedule over your high school years so that you will get to include calculus in your schedule by the time you graduate.;
, A strong teacher makes a big difference in how much you enjoy any subject and how much you retain of it later.If you are a high school student signing up for a calculus course, you may not have much direction or control over the teacher that you get. But to the extent possible, if you are looking to study the subject privately or selecting a tutor, find someone who has a true love for the subject and has strong communication skills. If you want to enjoy the topic, you need a teacher who truly enjoys teaching it and sharing it with you. If you are interviewing teachers or tutors, for example, ask the following questions:


How long have you been teaching calculus?
Tell me why you love this subject.
How do you see that calculus applies to the real world?
Why do you think I should want to learn more about calculus?

, Many books have been written about calculus (or mathematics in general) as a general field of study. These are not just textbooks. Many authors have written about the human applications of calculus, about the history of it, and about the general enjoyment that can come from understanding it. You should seek out such literature and read it. The more you learn about the topic -- beyond just learning how to do it -- the more you will appreciate and enjoy it. For example, some books on the subject of calculus include:



Zombies & Calculus, by Colin Adams. This is written by a humor columnist, as a piece of “zombie fiction.” The heroes of the novel use tangent vectors, logistic growth, gravitational acceleration and other calculus-related topics to escape and defeat a pack of zombies.The Magic of Math, by Arthur Benjamin. Using simple explanations and real life examples, the author explains a variety of math concepts, including calculus, from the basis of being a magician.Beyond Numeracy, by John Allen Paulos.

Note that we could have swapped the integrals. The end result would be the same. However, in more general cases, the boundaries will not stay the same, so the order in which you integrate does matter.

Calculate the moment of inertia of a right circular cone.,
Recall the moment of inertia formula.,

Obtain the boundaries.,
Rewrite the moment of inertia integral in terms of a volume integral, then solve.",How to Integrate in Cylindrical Coordinates3," This cone is centered on the z-axis with the apex at the origin, but rotates with respect to the x-axis. In other words, it is rotating laterally, similar to how a beam from a lighthouse rotates. Assume this cone has a height h,{\displaystyle h,} radius a,{\displaystyle a,} mass M,{\displaystyle M,} and constant density σ.{\displaystyle \sigma .}

Most moment of inertia questions are written with answers in terms of M{\displaystyle M} and R{\displaystyle R} (in this example, a{\displaystyle a}), but because a cone also requires a specified height, there will be a term with h{\displaystyle h} in it as well.


, 


I=∫Mr2dm,{\displaystyle I=\int _{M}r^{2}{\mathrm {d} }m,} where r=y2+z2{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {y^{2}+z^{2}}}} is the perpendicular distance from the axis (the cone is rotating about the x-axis) and we are integrating over the mass M.{\displaystyle M.}


,


σ=MV.{\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {M}{V}}.} Of course, we know the volume of the cone as 13πa2h,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}\pi a^{2}h,} so


σ=3Mπa2h.{\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {3M}{\pi a^{2}h}}.}


, We face a dilemma here - we are not integrating over a cylinder, but a cone. Instead, notice the relationships between the variables of integration. As z{\displaystyle z} increases, r{\displaystyle r} increases as well. Therefore, there is variable dependency in the integration, and one of the boundaries will no longer be a constant. 

Recall the equation of a cone.


z2h2=x2a2+y2b2{\displaystyle {\frac {z^{2}}{h^{2}}}={\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}}



The cone is circular, so b=a.{\displaystyle b=a.} Then, convert to cylindrical coordinates.


z2h2=r2a2{\displaystyle {\frac {z^{2}}{h^{2}}}={\frac {r^{2}}{a^{2}}}}



Solve for either the radius or height. Both cases are completely equivalent, but be careful of the boundaries that result, for they are not the same. We will solve for radius and compute the integral that results. See the tips for computing the integral after solving for height. 


r=azh{\displaystyle r={\frac {az}{h}}}

Then, z{\displaystyle z} integrates from 0{\displaystyle 0} to h,{\displaystyle h,} and r{\displaystyle r} goes from 0{\displaystyle 0} to azh.{\displaystyle {\frac {az}{h}}.} Notice that the nature of the object being integrated over introduces variable dependency in the boundaries. In this case, after we integrate the height, the upper boundary of the radius integral is dependent on the z{\displaystyle z} variable.


, The order of the integrals matters here, owing to the way we calculated our boundaries. Also note constants that factor out.


dm=σdV,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }m=\sigma {\mathrm {d} }V,} so therefore,


Ix=∫V(y2+z2)3Mπa2hdV=3Mπa2h∫0hdz∫0azhrdr∫02πdθ(r2sin2⁡θ+z2).{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I_{x}&=\int _{V}(y^{2}+z^{2}){\frac {3M}{\pi a^{2}h}}{\mathrm {d} }V\\&={\frac {3M}{\pi a^{2}h}}\int _{0}^{h}{\mathrm {d} }z\int _{0}^{\frac {az}{h}}r{\mathrm {d} }r\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\mathrm {d} }\theta (r^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta +z^{2}).\end{aligned}}}

Notice that although cylindrical coordinates do not have as much variable dependency in the integrand as do Cartesian coordinates, that does not mean the dependency goes away. Similar to Cartesian integrals, we will have to manually integrate one at a time.

Plug in (x, y) values to find (dy/dx) for any point.,
Use the chain rule for functions-within-functions.,
For equations with x, y, and z variables, find (dz/dx) and (dz/dy).",How to Do Implicit Differentiation2," Congratulations! You've differentiated your equation implicitly — not an easy task for first-timers! Using this equation to find the slope (dy/dx) for any (x, y) point is as simple as plugging in the x and y values for your point into the right side of the equation, then solving for (dy/dx).


For example, let's say that we want to find the slope at the point (3, -4) for our example equation above. To do this, we would substitute 3 for x and -4 for y, solving as follows:



(dy/dx) = (-2y2 - 2x + 5)/(2(2xy + y + 4)
(dy/dx) = (-2(-4)2 - 2(3) + 5)/(2(2(3)(-4) + (-4) + 4)
(dy/dx) = (-2(16) - 6 + 5)/(2(2(3)(-4))
(dy/dx) = (-32) - 6 + 5)/(2(2(-12))
(dy/dx) = (-33)/(2(2(-12))
(dy/dx) = (-33)/(-48) = 3/48, or 0.6875.





, The chain rule is an important piece of knowledge to have when dealing with calculus problems (including implicit differentiation problems). The chain rule states that for a function F(x) which can be written as (f o g)(x), the derivative of F(x) is equal to f'(g(x))g'(x). For difficult implicit differentiation problems, this means that it's possible to differentiate different individual ""pieces"" of the equation, then piece together the result.


As a simple example, let's say that we need to find the derivative of sin(3x2 + x) as part of a larger implicit differentiation problem for the equation sin(3x2 + x) + y3 = 0. If we think of sin(3x2 + x) as ""f(x)"" and 3x2 + x as ""g(x)"", we can find the differentiation as follows:



f'(g(x))g'(x)
(sin(3x2 + x))' × (3x2 + x)'
cos(3x2 + x) × (6x + 1)
(6x + 1)cos(3x2 + x)





, Though it's not common in basic calculus, some advanced applications may require the implicit differentiation of more than two variables. For each extra variable, you'll need to find an extra derivative with respect to x. For instance, if you're working with x, y, and z, you'll need to find both (dz/dy) and (dz/dx). We can do this by differentiating the equation with respect x twice — the first time, we'll insert a (dz/dx) every time we differentiate a term with z, and the second time, we'll insert a (dz/dy) every time we differentiate a z. After this, it's just a matter of solving for (dz/dx) and (dz/dy).


For example, let's say that we're trying to differentiate x3z2 - 5xy5z = x2 + y3.
First, let's differentiate with respect to x and insert (dz/dx). Don't forget to apply the product rule where appropriate!



x3z2 - 5xy5z = x2 + y3

3x2z2 + 2x3z(dz/dx) - 5y5z - 5xy5(dz/dx) = 2x
3x2z2 + (2x3z - 5xy5)(dz/dx) - 5y5z = 2x
(2x3z - 5xy5)(dz/dx) = 2x - 3x2z2 + 5y5z
(dz/dx) = (2x - 3x2z2 + 5y5z)/(2x3z - 5xy5)




Now, let's do the same for (dz/dy)



x3z2 - 5xy5z = x2 + y3

2x3z(dz/dy) - 25xy4z - 5xy5(dz/dy) = 3y2

(2x3z - 5xy5)(dz/dy) = 3y2 + 25xy4z
(dz/dy) = (3y2 + 25xy4z)/(2x3z - 5xy5)

Review the chain rule for functions.,
Define the functions for the chain rule.,
Find the derivatives of the two functions.,
Combine the functions in the chain rule.",How to Differentiate the Square Root of X2," The chain rule is a rule for derivatives that you use when the original function combines a function within another function. The chain rule says that, for two functions f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} and g(x){\displaystyle g(x)}, the derivative of the combination of the two can be found as follows:If y=f(g(x)){\displaystyle y=f(g(x))}, then y′=f′(g)∗g′(x){\displaystyle y^{\prime }=f^{\prime }(g)*g^{\prime }(x)}.


, Using the chain rule requires that you first define the two functions that make up your combined function. For square root functions, the outer function f(g){\displaystyle f(g)} will be the square root function, and the inner function g(x){\displaystyle g(x)} will be whatever appears under the radical sign.For example, suppose you wish to find the derivative of 3x+2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3x+2}}}. Define the two parts as follows:


f(g)=g=g12{\displaystyle f(g)={\sqrt {g}}=g^{\frac {1}{2}}}


g(x)=(3x+2){\displaystyle g(x)=(3x+2)}




, To apply the chain rule to the square root of a function, you will first need to find the derivative of the general square root function:f(g)=g=g12{\displaystyle f(g)={\sqrt {g}}=g^{\frac {1}{2}}}


f′(g)=12g−12{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(g)={\frac {1}{2}}g^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}


f′(g)=12g{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(g)={\frac {1}{2{\sqrt {g}}}}}



Then find the derivative of the second function:


g(x)=(3x+2){\displaystyle g(x)=(3x+2)}


g′(x)=3{\displaystyle g^{\prime }(x)=3}




, Recall the chain rule, y′=f′(g)∗g′(x){\displaystyle y^{\prime }=f^{\prime }(g)*g^{\prime }(x)}, and then combine the derivatives as follows:y′=12g∗3{\displaystyle y^{\prime }={\frac {1}{2{\sqrt {g}}}}*3}


y′=12(3x+2∗3{\displaystyle y^{\prime }={\frac {1}{2{\sqrt {(3x+2}}}}*3}


y′=32(3x+2{\displaystyle y^{\prime }={\frac {3}{2{\sqrt {(3x+2}}}}}

Learn the shortcut for derivatives of any radical function.,
Find the derivative of the radicand.,
Write the derivative of the radicand as the numerator of a fraction.,
Write the denominator as double the original square root.,
Combine numerator and denominator to find the derivative.",How to Differentiate the Square Root of X3," Whenever you wish to find the derivative of the square root of a variable or a function, you can apply a simple pattern. The derivative will always be the derivative of the radicand, divided by double the original square root. Symbolically, this can be shown as:If f(x)=u{\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {u}}}, then f′(x)=u′2u{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {u^{\prime }}{2{\sqrt {u}}}}}


, The radicand is the term or function underneath the square root sign. To apply this shortcut, find the derivative of the radicand alone. Consider the following examples:In the function 5x+2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {5x+2}}}, the radicand is (5x+2){\displaystyle (5x+2)}. Its derivative is 5{\displaystyle 5}.

In the function 3x4{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, the radicand is 3x4{\displaystyle 3x^{4}}. Its derivative is 12x3{\displaystyle 12x^{3}}.

In the function sin(x){\displaystyle {\sqrt {sin(x)}}}, the radicand is sin⁡(x){\displaystyle \sin(x)}. Its derivative is cos⁡(x){\displaystyle \cos(x)}.


, The derivative of a radical function will involve a fraction. The numerator of this fraction is the derivative of the radicand. Thus, for the sample functions above, the first part of the derivative will be as follows:If f(x)=5x+2{\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {5x+2}}}, then f′(x)=5denom{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {5}{\text{denom}}}}

If f(x)=3x4{\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, then f′(x)=12x3denom{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {12x^{3}}{\text{denom}}}}

If f(x)=sin⁡(x){\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {\sin(x)}}}, then f′(x)=cos⁡(x)denom{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {\cos(x)}{\text{denom}}}}


, Using this shortcut, the denominator will be two times the original square root function. Thus, for the three sample functions above, the denominators of the derivatives will be:For f(x)=5x+2{\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {5x+2}}}, then f′(x)=num25x+2{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {\text{num}}{2{\sqrt {5x+2}}}}}

If f(x)=3x4{\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, then f′(x)=num23x4{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {\text{num}}{2{\sqrt {3x^{4}}}}}}

If f(x)=sin⁡(x){\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {\sin(x)}}}, then f′(x)=num2sin⁡(x){\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {\text{num}}{2{\sqrt {\sin(x)}}}}}


, Put the two halves of the fraction together, and the result will be the derivative of the original function.For f(x)=5x+2{\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {5x+2}}}, then f′(x)=525x+2{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {5}{2{\sqrt {5x+2}}}}}

If f(x)=3x4{\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, then f′(x)=12x323x4{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {12x^{3}}{2{\sqrt {3x^{4}}}}}}

If f(x)=sin⁡(x){\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {\sin(x)}}}, then f′(x)=cos⁡(x)2sin⁡(x){\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)={\frac {\cos(x)}{2{\sqrt {\sin(x)}}}}}

Understand the concept of functions.,
Review the concept of limits.,
Memorize certain rules of manipulating derivatives.,
Memorize derivatives of basic trig functions.",How to Do Well in Calculus2," Most calculus text books begin with a review of functions. A function is generally described as a mapping from one set of numbers, called the domain of the function, to another set, called the range. In simple form, if you put one number in to the function, you get another number out. Some simple functions are:

Constant functions. An example is f(x)=3{\displaystyle f(x)=3}.

Linear functions. These are functions whose graphs form straight lines. An example is f(x)=2x−7{\displaystyle f(x)=2x-7}.

Quadratic functions. A simple quadratic function forms a parabola, such as f(x)=x2+3x−2{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+3x-2}.

Power functions. These are variations or advancements on the quadratic function, including such functions as f(x)=x12{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{\frac {1}{2}}} or f(x)=x−1=1x{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{-1}={\frac {1}{x}}}.


, Calculus rests primarily on the concept of mathematical limits. This is the theoretical idea of numbers getting infinitely small or infinitely large, and then measuring the results. Using limits leads to many of the derivations and other concepts that you study in calculus., As you begin studying the concept of derivatives in calculus, you will learn certain rules that help in manipulating functions and resolving problems. You will need to memorize these rules so they come to you quickly when you need them. These basic rules are:Product rule. The derivative of f(x)g(x)=f′(x)g(x)+f(x)g′(x){\displaystyle f(x)g(x)=f^{\prime }(x)g(x)+f(x)g^{\prime }(x)}.

Chain rule. The derivative of f(g(x))=f′(g)∗g′(x){\displaystyle f(g(x))=f^{\prime }(g)*g^{\prime }(x)}.

Quotient rule. If f{\displaystyle f} and g{\displaystyle g} are both functions, then:


(fg)′=f′g−g′fg2{\displaystyle ({\frac {f}{g}})^{\prime }={\frac {f^{\prime }g-g^{\prime }f}{g^{2}}}}




, As with many of the rules of trigonometry, you want the derivatives to be tools that you can use and not additional problems to solve every time they arise. You will be using trigonometric functions over and over, so you should memorize the basic derivatives of them:(sin⁡x)′=cos⁡x{\displaystyle (\sin x)^{\prime }=\cos x}


(cos⁡x)′=−sin⁡x{\displaystyle (\cos x)^{\prime }=-\sin x}


(tan⁡x)′=sec2⁡x{\displaystyle (\tan x)^{\prime }=\sec ^{2}x}


(cot⁡x)′=−csc2⁡x{\displaystyle (\cot x)^{\prime }=-\csc ^{2}x}


(sec⁡x)′=sec⁡xtan⁡x{\displaystyle (\sec x)^{\prime }=\sec x\tan x}


(csc⁡x)′=−csc⁡xcot⁡x{\displaystyle (\csc x)^{\prime }=-\csc x\cot x}

Prepare for class.,
Attend all classes and tutorial sessions.,
Do all homework problems.,
Work with a study group.,
Know the content of each exam.",How to Do Well in Calculus3," Calculus is a subject that moves very quickly. You cannot always expect the teacher or professor to slow the presentation for you to keep up. You should review the course outline, know the topic of each class lecture, and do the reading from your text in advance.As you read, highlight or underline key topics. Make note of particular concepts that you do not understand.

Prepare questions for class. Realize as you read that the lecture may help explain things to you. Even so, prepare some questions in case you remain confused.


, Calculus is a complicated subject, and you cannot expect to learn it completely on your own. In lectures, the teacher may give you added tips or hints for solving particular problem types. You may also get insights into what the teacher believes is most important for testing., The best way to learn any subject - particularly in math - is to use it repeatedly for solving problems. Between classes, you should complete all assigned homework. If you really want to do well, seek out additional work.For example, some teachers may make a practice of assigning only the even numbered homework problems. If you really want to learn the material well, go beyond the assignment and do all the problems.

Check your work carefully and look for errors before turning in your homework.


, Advanced subjects like calculus lend themselves well to study groups. Find some other students in your class and suggest working together. Working in a group, you can help each other understand difficult concepts. You can also check each other’s homework and review ideas.Make sure that your study group is productive and spends the time working.

Hold each member of the group responsible for doing his or her own work. If someone is not meeting expectations, you may want to ask that person to leave the group.

Productive group sizes are about four to six students.


, Before you go into any exam, make sure you know what it will cover. Usually this is just a matter of reviewing your course syllabus. However, if you have any questions, you should check with your professor or teaching assistant. Carefully study all the issues that will be covered on the exam."

Recognize that calculus is the study of change.,
Use calculus to measure amounts or sizes.,
Learn the concept of limits.",How to Enjoy Calculus2," It is easier to enjoy something if you understand it, and it is easier to understand something if you can see a purpose for it. Calculus has many real world applications every day. You may not personally be called on to calculate a derivative or an integral, but you can still see and appreciate the application of calculus in anything that changes.


For example, consider the speed of a car on the road. As cars speed up or slow down, they are changing their location, and they change their rate of speed (acceleration). Recognizing and measuring change is part of the field of calculus., Almost anyone who has passed about third or fourth grade can tell you the area of a simple box, square or rectangle. But if the shape gets more complicated, with angles or curves, you may not have a simple formula to measure its size. Using calculus, however, and integrating a function, can help you determine the area that is held within.For example, if you have a specific amount of fencing material, and you need to design a pasture, a simple calculus problem will help you decide the best shape and size to maximize the size of your pasture while conserving your building materials., The study of calculus is ultimately the study of limits - that is, measurements that get infinitely small or infinitely close together, without ever actually reaching a particular point. If you enjoy mental brain teasers, you can find applications in limits - and therefore, in calculus - that are especially challenging and enjoyable.


Consider the ancient problem of Achilles and the Tortoise. The concept behind this paradox is that Achilles, the fastest man in the world at that time, was to race a tortoise. He offered the tortoise a head start of half the distance to the goal. The tortoise argued that there was no reason to race, because Achilles could never win. Once they start running, Achilles would run up to the point where the tortoise began. But in that time, the tortoise would have moved ahead by some distance. So Achilles would try to catch up. But in that time that he caught up, the tortoise would have moved ahead again. In each moment of time, as Achilles covers the ground between them, the tortoise would move ahead by some amount. Calculus addresses this conundrum and provides an explanation."
"
Expand your sense of humor.,
Look for calculus references all around you.,
Enjoy parodies of calculus.",How to Enjoy Calculus3," Many mathematicians find the actual study of humor to be enjoyable. One professor, John Allen Paulos, even wrote a book entitled “Mathematics and Humor: A Study of the Logic of Humor.”Developing an understanding of mathematics in general and calculus in particular can open a new field of jokes and puns.


A poster, designed to be humorous to calculus students, advertises the dangers of alcoholism. It warns, “Don’t drink and derive,” making a pun out of derivative calculus., Modern society has adopted many forms of calculus in jokes, stories, and other forms of entertainment. Perhaps the most popular source currently is the television program “The Big Bang Theory,” which finds humor in four scientists and their encounters with everyday life. The show often bases jokes on misunderstandings of calculus, physics and other mathematical concepts., Again, recognizing that jokes are funnier if you have a basic understanding of the subject area, many math-minded people have created YouTube parodies of songs or literature that revolve around calculus. Many of these are funny to anyone watching, but the humor is strongest if you watch them with an understanding of calculus. Some examples include:”I Will Derive,” a song parody of the disco tune “I will Survive.”
”Calculus Rhapsody,” a parody of the Queen classic “Bohemian Rhapsody.”
”Derive me, Maybe,” a parody of the pop tune “Call me Maybe.”

Find and memorize the 6 trig functions of the special angle π/4.,
Know which reference angle to use.,
Know whether the value is positive or negative.",How to Understand the Unit Circle," The unit circle is a circle, centered at the origin, with a radius of 1. Recall from conics that the equation is x2+y2=1. This circle can be used to find certain ""special"" trigonometric ratios as well as aid in graphing. There is also a real number line wrapped around the circle that serves as the input value when evaluating trig functions.;
, Know that


sinθ=opposite/hypotenuse
cosθ=adjacent/hypotenuse
tanθ=opposite/adjacent
cosecθ=1/sinθ
secθ=1/cosθ
cotθ=1/tanθ.

, A radian is another way to measure an angle. One radian is the angle needed so the enclosed arc length is equal to the radius length. Note that it doesn't matter the size or orientation of the circle. You also need to know the number of radians in a full circle (360 degrees). Remember that the circumference of a circle is given by 2πr so there are 2π radius measures in the circumference. Since a radian by definition is the angle where the radius length equals the arc length, there are 2π radians in a full circle.

, There are 2π radians in a full circle, or 360 degrees. So:


2πradian=360degree
radian=(360/2π)degree
radian=(180/π)degree
and
360degree=2πradian
degree=(2π/360)radian
degree=(π/180)radian

, The special angles in radians are π/6, π/3, π/4, π/2, π, and the multiples of all (e.g. 5π/6)

, To derive these, you must look at the unit circle. Recall that there is a real number line wrapped around the unit circle. The point on the number line refers to the number of radians in the angle formed. For instance The point at π/2 on the real number line corresponds with the point on the circle whose radius forms an angle of π/2 with the positive horizontal radius. The trick to finding the trig values of any angle, therefore is to find the coordinates of the point. The hypotenuse is always 1, as that is the radius of the circle, and since any number divided by 1 is itself, and the opposite side equals the y-value, it follows that the sine value is the y-coordinate of the point. The cosine value follows a similar logic. Cos equals the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse, and again, as the hypotenuse is always 1, and the adjacent side equals the x-coordinate, it follows that the cosine value is the x-coordinate of the point. The tangent is slightly more difficult. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle equals the opposite side divided by the adjacent side. The problem is that there is no constant in the denominator like in the previous examples, so you have to be a bit more creative. Remember that the opposite side equals the y-coordinate and the adjacent side equals the x-coordinate, so by substituting, you should find that the tangent equals y/x. Using this you can find the inverse trig functions by taking the reciprocal of these formulas. To summarize, here are the identities.


sinθ=y
cosθ=x
tanθ=y/x
csc=1/y
sec=1/x
cot=x/y

, For angles that are multiples of π/2 such as 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π etc. Finding the trig functions is as easy as picturing the angle on the axes. If the terminal side is along the x-axis, the sin will be 0 and the cos will be either 1 or -1 depending on which direction the ray points. Similarly, if the terminal side is along the y-axis, the sin will be either 1 or -1 and the cos will be 0.

, Start by drawing the angle π/6 on the unit circle. You know how to find the side lengths for special right triangles (30-60-90 and 45-45-90) given one side, and as π/6=30 degrees, this triangle is one of those special cases. So if you recall, the short leg is 1/2 the hypotenuse, so the y-coordinate is 1/2, and the long leg is √3 times the shorter leg, or (√3)/2, so the x-coordinate is (√3)/2. The coordinates of that point are ((√3)/2,1/2) Now use the identities in the previous step to find that:


sinπ/6=1/2
cosπ/6=(√3)/2
tanπ/6=1/(√3)
cscπ/6=2
secπ/6=2/(√3)
cotπ/6=√3

, So, the point is (1/2, √3/2). Therefore it follows that:


sinπ/3=(√3)/2
cosπ/3=1/2
tanπ/3=√3
cscπ/3=2/(√3)
secπ/3=2
cotπ/3=1/(√3)

, The ratios for a 45-45-90 triangle are a hypotenuse of √2 and legs of 1, so on the unit circle, the dimensions are as follows:and the trig functions are:


sinπ/4=1/(√2)
cosπ/4=1/(√2)
tanπ/4=1
cscπ/4=√2
secπ/4=√2
cotπ/4=1

, At this point you have already found the trig values of the three special reference angles, however all of these are in Quadrant I. If you need to find a function of a larger or smaller special angle, first figure out which reference angle is in the same ""family"" of angles. For instance, the π/3 family consists of 2π/3, 4π/3, and 5π/3. A good general rule for finding the reference angle is to reduce the fraction as much as possible then look at the bottom number.


If it is a 3, it is in the π/3 family
If it is a 6, it is in the π/6 family
If it is a 2, it is in the π/2 family
If it stands alone, like π or 0, it is in the π family
If it is a 4, it is in the π/4 family

, All angles in the same family have the same trig values as the reference angle, but 2 will be positive and two will be negative.


If the angle is in Quadrant I, all trig values are positive
If the angle is in Quadrant II, all trig values are negative except sin and csc.
If the angle is in Quadrant III, all trig values are negative except tan and cot.
If the angle is in Quadrant IV, all trig values are negative except for cos and sec.

Assess what values you know.,
Set up the formula for the Cosine Rule.,
Plug the known values into the formula.,
Find the cosine of the known angle.,
Complete the necessary multiplication.,
Add the squares of the known sides.,
Subtract the two values.,
Take the square root of the difference.",How to Use the Cosine Rule1," To find the missing side length of a triangle, you need to know the lengths of the other two sides, as well as the size of the angle between them.For example, you might have triangle XYZ. Side YX is 5 cm long. Side YZ is 9 cm long. Angle Y is 89 degrees. How long is side XZ?
;
, This is also called the law of cosines. The formula is c2=a2+b2−2abcosC{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos {C}}. In this formula, c{\displaystyle c} equals the missing side length, and cosC{\displaystyle \cos {C}} equals the cosine of the angle opposite the missing side length. The variables a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the lengths of the two known sides., The variables a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the two known side lengths. The variable C{\displaystyle C} is the known angle, which should be the angle between a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.For example, since the length of side XZ is missing, this side length will stand for c{\displaystyle c} in the formula. Since sides YX and YZ are known, these two side lengths will be a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}. It doesn’t matter which side is which variable. The variable C{\displaystyle C} is angle Y. So, your formula should look like this: c2=52+92−2(5)(9)cos89{\displaystyle c^{2}=5^{2}+9^{2}-2(5)(9)\cos {89}}.


, Do this using a calculator’s cosine function. Simply type in the angle measurement, then hit the COS{\displaystyle COS} button. If you don't have a scientific calculator, you can find a cosine table online, such as the one found at the Physics Lab website.You can also simply type in ""cosine x degrees"" into Google, (substituting the angle for x), and the search engine will give back the calculation.

For example, the cosine of 89 is about 0.01745. So, plug this value into your formula: c2=52+92−2(5)(9)(0.01745){\displaystyle c^{2}=5^{2}+9^{2}-2(5)(9)(0.01745)}.


, You are multiplying 2ab{\displaystyle 2ab} by the known angle’s cosine.

For example:c2=52+92−2(5)(9)(0.01745){\displaystyle c^{2}=5^{2}+9^{2}-2(5)(9)(0.01745)}c2=52+92−1.5707{\displaystyle c^{2}=5^{2}+9^{2}-1.5707}


, Remember that when you square a number, you multiply it by itself. Square the two numbers first, then add them.

For example:c2=52+92−1.5707{\displaystyle c^{2}=5^{2}+9^{2}-1.5707}c2=25+81−1.5707{\displaystyle c^{2}=25+81-1.5707}c2=106−1.5707{\displaystyle c^{2}=106-1.5707}


, This will give you the value of c2{\displaystyle c^{2}}.

For example:c2=106−1.5707{\displaystyle c^{2}=106-1.5707}c2=104.4293{\displaystyle c^{2}=104.4293}


, You will likely want to use a calculator for this step, because the number you are finding the square root of will have many decimal places. The square root is equal to the length of the missing side of the triangle.For example:c2=104.4293{\displaystyle c^{2}=104.4293}c2=104.4293{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c^{2}}}={\sqrt {104.4293}}}c=10.2191{\displaystyle c=10.2191}So, the missing side length, c{\displaystyle c}, is 10.2191 cm long.

To solve a trig equation, transform it into one or many basic trig equations. Solving trig equations finally results in solving 4 types of basic trig equations.;
,


There are 4 types of basic trig equations:
sin x = a  ; cos x = a
tan x = a  ; cot x = a
Solving basic trig equations proceeds by studying the various positions of the arc x on the trig circle, and by using trig conversion table (or calculator). To fully know how to solve these basic trig equations, and similar, see book titled :""Trigonometry: Solving trig equations and inequalities"" (Amazon E-book 2010).
Example 1. Solve sin x = 0.866. The conversion table (or calculator) gives the answer: x = Pi/3. The trig circle gives another arc (2Pi/3) that has the same sin value (0.866). The trig circle also gives an infinity of answers that are called extended answers.
x1 = Pi/3 + 2k.Pi, and x2 = 2Pi/3. (Answers within period (0, 2Pi))
x1 = Pi/3 + 2k Pi, and x2 = 2Pi/3 + 2k Pi. (Extended answers).
Example 2. Solve: cos x = -1/2. Calculators give x = 2 Pi/3. The trig circle gives another x = -2Pi/3.
x1 = 2Pi/3 + 2k.Pi, and x2 = - 2Pi/3. (Answers within period (0, 2Pi))
x1 = 2Pi/3 + 2k Pi, and x2 = -2Pi/3 + 2k.Pi. (Extended answers)
Example 3. Solve: tan (x - Pi/4) = 0.
x = Pi/4 ; (Answer)
x = Pi/4 + k Pi; ( Extended answer)
Example 4. Solve cot 2x = 1.732. Calculators and the trig circle give
x = Pi/12 ; (Answer)
x = Pi/12 + k Pi ; (Extended answers)

,


To transform a given trig equation into basic trig ones, use common algebraic transformations (factoring, common factor, polynomial identities...), definitions and properties of trig functions, and trig identities. There are about 31, among them the last 14 trig identities, from 19 to 31, are called Transformation Identities, since they are used in the transformation of trig equations. See book mentioned above.
Example 5: The trig equation: sin x + sin 2x + sin 3x = 0 can be transformed, using trig identities, into a product of basic trig equations: 4cos x*sin (3x/2)*cos (x/2) = 0. The basic trig equations to be solved are: cos x = 0 ; sin (3x/2) = 0 ; and cos (x/2) = 0.

,


Before learning solving trig equations, you must know how to quickly find the arcs whose trig functions are known. Conversion values of arcs (or angles) are given by trig tables or calculators.
Example: After solving, get cos x = 0.732. Calculators give the solution arc x = 42.95 degree. The trig unit circle will give other solution arcs that have the same cos value.

,


You can graph to illustrate the solution arcs on the trig unit circle. The terminal points of these solution arcs constitute regular polygons on the trig circle. For examples:
The terminal points of the solution arcs x = Pi/3 + k.Pi/2 constitute a square on the trig unit circle.
The solution arcs x = Pi/4 + k.Pi/3 are represented by the vertexes of a regular hexagon on the trig unit circle.

,


If the given trig equation contains only one trig function, solve it as a basic trig equation. If the given equation contains two or more trig functions there are 2 approaches in solving, depending on transformation possibility.

A. Approach 1.


Transform the given trig equation into a product in the form: f(x).g(x) = 0 or f(x).g(x).h(x) = 0, in which f(x), g(x) and h(x) are basic trig equations.
Example 6. Solve: 2cos x + sin 2x = 0. (0 < x < 2Pi)
Solution. Replace in the equation sin 2x by using the identity: sin 2x = 2*sin x*cos x.
cos x + 2*sin x*cos x = 2cos x*( sin x + 1) = 0. Next, solve the 2 basic trig functions: cos x = 0, and (sin x + 1) = 0.
Example 7. Solve: cos x + cos 2x + cos 3x = 0. (0 < x < 2Pi)
Solution: Transform it to a product, using trig identities: cos 2x(2cos x + 1 ) = 0. Next, solve the 2 basic trig equations: cos 2x = 0, and (2cos x + 1) = 0.
Example 8. Solve: sin x - sin 3x = cos 2x. (0 < x < 2Pi)
Solution: Transform it into a product, using trig identities: -cos 2x*(2sin x + 1) = 0. Then solve the 2 basic trig equations: cos 2x = 0, and (2sin x + 1) = 0.

B. Approach 2.


Transform the given trig equation into a trig equation having only one unique trig function as variable. There are a few tips on how to select the appropriate variable. The common variables to select are: sin x = t; cos x = t; cos 2x = t, tan x = t and tan (x/2) = t.
Example 9. Solve: 3sin^2 x - 2cos^2 x = 4sin x + 7 (0 < x < 2Pi).
Solution. Replace in the equation (cos^2 x) by (1 - sin^2 x), then simplify the equation:
3sin^2 x - 2 + 2sin^2 x - 4sin x - 7 = 0. Call sin x = t. The equation becomes: 5t^2 - 4t - 9 = 0. This is a quadratic equation that has 2 real roots: t1 = -1 and t2 = 9/5. The second t2 is rejected since > 1. Next, solve: t = sin = -1 --> x = 3Pi/2.
Example 10. Solve: tan x + 2 tan^2 x = cot x + 2.
Solution. Call tan x = t. Transform the given equation into an equation with t as variable: (2t + 1)(t^2 - 1) = 0. Solve for t from this product, then solve the basic trig equation tan x = t for x.

,


There are a few special types of trig equations that require some specific transformations. Examples:
a*sin x+ b*cos x = c ; a(sin x + cos x) + b*cos x*sin x = c ;
a*sin^2 x + b*sin x*cos x + c*cos^2 x = 0

,


All trig functions are periodic meaning they come back to the same value after a rotation for one period. Examples:

The function f(x) = sin x has 2Pi as period.
The function f(x) = tan x has Pi as period.
The function f(x) = sin 2x has Pi as period.
The function f(x) = cos (x/2) has 4Pi as period.


If the period is specified in the problem/test, you have to only find the solution arc(s) x within this period.
NOTE: Solving trig equation is a tricky work that often leads to errors and mistakes. Therefore, answers should be carefully checked. After solving, you can check the answers by using a graphing calculator to directly graph the given trig equation R(x) = 0. The answers (real roots) will be given in decimals. For example, Pi is given by the value 3.14

Set up a right triangle model.,
Identify the known parts of the triangle.,
Set up a trigonometry equation.,
Solve for your unknown value.,
Interpret and report your result.,
Solve another problem for practice.",How to Use Right Angled Trigonometry1," Trigonometry functions can be used to model real world situations involving lengths and angles. The first step is to define the situation with a right triangle model.For example, suppose you have the following problem:

You are climbing a hill. You know that the peak of the hill is 500 meters above the base, and you know that the angle of the climb is 15 degrees. How far must you walk to reach the top? 

Sketch a right triangle and label the parts. The vertical leg is the height of the hill. The top of that leg represents the peak of the hill. The angled side of the triangle, the hypotenuse, is the climbing trail.


;
, When you have your sketch and have labeled the parts of it, you need to assign the values that you know.

On the problem of the hill, you are told that the vertical height is 500 meters. Mark the vertical leg of the triangle 500 m.

You are told that the climbing angle is 15 degrees. This is the angle between the base (bottom leg) of the triangle and the hypotenuse.

You are asked to find the distance of the climb, which is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle. Mark this unknown as x{\displaystyle x}.


, Review the information that you know and what you are trying to learn, and choose the trigonometry function that links those together. For example, the sine function links an angle, its opposite side and the hypotenuse. The cosine function links an angle, its adjacent side and the hypotenuse. The tangent function links the two legs without the hypotenuse.

In the problem with the hill climb, you should recognize that you know the base angle and the vertical height of the triangle, so this should let you know that you will be using the sine function. Set up the problem as follows:sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


sin⁡15=500hypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin 15={\frac {500}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


, Use basic algebraic manipulation to rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown value. You will then use either a table of trigonometric values or a calculator to find the value of the sine of the angle that you know.To find the length of the hill climb, solve the equation for the length of the hypotenuse.


sin⁡15=500hypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin 15={\frac {500}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


hypotenuse=500sin⁡15{\displaystyle {\text{hypotenuse}}={\frac {500}{\sin 15}}}


hypotenuse=5000.259{\displaystyle {\text{hypotenuse}}={\frac {500}{0.259}}}


hypotenuse=1930{\displaystyle {\text{hypotenuse}}=1930}




, With any word problem, getting a numerical answer is not the end of the solution. You need to report your answer in terms that make sense for the problem, using the proper units.For the hill problem, the solution of 1930 means that the length of the climb is 1930 meters.


, Consider one more problem, set up a diagram, and then solve for the unknown length.Read the problem. Suppose a coal bed under your property is at a 12 degree angle and comes to the surface 6 kilometers away. How deep do you have to dig straight down to reach the coal under your property?

 Set up a diagram. This problem actually sets up an inverted right triangle. The horizontal base represents the ground level. The vertical leg represents the depth under your property, and the hypotenuse is the 12 degree angle that slopes down to the coal bed.

Label the known and unknown values. You know that the horizontal leg is 6 kilometers (3.7 mi), and the angle measurement is 12 degrees. You want to solve the length of the vertical leg.

Set up a trigonometry equation. In this case, the unknown value that you want to solve is the vertical leg, and you know the horizontal leg. The trigonometry function that uses the two legs is the tangent. 


tan⁡θ=oppositeadjacent{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}}}


tan⁡12=opposite6{\displaystyle \tan 12={\frac {\text{opposite}}{6}}}



Solve for the unknown value.


opposite=tan⁡12∗6{\displaystyle {\text{opposite}}=\tan 12*6}


opposite=0.213∗6{\displaystyle {\text{opposite}}=0.213*6}


opposite=1.278{\displaystyle {\text{opposite}}=1.278}



Interpret your result. The lengths in this problem are in units of kilometers. Therefore, your answer is 1.278 kilometers (0.794 mi). The answer to the question is that you must dig 1.278 kilometers (0.794 mi) straight down to reach the coal bed.

To solve a trig inequality, transform it into many basic trig inequalities.,
Learn the 4 types of basic trig inequalities:


sin x > a (or < a)  ; cos x > a (or < a)
tan x > a (or < a) ; cot x > a (or < a)

,
To know how to solve these basic trig inequalities, see book titled ""Trigonometry: Solving trigonometric equations and inequalities"" (Amazon e-book 2010).,
If the trig inequality contains only one trig function, solve it as a basic trig inequality.,
Step 1.Transform the given trig inequality into standard form R> 0 (or < 0).,
Step 2.,
Step 3.,
Step 4.,
Set up a Sign Table in which the top line figures all the values of x progressively varying from 0 to 2Pi.",How to Solve Trigonometric Inequalities," Solving trig inequalities finally results in solving basic trig inequalities.


The transformation process proceeds exactly the same as in solving trig equations.
The common period of a trig inequality is the least common multiple of all periods of the trig functions presented in the equality.
For example: the trig inequality sin x + sin 2x + cos x/2 < 1 has 4Pi as common period.
For example: the trig tan x + cot x/2 has 2Pi as common period.
Unless specified, the solution set of a trig inequality must be solved, at least, within one whole common period.;
,, Solving basic trig inequalities proceeds by studying the various positions of the variable arc x that rotates on the trig unit circle, and by using trig tables, or calculators.


Example 1. Solve: sin x > 0.709

Solution. The solution set is given by the trig unit circle and Trig Table:


Pi/4 + 2k.Pi < x < 3Pi/4 + 2k.Pi
Example 2. Solve: tan x < 0.414

Solution. Solution set given by Trig Table and unit circle:


-Pi/2 + k.Pi < x < Pi/8 + k.Pi

, If the inequality is complicated, containing two or more trig functions, solve it in 4 steps.

,


Example. The inequality (cos 2x < 2 + 3sin x) will be transformed into standard form: R= cos 2x - 3sin x -2 < 0.
Example. The inequality (2tan x + tan 2x > 3cot x) will be transformed to R= 2tan x + tan 2x - 3cot x > 0.

, Find the common period. The common period of a trig inequality must be the least multiple of all the periods of the trig functions contained in this inequality.


Example. The trig inequality R= cos 2x - 3sin x - 2 < 0 has 2Pi as common period that is the least multiple of the 2 periods 2Pi, and Pi.
Example. The trig inequality sin x + sin 2x + sin 3x > 0 has 2Pi as common period that is the least multiple of the 3 periods: 2Pi, Pi, and 2Pi/3.
Example. The trig inequality sin 3x + cos x/2 - 1 < 0 has 4Pi as common period.

, Transform and solve the trig equation R= 0 for x. To know how to transform and to solve the trig equation R= 0, please read the article ""How to solve trig equations"" on this wikiHow website. As a reminder, there are 2 approaches:


a. The first approach transforms the given trig equation into a product of many basic trig equations. Next, separately solve these basic trig equations to get all values of x within the common period. These values of x will be used in STEP 4.

Example. Solve the trig inequality: cos x + cos 2x + cos 3x > 0.
Solution. Using trig identities, transform the equation R= cos x + cos 2x + cos 3x = 0 into a product: cos 2x (1 + 2cos x) = 0.
Next, solve the 2 basic trig equations f(x) = cos 2x = 0 and g(x) = 1 + cos 2x = 0 to get all values of x within the common period.


b. The second approach transforms the given trig equation into one trig equation containing only one trig function (called t) as variable. Solve for t from this transformed trig equation. Then solve these t values for x. The common function variables to select are sin x = t; cos x = t; tan x = t; and tan x/2 = t.

Example. Solve: R= cos 4x + 3cos2x + 1 < 0.
Solution. Transform the equation Rinto a trig quadratic equation with cos 2x = t as variable:
2cos^2 2x + 3cos 2x + 1 = 2t^2 + 3t + 1 = 0


Solve this quadratic equation for t. There are 2 real roots: t = -1 and t = -1/2. Then, solve the two basic trig equation cos 2x = t = -1 and cos 2x = t = -1/2 for x. All these values of x will be used in STEP 4.

, Solve the given trig inequality R(x) < 0 (or > 0) by the algebraic method, using a Sign Table.


Example. Solve the inequality R= sin x + sin 3x < -sin 2x (1)
Solution. Standard form: sin x + sin 2x + sin 3x < 0. The common period is 2Pi. Transform (1) into a product: R= 2sin 2x(cos x - 1/2) < 0. In step 3 solve R(x) = 0. Solve the basic equation f(x) = sin 2x = 0. The solution arcs are: 0, Pi/2, Pi, 3Pi/2, 2Pi. Then, solve the equation g(x) = cos x - 1/2 = 0. The arcs are Pi/3, 5Pi/3. All these 7 values of x will be used to set up a sign table in Step 4, to solve R(x) < 0 (or > 0)

, These consecutive values of x create various intervals between them.


First, figure the variation of f(x)= sin 2x on the second line of the sign table. This proceeds by considering the various positions of the arc x that rotates on the trig unit circle. For example if x is in the first quadrant, the arc 2x is in the second quadrant and sin 2x is positive. Mark the intervals with + and - signs according to the variation of f(x).
Next, figure the variation of g(x) = cos x - 1/2 on the third line of the sign table. Solve and mark the intervals with + or - sign as in the above operation.
The bottom line figures the variation of R, with + and - signs that are the combined signs of the product R= f(x).g(x) in each interval. In this example, all the - intervals of the bottom line constitute the solution set of the given trig inequality R(x) < 0 within the common period. The solution set: (Pi/3 , Pi/2) and (Pi , 3Pi/2) and (5Pi/3 , 2Pi).
Note 1. The approach to determine the variation of f(x) and g(x) is exactly the same approach in solving basic trig inequalities, that is the study of various positions of the variable arc x on the trig unit circle.
Note 2. The graphing method. This method uses graphing calculators to directly graph the given trig inequality R> 0 (or < 0). This method, if allowed by teachers/tests/exams, is fast, accurate and convenient. To know how to proceed, see the last chapter of the above mentioned trig book.

Check your work.",How to Memorize the Unit Circle," Place a straightedge on a large sheet of paper. Draw one vertical and one horizontal line. These should intersect near the center of the page. These are the x and y axes of a graph.

, Using a compass, draw a large circle with its center at the intersection of the two lines.
, A radian is a measure of angle. Specifically, it is defined such that a person walking around a circle with a radius of 1 unit sweeps across an angle of one radian after walking for 1 unit around the circumference. In the next step, we'll label the four coordinate points with the radian value. If you memorize the formula to relate circumference and radius, you can quickly work these out from scratch, even if you haven't memorized them.

The unit circle's radian measurements always assume you are starting from the (0, 1) coordinate. To make it clear which point we're referring to, we'll describe the circle as a compass rose:


, A circle's circumference equals 2πr, where r is the radius. Since the unit circle has a radius of 1, we can simplify its circumference to 2π. You can find the radian value of any point on the circumference, just by taking 2π and dividing by the fraction of the circle you've covered. This is much easier than memorizing every single value on the circle.
, All this takes is dividing 2π into quarters:

""East"" is the starting point, so you've covered 0 radians.

""North"" = ¼ of the circumference = 2π/4 = π/2 radians.

""West"" = halfway across = 2π/2 = π radians.


South = three quarters across = 2π * ¾ = 3π/2 radians.

Walking the entire circumference brings you back to your starting point. You can label this 2π as well as 0 to represent this.


, Now draw a line through each quadrant, cutting it perfectly in half. Once again, use division to find the value in radians:


π/4


3π/4


5π/4


7π/4


(π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π are already labeled.)


, Now draw additional lines cutting the circle into six segments. (You can use a protractor to do this, starting at the positive x-axis and measuring 60 degrees each time.) You can use the same approach above to realize that one-sixth of a circle covers 2π/6 = π/3 radians. Use this to label the following points on the circumference (one in each quadrant):


π/3


2π/3


4π/3


5π/3


(π and 2π are already labeled)


, The last points labeled on most unit circles represent increments of one-twelfth the circumference. Only four of these have not yet been labeled:


π/6


5π/6


7π/6


11π/6


, The unit circle is especially useful for right angle trigonometry. Each x coordinate of a point on the circle equals cosine(θ), and each y coordinate equals sine(θ), where θ is the value of the angle.

If you have trouble remembering this, think (cos, sin) ""'cause sine goes last"".

You can derive this using right triangles and the definition of these functions — remember ""sohcahtoa""?


, A ""unit circle"" is just a circle with a radius exactly one unit long. Use this to find the x and y coordinates of four points on the circle, where it intersects with an axis. (We're calling this ""East,"" ""North,"" and so on for ease of reading, but these are not official names.)

The ""East"" point's coordinates are (1, 0).

The ""North"" point is at (0, 1).

The ""West"" point is at (-1, 0).

The ""South"" point is at (0, -1).

This works just like a normal graph. You should be able to figure out these coordinates on your own, without having to memorize them.


, The first quadrant is the upper right quarter of the circle, where both x and y values are positive. These are the only coordinate values you have to memorize:

At π/6, the coordinates are (32,12{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}}}).

At π/4, the coordinates are (22,22{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}},{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}}).

At π/3, the coordinates are (12,32{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}},{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}).

Notice that there are only three numerators. Moving in a positive direction (left to right for x values, bottom to top for y values), these should go 1 → √2 → √3.


, If you can draw a perfectly vertical or a perfectly horizontal line between two points, they have the same absolute value x- and y- coordinates. In other words, you can draw a line from a point in the first quadrants, write in the same coordinates at the point where you end up, and leave room to right in the sign (+ or -).

For example, you can draw a horizontal line between π/3 and 2π/3. Since the coordinates at the first point are (12,32{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}},{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}), the coordinates at the second point are (?12,?32{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}},?{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}), where ""?"" is standing in for a + or - sign.

Here's a shortcut: check the denominator in the radians. All points ending /3 have the same absolute value coordinates, as do all points ending in /4 and all points ending in /6.


, There are several ways to memorize where to put the - signs on your circle:

Think of basic graph rules. Above the x axis is positive, below is negative. Left of the y axis is negative, right is positive.

Start from quadrant 1 and draw lines to other points. If the line crosses the y axis, the y value switches sign. If it crosses the x axis, the x value switches sign.

Memorize ""All Students Take Calculus"" (ASTC), moving counter-clockwise. Quadrant 1 has All positive values, Q2 has positive Sine only, Q3 has positive Tangent only, and Q4 has positive Cosine only.

Whichever method you choose, the signs are (+,+) for quadrant 1, (-,+) for quadrant 2, (-,-) for quadrant 3, and (+,-) for quadrant 4.


, Here's the full list of coordinate values at every labeled point on your circle (not counting the four points on the axes), moving clockwise. Remember, you should be able to find all these values just by memorizing quadrant 1:

Quadrant 1: (32,12{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}}}); (22,22{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}},{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}}); (12,32{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}},{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}).

Quadrant 2: (−12,32{\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{2}},{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}); (−22,22{\displaystyle -{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}},{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}}); (−32,12{\displaystyle -{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}}})

Quadrant 3: (−32,−12{\displaystyle -{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},-{\frac {1}{2}}}); (−22,−22{\displaystyle -{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}},-{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}}); (−12,−32{\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{2}},-{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}})

Quadrant 4: (12,−32{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}},-{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}); (22,−22{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}},-{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}}); (32,−12{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},-{\frac {1}{2}}})

Create a table.,
Fill in the sine column.,
Fill in the cosine column.,
Fill in the tangent column.,
Fill in the cotangent column.",How to Remember the Trigonometric Table,"
In the first row, write down the trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan, cot).
In the first column, write down the angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°).
Leave other entries blank.;
,
We will fill in the blank entries in the sin column using the expression √x/2. Once the sine column is filled, we'll be able to fill all other columns effortlessly!


For the 1st entry in the sine column (that is, sin 0°), set x = 0 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 0° = √0/2 = 0/2 = 0






For the 2nd entry in the sine column (that is, sin 30°), set x = 1 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 30° = √1/2 = 1/2






For the 3rd entry in the sine column (that is, sin 45°), set x = 2 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 45° = √2/2 = 1/√2






For the 4th entry in the sine column (that is, sin 60°), set x = 3 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 60° = √3/2.






For the 5th entry in the sin column (that is, sin 90°), set x = 4 and plug it in the expression √x/2.
Thus, sin 90° = √4/2 = 2/2 = 1.







,
Simply copy the entries in the sine column in reverse order into the cosine column. This is valid because sin x° = cos (90-x)° for any x.

,
We know that tan = sin / cos. So, for every angle take its sin value and divide it by the cos value to get the corresponding tan value.
For example, tan 30° = sin 30° / cos 30° = (√1/2) / (√3/2) = 1/√3

,
Simply copy the entries in tangent column in reverse order into the cot column. This is valid because tan x° = sin x° / cos x° = cos (90-x)° / sin (90-x)° = cot (90-x)° for any x.

Side SR is 8 cm long. Side ST is 10 cm long. Side RT is 12 cm long. What is the measurement of angle S?


, The formula is c2=a2+b2−2abcosC{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos {C}}. In this formula, cosC{\displaystyle \cos {C}} equals the cosine of the angle you are trying to find. The variable c{\displaystyle c} equals the side opposite the missing angle. The variables a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the lengths of the other two sides., Plug these values into the formula.For example, since side RT is opposite the missing angle, angle S, side RT will equal c{\displaystyle c} in the formula. The other two side lengths will be a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}. It doesn’t matter which side is which variable. So, your formula should look like this: 122=82+102−2(8)(10)cosC{\displaystyle 12^{2}=8^{2}+10^{2}-2(8)(10)\cos {C}}.


, You are multiplying 2ab{\displaystyle 2ab} times the cosine of the missing angle, which you don’t know yet. So, the variable should remain.

For example, 122=82+102−160cosC{\displaystyle 12^{2}=8^{2}+10^{2}-160\cos {C}}.


, Remember that to square a number, you multiply the number by itself.

For example, 144=82+102−160cosC{\displaystyle 144=8^{2}+10^{2}-160\cos {C}}


, Make sure you square each number first, and then add them together.

For example:144=64+100−160cosC{\displaystyle 144=64+100-160\cos {C}}144=164−160cosC{\displaystyle 144=164-160\cos {C}}


, To do this, subtract the sum of a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} and b2{\displaystyle b^{2}} from both sides of the equation. Then, divide each side of the equation by the coefficient of the missing angle’s cosine.

For example, to isolate the cosine of the missing angle, subtract 164 from both sides of the equation, then divide each side by -160:144−164=164−164−160cosC{\displaystyle 144-164=164-164-160\cos {C}}−20=−160cosC{\displaystyle -20=-160\cos {C}}−20−160=−160cosC−160{\displaystyle {\frac {-20}{-160}}={\frac {-160\cos {C}}{-160}}}0.125=cosC{\displaystyle 0.125=\cos {C}}


, This will give you the measurement of the missing angle.On a calculator, the inverse cosine key is denoted by COS−1{\displaystyle COS^{-1}}.

For example, the inverse cosine of .0125 is 82.8192. So, the missing angle, angle S, is 82.8192 degrees.

Find the missing side length of a triangle.,
Find angle H in the triangle GHI.,
Find the missing trail length.",How to Use the Cosine Rule3," The two known side lengths are 20 and 17 cm long. The angle between these two sides is 68 degrees.

Since you know two side lengths, and the angle between them, you can use the cosine rule. Set up the formula: c2=a2+b2−2abcosC{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos {C}}.

The missing side length is c{\displaystyle c}. Plug the other values into the formula:c2=202+172−2(20)(17)cos68{\displaystyle c^{2}=20^{2}+17^{2}-2(20)(17)\cos {68}}.

Use the order of operations to find c2{\displaystyle c^{2}}:c2=202+172−2(20)(17)cos68{\displaystyle c^{2}=20^{2}+17^{2}-2(20)(17)\cos {68}}c2=202+172−2(20)(17)(.3746){\displaystyle c^{2}=20^{2}+17^{2}-2(20)(17)(.3746)}c2=202+172−254.7325{\displaystyle c^{2}=20^{2}+17^{2}-254.7325}c2=400+289−254.7325{\displaystyle c^{2}=400+289-254.7325}c2=689−254.7325{\displaystyle c^{2}=689-254.7325}c2=434.2675{\displaystyle c^{2}=434.2675}

Take the square root of both sides of the equation. This will give you the missing side length:c2=434.2675{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c^{2}}}={\sqrt {434.2675}}}c=20.8391{\displaystyle c=20.8391}So, the missing side length is 20.8391 cm long.


, The two sides adjacent to angle H are 22 and 16 cm long. The side opposite angle H is 13 centimeter (5.1 in) long.

Since you know all three side lengths, you can use the cosine rule. Set up the formula: c2=a2+b2−2abcosC{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos {C}}.

The side opposite the missing angle is c{\displaystyle c}. Plug all of the values into the formula: 132=222+162−2(22)(16)cosC{\displaystyle 13^{2}=22^{2}+16^{2}-2(22)(16)\cos {C}}.

Use the order of operations to simplify the expression:132=222+162−704cosC{\displaystyle 13^{2}=22^{2}+16^{2}-704\cos {C}}132=484+256−704cosC{\displaystyle 13^{2}=484+256-704\cos {C}}169=484+256−704cosC{\displaystyle 169=484+256-704\cos {C}}169=740−704cosC{\displaystyle 169=740-704\cos {C}}

Isolate the cosine:169−740=740−740−704cosC{\displaystyle 169-740=740-740-704\cos {C}}−571=−704cosC{\displaystyle -571=-704\cos {C}}−571−704=−704cosC−704{\displaystyle {\frac {-571}{-704}}={\frac {-704\cos {C}}{-704}}}0.8111=cosC{\displaystyle 0.8111=\cos {C}}

Find the inverse cosine. This will give you the missing angle:0.8111=cosC{\displaystyle 0.8111=\cos {C}}35.7985=COS−1{\displaystyle 35.7985=COS^{-1}}.So, angle H is about 35.7985 degrees.


, Dune, Ridge, and Bog Trail form a triangle. Dune Trail is 3 miles long. Ridge Trail is 5 miles long. Dune Trail and Ridge Trail meet on their north ends at a 135 degree angle. Bog Trail connects the other two ends of the trails. How long is Bog Trail?

The trails form a triangle, and you are asked to find a missing trail length, which is like the side of a triangle. Since you know the length of the other two trails, and you know they meet at 135 degree angle, you can use the cosine rule.

Set up the formula: c2=a2+b2−2abcosC{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos {C}}.

The missing side length (Bog Trail) is c{\displaystyle c}. Plug the other values into the formula:c2=32+52−2(3)(5)cos135{\displaystyle c^{2}=3^{2}+5^{2}-2(3)(5)\cos {135}}.

Use the order of operations to find c2{\displaystyle c^{2}}:c2=32+52−2(3)(5)cos135{\displaystyle c^{2}=3^{2}+5^{2}-2(3)(5)\cos {135}}c2=32+52−2(3)(5)(−0.7071){\displaystyle c^{2}=3^{2}+5^{2}-2(3)(5)(-0.7071)}c2=32+52−(−21.2132){\displaystyle c^{2}=3^{2}+5^{2}-(-21.2132)}c2=9+25+21.2132{\displaystyle c^{2}=9+25+21.2132}c2=55.2132{\displaystyle c^{2}=55.2132}

Take the square root of both sides of the equation. This will give you the missing side length:c2=55.2132{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c^{2}}}={\sqrt {55.2132}}}c=7.4306{\displaystyle c=7.4306}So, Bog Trail is about 7.4306 miles long.

Review your results.",How to Use Right Angled Trigonometry2," Trigonometry can also be used to calculate angle measurements. The procedure is similar, but the problem will ask for the measurement of an unknown angle.

Consider the following problem:

At a certain time of day, a 200 foot high flag pole casts a shadow that is 80 feet long. What is the angle of the sun at this time of day?




, Remember that trigonometry problems are based on the geometry of right triangles. Sketch a right triangle to represent the problem, and label the known and unknown values.

For the flag pole problem, the vertical leg is the flag pole itself. Label its height 200 feet. The horizontal base of the triangle represents the length of the shadow. Label the base 80 feet. The hypotenuse, in this case, does not represent any physical measurement but is the length from the top of the flag pole to the end of the shadow. This will provide the angle that you want to solve. Mark this angle, between the hypotenuse and the base, angle θ{\displaystyle \theta }.


, You need to review which parts of the triangle you know and which you need to solve. This will help you choose the correct trigonometry function to help find the unknown value.

For the flag pole, you know the vertical height and the horizontal base, but you do not know the hypotenuse. The function that uses the ratio of the two legs is the tangent.

Set up a tangent equation as follows:


tan⁡θ=oppositeadjacent{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}}}


tan⁡θ=20080{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {200}{80}}}


tan⁡θ=2.5{\displaystyle \tan \theta =2.5}




, When you need to find the measure of the angle itself, you will need to use what is called the inverse trigonometry function. The inverse functions are referred to as “arc” functions. These are arcsin, arccos, and arctan.

On a calculator, these functions appear as sin−1{\displaystyle sin^{-1}}, cos−1{\displaystyle cos^{-1}} and tan−1{\displaystyle tan^{-1}}. You will enter the value and then press the appropriate button, and you will get the measure of the angle. Some calculators differ. On some, you will enter the value first, and then the arctan button. On some, you enter the arctan and then the value. You will need to determine which process works for your calculator.


tan⁡θ=2.5{\displaystyle \tan \theta =2.5}


θ=arctan⁡2.5{\displaystyle \theta =\arctan 2.5}


θ=68.2{\displaystyle \theta =68.2}




, Because you were solving for an angle measurement, the unit of your result will be in degrees. Check to see that your answer makes sense.

Based on this solution, the angle between the earth and the sun is 68.2 degrees. At noon, the sun is directly overhead, which would be an angle of 90 degrees, so this solution seems reasonable.


, Anytime the angle measure is the unknown factor, you will use an inverse trigonometry function. The procedure is always generally the same.

Read the problem. A right triangle with legs that are 3 inches and 4 inches long has a hypotenuse that is 5 inches long. What is the measure of the angle opposite the 3 inch leg?

Sketch the problem. In this case, the problem is simply about the measurements of a triangle. Sketch a right triangle and label the information that you know. One leg is 3, the other leg is 4, and the hypotenuse is 5. The unknown angle, for this problem, is the acute angle opposite the 3 inch leg.

Set up a trigonometry equation. In this case, because you know all three sides of the triangle, you actually have a choice of functions. You have the data you need to use any one of the functions sin, cos or tan, as follows:


sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


cos⁡θ=adjacenthypotenuse{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


tan⁡θ=oppositeadjacent{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}}}




, In this case, continue solving using all three functions to see, eventually, that the three different functions all reach the same conclusion for the value of the angle θ{\displaystyle \theta }.

First set up a solution with the sin{\displaystyle \sin } function:


sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


sin⁡θ=35{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {3}{5}}}


sin⁡θ=0.6{\displaystyle \sin \theta =0.6}



Next, set up a solution with the cos{\displaystyle \cos } function:


cos⁡θ=adjacenthypotenuse{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


cos⁡θ=45{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {4}{5}}}


cos⁡θ=0.8{\displaystyle \cos \theta =0.8}



Finally, set up a solution with the tan{\displaystyle \tan } function:


tan⁡θ=oppositeadjacent{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}}}


tan⁡θ=34{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {3}{4}}}


tan⁡θ=0.75{\displaystyle \tan \theta =0.75}




,

Find the measure using arcsin{\displaystyle \arcsin }:


sin⁡θ=0.6{\displaystyle \sin \theta =0.6}


θ=arcsin⁡0.6{\displaystyle \theta =\arcsin 0.6}


θ=36.9{\displaystyle \theta =36.9}



Find the measure using arccos{\displaystyle \arccos }:


cos⁡θ=0.8{\displaystyle \cos \theta =0.8}


θ=arccos⁡0.8{\displaystyle \theta =\arccos 0.8}


θ=36.9{\displaystyle \theta =36.9}



Find the measure using arctan{\displaystyle \arctan }:


tan⁡θ=0.75{\displaystyle \tan \theta =0.75}


θ=arctan⁡0.75{\displaystyle \theta =\arctan 0.75}


θ=36.9{\displaystyle \theta =36.9}




, In this problem, because you began with an angle and the measurements of all three sides, you were able to solve the problem in three different ways. Any one of them alone would have been sufficient to find the answer. By solving all three, you see that the solution is the same either way. In this case, the chosen angle is 36.9 degrees.

Learn the mnemonic device SOHCAHTOA.",How to Use Right Angled Trigonometry3," Trigonometry is based on the mathematical concept of the unit circle. This is a circle drawn on the x-y coordinate plane, with its center at (0,0), with a radius of 1. By setting the radius equal to 1, the trigonometric functions can be measured directly.If you envision a unit circle, any point on that circle establishes a right triangle. From a selected point on the circle, draw a vertical line directly to the x-axis. Then from that point on the x-axis, draw a horizontal line connecting to the origin. These two lines, the vertical and the horizontal, serve as the legs of a right triangle. The radius of the circle that connects the point on the circle to the center at the origin is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

Trigonometric functions still apply to triangles and lengths other than 1, but setting the radius equal to 1 makes calculating the ratios more direct.


, The sine function is the ratio of the leg opposite a chosen angle to the hypotenuse of the right triangle. On the unit circle, the sine is a way of measuring the vertical distance from the x-axis to the designated point. This is another way of saying that it is the y-coordinate of the chosen point.The sine of an angle is commonly abbreviated as “sin.” The angle of measurement is often labeled θ{\displaystyle \theta }, by convention, so you say you are measuring sin⁡θ{\displaystyle \sin \theta } or sin(θ){\displaystyle sin(\theta )}.

For example, if you select an angle, called θ{\displaystyle \theta }, of 30 degrees at the center of the unit circle, this would mark a point on the circle with coordinates (32,12){\displaystyle ({\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}})}. You can then say that sin⁡θ=12{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {1}{2}}}., The cosine function is the ratio of the leg adjacent to the chosen angle divided by the hypotenuse of the right triangle. On the unit circle, the cosine is the length of the horizontal leg, which is also the x-axis coordinate of the point on the circle.The cosine of an angle is commonly abbreviated as “cos.” You say you are measuring cos⁡θ{\displaystyle \cos \theta } or cos⁡(θ){\displaystyle \cos(\theta )}.

For example, if you select an angle θ{\displaystyle \theta } of 30 degrees at the center of the unit circle, this would mark a point on the circle with coordinates (32,12){\displaystyle ({\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}})}. You can then say that cos⁡θ=32{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}., The third common trigonometric function is the tangent. The tangent is the ratio of the two legs of the right triangle to each other, without reference to they hypotenuse. Specifically, for a chosen angle of a right triangle, the tangent is found by dividing the length of the leg opposite to the chosen angle over the leg adjacent to the chosen angle. On the unit circle, the tangent is equal to the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate.The tangent function is often abbreviated as “tan.” For a selected angle θ{\displaystyle \theta }, you say you are measuring tan⁡θ{\displaystyle \tan \theta } or tan⁡(θ){\displaystyle \tan(\theta )}.

For the example of an angle θ{\displaystyle \theta } of 30 degrees at the center of the unit circle, recall that the coordinates are (32,12){\displaystyle ({\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}})}. You can find the tangent by dividing the sine (y-coordinate) by the cosine (x-coordinate) as follows:


tan⁡θ=1232=33=0.577{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}={\frac {\sqrt {3}}{3}}=0.577}.Note that reporting the result in terms of a fraction with the square root, such as 33{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{3}}} is generally considered more precise and more accurate than rounding to a decimal like 0.577. For practically purposes, a three-place decimal may be acceptable.




, Occasionally, you may need alternate ratios than the cosine, sine and tangent. These alternative functions are inverses of the first three. They are less commonly used in basic calculations. However, in more advanced trigonometric work, they become essential. These functions are:Secant. This is abbreviated as “sec” and is equal to 1cos{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{cos}}}.

Cosecant. The cosecant is abbreviated as “csc” and is equal to 1sin{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{sin}}}.

Cotangent. The cotangent is abbreviated as “cot” and is equal to 1tan{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{tan}}}.


, When trying to remember the ratios of the primary functions sin, cos and tan, many students use the memory tool “SOHCAHTOA.” When broken into its parts, it provides the ratios as follows:

SOH stands for the initials of sin, opposite, hypotenuse, and calls to mind the ratio:


sin=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}



CAH stands for the initials of cos, adjacent, hypotenuse, as follows:


cos=adjacenthypotenuse{\displaystyle \cos ={\frac {\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}



TOA stands for the initials of tan, opposite, adjacent, and represents the ratio:


tan=oppositeadjacent{\displaystyle \tan ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}}}

Find the value of the new equation with a given ""x"" value.",How to Differentiate Polynomials," A variable term is any term that includes a variable and a constant term is any term that has only a number without a variable. Find the variable and constant terms in this polynomial function: y = 5x3 + 9x2 + 7x + 3









The variable terms are 5x3, 9x2, and 7x
The constant term is 3;
, Their products will form the new coefficients of the differentiated equation. Once you find their products, place the results in front of their respective variables. Here's how you do it:









5x3 = 5 x 3 = 15
9x2 = 9 x 2 = 18
7x = 7 x 1 = 7

, To do this, simply subtract 1 from each exponent in each variable term. Here's how you do it:









5x3 = 5x2

9x2 = 9x1

7x = 7

, To finish differentiating the polynomial equation, simply replace the old coefficients with their new coefficients and replace the old exponents with their values lowered by one degree. The derivative of constants is zero so you can omit 3, the constant term, from the final result.









5x3 becomes 15x2

9x2 becomes 18x
7x becomes 7
The derivative of the polynomial y = 5x3 + 9x2 + 7x + 3 is y = 15x2 + 18x + 7

, To find the value of ""y"" with a given ""x,"" simply replace all of the ""x""s in the equation with the given value of ""x"" and solve. For example, if you want to find the value of the equation at x = 2, simply plug the number 2 in place of every x in the equation. Here's how to do it:









2 --> y = 15x2 + 18x+ 7 = 15 x 22 + 18 x 2 + 7 =
y = 60 + 36 + 7 = 103
The value of the equation at x = 2 is 103.

No amount of integration by parts, u-substitution, or any other technique learned in introductory calculus class will solve this integral, because this integrand does not have an antiderivative that can be written in terms of elementary functions.


∫0∞ln⁡te−stdt{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\ln te^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t}
;
, By the properties of the log, the integral is split into two. The latter is easy to evaluate using the fundamental theorem because s{\displaystyle s} is independent of u.{\displaystyle u.}


1s∫0∞ln(us)e−udu=1s∫0∞ln⁡ue−udu−ln⁡ss{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{s}}\int _{0}^{\infty }\ln \left({\frac {u}{s}}\right)e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {1}{s}}\int _{0}^{\infty }\ln ue^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u-{\frac {\ln s}{s}}}


, There are two important formulas to consider here.

The first is given below. It is a formula that expresses the logarithm of the Gamma function as an infinite series. This formula is derived from the infinite product definition (see the tips), where ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } is a small number, γ≈0.577...{\displaystyle \gamma \approx 0.577...} is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and ζ(j){\displaystyle \zeta (j)} is the Riemann zeta function. (Don't worry about the summation part - it turns out that it won't be important for what we're about to do.)


ln⁡Γ(1+ϵ)=−γϵ+∑j=2∞(−1)jζ(j)jϵj{\displaystyle \ln \Gamma (1+\epsilon )=-\gamma \epsilon +\sum _{j=2}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{j}\zeta (j)}{j}}\epsilon ^{j}}



The second comes straight from the integral definition of the Gamma function, Legendre's expression. We rewrite the integral so as to write the exponent with e{\displaystyle e} in the base, and rewrite that in terms of its Taylor series.


Γ(1+ϵ)=∫0∞xϵe−xdx=∑n=0∞ϵnn!∫0∞lnn⁡xe−xdx{\displaystyle \Gamma (1+\epsilon )=\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{\epsilon }e^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{n}}{n!}}\int _{0}^{\infty }\ln ^{n}xe^{-x}{\mathrm {d} }x}



Again, if you are not familiar with integrals involving the Gamma function, it is highly recommended that you go through them.


, Specifically, ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } to the first power. The reason why is because the integral we want to compute is in the coefficient of the Taylor series of the Gamma function. The specific integral we want sets n=1,{\displaystyle n=1,} so to evaluate the integral, we need to equate the two expressions. We first look at the first formula and take the exponent of both sides.


Γ(1+ϵ)=exp(−γϵ+∑j=2∞(−1)jζ(j)jϵj){\displaystyle \Gamma (1+\epsilon )=\exp \left(-\gamma \epsilon +\sum _{j=2}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{j}\zeta (j)}{j}}\epsilon ^{j}\right)} 

Since ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } is a small number, we can safely neglect any higher-order terms, because they will fall off faster. This is why we don't need to worry about the summation part, which begins at the second-order.


Γ(1+ϵ)≈e−γϵ≈1−γϵ{\displaystyle \Gamma (1+\epsilon )\approx e^{-\gamma \epsilon }\approx 1-\gamma \epsilon }




, Combining our previous results, we have arrived at the Laplace transform of the natural logarithm.


∫0∞ln⁡ue−udu=−γ{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\ln ue^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u=-\gamma }


L{ln⁡t}=−γ+ln⁡ss{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{\ln t\}=-{\frac {\gamma +\ln s}{s}}}

Obviously, the method outlined in this article can be used to solve a great many integrals of these kinds. Specifically, the kinds outlined below, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are whole numbers and a,b,{\displaystyle a,\,b,} and c{\displaystyle c} are constants such that the integral converges.


∫0∞xalnb⁡xe−cxdx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{a}\ln ^{b}xe^{-cx}{\mathrm {d} }x}



Even though the final result is a bit unusual, owing to the presence of the Euler-Mascheroni constant, the properties of the Laplace transform, such as the shift and derivative properties, still work. For example, we can immediately derive results like the one below once we know the original result.


L{e2tln⁡t}=−γ+ln⁡(s−2)s−2{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{e^{2t}\ln t\}=-{\frac {\gamma +\ln(s-2)}{s-2}}}




, The second power on the log means that we have to find the coefficient of ϵ2{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{2}} in our expansion. Conceptually, this is very easy - we simply keep terms up to second order. The algebra, however, is a bit more involved. Furthermore, the properties of the log only are convenient for us when the power on the log is 1. We will thus have to approach this integral more directly.

∫0∞ln2⁡te−stdt{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\ln ^{2}te^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t}

, We keep the exponent in the exponential function and then perform a u-sub u=st{\displaystyle u=st} when we don't have the log inside the integral.


∫0∞tϵe−stdt=∑n=0∞ϵnn!∫0∞lnn⁡te−stdt{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }t^{\epsilon }e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\epsilon ^{n}}{n!}}\int _{0}^{\infty }\ln ^{n}te^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t}

, We rewrite 1s1+ϵ{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{s^{1+\epsilon }}}} with e{\displaystyle e} in the base. 

Γ(1+ϵ)s1+ϵ≈1seϵln⁡s(e−γϵ+ζ(2)2ϵ2)≈1s(1−ϵln⁡s+ln2⁡s2ϵ2)(1−γϵ+ζ(2)2ϵ2+γ22ϵ2)≈1s(⋯+(ζ(2)2+γ22+γln⁡s+ln2⁡s2)ϵ2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\Gamma (1+\epsilon )}{s^{1+\epsilon }}}&\approx {\frac {1}{se^{\epsilon \ln s}}}\left(e^{-\gamma \epsilon +{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}}\right)\\&\approx {\frac {1}{s}}\left(1-\epsilon \ln s+{\frac {\ln ^{2}s}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}\right)\left(1-\gamma \epsilon +{\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}+{\frac {\gamma ^{2}}{2}}\epsilon ^{2}\right)\\&\approx {\frac {1}{s}}\left(\cdots +\left({\frac {\zeta (2)}{2}}+{\frac {\gamma ^{2}}{2}}+\gamma \ln s+{\frac {\ln ^{2}s}{2}}\right)\epsilon ^{2}\right)\end{aligned}}}

, The second-order coefficient has a 2!{\displaystyle 2!} term in it next to the integral, so we multiply the coefficient we just found by 2 to evaluate. In principle, it is possible to find the Laplace transforms of any integer power of the natural log. We would just have to keep more terms. 


L{ln2⁡t}=ζ(2)+γ2+2γln⁡s+ln2⁡ss{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{\ln ^{2}t\}={\frac {\zeta (2)+\gamma ^{2}+2\gamma \ln s+\ln ^{2}s}{s}}}

As usual with this technique, the integrals with decreasing powers of the log come out naturally as a result of our work.


∫0∞ln⁡te−stdt=−γ+ln⁡ss{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\ln te^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t=-{\frac {\gamma +\ln s}{s}}}

∫0∞e−stdt=1s{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t={\frac {1}{s}}}



, The first one uses the same technique as the one that we have been using. The second one takes advantage of the properties of the Laplace transform.

, This integral resists the techniques of elementary calculus, but we can make use of residue theory instead. The absolute value stems from the fact that we close the contour in the lower half plane when ω>0{\displaystyle \omega >0} and in the upper half plane when ω<0.{\displaystyle \omega <0.}

, The symmetry of the Fourier transform gives the analogous property in frequency space. We will first work with n=1{\displaystyle n=1} and then generalize.


F{tf(t)}=∫−∞∞tf(t)e−iωtdt=∫−∞∞i∂∂ω(e−iωt)f(t)dt=iddωf^(ω){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {F}}\{tf(t)\}&=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }tf(t)e^{-i\omega t}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }i{\frac {\partial }{\partial \omega }}(e^{-i\omega t})f(t){\mathrm {d} }t\\&=i{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\omega }}{\hat {f}}(\omega )\end{aligned}}}

In general, we can multiply by tn.{\displaystyle t^{n}.}


F{tnf(t)}=indndωnf^(ω){\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\{t^{n}f(t)\}=i^{n}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{n}}{{\mathrm {d} }\omega ^{n}}}{\hat {f}}(\omega )}



We immediately obtain the below result. This is a symmetry that is not fully realized with the Laplace transforms between the variables t{\displaystyle t} and s.{\displaystyle s.}


iddω→t{\displaystyle i{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\omega }}\to t}




, Multiplication by eiat{\displaystyle e^{iat}} in the time domain corresponds to a shift in the frequency domain.


F{eiatf(t)}=∫−∞∞f(t)e−i(ω−a)tdt=f^(ω−a){\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\{e^{iat}f(t)\}=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(t)e^{-i(\omega -a)t}{\mathrm {d} }t={\hat {f}}(\omega -a)}


, A shift in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by e−iωc{\displaystyle e^{-i\omega c}} in the frequency domain, which again illustrates the symmetry between t{\displaystyle t} and ω.{\displaystyle \omega .} We can easily evaluate this using a simple substitution.


F{f(t−c)}=∫−∞∞f(t−c)e−iωtdt=∫−∞∞f(t)e−iω(t+c)dt=e−iωcf^(ω){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {F}}\{f(t-c)\}&=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(t-c)e^{-i\omega t}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(t)e^{-i\omega (t+c)}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=e^{-i\omega c}{\hat {f}}(\omega )\end{aligned}}}


, The stretch property seen in the Laplace transform also has an analogue in the Fourier transform.


F{f(ct)}=∫−∞∞f(ct)e−iωtdt,  u=ct=1c∫−∞∞f(u)e−iωu/cdu=1cf^(ωc){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {F}}\{f(ct)\}&=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(ct)e^{-i\omega t}{\mathrm {d} }t,\ \ u=ct\\&={\frac {1}{c}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(u)e^{-i\omega u/c}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&={\frac {1}{c}}{\hat {f}}\left({\frac {\omega }{c}}\right)\end{aligned}}}


, If you have had some exposure to Laplace transforms before, you know that the exponential function is the ""simplest"" function that has a Laplace transform. In the case of the Fourier transform, this function is not well-behaved because the modulus of this function does not tend to 0 as t→∞.{\displaystyle t\to \infty .} Nevertheless, its Fourier transform is given as the delta function.


F{eiat}=2πδ(ω−a){\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\{e^{iat}\}=2\pi \delta (\omega -a)}

 The imaginary exponential oscillates around the unit circle, except when t=0,{\displaystyle t=0,} where the exponential equals 1. You can think of the contributions by the oscillations as canceling themselves out for all t≠0.{\displaystyle t\neq 0.} At t=0,{\displaystyle t=0,} the integral of the function then diverges. The delta function is then used to model this behavior.

This result gives us the Fourier transform of three other functions for ""free."" The Fourier transform of the constant function is obtained when we set a=0.{\displaystyle a=0.}


F{1}=2πδ(ω){\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\{1\}=2\pi \delta (\omega )}



Using Euler's formula, we get the Fourier transforms of the cosine and sine functions.


F{cos⁡at}=π(δ(ω−a)+δ(ω+a)){\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\{\cos at\}=\pi (\delta (\omega -a)+\delta (\omega +a))}


F{sin⁡at}=−iπ(δ(ω−a)−δ(ω+a)){\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\{\sin at\}=-i\pi (\delta (\omega -a)-\delta (\omega +a))}




, We can use the shift property to compute Fourier transforms of powers.


F{tneiat}=2πindndωnδ(ω−a){\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\{t^{n}e^{iat}\}=2\pi i^{n}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{n}}{{\mathrm {d} }\omega ^{n}}}\delta (\omega -a)}

However, it is important to recognize that the extra symbols may not always be written out. In those cases, you must understand what is being integrated over. 

In this article, we write the extra integration symbols in order to emphasize that these are double and triple integrals that are being evaluated.


∬f(x,y)dA{\displaystyle \iint f(x,y){\mathrm {d} }A}


∭f(x,y,z)dV{\displaystyle \iiint f(x,y,z){\mathrm {d} }V}



The way in which the integrals are written can be slightly different. The first is the mathematician's notation, which writes the differential elements at the end. The innermost integral is the one that is integrated over first. The second is the physicist's notation, which separates the integrals and makes it look more like an operator is acting on a function. Integrals are evaluated from right to left. In this article, for ease of calculation and to avoid confusion with which integrals are being evaluated, we will choose the latter.


∫02∫−11(4x3+x2y+5)dydx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2}\int _{-1}^{1}(4x^{3}+x^{2}y+5){\mathrm {d} }y{\mathrm {d} }x}


∫02dx∫−11dy(4x3+x2y+5){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x\int _{-1}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }y(4x^{3}+x^{2}y+5)}


;
, In two dimensions, the double integral is defined as the limit of sums that send the number of rectangles to infinity, provided both limits exist. This definition should be familiar from the single-variable integral.


∬Df(x,y)dA=limm→∞limn→∞∑j=1m∑k=1nf(xj,yk)ΔxΔy{\displaystyle \iint _{D}f(x,y){\mathrm {d} }A=\lim _{m\to \infty }\lim _{n\to \infty }\sum _{j=1}^{m}\sum _{k=1}^{n}f(x_{j},y_{k})\Delta x\Delta y}

Here, D{\displaystyle D} is a domain of integration. In two dimensions, D{\displaystyle D} is a subset of the two-dimensional plane. 


, At first sight, this is a formidable integral. As we will see, recognizing symmetry is crucial to simplifying the algebra involved.


∬D(6+2xy2+3x2y+2y3sin⁡(πxy2)−3xy)dA{\displaystyle \iint _{D}(6+2xy^{2}+3x^{2}y+2y^{3}\sin(\pi xy^{2})-3xy){\mathrm {d} }A}


, Before we write the problem in terms of definite integrals, we need to see if we can simplify the problem. The domain of integration is shaped like a bowl. This domain is symmetric about the y-axis, meaning that any term that is odd in x{\displaystyle x} will vanish. Because the domain is not symmetric in y,{\displaystyle y,} we do not eliminate terms that are only odd in y.{\displaystyle y.} This means that 2xy2,{\displaystyle 2xy^{2},} 2y3sin⁡(πxy2),{\displaystyle 2y^{3}\sin(\pi xy^{2}),} and −3xy{\displaystyle -3xy} all vanish. 


∬D(6+2xy2+3x2y+2y3sin⁡(πxy2)−3xy)dA=∬D(6+3x2y)dA{\displaystyle \iint _{D}(6+2xy^{2}+3x^{2}y+2y^{3}\sin(\pi xy^{2})-3xy){\mathrm {d} }A=\iint _{D}(6+3x^{2}y){\mathrm {d} }A}

Similar to taking partial derivatives, we treat the other variables in a term as constants when we are doing this.


, We first integrate over x.{\displaystyle x.} This is simple - the domain goes from x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2} to x=2.{\displaystyle x=2.} Then we integrate over y.{\displaystyle y.} The lower boundary is the curve y=x2{\displaystyle y=x^{2}} and the upper boundary is the line y=4.{\displaystyle y=4.} Notice that the y{\displaystyle y} integral has an x{\displaystyle x} dependence. This can be done because the y{\displaystyle y} integral is being evaluated first. It is not possible for the x{\displaystyle x} integral to have a y{\displaystyle y} dependence if the x{\displaystyle x} integral is being evaluated after the y{\displaystyle y} integral.


∬D(6+3x2y)dA=∫−22dx∫x24dy(6+3x2y){\displaystyle \iint _{D}(6+3x^{2}y){\mathrm {d} }A=\int _{-2}^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x\int _{x^{2}}^{4}{\mathrm {d} }y(6+3x^{2}y)}


, In this case, we look for even functions of x.{\displaystyle x.} The symmetry that applies here is that the integral of an even function is equal to twice the integral over half the domain. In other words, we pull a 2 out of the integral and change the lower boundary to 0. We see that 6+3x2y{\displaystyle 6+3x^{2}y} is indeed even.


∫−22dx∫x24dy(6+3x2y)=2∫02dx∫x24dy(6+3x2y){\displaystyle \int _{-2}^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x\int _{x^{2}}^{4}{\mathrm {d} }y(6+3x^{2}y)=2\int _{0}^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x\int _{x^{2}}^{4}{\mathrm {d} }y(6+3x^{2}y)}

It is important to note that this simplification cannot be done before exploiting the symmetry of odd functions. If we did, then the domain would no longer be symmetric, and the odd terms would not vanish.


, We do the y{\displaystyle y} integral first and then do the x{\displaystyle x} integral.


∬f(x,y)dA=2∫02dx∫x24dy(6+3x2y)=2∫02dx(6(4−x2)+32x2(42−x4))=2(48−2⋅23+24⋅233−32277)=2(96−1927)=9607{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\iint f(x,y){\mathrm {d} }A&=2\int _{0}^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x\int _{x^{2}}^{4}{\mathrm {d} }y(6+3x^{2}y)\\&=2\int _{0}^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x(6(4-x^{2})+{\frac {3}{2}}x^{2}(4^{2}-x^{4}))\\&=2\left(48-2\cdot 2^{3}+24\cdot {\frac {2^{3}}{3}}-{\frac {3}{2}}{\frac {2^{7}}{7}}\right)\\&=2\left(96-{\frac {192}{7}}\right)\\&={\frac {960}{7}}\end{aligned}}}


, Let D{\displaystyle D} be bounded by y=0{\displaystyle y=0} and y=1−x2.{\displaystyle y=1-x^{2}.} This integral uses the same technique as before - eliminate terms and simplify calculations by exploiting odd and even symmetry.


∬D(4−2x2y+xy2+3x3y+x2+4xy)dA=572105{\displaystyle \iint _{D}(4-2x^{2}y+xy^{2}+3x^{3}y+x^{2}+4xy){\mathrm {d} }A={\frac {572}{105}}}

We can also choose to send out y{\displaystyle y} first instead. The bounds would then be y=0{\displaystyle y=0} and y=1,{\displaystyle y=1,} and after solving y=1−x2{\displaystyle y=1-x^{2}} for x,{\displaystyle x,} the x{\displaystyle x} bounds would go from x=−1−y{\displaystyle x=-{\sqrt {1-y}}} to x=1−y.{\displaystyle x={\sqrt {1-y}}.} After simplifying, the integrand is still even in x.{\displaystyle x.}


∬Df(x,y)dA=∫01dy∫−1−y1−ydx(4−2x2y+x2)=2∫01dy∫01−ydx(4−2x2y+x2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\iint _{D}f(x,y){\mathrm {d} }A&=\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }y\int _{-{\sqrt {1-y}}}^{\sqrt {1-y}}{\mathrm {d} }x(4-2x^{2}y+x^{2})\\&=2\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }y\int _{0}^{\sqrt {1-y}}{\mathrm {d} }x(4-2x^{2}y+x^{2})\end{aligned}}}


, The average value as encountered in single-variable calculus extends naturally to multivariable calculus. 

There are two basic types of averages - unweighted and weighted. Weighted averages depend on a weight σ{\displaystyle \sigma } present in the integral. Below, we will work an example of an unweighted average problem - one where we can pull the σ{\displaystyle \sigma } out of the integrals. In general, σ{\displaystyle \sigma } may be defined as σ(x,y),{\displaystyle \sigma (x,y),} so that we cannot bring it out of the integrals.


⟨f(x,y)⟩=∬Df(x,y)dA∬DdA{\displaystyle \langle f(x,y)\rangle ={\frac {\iint _{D}f(x,y){\mathrm {d} }A}{\iint _{D}{\mathrm {d} }A}}}


⟨f(x,y)⟩σ=∬Df(x,y)σdA∬DσdA{\displaystyle \langle f(x,y)\rangle _{\sigma }={\frac {\iint _{D}f(x,y)\sigma {\mathrm {d} }A}{\iint _{D}\sigma {\mathrm {d} }A}}}




, D{\displaystyle D} is the region bounded by y=x2{\displaystyle y=x^{2}} and y=2−x2.{\displaystyle y=2-x^{2}.} The bounds will be from x=−1{\displaystyle x=-1} to x=1,{\displaystyle x=1,} and from y=x2{\displaystyle y=x^{2}} to y=2−x2.{\displaystyle y=2-x^{2}.}


⟨x2y⟩=∬Dx2ydA∬DdA{\displaystyle \langle x^{2}y\rangle ={\frac {\iint _{D}x^{2}y{\mathrm {d} }A}{\iint _{D}{\mathrm {d} }A}}}


, There exist no terms odd in x,{\displaystyle x,} but there do exist terms even in x.{\displaystyle x.}


∬Dx2ydA=∫−11dx∫x22−x2dyx2y=2∫01dx12x2((2−x2)2−x4)=∫01dx(x2(4−4x2))=4(13−15)=815{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\iint _{D}x^{2}y{\mathrm {d} }A&=\int _{-1}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }x\int _{x^{2}}^{2-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }yx^{2}y\\&=2\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }x{\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}((2-x^{2})^{2}-x^{4})\\&=\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }x(x^{2}(4-4x^{2}))\\&=4\left({\frac {1}{3}}-{\frac {1}{5}}\right)\\&={\frac {8}{15}}\end{aligned}}}


, The bottom integral is easier to evaluate because we are simply finding the area of the domain.


∬DdA=∫−11dx∫x22−x2dy=2∫01dx2(1−x2)=4(1−13)=83{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\iint _{D}{\mathrm {d} }A&=\int _{-1}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }x\int _{x^{2}}^{2-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }y=2\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }x\,2(1-x^{2})\\&=4\left(1-{\frac {1}{3}}\right)={\frac {8}{3}}\end{aligned}}}


, Simply substitute our results to obtain ⟨x2y⟩.{\displaystyle \langle x^{2}y\rangle .}


⟨x2y⟩=815⋅38=15{\displaystyle \langle x^{2}y\rangle ={\frac {8}{15}}\cdot {\frac {3}{8}}={\frac {1}{5}}}


, The centroid is the center of mass of a region. If you were to balance the region on the tip of a pin, then the only point that would balance is at the centroid. Once again, we give an example of a region with uniform density, so that σ{\displaystyle \sigma } can be pulled out of the integrals.


center of mass=(∬DxσdA∬DσdA,∬DyσdA∬DσdA){\displaystyle {\text{center of mass}}=\left({\frac {\iint _{D}x\sigma {\mathrm {d} }A}{\iint _{D}\sigma {\mathrm {d} }A}},{\frac {\iint _{D}y\sigma {\mathrm {d} }A}{\iint _{D}\sigma {\mathrm {d} }A}}\right)}


, It is helpful to draw a diagram. In our case, the boundaries go from x=0{\displaystyle x=0} to x=1.{\displaystyle x=1.} As you may have noticed, the regions are defined in a manner such that the boundaries can easily be figured out. In general, you will have to find the points of intersection by equating the two bounds and going from there. Finding the centroid involves taking three integrals.


∬DdA=∫01dx∫x2x3dy=∫01dx(x1/3−x2)=512{\displaystyle \iint _{D}{\mathrm {d} }A=\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }x\int _{x^{2}}^{\sqrt{x}}{\mathrm {d} }y=\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }x(x^{1/3}-x^{2})={\frac {5}{12}}}


∬DxdA=∫01dx∫x2x3dyx=∫01dxx(x1/3−x2)=528{\displaystyle \iint _{D}x{\mathrm {d} }A=\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }x\int _{x^{2}}^{\sqrt{x}}{\mathrm {d} }y\,x=\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }x\,x(x^{1/3}-x^{2})={\frac {5}{28}}}

We could proceed in the same manner to find ∬DydA,{\displaystyle \iint _{D}y{\mathrm {d} }A,} but it would be simpler to rewrite the integral so that we evaluate the x{\displaystyle x} integral first. Notice how the bounds change. This comes from solving the bounds for x.{\displaystyle x.}


∬DydA=∫01dy∫y3y1/2dxy=∫01dyy(y1/2−y3)=15{\displaystyle \iint _{D}y{\mathrm {d} }A=\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }y\int _{y^{3}}^{y^{1/2}}{\mathrm {d} }x\,y=\int _{0}^{1}{\mathrm {d} }y\,y(y^{1/2}-y^{3})={\frac {1}{5}}}

From these results, the centroid of this region follows.


center of mass=(37,1225){\displaystyle {\text{center of mass}}=\left({\frac {3}{7}},{\frac {12}{25}}\right)}

As seen by the diagram above, all we are doing is generalizing the area under a curve as learned in single-variable calculus, whose path is restricted to the x-axis only. This step is not necessary to solve problems dealing with line integrals, but only provides a background to how the formula arises.


limΔsi→0∑i=1nf(xi,yi)Δsi{\displaystyle \lim _{\Delta s_{i}\to 0}\sum _{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i},y_{i})\Delta s_{i}}

This form should seem familiar to you. We are adding up rectangles with height f(xi,yi){\displaystyle f(x_{i},y_{i})} and width Δsi.{\displaystyle \Delta s_{i}.} These rectangles are bounded by our curve, as recognized by the s{\displaystyle s} variable, signifying arc length. Then, we take the limit as Δsi→0{\displaystyle \Delta s_{i}\to 0} to recover the integral, where the Δs{\displaystyle \Delta s} is replaced by the differential ds.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }s.} Below, C{\displaystyle C} is the curve over which we are integrating.


∫Cf(x,y)ds{\displaystyle \int _{C}f(x,y){\mathrm {d} }s}


;
, While the integral above is true, it is not very useful, as the calculations can quickly become clunky. Inevitably, we need a coordinate system to work with - one that we can choose for our convenience.

Consider the integral ∫Cxy4ds,{\displaystyle \int _{C}xy^{4}{\mathrm {d} }s,} where C{\displaystyle C} is the right half of the circle x2+y2=16.{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=16.}

Reparameterize by converting to polar coordinates. You can verify this parameterization by plugging it back into the equation of a circle and using the trigonometric identity cos2⁡t+sin2⁡t=1.{\displaystyle \cos ^{2}t+\sin ^{2}t=1.}


x=4cos⁡t{\displaystyle x=4\cos t}


y=4sin⁡t{\displaystyle y=4\sin t}




, Since our integrand is in terms of t,{\displaystyle t,} so does our differential element.

Use the Pythagorean theorem to relate arc length s{\displaystyle s} to x{\displaystyle x} and y.{\displaystyle y.}


ds2=dx2+dy2ds=dx2+dy2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathrm {d} }s^{2}&={\mathrm {d} }x^{2}+{\mathrm {d} }y^{2}\\{\mathrm {d} }s&={\sqrt {{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}+{\mathrm {d} }y^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}



Compute differentials of x{\displaystyle x} and y.{\displaystyle y.}


dx=−4sin⁡tdt{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x=-4\sin t{\mathrm {d} }t}


dy=4cos⁡tdt{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }y=4\cos t{\mathrm {d} }t}



Substitute into arc length.


ds=(−4sin⁡tdt)2+(4cos⁡tdt)2=4dtsin2⁡t+cos2⁡t=4dt{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathrm {d} }s&={\sqrt {(-4\sin t{\mathrm {d} }t)^{2}+(4\cos t{\mathrm {d} }t)^{2}}}\\&=4{\mathrm {d} }t{\sqrt {\sin ^{2}t+\cos ^{2}t}}\\&=4{\mathrm {d} }t\end{aligned}}}




, Our parameterization converted us to polar coordinates, so our boundaries must be angles. We are dealing with a curve that describes the right half of a circle. Therefore, our bounds will be −π/2{\displaystyle -\pi /2} to π/2.{\displaystyle \pi /2.}


∫−π/2π/2(4cos⁡t)(4sin⁡t)44dt{\displaystyle \int _{-\pi /2}^{\pi /2}(4\cos t)(4\sin t)^{4}4{\mathrm {d} }t}


, In the penultimate step, we recognize that u4{\displaystyle u^{4}} is an even function, so a factor of 2 can be pulled out to simplify the boundaries.


∫Cxy4ds=46∫−π/2π/2cos⁡tsin4⁡tdt,u=sin⁡t=46∫−11u4du=(22)62∫01u4du=2135{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{C}xy^{4}{\mathrm {d} }s&=4^{6}\int _{-\pi /2}^{\pi /2}\cos t\sin ^{4}t{\mathrm {d} }t,u=\sin t\\&=4^{6}\int _{-1}^{1}u^{4}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&=(2^{2})^{6}2\int _{0}^{1}u^{4}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&={\frac {2^{13}}{5}}\end{aligned}}}


, Now that we are dealing with vector fields, we need to find a way to relate how differential elements of a curve in this field (the unit tangent vectors) interact with the field itself. As before, this step is only here to show you how the integral is derived.


limΔri→0∑i=1nF(ri)⋅Δri{\displaystyle \lim _{\Delta {\mathbf {r} }_{i}\to 0}\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\mathbf {F} }({\mathbf {r} }_{i})\cdot \Delta {\mathbf {r} }_{i}}


∫CF(r)⋅dr{\displaystyle \int _{C}{\mathbf {F} }({\mathbf {r} })\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }}

It turns out that the dot product is the correct choice here. The only contributions of the vector field to the curve being integrated over are the components parallel to the curve. The physical example of work may guide your intuition, as no work is done by a force perpendicular to the direction of motion, such as gravity acting on a car on a flat road with no inclination. This all stems from the fact that the vector field acts separately to each of the components of the curve. 


, As before, we must write our integral in a convenient coordinate system. 

Consider the integral ∫CF⋅dr,{\displaystyle \int _{C}{\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} },} where F=(x2y−y)i+xy2j{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=(x^{2}y-y){\mathbf {i} }+xy^{2}{\mathbf {j} }} and C{\displaystyle C} is the curve y=xn{\displaystyle y=x^{n}}from (0,0){\displaystyle (0,0)} to (1,1).{\displaystyle (1,1).} This curve is the power function of degree n,{\displaystyle n,} where n{\displaystyle n} is any real number, so the parameterization is especially simple. Verify this by substituting back into the equation of the curve.


x=t{\displaystyle x=t}


y=tn{\displaystyle y=t^{n}}




,

Relate r{\displaystyle {\mathbf {r} }} to x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} in terms of t.{\displaystyle t.}


r=ti+tnj{\displaystyle {\mathbf {r} }=t{\mathbf {i} }+t^{n}{\mathbf {j} }}



Compute the differential.


dr=dti+ntn−1dtj{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }={\mathrm {d} }t{\mathbf {i} }+nt^{n-1}{\mathrm {d} }t{\mathbf {j} }}




, Compute the dot product by substituting the expression for dr(t){\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }(t)}.


∫01⋅∫01(tn+2−tn+nt3n)dt{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\int _{0}^{1}\cdot \\&\int _{0}^{1}(t^{n+2}-t^{n}+nt^{3n}){\mathrm {d} }t\end{aligned}}}


,


∫CF⋅dr=1n+3−1n+1+n3n+1{\displaystyle \int _{C}{\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }={\frac {1}{n+3}}-{\frac {1}{n+1}}+{\frac {n}{3n+1}}}

This expression is valid for any power function, so by substituting a value for n,{\displaystyle n,} we can evaluate this integral along that particular curve. A limit occurs when we take n=∞{\displaystyle n=\infty } or n=0;{\displaystyle n=0;} the former describes the curve along the x-axis going up, while the latter describes the curve along the y-axis going across. A few examples are given below.


n=2:∫CF⋅dr=1(2)+3−1(2)+1+(2)3(2)+1=15−13+27{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}n=2:\int _{C}{\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }&={\frac {1}{(2)+3}}-{\frac {1}{(2)+1}}+{\frac {(2)}{3(2)+1}}\\&={\frac {1}{5}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {2}{7}}\end{aligned}}}

, The Fundamental Theorem is one of the most important theorems in calculus, in that it relates a function with its antiderivatives, thereby establishing integration and differentiation as inverse operators. As it pertains to line integrals, the gradient theorem, also known as the fundamental theorem for line integrals, is a powerful statement that relates a vector function F{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }} as the gradient of a scalar ∇f,{\displaystyle \nabla f,} where f{\displaystyle f} is called the potential. Below, a curve C{\displaystyle C} connects its two endpoints from a{\displaystyle a} to b{\displaystyle b} in an arbitrary fashion.


∫CF⋅dr=f(b)−f(a){\displaystyle \int _{C}{\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }=f(b)-f(a)}


F=∇f{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=\nabla f} defines the vector field to be conservative. Therefore, conservative fields have the property of path-independence - no matter what path you take between two endpoints, the integral will evaluate to be the same. The converse is true - path-independence implies a conservative field. 

A corollary of this important property is that a loop integral for conservative F{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }} evaluates to 0.


∮CF⋅dr=0{\displaystyle \oint _{C}{\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }=0}



Obviously, conservative fields are much easier to evaluate than non-conservative fields. Checking if a function is conservative or not will therefore be a useful technique for evaluating line integrals. The rest of this section will be working with conservative fields.


, In order to skip what would be a tedious integral to compute, we can simply find the potential and evaluate at the endpoints. 

Consider the function F=(2xy2−y2+2x)i+(2x2y−5−2xy)j,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=(2xy^{2}-y^{2}+2x){\mathbf {i} }+(2x^{2}y-5-2xy){\mathbf {j} },} where we want to evaluate at the endpoints (0,2){\displaystyle (0,2)} to (2,1).{\displaystyle (2,1).} Remember that conservative fields are path-independent, so we can use the gradient theorem. 


, Each component of the vector field is a partial derivative of the potential f.{\displaystyle f.} Therefore, in order to recover that potential, we need to integrate each component with respect to the same variable. The caveat here is that this process can only recover part of the original function, so this step must in general be done with each of the components.


∫∂f∂xdx=f+G(y)+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=f+G(y)+C}


∫∂f∂ydy=f+H(x)+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}{\mathrm {d} }y=f+H(x)+C}

The ""constants of integration"" G(y){\displaystyle G(y)} and H(x){\displaystyle H(x)} signify that some information is lost, just like how adding the constant C{\displaystyle C} in single-variable integration must be done because antiderivatives are not unique. Now, we just do the integrals.


∂f∂x=2xy2−y2+2x∫∂f∂xdx=x2y2−y2x−x2+G(y)+C{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}=2xy^{2}-y^{2}+2x\\\int &{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=x^{2}y^{2}-y^{2}x-x^{2}+G(y)+C\end{aligned}}}


∂f∂y=2x2y−5−2xy∫∂f∂ydy=x2y2−5y−xy2+H(x)+C{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}=2x^{2}y-5-2xy\\\int &{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}{\mathrm {d} }y=x^{2}y^{2}-5y-xy^{2}+H(x)+C\end{aligned}}}




, Notice that G(y)=5y,{\displaystyle G(y)=5y,} and H(x)=x2.{\displaystyle H(x)=x^{2}.} Doing the integrals revealed single-variable terms. These terms are covered by the constants of integration in the other evaluation. The actual constant C{\displaystyle C} is still there, but for our purposes, we can neglect it. We have therefore found the potential function up to a constant.


f(x,y)=x2y2−xy2+x2−5y{\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}y^{2}-xy^{2}+x^{2}-5y}


, This process of integrating skips the dot product and avoids the messy integration that would have resulted if we were to parameterize in terms of t.{\displaystyle t.}


∫CF⋅dr=f(2,1)−f(0,2)=11{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{C}{\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }&=f(2,1)-f(0,2)\\&=11\end{aligned}}}

Define the complex limit.,
Define the complex derivative.,

Substitute Δz=iΔy{\displaystyle \Delta z=i\Delta y} into the definition of the derivative and simplify.,
Equate the real and imaginary parts of the derivative.",How to Derive the Cauchy‐Riemann Equations," Because the complex derivative is defined to be a limit, we need to understand what a complex limit means. The definition is analogous to a real limit as defined in multivariable calculus, because we can approach a point from infinitely many curves in the complex plane.

Let f(z){\displaystyle f(z)} be a complex-valued function defined in some neighborhood of z0,{\displaystyle z_{0},} though z0{\displaystyle z_{0}} need not be defined itself. We say that the limit of f(z){\displaystyle f(z)} as z→z0{\displaystyle z\to z_{0}} is w0{\displaystyle w_{0}} if and only if for any positive number ϵ,{\displaystyle \epsilon ,} a positive number δ{\displaystyle \delta } can be found such that |f(z)−w0|<ϵ{\displaystyle |f(z)-w_{0}|<\epsilon } whenever 0<|z−z0|<δ.{\displaystyle 0<|z-z_{0}|<\delta .} If such a limit exists, we communicate this by the following statement.


limz→z0f(z)=w0{\displaystyle \lim _{z\to z_{0}}f(z)=w_{0}}



This is the (ϵ,δ){\displaystyle (\epsilon ,\delta )} definition of the limit that makes limits rigorous. While we could get away with an intuitive understanding in single-variable calculus, that was only possible because the limit could only be approached from two directions. 

Essentially, what the definition states is that no matter how close we get to w0,{\displaystyle w_{0},} we can find a neighborhood of z0{\displaystyle z_{0}} that maps entirely into a neighborhood of w0{\displaystyle w_{0}} by f(z).{\displaystyle f(z).} If the limit exists, then δ{\displaystyle \delta } can be found no matter how small we make ϵ.{\displaystyle \epsilon .}
;
, With the complex limit rigorously defined, we can now move onto the complex derivative. The complex derivative looks very similar to the real derivative, but further study into complex analysis reveals that the existence of a complex derivative is a much stronger statement about a function than is the case when we restrict ourselves to the reals. 

A function f(z){\displaystyle f(z)} is said to be differentiable at z=z0{\displaystyle z=z_{0}} if and only if the following limit exists.


limΔz→0f(z0+Δz)−f(z0)Δz{\displaystyle \lim _{\Delta z\to 0}{\frac {f(z_{0}+\Delta z)-f(z_{0})}{\Delta z}}}



If the function is differentiable at the point z=z0,{\displaystyle z=z_{0},} then the value of the aforementioned limit is called the derivative of f(z){\displaystyle f(z)} at z=z0{\displaystyle z=z_{0}} and is denoted by dfdz(z0){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }z}}(z_{0})} or f′(z0).{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(z_{0}).}

It seems as if we are simply replacing all the x's with z's, but the implications are far more profound than that.

, The existence of the complex derivative at some point z=z0{\displaystyle z=z_{0}} means that we should be able to approach the point from any direction we want to. When we set Δz=Δx,{\displaystyle \Delta z=\Delta x,} we are approaching the limit horizontally.,
dfdz(z0)=limΔz→0f(z0+Δz)−f(z0)Δz=limΔx→0u(x0+Δx,y0)+iv(x0+Δx,y0)−(u(x0,y0)+iv(x0,y0))Δx=limΔx→0u(x0+Δx,y0)−u(x0,y0)Δx+ilimΔx→0v(x0+Δx,y0)−v(x0,y0)Δx{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }z}}(z_{0})&=\lim _{\Delta z\to 0}{\frac {f(z_{0}+\Delta z)-f(z_{0})}{\Delta z}}\\&=\lim _{\Delta x\to 0}{\frac {u(x_{0}+\Delta x,y_{0})+iv(x_{0}+\Delta x,y_{0})-(u(x_{0},y_{0})+iv(x_{0},y_{0}))}{\Delta x}}\\&=\lim _{\Delta x\to 0}{\frac {u(x_{0}+\Delta x,y_{0})-u(x_{0},y_{0})}{\Delta x}}+i\lim _{\Delta x\to 0}{\frac {v(x_{0}+\Delta x,y_{0})-v(x_{0},y_{0})}{\Delta x}}\end{aligned}}}

We immediately see that the limits above are just the definitions of the partial derivatives of u{\displaystyle u} and v,{\displaystyle v,} so we can simplify in the following manner.

dfdz(z0)=∂u∂x(x0,y0)+i∂v∂x(x0,y0){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }z}}(z_{0})={\frac {\partial u}{\partial x}}(x_{0},y_{0})+i{\frac {\partial v}{\partial x}}(x_{0},y_{0})}



, Now we are approaching from the vertical direction., For consistency, the arguments of the functions are real, so we denote a change with Δy{\displaystyle \Delta y} instead.
dfdz(z0)=limΔz→0f(z0+Δz)−f(z0)Δz=limiΔy→0u(x0,y0+Δy)+iv(x0,y0+Δy)−(u(x0,y0)+iv(x0,y0))iΔy=limiΔy→0u(x0,y0+Δy)−u(x0,y0)iΔy+ilimiΔy→0v(x0,y0+Δy)−v(x0,y0)iΔy{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }z}}(z_{0})&=\lim _{\Delta z\to 0}{\frac {f(z_{0}+\Delta z)-f(z_{0})}{\Delta z}}\\&=\lim _{i\Delta y\to 0}{\frac {u(x_{0},y_{0}+\Delta y)+iv(x_{0},y_{0}+\Delta y)-(u(x_{0},y_{0})+iv(x_{0},y_{0}))}{i\Delta y}}\\&=\lim _{i\Delta y\to 0}{\frac {u(x_{0},y_{0}+\Delta y)-u(x_{0},y_{0})}{i\Delta y}}+i\lim _{i\Delta y\to 0}{\frac {v(x_{0},y_{0}+\Delta y)-v(x_{0},y_{0})}{i\Delta y}}\end{aligned}}}

As with step 4, we see that the limits above are just the definitions of the partial derivatives, so we can simplify in the following manner, taking care to recognize that 1i=−i.{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{i}}=-i.}

dfdz(z0)=−i∂u∂y(x0,y0)+∂v∂y(x0,y0){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }z}}(z_{0})=-i{\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0})+{\frac {\partial v}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0})}



, The result is the famed Cauchy-Riemann equations, which establish a necessary condition for complex differentiability. When coupled with the assumption that the partial derivatives of u{\displaystyle u} and v{\displaystyle v} are continuous, then the function is said to be holomorphic.

∂u∂x=∂v∂y,  ∂u∂y=−∂v∂x{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial x}}={\frac {\partial v}{\partial y}},\ \ {\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}=-{\frac {\partial v}{\partial x}}}

Calculate impedance.,
Therefore Impedance Total (represented as “Z”) is equal to Real Power squared plus Reactive power squared and then take the square root of the answer.,
Find your phase angle.,
Take the inverse of the tangent and acquire your Phase Angle.,
Calculate your total Current (Amps).,
You must now calculate your apparent power which is represented as “S”.,
You must now calculate your true power which is represented as “P”.,
Calculate your Power Factor!",How to Calculate Power Factor Correction," (Pretend as if impedance was in the same place as apparent power in the picture above). So to find impedance you need to use the Pythagorean Theorem c² = √ (a² + b²).;
,


( Z = √(60² + 60²) ). So if you enter that into your scientific calculator you will receive an answer of 84.85Ω. ( Z = 84.85Ω ).

, So you now have your hypotenuse which is your impedance. You also have your adjacent side which is your true power and you have your opposite side which is your reactive power. So to find the angle you can use any the laws stated earlier. For example we use the Tangent Law which is the opposite side divided by the adjacent side (Reactive/True).


You should have an equation that looks like this: (60/60 = 1)

, The inverse tangent is a button on your calculator. So you now take the inverse tangent of the equation in the previous step and this will give you your phase angle. Your equation should look something like this: tan ‾ ¹ (1) = Phase Angle. So your answer should be 45°.

, Your current is in the units of amps also represented as an “A”. The formula used for calculating current is Voltage divided by Impedance which numerically looks like this: 120V/84.85Ω. You should now have an answer around 1.141A. ( 120V/84.84Ω = 1.141A ).

, To calculate apparent power you do not need to use the Pythagorean Theorem because your hypotenuse was considered your impedance. Remembering that apparent power is in the units of Volt-Amps we can calculate apparent power using the formula: Voltage squared divided by your total impedance. Your equation should look like this: 120V²/84.85Ω. You should now get an answer of 169.71VA. ( 120²/84.85 = 169.71 )

, To calculate true power you must have found current which you did in step number four. True power which is in the units of a Watt is calculated by multiplying your current squared (1.141²) by the resistance (60Ω) in your circuit. You should get an answer of 78.11 watts. Your equation should look like this: 1.141² x 60 = 78.11

, To calculate your power factor you need the following information: Watts and Volt-Amps. You have calculated this information in the previous steps. Your wattage is equal to 78.11W and your Volt-Amps are equal to 169.71VA. The formula for your power factor, also represented as Pf, is Watts divided by Volt-Amps. You should have an equation that looks something like this: 78.11/169.71 = .460


This can also be expressed as a percentage therefore you multiply .460 by 100 giving you a power factor of 46%.

,
Calculate partial derivatives.,
The partial derivatives are the components of the gradient.",How to Calculate the Gradient," The gradient generalizes the derivative to functions of multiple variables. When you take a gradient, you must input a scalar function - calculating the gradient then outputs a vector function, where the vectors point in the direction of greatest increase. In the diagram above, the gradient is represented by the blue vector field.

The gradient is recognized by grad{\displaystyle \operatorname {grad} }, or the nabla symbol ∇{\displaystyle \nabla } called the del operator, which can be written out as ∇=(∂∂x,∂∂y,∂∂z).{\displaystyle \nabla =\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial x}},{\frac {\partial }{\partial y}},{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}\right).} Gradients are most commonly taken in three dimensions.

The gradient is not defined for a vector field. It only takes in scalar functions.
;
,

In Cartesian coordinates, the gradient of a function f(x,y,z){\displaystyle f(x,y,z)} is ∇f=∂f∂xi+∂f∂yj+∂f∂zk,{\displaystyle \nabla f={\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}{\mathbf {i} }+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}{\mathbf {j} }+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}{\mathbf {k} },} where i,j,k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {i} },{\mathbf {j} },{\mathbf {k} }} are unit vectors pointing in the x, y, and z axes, respectively.


,,


∂f∂x=5y2+6x2z2{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}=5y^{2}+6x^{2}z^{2}}


∂f∂y=10xy+6{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}=10xy+6}


∂f∂z=4x3z{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}=4x^{3}z}


, 

Therefore, ∇f=(5y2+6x2z2)i+(10xy+6)j+(4x3z)k{\displaystyle \nabla f=(5y^{2}+6x^{2}z^{2}){\mathbf {i} }+(10xy+6){\mathbf {j} }+(4x^{3}z){\mathbf {k} }}

Note that we have mapped from a scalar field to a vector field.

Begin with the vector triple product.,
Convert the triple product into index notation.,
Rewrite the Levi-Civita symbols in terms of Kronecker deltas.,
Substitute and contract the indices.,
Rewrite in terms of bolded vectors.",How to Derive the BAC‐CAB Identity Using Index Notation,"


a×(b×c){\displaystyle {\mathbf {a} }\times ({\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} })}  
;
, Recall that a cross product is represented in index notation using the Levi-Civita symbol. Because there are two cross products, there will be two Levi-Civita symbols, and since the indices i,j,k,l,m{\displaystyle i,j,k,l,m} only represent numbers, they will commute with the vector components.


(a×(b×c))i=ϵijkaj(b×c)k=ϵijkajϵklmblcm=ϵijkϵklmajblcm{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}({\mathbf {a} }\times ({\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} }))^{i}&=\epsilon _{ijk}a^{j}({\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} })^{k}\\&=\epsilon _{ijk}a^{j}\epsilon _{klm}b^{l}c^{m}\\&=\epsilon _{ijk}\epsilon _{klm}a^{j}b^{l}c^{m}\end{aligned}}}

In the second line, we recognize that k{\displaystyle k} is the “output” of b×c,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} },} so to write the second cross product, we introduce two new indices for the two vectors, not three.


, Because k{\displaystyle k} is summed over, we can contract the Levi-Civita symbols by making use of an argument. 

First, let’s make use of cyclic permutation to write the Levi-Civita symbols in a manner that will allow us to comprehend the argument more easily.


ϵijkϵlmk{\displaystyle \epsilon _{ijk}\epsilon _{lmk}}



Let’s assume that k=1.{\displaystyle k=1.} This means that for ϵ{\displaystyle \epsilon } to be non-zero, i,j,l,m{\displaystyle i,j,l,m} all have to be either 2 or 3, and of course, i≠j{\displaystyle i\neq j} and l≠m.{\displaystyle l\neq m.}

So in order for ϵijkϵlmk=1,{\displaystyle \epsilon _{ijk}\epsilon _{lmk}=1,} both symbols must output the same number. That is, they must both either be 1 or -1. The only way that this could happen is if i=l{\displaystyle i=l} and j=m.{\displaystyle j=m.} If k=1,{\displaystyle k=1,} that means that i,l{\displaystyle i,l} must both take on the same value, and j,m{\displaystyle j,m} must both take on the other value. For example, i=l=2,j=m=3.{\displaystyle i=l=2,\,j=m=3.} We can therefore make use of the Kronecker delta to write this mathematically.


δilδjm{\displaystyle \delta _{il}\delta _{jm}}



Of course, if the Levi-Civita symbols are different, then the opposite is true: i≠l,j≠m,{\displaystyle i\neq l,\,j\neq m,} and the output will be -1. Since these four indices can only be one of two numbers, it nicely turns out that i=m,j=l.{\displaystyle i=m,\,j=l.} We can again write this in terms of a Kronecker delta.


−δimδlj{\displaystyle -\delta _{im}\delta _{lj}}



Now we add these two deltas together, because we have laid out the two possible scenarios after going through the summations.


ϵijkϵlmk=δilδjm−δimδlj{\displaystyle \epsilon _{ijk}\epsilon _{lmk}=\delta _{il}\delta _{jm}-\delta _{im}\delta _{lj}}



The above identity is highly useful for simplifying expressions in index notation.


, Now that we have the vector triple product in terms of Kronecker deltas, contracting indices is much easier now. Here, we can contract l{\displaystyle l} and m.{\displaystyle m.} For example, δilbl=bi.{\displaystyle \delta _{il}b^{l}=b^{i}.}


(δilδjm−δimδlj)ajblcm=ajbicj−ajbjci=bi(ajcj)−ci(ajbj){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(\delta _{il}\delta _{jm}-\delta _{im}\delta _{lj})a^{j}b^{l}c^{m}&=a^{j}b^{i}c^{j}-a^{j}b^{j}c^{i}\\&=b^{i}(a^{j}c^{j})-c^{i}(a^{j}b^{j})\end{aligned}}}


, We can clearly see that j{\displaystyle j} is being summed over, just like a dot product.


bi(ajcj)−ci(ajbj)=bi(a⋅c)−ci(a⋅b){\displaystyle b^{i}(a^{j}c^{j})-c^{i}(a^{j}b^{j})=b^{i}({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {c} })-c^{i}({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {b} })}

Since this is exactly what we were looking for - the i{\displaystyle i}th component of the vector triple product - we have proven the BAC-CAB identity.


(a×(b×c))i=bi(a⋅c)−ci(a⋅b){\displaystyle ({\mathbf {a} }\times ({\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} }))^{i}=b^{i}({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {c} })-c^{i}({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {b} })}


a×(b×c)=b(a⋅c)−c(a⋅b){\displaystyle {\mathbf {a} }\times ({\mathbf {b} }\times {\mathbf {c} })={\mathbf {b} }({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {c} })-{\mathbf {c} }({\mathbf {a} }\cdot {\mathbf {b} })}

The formula above is the surface element for general surfaces defined by z=f(x,y).{\displaystyle z=f(x,y).} It is important to note that the nature of surfaces (more accurately, the cross product) still allows one ambiguity - the way the normal vector is pointing.

The derivation works in any coordinate system. See the tips for the derivation in cylindrical coordinates.


, The surface consists of infinitesimal patches that are approximately flat. As you can see, the way we integrate over a domain works the same way, and the fact that a surface element denotes orientation as well reflects that surface integrals are a powerful generalization of area integrals.

r=xi+yj+f(x,y)k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {r} }=x{\mathbf {i} }+y{\mathbf {j} }+f(x,y){\mathbf {k} }}
;
, For drx,y{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }_{x},\,y} is being held constant, and vice versa. We use the notation fx=∂f(x,y)∂x.{\displaystyle f_{x}={\frac {\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}}.}


drx=dxi+fxdxk{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }_{x}={\mathrm {d} }x{\mathbf {i} }+f_{x}{\mathrm {d} }x{\mathbf {k} }}


dry=dyj+fydyk{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }_{y}={\mathrm {d} }y{\mathbf {j} }+f_{y}{\mathrm {d} }y{\mathbf {k} }}


, Surface integrals are a generalization of line integrals. A surface element therefore contains information about both its area and orientation. Thus, the goal is to compute a cross product.


dS=drx×dry=|ijkdx0fxdx0dyfydy|=−fxdxdyi−fydxdyj+dxdyk{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {S} }&={\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }_{x}\times {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }_{y}\\&={\begin{vmatrix}{\mathbf {i} }&{\mathbf {j} }&{\mathbf {k} }\\{\mathrm {d} }x&0&f_{x}{\mathrm {d} }x\\0&{\mathrm {d} }y&f_{y}{\mathrm {d} }y\end{vmatrix}}\\&=-f_{x}{\mathrm {d} }x{\mathrm {d} }y{\mathbf {i} }-f_{y}{\mathrm {d} }x{\mathrm {d} }y{\mathbf {j} }+{\mathrm {d} }x{\mathrm {d} }y{\mathbf {k} }\end{aligned}}}


dS=(−fxi−fyj+k)dxdy{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {S} }=(-f_{x}{\mathbf {i} }-f_{y}{\mathbf {j} }+{\mathbf {k} }){\mathrm {d} }x{\mathrm {d} }y}

The formula above is the surface element for general surfaces defined by z=f(x,y).{\displaystyle z=f(x,y).} It is important to note that the nature of surfaces (more accurately, the cross product) still allows one ambiguity - the way the normal vector is pointing. The result that we have derived applies to outward normals, as recognized by the positive k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }} component, and for most applications, this will always be the case. 


, The surface below has a boundary of an ellipse, not a circle. If we choose to do the surface integral, then we will need to use Jacobian change of variables in order to properly convert into polar coordinates. Therefore, we will choose to parameterize the boundary directly.


G=(2x2y−4xz)i+yj+x3zk{\displaystyle {\mathbf {G} }=(2x^{2}y-4xz){\mathbf {i} }+y{\mathbf {j} }+x^{3}z{\mathbf {k} }}


, As always, verify that the chosen parameters work before proceeding.


x=3cos⁡t{\displaystyle x={\sqrt {3}}\cos t}


y=2sin⁡t{\displaystyle y=2\sin t}


,


dx=−3sin⁡t{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x=-{\sqrt {3}}\sin t}


dy=2cos⁡t{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }y=2\cos t}


, Since our boundary is on the xy-plane, z=0,{\displaystyle z=0,} so cross out all terms that contain z.{\displaystyle z.} Additionally, we are performing a closed loop integral, so our interval is .{\displaystyle .}


∮G⋅dr=∫02π(2⋅3cos2⁡t⋅2sin⁡t⋅−3sin⁡t+4sin⁡tcos⁡t)dt=∫02π(−123cos2⁡tsin2⁡t+4sin⁡tcos⁡t)dt{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\oint {\mathbf {G} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }&=\int _{0}^{2\pi }(2\cdot 3\cos ^{2}t\cdot 2\sin t\cdot -{\sqrt {3}}\sin t+4\sin t\cos t){\mathrm {d} }t\\&=\int _{0}^{2\pi }(-12{\sqrt {3}}\cos ^{2}t\sin ^{2}t+4\sin t\cos t){\mathrm {d} }t\end{aligned}}}


, The second term is 0 if we perform a u-substitution.


∫02π(−123cos2⁡tsin2⁡t+4sin⁡tcos⁡t)dt{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }(-12{\sqrt {3}}\cos ^{2}t\sin ^{2}t+{\cancel {4\sin t\cos t}}){\mathrm {d} }t}


, It is useful to memorize ∫02πcos2⁡tsin2⁡tdt=π4.{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }\cos ^{2}t\sin ^{2}t{\mathrm {d} }t={\frac {\pi }{4}}.}


−123∫02πcos2⁡tsin2⁡tdt=−33π{\displaystyle -12{\sqrt {3}}\int _{0}^{2\pi }\cos ^{2}t\sin ^{2}t{\mathrm {d} }t=-3{\sqrt {3}}\pi }

To check that this answer is correct, simply do the surface integral. The process will be longer, since you have to take the curl of a vector field and do Jacobians when you convert to the area integral.


, Use the surface z=6−x2−y2{\displaystyle z=6-x^{2}-y^{2}} above the xy-plane with the given vector field below.


F=(x2−2y)i+(3x−2xz)j+(x2y2−4yz)k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=(x^{2}-2y){\mathbf {i} }+(3x-2xz){\mathbf {j} }+(x^{2}y^{2}-4yz){\mathbf {k} }}

The goal of verification is to evaluate both integrals and check that their answers are the same. First, we will parameterize the boundary and compute the line integral. Then, we'll evaluate the surface integral. With enough practice using Stokes' theorem, you will be able to rewrite a problem into something that is easier to solve.


, When we set z=0,{\displaystyle z=0,} we find that the boundary is a circle of radius 6{\displaystyle {\sqrt {6}}} on the xy-plane. Therefore, the following parameters are appropriate. These are the components of r.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {r} }.}


x=6cos⁡t{\displaystyle x={\sqrt {6}}\cos t}


y=6sin⁡t{\displaystyle y={\sqrt {6}}\sin t}


,


dx=−6sin⁡tdt{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x=-{\sqrt {6}}\sin t{\mathrm {d} }t}


dy=6cos⁡tdt{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }y={\sqrt {6}}\cos t{\mathrm {d} }t}


, The vector field contains terms with z{\displaystyle z} in them, but since on the xy-plane, z=0,{\displaystyle z=0,} neglect those terms.


F⋅dr=(6cos2⁡t−26sin⁡t)(−6sin⁡tdt)+(36cos⁡t)(6cos⁡tdt)=(−66cos2⁡tsin⁡t+12sin2⁡t+18cos2⁡t)dt{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }&=(6\cos ^{2}t-2{\sqrt {6}}\sin t)(-{\sqrt {6}}\sin t{\mathrm {d} }t)+(3{\sqrt {6}}\cos t)({\sqrt {6}}\cos t{\mathrm {d} }t)\\&=(-6{\sqrt {6}}\cos ^{2}t\sin t+12\sin ^{2}t+18\cos ^{2}t){\mathrm {d} }t\end{aligned}}}


, Stokes' theorem tells us that t{\displaystyle t} is being integrated on the interval .{\displaystyle .} It is useful to recognize that ∫02πsin⁡tdt=0,{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }\sin t{\mathrm {d} }t=0,} which allows us to annihilate that term. Even though it is being multiplied by cos2⁡t,{\displaystyle \cos ^{2}t,} that does not affect sin⁡t{\displaystyle \sin t} being odd over the interval {\displaystyle } because cos2⁡t{\displaystyle \cos ^{2}t} is even.


∫∂SF⋅dr=∫02π(12sin2⁡t+18cos2⁡t)dt{\displaystyle \int _{\partial S}{\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {r} }=\int _{0}^{2\pi }(12\sin ^{2}t+18\cos ^{2}t){\mathrm {d} }t}


, Here, we recognize that ∫02πsin2⁡tdt=∫02πcos2⁡tdt=π,{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }\sin ^{2}t{\mathrm {d} }t=\int _{0}^{2\pi }\cos ^{2}t{\mathrm {d} }t=\pi ,} which, while they can be found using trig identities, are worth memorizing regardless.


∫02π(12sin2⁡t+18cos2⁡t)dt=30π{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi }(12\sin ^{2}t+18\cos ^{2}t){\mathrm {d} }t=30\pi }


, We recall the formula converting the surface integral into an easier-to-manage area integral as dS=(−fxi−fyj+k)dA.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {S} }=(-f_{x}{\mathbf {i} }-f_{y}{\mathbf {j} }+{\mathbf {k} }){\mathrm {d} }A.} In this case, f{\displaystyle f} refers to the surface z=f(x,y)=6−x2−y2.{\displaystyle z=f(x,y)=6-x^{2}-y^{2}.}


dS=(2xi+2yj+k)dA{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {S} }=(2x{\mathbf {i} }+2y{\mathbf {j} }+{\mathbf {k} }){\mathrm {d} }A}


, During the dot product, we find that we have three variables, yet we are integrating over just two dimensions. Simply substitute z=6−x2−y2{\displaystyle z=6-x^{2}-y^{2}} to solve this.


∇×F=|ijk∂/∂x∂/∂y∂/∂zx2−2y3x−2xzx2y2−4yz|=(2x2y−4z+2x)i−(2xy2)j+(5−2z)k{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \times {\mathbf {F} }&={\begin{vmatrix}{\mathbf {i} }&{\mathbf {j} }&{\mathbf {k} }\\\partial /\partial x&\partial /\partial y&\partial /\partial z\\x^{2}-2y&3x-2xz&x^{2}y^{2}-4yz\end{vmatrix}}\\&=(2x^{2}y-4z+2x){\mathbf {i} }-(2xy^{2}){\mathbf {j} }+(5-2z){\mathbf {k} }\end{aligned}}}


∫S(∇×F)⋅dS=∫D(4x3y−8xz+4x2−4xy3+5−2z)dA{\displaystyle \int _{S}(\nabla \times {\mathbf {F} })\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {S} }=\int _{D}(4x^{3}y-8xz+4x^{2}-4xy^{3}+5-2z){\mathrm {d} }A}


, The function f(x,y)=6−x2−y2{\displaystyle f(x,y)=6-x^{2}-y^{2}} is symmetric over both the x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} axes. Therefore, any terms with an odd function of either variable will cancel out. In this problem, notice that f(x,y){\displaystyle f(x,y)} is an even function. Therefore, we don't even need to do the multiplication for the 8xz{\displaystyle 8xz} term, because 8x{\displaystyle 8x} is odd, so the entire term cancels out. This step greatly simplifies the integral to be evaluated.


∫D(4x3y−8xz+4x2−4xy3+5−12+2x2+2y2)dA{\displaystyle \int _{D}({\cancel {4x^{3}y}}-{\cancel {8xz}}+4x^{2}-{\cancel {4xy^{3}}}+5-12+2x^{2}+2y^{2}){\mathrm {d} }A}


, Our problem has now been reduced to an area integral on the xy-plane, for we have taken advantage of Stokes' theorem and recognized that this ""surface"" - the disk on the plane - will yield the same result as our elliptic paraboloid.


∫D(6x2+2y2−7)dA=∫06rdr∫02πdθ(6r2cos2⁡θ+2r2sin2⁡θ−7){\displaystyle \int _{D}(6x^{2}+2y^{2}-7){\mathrm {d} }A=\int _{0}^{\sqrt {6}}r{\mathrm {d} }r\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\mathrm {d} }\theta (6r^{2}\cos ^{2}\theta +2r^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta -7)}


,


∫06rdr(8r2π−14π)=π∫06(8r3−14r)dr=π(2⋅36−7⋅6)=30π{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{0}^{\sqrt {6}}r{\mathrm {d} }r(8r^{2}\pi -14\pi )&=\pi \int _{0}^{\sqrt {6}}(8r^{3}-14r){\mathrm {d} }r\\&=\pi (2\cdot 36-7\cdot 6)\\&=30\pi \end{aligned}}}

Our answer agrees with our answer obtained in step 6, so Stokes' theorem has been verified.

Evaluate.",How to Calculate Indefinite Integrals,", This is the same power rule for derivatives, but in reverse. We increase the power by 1, and divide by the new power. Don't forget to add the constant of integration C.{\displaystyle C.}


∫xndx=xn+1n+1+C{\displaystyle \int x^{n}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {x^{n+1}}{n+1}}+C}

To verify that this power rule holds, differentiate the antiderivative to recover the original function.

The power rule holds for all functions of this form with degree n{\displaystyle n} except when n=−1.{\displaystyle n=-1.} We will see why later.


, Integration is a linear operator, which means that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals, and coefficients can be factored out, like so.


∫(axn+bxm)dx=a∫xndx+b∫xmdx{\displaystyle \int (ax^{n}+bx^{m}){\mathrm {d} }x=a\int x^{n}{\mathrm {d} }x+b\int x^{m}{\mathrm {d} }x}

This should be familiar because the derivative is also a linear operator; the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.

Linearity does not just apply for polynomials. It applies to any integral where the integrand is a sum of two or more terms.


, This is a polynomial, so using the property of linearity and the power rule, the antiderivative can easily be computed. To find the antiderivative of a constant, remember that x0=1,{\displaystyle x^{0}=1,} so the constant is really just the coefficient of x0.{\displaystyle x^{0}.}


∫(x3−2x2+4x+2)dx=14x4−23x3+2x2+2x+C{\displaystyle \int (x^{3}-2x^{2}+4x+2){\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{4}}x^{4}-{\frac {2}{3}}x^{3}+2x^{2}+2x+C}


, This may seem like an integral that cannot be done using the power rule, but a moment's glance reveals that we can rewrite x=x1/2,{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}=x^{1/2},} separate the fraction into three fractions, and apply linearity and the power rule to find the antiderivative.


∫f(x)dx=∫3x2−7x+1xdx=∫(3x2x1/2−7xx1/2+1x1/2)dx=∫(3x3/2−7x1/2+x−1/2)dx=3⋅25x5/2−7⋅23x3/2+2x1/2+C=65x5/2−143x3/2+2x1/2+C{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int f(x){\mathrm {d} }x&=\int {\frac {3x^{2}-7x+1}{\sqrt {x}}}{\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\int \left({\frac {3x^{2}}{x^{1/2}}}-{\frac {7x}{x^{1/2}}}+{\frac {1}{x^{1/2}}}\right){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\int (3x^{3/2}-7x^{1/2}+x^{-1/2}){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=3\cdot {\frac {2}{5}}x^{5/2}-7\cdot {\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}+2x^{1/2}+C\\&={\frac {6}{5}}x^{5/2}-{\frac {14}{3}}x^{3/2}+2x^{1/2}+C\end{aligned}}}


, In the following steps, we list commonly encountered functions like the exponential and trigonometric functions. All are widely encountered, especially ones that are listed further up, so knowing what their antiderivatives are is crucial to building up integrating skills. Remember that indefinite integrals have an extra C,{\displaystyle C,} because the derivative of a constant is 0. The integral of the logarithmic function can be found using integration by parts, which we go over later.


∫exdx=ex+C{\displaystyle \int e^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x=e^{x}+C}


∫axdx=axln⁡a+C{\displaystyle \int a^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {a^{x}}{\ln a}}+C}


∫ln⁡xdx=xln⁡x−x+C{\displaystyle \int \ln x{\mathrm {d} }x=x\ln x-x+C}


∫loga⁡xdx=xln⁡x−xln⁡a+C{\displaystyle \int \log _{a}x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {x\ln x-x}{\ln a}}+C}


, Previously, we said that the function f(x)=x−1,{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{-1},} or f(x)=1x,{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{x}},} was an exception to the power rule. The reason is because the antiderivative of this function is the logarithmic function.


∫1xdx=ln⁡|x|+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {1}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\ln |x|+C}

(Sometimes, authors like to put the dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} in the numerator of the fraction, so it reads like ∫dxx.{\displaystyle \int {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x}{x}}.} Be aware of this notation.)


, The sines and cosines are encountered far more often and should definitely be memorized. Integrals three through six can be found through u-substitution, which we will go over. The last four integrals listed below should be familiar from derivatives.


∫sin⁡xdx=−cos⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \sin x{\mathrm {d} }x=-\cos x+C}


∫cos⁡xdx=sin⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \cos x{\mathrm {d} }x=\sin x+C}


∫tan⁡xdx=ln⁡|sec⁡x|+C{\displaystyle \int \tan x{\mathrm {d} }x=\ln |\sec x|+C}


∫sec⁡xdx=ln⁡|sec⁡x+tan⁡x|+C{\displaystyle \int \sec x{\mathrm {d} }x=\ln |\sec x+\tan x|+C}


∫csc⁡xdx=−ln⁡|csc⁡x+cot⁡x|+C{\displaystyle \int \csc x{\mathrm {d} }x=-\ln |\csc x+\cot x|+C}


∫cot⁡xdx=ln⁡|sin⁡x|+C{\displaystyle \int \cot x{\mathrm {d} }x=\ln |\sin x|+C}


∫sec2⁡xdx=tan⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \sec ^{2}x{\mathrm {d} }x=\tan x+C}


∫csc2⁡xdx=−cot⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \csc ^{2}x{\mathrm {d} }x=-\cot x+C}


∫sec⁡xtan⁡xdx=sec⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \sec x\tan x{\mathrm {d} }x=\sec x+C}


∫csc⁡xcot⁡xdx=−csc⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \csc x\cot x{\mathrm {d} }x=-\csc x+C}


, These should not really be considered an exercise in ""memorization."" As long as you are familiar with the derivatives, then most of these antiderivatives should be familiar as well.


∫1a2−x2dx=sin−1xa+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {1}{\sqrt {a^{2}-x^{2}}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\sin ^{-1}{\frac {x}{a}}+C}


∫−1a2−x2dx=cos−1xa+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {-1}{\sqrt {a^{2}-x^{2}}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\cos ^{-1}{\frac {x}{a}}+C}


∫1a2+x2dx=1atan−1xa+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {1}{a^{2}+x^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{a}}\tan ^{-1}{\frac {x}{a}}+C}


, Hyperbolic functions are not encountered as often as the related trigonometric functions, but they do occur in applications such as special relativity. Below, we list the two integrals that you should know - all others can be looked up in a table.


∫sinh⁡xdx=cosh⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \sinh x{\mathrm {d} }x=\cosh x+C}


∫cosh⁡xdx=sinh⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \cosh x{\mathrm {d} }x=\sinh x+C}


, U-substitution is a technique that changes variables with the hope of obtaining an easier integral. As we will see, it is the analogue of the chain rule for derivatives. 
, What do we do when the exponent has a coefficient in it? We use u-substitution to change variables. It turns out that these kinds of u-subs are the easiest to perform, and they are done so often, the u-sub is often skipped. Nevertheless, we will show the entire process.


∫eaxdx{\displaystyle \int e^{ax}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We choose u=ax{\displaystyle u=ax} so that we get a eu{\displaystyle e^{u}} in the integrand, a function whose antiderivative we are familiar with - itself. Then we must replace dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} with du,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u,} but we need to make sure that we are keeping track of our terms. In this example, du=adx,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=a{\mathrm {d} }x,} so we need to divide the whole integral by a{\displaystyle a} to compensate.


∫eaxdx=1a∫eudu{\displaystyle \int e^{ax}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{a}}\int e^{u}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, For indefinite integrals, you must rewrite in terms of the original variable.


∫eaxdx=1aeax+C{\displaystyle \int e^{ax}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{a}}e^{ax}+C}


, We will see that this u-sub is a case where you need to ""back-substitute."" 


∫x2x+3dx{\displaystyle \int x{\sqrt {2x+3}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We choose u=2x+3{\displaystyle u=2x+3} so that we simplify the square root. Then du=2dx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=2{\mathrm {d} }x.} However, after replacing the dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} with a du,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u,} we still have an x{\displaystyle x} in the integrand.


∫x2x+3dx=12∫xudu{\displaystyle \int x{\sqrt {2x+3}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{2}}\int x{\sqrt {u}}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, This is the back-substitution that we were talking about earlier. Our u-sub did not get rid of all the x{\displaystyle x} terms in the integrand, so we need to back-sub to get rid of it. We find that x=u−32.{\displaystyle x={\frac {u-3}{2}}.} After simplifying, we get the following.


12∫xudu=14∫(u−3)udu{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\int x{\sqrt {u}}{\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {1}{4}}\int (u-3){\sqrt {u}}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, We were given the problem in terms of x,{\displaystyle x,} so our answer must also be written in terms of x.{\displaystyle x.}


14∫(u−3)udu=14∫(u3/2−3u1/2)du=14(25u5/2−3⋅23u3/2)+C=110u5/2−12u3/2+C=110(2x+3)5/2−12(2x+3)3/2+C{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {1}{4}}\int (u-3){\sqrt {u}}{\mathrm {d} }u&={\frac {1}{4}}\int (u^{3/2}-3u^{1/2}){\mathrm {d} }u\\&={\frac {1}{4}}\left({\frac {2}{5}}u^{5/2}-3\cdot {\frac {2}{3}}u^{3/2}\right)+C\\&={\frac {1}{10}}u^{5/2}-{\frac {1}{2}}u^{3/2}+C\\&={\frac {1}{10}}(2x+3)^{5/2}-{\frac {1}{2}}(2x+3)^{3/2}+C\end{aligned}}}


, The integration by parts formula is given below. The main goal of integration by parts is to integrate the product of two functions - hence, it is the analogue of the product rule for derivatives. This technique simplifies the integral into one that is hopefully easier to evaluate.


∫udv=uv−∫vdu{\displaystyle \int u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv-\int v{\mathrm {d} }u}


, We know that the derivative of ln⁡x{\displaystyle \ln x} is 1x,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{x}},} but not the antiderivative. It turns out that this integral is a simple application of integration by parts. 


∫ln⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int \ln x{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We choose u=ln⁡x{\displaystyle u=\ln x} because the derivative is algebraic and therefore easier to manipulate. Then dv=dx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v={\mathrm {d} }x.} Therefore, du=1xdx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {1}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x} and v=x.{\displaystyle v=x.} Substituting all of these into the formula, we obtain the following.


∫ln⁡xdx=xln⁡x−∫dx{\displaystyle \int \ln x{\mathrm {d} }x=x\ln x-\int {\mathrm {d} }x}

We converted the integral of a logarithm into the integral of 1, which is trivial to evaluate.

∫−∞∞e−x2dx{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x}
;
, We are expanding this integral into the xy{\displaystyle xy} plane. The idea here is to turn this problem into a double integral for which we can easily solve, and then take the square root.


∫−∞∞dxe−x2∫−∞∞dye−y2{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\mathrm {d} }xe^{-x^{2}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\mathrm {d} }ye^{-y^{2}}}


, Recall that the area integral of a polar rectangle is of the form rdrdθ,{\displaystyle r{\mathrm {d} }r{\mathrm {d} }\theta ,} with the extra r{\displaystyle r} there in order to scale the angle to units of length. This extra r{\displaystyle r} makes this problem trivial.


∫−∞∞dxe−x2∫−∞∞dye−y2=∫0∞rdr∫02πdθe−r2{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\mathrm {d} }xe^{-x^{2}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\mathrm {d} }ye^{-y^{2}}=\int _{0}^{\infty }r{\mathrm {d} }r\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\mathrm {d} }\theta e^{-r^{2}}}


, Let u=r2.{\displaystyle u=r^{2}.} Then the differential du=2rdr{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=2r{\mathrm {d} }r} will cancel out the extra r{\displaystyle r} that we got from changing to polar. Since the integrand has no θ{\displaystyle \theta } dependence, we can evaluate the θ{\displaystyle \theta } integral immediately.

, Since we were evaluating the square of the integral, we take the square root of our result.


∫−∞∞e−x2dx=π{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\sqrt {\pi }}}

Importantly, the Gaussian function is even.


∫−∞∞e−x2dx=2∫0∞e−x2dx=2⋅π2{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x=2\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x=2\cdot {\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2}}}




, This function is determined by the parameters a{\displaystyle a} and σ,{\displaystyle \sigma ,} where a{\displaystyle a} is a (normalization) constant that determines the height of the bell curve, and σ{\displaystyle \sigma } is the standard deviation, which determines the curve's width. 


f(x)=ae−x22σ2{\displaystyle f(x)=ae^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}}}}}

Follow the steps shown above to verify this integral. 


∫−∞∞ae−x22σ2dx=aσ2π{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }ae^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=a\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}



Another way to formulate the problem is if we have a Gaussian in the form e−αx2.{\displaystyle e^{-\alpha x^{2}}.} Verify this integral as well.


∫−∞∞e−αx2dx=πα{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }e^{-\alpha x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{\alpha }}}}




, In many applications, it is desired that the area of the Gaussian be set to unity. In this case, we set aσ2π=1{\displaystyle a\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}=1} and solve for a.{\displaystyle a.}


a=1σ2π{\displaystyle a={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}}

Here, we arrive at the normalized Gaussian, so desired in such applications as probability theory, quantum mechanics, and so forth. The diagram above lists a few normalized Gaussians with varying standard deviations (actually variances, since they are defined by σ2{\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}}).


f(x)=1σ2πe−x22σ2{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {x^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}}}}}




, The Gaussian integral ∫0∞e−αx2dx=12πα{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-\alpha x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{\alpha }}}} is a result that can be used to find numerous related integrals. The ones below are called moments of the Gaussian. Below, n{\displaystyle n} is a positive number.


∫0∞xne−x2dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{n}e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, The result from differentiating under the integral is that even powers of x{\displaystyle x} get brought down. Notice that as the integral gets negated, the result on the right also gets negated because of the negative power in α,{\displaystyle \alpha ,} so the answers remain positive. Since differentiation is much easier than integration, we could do this all day, making sure to set α=1{\displaystyle \alpha =1} at a convenient time. We list some of these integrals below. Make sure to verify them for yourself.


∫0∞e−αx2dx=12πα{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-\alpha x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{\alpha }}}}


∫0∞x2e−x2dx=−∫0∞∂∂αe−αx2dx=−ddα(12πα)=π4{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{2}e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x=-\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {\partial }{\partial \alpha }}e^{-\alpha x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x=-{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\alpha }}\left({\frac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{\alpha }}}\right)={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{4}}}


∫0∞x4e−x2dx=3π8{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{4}e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {3{\sqrt {\pi }}}{8}}}


∫0∞x6e−x2dx=15π16{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{6}e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {15{\sqrt {\pi }}}{16}}}


, Then we can use the Gamma function to easily evaluate. Below, we choose n=9{\displaystyle n=9} and n=1/3{\displaystyle n=1/3} as examples.


∫0∞x9e−x2dx=12∫0∞u4e−udu=4!2=12{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{9}e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{2}}\int _{0}^{\infty }u^{4}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {4!}{2}}=12}


∫0∞x1/3e−x2dx=12∫0∞u−1/3e−udu=Γ(2/3)2{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }x^{1/3}e^{-x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{2}}\int _{0}^{\infty }u^{-1/3}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {\Gamma (2/3)}{2}}}

It is interesting to note that we could've used the Gamma function for even n{\displaystyle n} as well. It is a more general method of evaluating these types of integrals that typically is no more involved than differentiating under the integral.


, The result is general enough such that α{\displaystyle \alpha } can even take on complex values. Recall Euler's formula relating the complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions. If we take the real and imaginary parts of our result, we obtain two integrals for free. Neither of the two real integrals have antiderivatives that can be written in closed form.


e−ix2=cos⁡x2−isin⁡x2{\displaystyle e^{-ix^{2}}=\cos x^{2}-i\sin x^{2}}


∫0∞e−ix2dx=12πi=π2e−iπ/4=π22(1−i){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-ix^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{i}}}={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2}}e^{-i\pi /4}={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2{\sqrt {2}}}}(1-i)}


∫0∞cos⁡x2dx=∫0∞sin⁡x2dx=π22{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\infty }\cos x^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int _{0}^{\infty }\sin x^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2{\sqrt {2}}}}}

These two integrals are special cases of the Fresnel integrals, where they are important in the study of optics.

If you are not very familiar with complex numbers, the number i{\displaystyle i} can be rewritten in polar form as eiπ/2,{\displaystyle e^{i\pi /2},} because imaginary exponents are rotations in the complex plane - in this case, by an angle of π/2.{\displaystyle \pi /2.} Polar form simplifies almost everything associated with complex numbers, so we can easily take the square root.


, Calculating the Fourier transform is computationally very simple, but it requires a slight modification. We opt to complete the square because we recognize the property that the integral is independent of the shift (see the discussion). Since we have to add 0 in order to not change the integrand, we have to compensate by adding a −ω24{\displaystyle -{\frac {\omega ^{2}}{4}}} term. Watch the signs - they can be tricky.


F{e−t2}=∫−∞∞e−t2e−iωtdt=∫−∞∞e−(t2+iωt−ω2/4+ω2/4)dt=e−ω2/4∫−∞∞e−(t+iω/2)2dt=πe−ω2/4{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {F}}\{e^{-t^{2}}\}&=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }e^{-t^{2}}e^{-i\omega t}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }e^{-(t^{2}+i\omega t-\omega ^{2}/4+\omega ^{2}/4)}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=e^{-\omega ^{2}/4}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }e^{-(t+i\omega /2)^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&={\sqrt {\pi }}e^{-\omega ^{2}/4}\end{aligned}}}

Interestingly, the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another (scaled) Gaussian, a property that few other functions have (the hyperbolic secant, whose function is also shaped like a bell curve, is also its own Fourier transform).

For physicists and engineers, Gaussian integrals are incredibly useful. Proficiency in evaluating them is a must.

Definition. Given a complex function f(z){\displaystyle f(z)} and a contour γ,{\displaystyle \gamma ,} the integral of f(z){\displaystyle f(z)} over γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is said to be the Riemann sum limn→∞∑i=0nf(zi)Δzi.{\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\sum _{i=0}^{n}f(z_{i})\Delta z_{i}.} If this limit exists, then we say f(z){\displaystyle f(z)} is integrable on γ.{\displaystyle \gamma .} We communicate this by writing ∫γf(z)dz.{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }f(z){\mathrm {d} }z.}

Intuitively, this is a very straightforward generalization of the Riemann sum. We are simply adding up rectangles to find the area of a curve, and send the width of the rectangles to 0 such that they become infinitesimally thin.
;
, 

If we parameterize the contour γ{\displaystyle \gamma } as z(t),{\displaystyle z(t),} then by the chain rule, we can equivalently write the integral below.


∫γf(z)dz=∫Δtf(z(t))dzdtdt{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }f(z){\mathrm {d} }z=\int _{\Delta t}f(z(t)){\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}{\mathrm {d} }t}



This is the integral that we use to compute. An important note is that this integral can be written in terms of its real and imaginary parts, like so.


∫Δtf(z(t))dzdtdt=∫Δt(u(t)+iv(t))dt{\displaystyle \int _{\Delta t}f(z(t)){\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}{\mathrm {d} }t=\int _{\Delta t}(u(t)+iv(t)){\mathrm {d} }t}




, 

The simplest contours that are used in complex analysis are line and circle contours. It is often desired, for simplicity, to parameterize a line such that 0≤t≤1.{\displaystyle 0\leq t\leq 1.} Given a starting point z1{\displaystyle z_{1}} and an endpoint z2,{\displaystyle z_{2},} such a contour can generally be parameterized in the following manner.


z(t)=(1−t)z1+z2,  0≤t≤1{\displaystyle z(t)=(1-t)z_{1}+z_{2},\ \ 0\leq t\leq 1}



A circle contour can be parameterized in a straightforward manner as well, as long as we keep track of the orientation of the contour. Let z0{\displaystyle z_{0}} be the center of the circle and r{\displaystyle r} be the radius of the circle. Then the parameterization of the circle, starting from t=0,{\displaystyle t=0,} and traversing the contour in the counterclockwise direction, is as such.


z(t)=z0+reit,  0≤t≤2π{\displaystyle z(t)=z_{0}+re^{it},\ \ 0\leq t\leq 2\pi }



Calculating dzdt{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}} from both of these contours is trivial. 

There are two important facts to consider here. First, the contour integral ∫γf(z)dz{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }f(z){\mathrm {d} }z} is independent of parameterization so long as the direction of γ{\displaystyle \gamma } stays the same. This means that there are an infinite number of ways to parameterize a given curve, since the velocity can vary in an arbitrary way. Second, reversing the direction of the contour negates the integral.


∫−γf(z)dz=−∫γf(z)dz{\displaystyle \int _{-\gamma }f(z){\mathrm {d} }z=-\int _{\gamma }f(z){\mathrm {d} }z}




, We know that t{\displaystyle t} is real-valued, so all that remains is to integrate using the standard integration techniques of real-variable calculus.

The visual above shows a typical contour on the complex plane. Starting from the point a,{\displaystyle a,} the contour traverses a semicircle in the counterclockwise direction with radius a{\displaystyle a} and closes the loop with a line going from −a{\displaystyle -a} to a.{\displaystyle a.} If the point z=i{\displaystyle z=i} as shown is taken to be the pole of a function, then the contour integral describes a contour going around the pole. This type of integration is extremely common in complex analysis.


, γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is the curve connecting the origin to 1+i{\displaystyle 1+i} along a straight line.


∫γ(xy2+2xyi)dz{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }(xy^{2}+2xyi){\mathrm {d} }z}


, Our curve is especially simple: x=t{\displaystyle x=t} and y=t.{\displaystyle y=t.} So we write our contour in the following manner.


z(t)=t+it,  0≤t≤1{\displaystyle z(t)=t+it,\ \ 0\leq t\leq 1}


, Substitute our results into the integral.

 dzdt=1+i{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}=1+i}


∫γ(xy2+2xyi)dz=∫01(t3+i2t2)(1+i)dt{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }(xy^{2}+2xyi){\mathrm {d} }z=\int _{0}^{1}(t^{3}+i2t^{2})(1+i){\mathrm {d} }t}


,


∫01(t3+i2t2)(1+i)dt=∫01(t3+i2t2+it3−2t2)dt=14+i(23+14)−23=−512+1112i{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{0}^{1}(t^{3}+i2t^{2})(1+i){\mathrm {d} }t&=\int _{0}^{1}(t^{3}+i2t^{2}+it^{3}-2t^{2}){\mathrm {d} }t\\&={\frac {1}{4}}+i\left({\frac {2}{3}}+{\frac {1}{4}}\right)-{\frac {2}{3}}\\&=-{\frac {5}{12}}+{\frac {11}{12}}i\end{aligned}}}


, Our parameterization changes to x=t{\displaystyle x=t} and y=t3.{\displaystyle y=t^{3}.}


z(t)=t+it3{\displaystyle z(t)=t+it^{3}}


dzdt=(1+i3t2)dt{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}=(1+i3t^{2}){\mathrm {d} }t}


∫γ(xy2+2xyi)dz=∫01(t7+i2t4)(1+i3t2)dt=∫01(t7+i2t4+i3t9−6t6)dt=18+i(25+310)−67=−4156+710i{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\gamma }(xy^{2}+2xyi){\mathrm {d} }z&=\int _{0}^{1}(t^{7}+i2t^{4})(1+i3t^{2}){\mathrm {d} }t\\&=\int _{0}^{1}(t^{7}+i2t^{4}+i3t^{9}-6t^{6}){\mathrm {d} }t\\&={\frac {1}{8}}+i\left({\frac {2}{5}}+{\frac {3}{10}}\right)-{\frac {6}{7}}\\&=-{\frac {41}{56}}+{\frac {7}{10}}i\end{aligned}}}

We have shown here that for non-analytic functions such as f(z)=xy2+2xyi,{\displaystyle f(z)=xy^{2}+2xyi,} the contour integral is dependent on the path chosen. We can show that this function is non-analytic by checking if the real and imaginary parts satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. As ∂u∂x=y2{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial x}}=y^{2}} and ∂v∂y=2x,{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial v}{\partial y}}=2x,} this is enough to demonstrate non-analyticity. 


, As it pertains to contour integrals, the theorem is used to easily compute the value of contour integrals so long as we can find an antiderivative. The proof of this theorem is similar to all other fundamental theorem of calculus proofs, but we will not state it here for brevity. 

Suppose the function f(z){\displaystyle f(z)} has an antiderivative F(z){\displaystyle F(z)} such that ddzF(z)=f(z){\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }z}}F(z)=f(z)} through a domain D,{\displaystyle D,} and let γ{\displaystyle \gamma } be a contour in D,{\displaystyle D,} where z0{\displaystyle z_{0}} and z1{\displaystyle z_{1}} are the start and end points of γ,{\displaystyle \gamma ,} respectively. Then ∫γf(z)dz{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }f(z){\mathrm {d} }z} is independent of path for all continuous paths γ{\displaystyle \gamma } of finite length, and its value is given by F(z1)−F(z0).{\displaystyle F(z_{1})-F(z_{0}).}


, γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is the semicircle going counterclockwise from z=−i{\displaystyle z=-i} to z=i.{\displaystyle z=i.}


∫γzdz{\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }{\sqrt {z}}{\mathrm {d} }z}


, 


z(t)=eit,−π2≤t≤π2{\displaystyle z(t)=e^{it},-{\frac {\pi }{2}}\leq t\leq {\frac {\pi }{2}}}


dzdt=ieit{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}=ie^{it}}


∫γzdz=∫−π/2π/2e12Log⁡eitieitdt=i∫−π/2π/2e32itdt=23e32it|−π/2π/2=23(e3π4i−e−3π4i)=232isin3π4=223i{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\gamma }{\sqrt {z}}{\mathrm {d} }z&=\int _{-\pi /2}^{\pi /2}e^{{\frac {1}{2}}\operatorname {Log} e^{it}}ie^{it}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=i\int _{-\pi /2}^{\pi /2}e^{{\frac {3}{2}}it}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&={\frac {2}{3}}e^{{\frac {3}{2}}it}{\Bigg |}_{-\pi /2}^{\pi /2}\\&={\frac {2}{3}}\left(e^{{\frac {3\pi }{4}}i}-e^{-{\frac {3\pi }{4}}i}\right)\\&={\frac {2}{3}}2i\sin {\frac {3\pi }{4}}\\&={\frac {2{\sqrt {2}}}{3}}i\end{aligned}}}


, However, in this method, the z{\displaystyle {\sqrt {z}}} in the integrand presents a problem. Since we know that z=e12Log⁡z,{\displaystyle {\sqrt {z}}=e^{{\frac {1}{2}}\operatorname {Log} z},} the presence of the logarithmic function indicates a branch cut over which we cannot integrate. Fortunately, we can choose our branch cut such that our contour is well-defined in our domain. The principal branch of the logarithm, where the branch cut consists of the non-positive real numbers, works in this case, because our contour goes around that branch cut. As long as we recognize the principal logarithm has an argument defined over (−π,π],{\displaystyle (-\pi ,\pi ],} the rest of the steps are simple computations.


∫γzdz=23z3/2|−ii=23(i32−(−i)32)=23(e32Log⁡i−e32Log⁡(−i)){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\gamma }{\sqrt {z}}{\mathrm {d} }z&={\frac {2}{3}}z^{3/2}{\Bigg |}_{-i}^{i}\\&={\frac {2}{3}}\left(i^{\frac {3}{2}}-(-i)^{\frac {3}{2}}\right)\\&={\frac {2}{3}}\left(e^{{\frac {3}{2}}\operatorname {Log} i}-e^{{\frac {3}{2}}\operatorname {Log} (-i)}\right)\end{aligned}}}

For the principal branch of the logarithm, we see that Log⁡i=iπ2{\displaystyle \operatorname {Log} i=i{\frac {\pi }{2}}} and Log⁡(−i)=−iπ2.{\displaystyle \operatorname {Log} (-i)=-i{\frac {\pi }{2}}.}


∫γzdz=23(e32iπ2−e−32iπ2)=23(e3π4i−e−3π4i)=232isin3π4=223i{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\gamma }{\sqrt {z}}{\mathrm {d} }z&={\frac {2}{3}}\left(e^{{\frac {3}{2}}i{\frac {\pi }{2}}}-e^{-{\frac {3}{2}}i{\frac {\pi }{2}}}\right)\\&={\frac {2}{3}}\left(e^{{\frac {3\pi }{4}}i}-e^{-{\frac {3\pi }{4}}i}\right)\\&={\frac {2}{3}}2i\sin {\frac {3\pi }{4}}\\&={\frac {2{\sqrt {2}}}{3}}i\end{aligned}}}

This can be done algebraically by factoring the numerator.






It can also be done by multiplying by the conjugate and then simplifying.

















, When an undefined answer is returned, this means there is either a hole or an asymptote on the graph.

An undefined answer of 0/0 means there is a hole in the graph. This occurs when there is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator.






On the other hand, if the undefined answer is c/0 where “c” is a constant, then this means there is a vertical asymptote. An asymptote is a value that the graph gets closer and closer to but never actually gets to.

Define the parts of a triangle.,
Learn to make unit circle.,
Know the trigonometric functions.,
Conceptualize relationships.",How to Learn Trigonometry1," At it’s core, trigonometry is the study of relationships present in triangles. A triangle has three sides and three angles. By definition, the sum of angles for any triangle is 180 degrees. You should familiarize yourself with triangles and triangle terminology to succeed in trigonometry. Some common triangle terms are:Hypotenuse ― The longest side of a triangle.
Obtuse ― An angle that is greater than 90 degrees.
Acute ― An angle less than 90 degrees.;
, A unit circle allows you to scale any triangle so that the hypotenuse is equal to one. This is helpful because it relates trigonometric functions, like sine and cosine to percents. Once you understand the unit circle, you can use trigonometric values for a given angle to answer questions about triangles with those angles.Example 1: The sine of 30 degrees is 0.50. This means that the side opposite a 30 degree angle is exactly one half the length of the hypotenuse.
Example 2: This relationship could be used to find the length of the hypotenuse in a triangle that has a 30 degree angle with the side opposite that angle measuring 7 inches. The hypotenuse would be equal to 14 inches.

, There are six functions that are central to understanding trigonometry. Together, they define the relationships within a triangle, and allow you to understand the unique properties of any triangle. These six functions are:Sine (Sin)
Cosine (Cos)
Tangent (Tan)
Secant (Sec)
Cosecant (Csc)
Cotangent (Cot)

, One of the most important things to understand about trigonometry is that all of the functions are interrelated. While values for Sine, Cosine, Tangent, etc. all have their own uses, they are most useful because of the relationships that exist between them. The unit circle scales these relationships down so that they are easily understood. Once you understand the unit circle, you can use the relationships it describes to model other problems."

, We know the cosine and sine of common angles like π3{\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{3}}} and π4.{\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{4}}.} It will therefore be easier to deal with such angles.

Determine the rate at which the radius of the balloon is increasing when the diameter of the balloon is 20 cm.”

From reading this problem, you should recognize that the balloon is a sphere, so you will be dealing with the volume of a sphere. You should also recognize that you are given the diameter, so you should begin thinking how that will factor into the solution as well.

, Any related rates problem consists of two or more changing elements, as well as any number of constant terms that will have some bearing on the answer. You need to read the problem and identify what you are being asked to solve. It is also helpful to recognize what information is in the problem that is not going to be part of the answer.In the problem shown above, you should recognize that the specific question is about the rate of change of the radius of the balloon. Notice, however, that you are given information about the diameter of the balloon, not the radius. This will have to be adapted as you work on the problem. You should see that you are also given information about air going into the balloon, which is changing the volume of the balloon.


, After you understand the problem, you should write down the information that you know, as well as the information that you don’t know. Determine variables for each and write these down. Be as explicit as you can at this stage, so you do not risk confusing yourself later on.Any rates that are given in the problem should be expressed as derivatives with respect to time. Note that a derivative can be expressed symbolically using the “prime” notation, as r′{\displaystyle r^{\prime }}, or the more explicit drdt{\displaystyle {\frac {dr}{dt}}}. These both indicate the derivative of radius with respect to time.In this problem you should identify the following items:


dVdt=5cm3/min{\displaystyle {\frac {dV}{dt}}=5cm^{3}/min}


d=20cm.{\displaystyle d=20cm.}


drdt={\displaystyle {\frac {dr}{dt}}=}unknown rate of radius change, to be solved



Note that the data given to you regarding the size of the balloon is its diameter. However, planning ahead, you should recall that the formula for the volume of a sphere uses the radius. Therefore, you should identify that variable as well:


r=10cm.{\displaystyle r=10cm.} (The radius is half the diameter.)




, The trickiest and most important step of solving a related rates problem is determining what formula you need to use that relates the data that you have. In this problem, you know the diameter and radius of a sphere, and you have information about the volume of a sphere. Therefore, the formula that you need should be the formula for the volume of a sphere.V=43πr3{\displaystyle V={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}}


, You should recognize that the formula itself is a representation of the volume in relation to the radius. However, for this problem, you are given the rate of the change of the volume (the air being pumped in) and you are asked for the rate of change of the radius. The rate of change is given by the first derivative of the equation.dVdt=4πr2drdt{\displaystyle {\frac {dV}{dt}}=4\pi r^{2}{\frac {dr}{dt}}} 


, Refer back to your earlier notes in which you wrote down the values of the various functions and variables. Insert that data into the derivative function that you are working with. When you do this, you should find that one variable remains in the problem. This is the one that you are trying to solve.In this problem, you know the rate of change of the volume and you know the radius. The only unknown is the rate of change of the radius, which should be your solution.


dVdt=4πr2drdt{\displaystyle {\frac {dV}{dt}}=4\pi r^{2}{\frac {dr}{dt}}}


5=4π∗102drdt{\displaystyle 5=4\pi *10^{2}{\frac {dr}{dt}}}


5=400πdrdt{\displaystyle 5=400\pi {\frac {dr}{dt}}}


5400π=drdt{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{400\pi }}={\frac {dr}{dt}}}


180π=drdt{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{80\pi }}={\frac {dr}{dt}}}




, Review your work and verify that you have answered the question as asked, and that your result is reasonable in terms of the data that was given.In this case, your solution is for drdt{\displaystyle {\frac {dr}{dt}}}, which is the rate of change of the radius. This is what the question asked for. You should then express your numerical answer with its units to present the final answer for the problem:


drdt=180π{\displaystyle {\frac {dr}{dt}}={\frac {1}{80\pi }}} centimeters per minute.




, The first step is to read the problem carefully and interpret what is being asked. Think about the following problem:

A baseball diamond is 90 feet square. A runner runs from first base to second base at 25 feet per second. How fast is he moving away from home plate when he is 30 feet from first base?

You can diagram this problem by drawing a square to represent the baseball diamond. Label one corner of the square as ""Home Plate."", In this case, the question asks for the runner’s speed. A speed is a rate of change of distance, so you should recognize that you are being asked for the derivative of the distance from home plate to the runner. Thinking about the situation, you should envision a right triangle that represents the baseball diamond.

One leg of the triangle is the base path from home plate to first base, which is 90 feet. 

The second leg is the base path from first base to the runner, which you can designate by length r{\displaystyle r}. You are asked to solve the problem when this distance is 30 feet.

The rate of change of this distance, drdt{\displaystyle {\frac {dr}{dt}}}, is the runner’s speed.

The hypotenuse of the right triangle is the straight line length from home plate to the runner (across the middle of the baseball diamond). Call this distance d{\displaystyle d}. You aren’t told this distance, but you can calculate it from the Pythagorean Theorem. If the two legs are 90 and 30, then the hypotenuse d{\displaystyle d} is 902+302{\displaystyle {\sqrt {90^{2}+30^{2}}}}. Thus, d=3010{\displaystyle d=30{\sqrt {10}}}.

The actual question is for the rate of change of this distance, or how fast the runner is moving away from home plate. This will be the derivative, dddt{\displaystyle {\frac {dd}{dt}}}.


, In this case, the baseball diamond can be represented by a right triangle, so you should immediately think of the Pythagorean Theorem, a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}. Your task is to translate the a,b,c{\displaystyle a,b,c} into the terms of your problem.

The first leg, a{\displaystyle a}, is the distance from home to first, 90 feet.

The second leg, b{\displaystyle b}, is the distance from first to the runner. Use the variable r{\displaystyle r}. You are asked to solve the problem for the instant when r=30{\displaystyle r=30}.

The hypotenuse, c{\displaystyle c}, is the distance from home to the runner, d{\displaystyle d}.

Write out the new equation:


d2=902+r2{\displaystyle d^{2}=90^{2}+r^{2}}




, To go from distances to rates of change (speed), you need the derivative of the formula. Take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to time (t).


2ddddt=2rdrdt{\displaystyle 2d{\frac {dd}{dt}}=2r{\frac {dr}{dt}}}

Note that the constant term, 902{\displaystyle 90^{2}}, drops out of the equation when you take the derivative.


, Using the derivative formula, insert the values that you know, and simplify to find the solution.


2ddddt=2rdrdt{\displaystyle 2d{\frac {dd}{dt}}=2r{\frac {dr}{dt}}}


2∗3010dddt=2∗30∗25{\displaystyle 2*30{\sqrt {10}}{\frac {dd}{dt}}=2*30*25}


dddt=2∗30∗252∗3010{\displaystyle {\frac {dd}{dt}}={\frac {2*30*25}{2*30{\sqrt {10}}}}}


dddt=2510{\displaystyle {\frac {dd}{dt}}={\frac {25}{\sqrt {10}}}}


, The rate of change of the hypotenuse, or the speed of the runner moving away from home plate, is 2510{\displaystyle {\frac {25}{\sqrt {10}}}} feet per second. Converting this to a more understandable rate, the runner is moving about 7.9 feet per second away from home plate at that instant.
, Consider the following problem:

Water flows at 8 cubic feet per minute into a cylinder with radius 4 feet. How fast is the water level rising?

Diagram this situation by sketching a cylinder. Make a horizontal line across the middle of it to represent the water height., You are told that water is filling a cylinder, which implies that you will be measuring the volume of the cylinder in some way. You are asked for the rate of change of the height of the water.

As the water fills the cylinder, the volume of water, which you can call V{\displaystyle V}, is increasing. 

The rate of the increase, dVdt{\displaystyle {\frac {dV}{dt}}}, is the amount of the water flow, or 8 cubic feet per minute.

The height of the water, h{\displaystyle h}, is not given.

The rate of change of the height, dhdt{\displaystyle {\frac {dh}{dt}}}, is the solution to the problem.

You are also told that the radius of the cylinder r{\displaystyle r} is 4 feet.


, In this case, you are working with a cylinder, its volume, its height and its radius. The formula that relates these terms is:


V=πr2h{\displaystyle V=\pi r^{2}h}


, Using this equation, take the derivative of each side with respect to time t{\displaystyle t} to get an equation involving rates of change:


V=πr2h{\displaystyle V=\pi r^{2}h}


dVdt=πr2dhdt{\displaystyle {\frac {dV}{dt}}=\pi r^{2}{\frac {dh}{dt}}}


, You know the rate of change of the volume and you know the radius of the cylinder. Insert these and simplify to find the rate that the water level rises:


dVdt=πr2dhdt{\displaystyle {\frac {dV}{dt}}=\pi r^{2}{\frac {dh}{dt}}}


8=π(42)dhdt{\displaystyle 8=\pi (4^{2}){\frac {dh}{dt}}}


8=16πdhdt{\displaystyle 8=16\pi {\frac {dh}{dt}}}


816π=dhdt{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{16\pi }}={\frac {dh}{dt}}}


12π=dhdt{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2\pi }}={\frac {dh}{dt}}}


, As the water pours into the cylinder at a rate of 8 cubic feet per minute, the rate of change of the height is 12π{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2\pi }}} feet per minute. Converting this to a more understandable rate, this is about 0.16 feet per minute, or almost 2 inches per minute.

Remember the formula for finding the perimeter of a triangle.,
Look at your triangle and determine the lengths of the three sides.,
Add the three side lengths together to find the perimeter.,
Remember to include the units in your final answer.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Triangle1," For a triangle with sides a, b and c, the perimeter P is defined as: P = a + b + c.


What this formula means in simpler terms is that to find the perimeter of a triangle, you just add together the lengths of each of its 3 sides.;
, In this example, the length of side a = 5, the length of side b = 5, and the length of side c = 5.


This particular example is called an equilateral triangle, because all three sides are of equal length. But remember that the perimeter formula is the same for any kind of triangle.

, In this example, 5 + 5 + 5 = 15. Therefore, P = 15.


In another example, where a = 4, b = 3, and c=5, the perimeter would be: P = 3 + 4 + 5, or 12.

, If the sides of the triangle are measured in centimeters, then your answer should also be in centimeters. If the sides are measured in terms of a variable like x, your answer should also be in terms of x.


In this example, the side lengths are each 5cm, so the correct value for the perimeter is 15cm.

Plug in infinity (∞) or negative infinity (-∞) into the equation.,
Simplify the equation to get a real answer.,
If there's a limit where x goes to infinity, an alternate method is to only consider the term with the highest power in both the numerator and the denominator, and ignore all the other terms, then use the simplified version of the limit to work with.",How to Calculate a Basic Limit2," Remember that any constant over an infinity in the denominator is equal to zero.

, Remember ∞/∞ is not an acceptable answer.


In this certain situation, putting an ∞ in for ""x"" would result in the answer being ∞/∞, which is not acceptable.
Therefore, the variable ""x"" was divided out of both the numerator and the denominator, which left the equation above.
It is then OK to plug in the infinity sign into the variable, which would result in 1 + 0 in the numerator, and 3 + 0 in the denominator, giving us a real answer of 1/3.

, Both methods should always yield the same value.

Understand basic uses of trigonometry in academia.,
Think about cycles in nature.,
Visualize how natural cycles could studied.",How to Learn Trigonometry2," Aside from studying trigonometry just for the love of trigonometry, mathematicians and scientists do apply these concepts. Trigonometry can be used to find the values for angles or line segments. You can also describe the any cyclical behaviors by graphing them as trigonometric functions.For example, the motion of a spring bouncing back and forth could be described by graphing it as a sine wave.

, Sometimes, people struggle to grasp abstract concepts in mathematics or science. If you realize that those concepts are present in the world around you, they often take on a new light. Look for things in your life that occur in cycles and try to relate them to trigonometry.The moon has a predictable cycle that is roughly 29.5 days long.

, Once you realize that nature is full of cycles, start thinking about exactly how you might study those cycles. Think of what a graph of such cycles would look like. From the graph, you could formulate an equation to describe the phenomenon you observed. This will give trigonometric functions meaning to help you understand their uses.Think about measuring the tide on a given beach. During high tide it would be at some height, and then recede until it reaches low tide. From low tide, the water would move up the beach until it again reached high tide. This cycle would continue endlessly, and could be graphed as a trigonometric function, such as a cosine wave.

Read the chapter.,
Keep a notebook.,
Work problems from the book.,
Bring your materials to class.",How to Learn Trigonometry3," Trigonometric concepts are often hard for some people to grasp the first time around. If you read the chapter before going over it in a classroom, you will be more familiar with the material. The more times you see the material, the more connections you will make as to how different concepts in trigonometry are related.This will also allow you to identify any concepts that you struggle with before class.

, Skimming through the book is better than nothing, but it isn’t the kind of in depth reading that will help you learn trigonometry. Keep detailed notes on the chapter you are reading. Remember that trigonometry is cumulative and the concepts build on each other, so having your notes from previous chapters can help you understand your current chapter.Also write down any questions that you want to ask the instructor.

, Some people visualize trigonometry well, but you also have to carry out the problems. To make sure that you really do understand the material, try working some problems before class. This way, if you have trouble, you’ll know exactly what you need help with in class.Most books have the answers to some problems in the back. This allows you to check your work.

, Bringing your notes and practice problems to class will give you a point of reference. This will refresh the things you understand, and remind you of any concepts you may need explained further. Be sure to clarify any questions that you listed during your reading.

Write in the same notebook.,
Make trigonometry your priority in class.,
Remain engaged in class.,
Follow up with more practice problems.",How to Learn Trigonometry4," Trigonometric concepts are all related. It is best practice to keep all of your notes in one place so that you can refer back to earlier notes. Designate a specific notebook or binder to your trigonometry studies.You can also keep practice problems in this book.

, Avoid using your class time to socialize or catch up on homework for another class. When you are in trigonometry class, you should be zeroed in on the lecture and practice problems. Write down any notes that the instructor puts on the board or otherwise indicates as important.

, Volunteer to solve problems at the board or share your answers to a practice problem. Ask questions if you don’t understand something. Keep communication as open and fluid as your instructor will allow. This will facilitate you learning and enjoying trigonometry.


If your instructor prefers to lecture mostly uninterrupted, you can save your questions for after class. Remember it is the instructor’s job to help you learn trigonometry, so don’t be shy.

, Complete any homework assigned. Homework problems are good indicators of test questions. Make sure that you understand each problem. If no homework is assigned, work problems from your book that reflect the concepts covered in the most recent lecture."

Remember what a right triangle is.,
Recall the Pythagorean Theorem.,
Look at your triangle, and label the sides ""a,"" ""b,"" and ""c"".,
Enter the side lengths that you know into the Pythagorean Theorem.,
Solve the equation to find the missing side length.,
Add up the lengths of the three side lengths to find the perimeter.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Triangle2," A right triangle is a triangle that has one right (90 degree) angle. The side of the triangle opposite the right angle is always the longest side, and it is called the hypotenuse. Right triangles show up frequently on math tests, and fortunately there is a very handy formula for finding the length of unknown sides!

, The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that for any right triangle with sides of length a and b, and hypotenuse of length c, a2 + b2 = c2., Remember that the longest side of the triangle is called the hypotenuse. It will be opposite the right angle and must be labeled c. Label the two shorter sides a and b. It doesn't really matter which is which, the math will turn out the same! 

, Remember that a2 + b2 = c2. Substitute the side lengths in for the corresponding letters in the equation.


If, for example, you know that side a = 3 and side b = 4, then plug those values into the formula as follows: 32 + 42 = c2.
If you know the length of side a = 6, and the hypotenuse c = 10, then you should set the equation up like so: 62 + b2 = 102.

, You will first need to square the known side lengths which means multiplying each value by itself (for example 32 = 3 * 3 = 9). If you are looking for the hypotenuse, simply add the two values together and find the square root of this number to find the length. If it is a side length you are missing, you must do a bit of easy subtraction, and then take the square root to get your side length.


In the first example, square the values in 32 + 42 = c2 and find that 25= c2. Then calculate the square root of 25 to find that c = 5.
In the second example, square the values in 62 + b2 = 102 to find that 36 + b2 = 100. Subtract 36 from each side to find that b2 = 64, then take the square root of 64 to find that b = 8.

, Recall that the perimeter P = a + b + c. Now that you know the lengths of sides a, b and c, you simply need to add the lengths together to find the perimeter.


In our first example,P = 3 + 4 + 5, or 12.
In our second example, P = 6 + 8 + 10, or 24.

Learn the Law of Cosines.,
Look at your triangle and assign variable letters to its components.,
Plug your information into the equation and solve for side c. You will first need to find the squares of a and b, and add them together.,
Use side length c to find the perimeter of the triangle.",How to Find the Perimeter of a Triangle3," The Law of Cosines allows you to solve any triangle when you know two side lengths and measurement of the angle between them. It works on any triangle, and is a very useful formula. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, with opposite angles A, B, and C: c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos(C)., The first side that you know should be labeled a, and the angle opposite it is A. The second side that you know should be labeled b; the angle opposite it is B. The angle that you know should be labeled C, and the third side, the one you need to solve in order to find the perimeter of the triangle, is side c.


For example, imagine a triangle with side lengths 10 and 12, and an angle between them of 97°. We will assign variables as follows: a = 10, b = 12, C = 97°.


, Then find the cosine of C using the cos function on your calculator, or an online cosine calculator.Multiply cos(C) by 2ab and subtract the product from the sum of a2 + b2. The result is c2. Find the square root of this value and you have the length of side c.
Using our example triangle:



c2 = 102 + 122 - 2 × 10 × 12 × cos(97).

c2 = 100 + 144 – (240 × -0.12187) (Round the cosine to 5 decimal places.)
c2 = 244 – (-29.25)

c2 = 244 + 29.25 (Carry the minus symbol through when cos(C) is negative!)
c2 = 273.25
c = 16.53

, Recall that Perimeter P = a + b + c, so all you need to do is add the length you just calculated for side c to the values you already had for a and b.


In our example: 10 + 12 + 16.53 = 38.53, the perimeter of our triangle!

;
, 


∫udv=uv−∫vdu{\displaystyle \int u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv-\int v{\mathrm {d} }u}


, We choose u=x{\displaystyle u=x} because its derivative of 1 is simpler than the derivative of ex,{\displaystyle e^{x},} which is only itself. That results in dv=exdx,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v=e^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x,} whose integral is trivial.


du=dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u={\mathrm {d} }x}


v=ex{\displaystyle v=e^{x}}

In general, integration of parts is a technique that aims to convert an integral into one that is simpler to integrate. If you see a product of two functions where one is a polynomial, then setting u{\displaystyle u} to be the polynomial will most likely be a good choice.

You can neglect the constant of integration when finding v,{\displaystyle v,} because it will drop out in the end. 


,


∫xexdx=xex−∫exdx{\displaystyle \int xe^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x=xe^{x}-\int e^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x}

The result was that our integral now consists of just one function - the exponential function. As ex{\displaystyle e^{x}} is its own antiderivative with a constant, evaluating it is much easier.


, Remember to add the constant of integration, as antiderivatives are not unique.


∫xexdx=xex−ex+C{\displaystyle \int xe^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x=xe^{x}-e^{x}+C}


, Definite integrals require evaluation at the boundaries. While the integral below looks like it has an integrand of just one function, the inverse tangent function, we can say that it is the product of inverse tangent and 1.

, Since the derivative of an inverse trig function is algebraic and therefore simpler, we set u=tan−1⁡x{\displaystyle u=\tan ^{-1}x} and dv=dx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v={\mathrm {d} }x.} This results in du=11+x2dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {1}{1+x^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x} and v=x.{\displaystyle v=x.}

, The numerator is proportional to the derivative of the denominator, so u-subbing is ideal.

Let u=1+x2.{\displaystyle u=1+x^{2}.} Then du=2xdx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=2x{\mathrm {d} }x.} Be careful in changing your boundaries.

, 


∫udv=uv−∫vdu{\displaystyle \int u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv-\int v{\mathrm {d} }u}


, As one of the functions is the exponential function, setting that as u{\displaystyle u} will get us nowhere. Instead, let u=cos⁡x{\displaystyle u=\cos x} and dv=exdx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v=e^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x.} What we find is that the second derivative of u{\displaystyle u} is simply the negative of itself. That is, d2dx2cos⁡x=−cos⁡x.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}\cos x=-\cos x.} This means that we need to integrate by parts twice to get an interesting result.

, In this problem, what we have found is that by performing integration by parts twice, the original integral came up in the work. Instead of performing integration by parts endlessly, which will get us nowhere, we can solve for it instead. Don't forget the constant of integration at the very end.


2∫excos⁡xdx=excos⁡x+exsin⁡x∫excos⁡xdx=12excos⁡x+12exsin⁡x+C{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}2\int e^{x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x&=e^{x}\cos x+e^{x}\sin x\\\int e^{x}\cos x{\mathrm {d} }x&={\frac {1}{2}}e^{x}\cos x+{\frac {1}{2}}e^{x}\sin x+C\end{aligned}}}


, We shall call this function G(x),{\displaystyle G(x),} where G{\displaystyle G} is any function that satisfies G′=g.{\displaystyle G^{\prime }=g.}
, Since this is a product of two functions, we use the product rule. Sharp minds will intuitively see the resulting integration by parts formula as closely related to the product rule, just as u-substitution is the counterpart to the chain rule. 


ddxfG=fG′+f′G=fg+f′G{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}fG&=fG^{\prime }+f^{\prime }G\\&=fg+f^{\prime }G\end{aligned}}}


, The above expression says that fG{\displaystyle fG} is the antiderivative of the right side, so we integrate both sides to recover the integral of the left side.


∫(fg+f′G)dx=fG{\displaystyle \int (fg+f^{\prime }G){\mathrm {d} }x=fG}


,


∫fgdx=fG−∫f′Gdx{\displaystyle \int fg{\mathrm {d} }x=fG-\int f^{\prime }G{\mathrm {d} }x}

The goal of integration by parts is seen in the expression above. We are integrating f′G{\displaystyle f^{\prime }G} instead of fg,{\displaystyle fg,} and if used correctly, this results in a simpler evaluation. 


, We let u=f,v=G,du=f′dx,dv=gdx.{\displaystyle u=f,\,v=G,\,{\mathrm {d} }u=f^{\prime }{\mathrm {d} }x,\,{\mathrm {d} }v=g{\mathrm {d} }x.}


∫udv=uv−∫vdu{\displaystyle \int u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv-\int v{\mathrm {d} }u}

In general, there is no systematic process by which we can make the integral easier to evaluate. However, it is often the case that we want a u{\displaystyle u} whose derivative is easier to manage, and a dv{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v} that can easily be integrated.

For definite integrals, it is easy to show that the formula holds when writing the boundaries for all three terms, though it is important to remember that the boundaries are limits on the variable x.{\displaystyle x.}

Know that π radians is equal to 180 degrees.,
Multiply the radians by 180/π to convert to degrees.,
Practice with a few examples.,
Remember that there's a difference between ""radians"" and ""π radians.""",How to Convert Radians to Degrees," Before you begin the conversion process, you have to know that π radians = 180°, which is equivalent to going halfway around a circle. This is important because you'll be using 180/π as a conversion metric. This is because 1π radians is equal to 180/π degrees.;
, It's that simple. Let's say you're working with π/12 radians. Then, you've got to multiply it by 180/π and simplify when necessary. Here's how you do it:


π/12 x 180/π =
180π/12π ÷ 12π/12π =
15°
π/12 radians = 15°

, If you really want to get the hang of it, then try converting from radians to degrees with a few more examples. Here are some other problems you can do:



Example 1: 1/3π radians = π/3 x 180/π = 180π/3π ÷ 3π/3π = 60°

Example 2: 7/4π radians = 7π/4 x 180/π = 1260π/4π ÷ 4π/4π = 315°

Example 3: 1/2π radians = π /2 x 180/π = 180π /2π ÷ 2π/2π = 90°

, If you say 2π radians or 2 radians, you are not using the same terms. As you know, 2π radians is equal to 360 degrees, but if you're working with 2 radians, then if you want to convert it to degrees, you will have to calculate 2 x 180/π. You will get 360/π, or 114.5°. This is a different answer because, if you're not working with π radians, the π does not cancel out in the equation and results in a different value.

, This is the first step in converting to parameter space.

, Recall that the area can be written in terms of the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors.

, The determinant above is the Jacobian determinant. A shorthand notation can be written as below, where we remember that we convert to parameter space as defined by the variables on the bottom. Should you end up with a negative determinant, neglect the negative sign - only the magnitude matters.


|∂(x,y)∂(u,v)|{\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}{\dfrac {\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)}}\end{vmatrix}}}


, The reason why this is more applicable is because normally, we would define our parameters in terms of the physical variables, but then have to solve for the physical variables in order to take partial derivatives. Recognizing that the determinant of an inverse is the multiplicative inverse of the determinant detJ−1=1detJ,{\displaystyle \det J^{-1}={\frac {1}{\det J}},} we can skip a step by taking the inverse Jacobian determinant first, and then finding its reciprocal to recover the actual determinant that we want.

Plotting this on a graph, we see that the domain is a rotated rectangle. Integrating over this domain by normal means would be rather tedious, but using Jacobian change of variables, this problem is trivial. 


, Notice that using our definition, we have changed the integrand to simply u.{\displaystyle u.}

Recall that the centroid is the mean of all the points of the region. The region is defined in such a way as to involve three separate integrals just to find the area. To find the centroid would mean to take several more integrals. This is obviously not the way to go, so we use Jacobians to convert this into an easier problem.

Write down the number of degrees you want to convert to radians.,
Multiply the number of degrees by π/180.,
Do the math.,
Simplify.,
Write down your answer.",How to Convert Degrees to Radians," Let's work with a few examples so you really get the concept down. Here are the examples you'll be working with:



Example 1: 120°

Example 2: 30°

Example 3: 225°;
, To understand why you have to do this, you should know that 180 degrees constitute π radians. Therefore, 1 degree is equivalent to (π/180) radians. Since you know this, all you have to do is multiply the number of degrees you're working with by π/180 to convert it to radian terms. You can remove the degree sign since your answer will be in radians anyway. Here's how to set it up:



Example 1: 120 x π/180

Example 2: 30 x π/180

Example 3: 225 x π/180

, Simply carry out the multiplication process, by multiplying the number of degrees by π/180. Think of it like multiplying two fractions: the first fraction has the number of degrees in the numerator and ""1"" in the denominator, and the second fraction has π in the numerator and 180 in the denominator. Here's how you do the math:



Example 1: 120 x π/180 = 120π/180

Example 2: 30 x π/180 = 30π/180

Example 3: 225 x π/180 = 225π/180

, Now, you've got to put each fraction in lowest terms to get your final answer. Find the largest number that can evenly divide into the numerator and denominator of each fraction and use it to simplify each fraction. The largest number for the first example is 60; for the second, it's 30, and for the third, it's 45. But you don't have to know that right away; you can just experiment by first trying to divide the numerator and denominator by 5, 2, 3, or whatever works. Here's how you do it:



Example 1: 120 x π/180 = 120π/180 ÷ 60/60 = 2/3π radians

Example 2: 30 x π/180 = 30π/180 ÷ 30/30 = 1/6π radians

Example 3: 225 x π/180 = 225π/180 ÷ 45/45 = 5/4π radians

, To be clear, you can write down what your original angle measure became when converted to radians. Then, you're all done! Here's what you do:



Example 1: 120° = 2/3π radians

Example 2: 30° = 1/6π radians

Example 3: 225° = 5/4π radians

Write out the problem.,
Add the numbers on the right.,
Carry any digit greater than 10 to the left.,
Add the next set of numbers.,
Repeat until you reach the end of the line.,
Write the final answer.",How to Double a Number1," For this method, you'll need to write out the problem as any other addition problem. Write the number twice, placing a plus sign in between.



Example: Find the double of 357.

Write the problem as you would write out any other addition problem: 357 + 357

;
, Add the right-hand digits of both written values together. Essentially, you are simply doubling the right-hand digit.



Example: For 357 + 357, the number on the right is 7.

7 + 7 = 14



, If the sum of the right-hand digits is 10 or greater, you will need to carry the value in the “tens” place position over to the next set of digits. Only write the number in the “ones” place position as part of your answer.



Example: In this problem, 14 is greater than 10, so the you must carry the 1 over to the next place setting. The 4 will be the right-most digit in your answer.

, Add the next set of digits together, moving to the left. If you carried over a “1” from the previous place setting, you should add that to the two digits, as well.



Example: For 357 + 357, the next digit to the left is 5.

Since you carried over 1 from the previous place setting, you must also add it to the doubled value of this place setting.
5 + 5 + 1 = 11



, Continue through the rest of the number in the same manner, working from right to left, until you reach the final set of digits on the left-hand side of the total value.



Example: Since 11 is greater than 10, you will need to carry the extra 1 over to the next place setting. The right-hand 1 will be the middle digit in your answer.

There is only one place setting left to deal with in this answer. You will need to add the values of this place setting together along with the 1 you carried over: 3 + 3 + 1 = 7
This 7 will be the left-most digit in your answer.



, If you haven't done so already, write the calculated sums from each place position side-by-side. This answer should be the doubled amount of your original number.



Example: The left-most digit is 7. The middle digit is 1. The right-most digit is 4. When written together, the answer is '714.

Therefore, the double of 357 is 714.

Double the left digit.,
Look at the second digit.,
Double the second digit.,
Repeat toward the right.,
Write it out.",How to Double a Number2," Look at the first digit of the number (the one on the left, with the highest place value). Mentally double that digit and write it down. The answer will be the first one or two digits of your final answer.



Example: Find the double of 872.

The left digit is 8.
The double of 8 is 16.



, If the second digit to the right is 5 or greater, you will need to add 1 to the value calculated in the previous step.


If the second digit is below 5, you do not need to add anything else to the previous value.
Doubling any digit between 5 and 9 will result in a two digit number, which makes this step necessary. Doubling and digit between 0 and 4 will result in a single digit number.

Example: The second digit in 872 is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, you need to add 1 to the sum of the previous place value.

16 + 1 = 17
This means that your final answer will begin with 17.



, Return to the second digit and double it. This value will be the next digit in your final answer.


If the value calculated in this step is two digits, ignore the digit in the tens place and only write down the digit in the ones place.

Example: The second digit of 872 is 7.

The double of 7 is 14.
Ignore the tens place (1) and only save the value of the ones place (4) for your final answer.
This 4 will appear in the middle of your final answer.



, Continue through the rest of the digits in the same manner, moving from left to right, until you double the final digit in the “ones” place value.



Example: For this problem, there is only one more place value to work with.

The final digit of 872 is 2. Since 2 is less than 5, you do not need to add anything more to the sum of the middle place value.
The double of 2 is 4. This will be the final digit in your answer.



, Write all of the calculated values of each place position side by side. This should be your final answer.



Example: The first part of the answer is 17. The middle digit is 4. The final digit is 4. When written together, that gives you an answer of 1744.

Therefore, the double of 872 is 1744.

Separate the number into pieces.,
Double each part.,
Add the pieces together.,
Write the answer.",How to Double a Number3," Partition or decompose the number into its separate place value pieces: ones, tens, hundreds, and so on. Write it out in extended form.



Example: Find the double of 453.

When broken apart into separate place values: 453 = 400 + 50 + 3



, Look at each partitioned portion and double it while separated.


To double values larger than those in the ones place position, double the non-zero digit, then follow that calculated value with the same number of zeroes.

Example: You will need to double 400, 50, and 3 separately.

Since the double of 4 is 8, the double of 400 is 800.
Since the double of 5 is 10, the double of 50 is 100.
The double of 3 is 6.



, Add the doubled values together to write the answer in its standard form.



Example: 800 + 100 + 6 = 906

, The answer you found by adding the doubled values together should be the doubled value of your original number, and your final answer.



Example: The double of 453 is 906.

Find the inflection point.",How to Find Inflection Points," To understand inflection points, you need to distinguish between these two. 

A concave down function is a function where no line segment that joins two points on its graph ever goes above the graph. Intuitively, the graph is shaped like a hill.

A concave up function, on the other hand, is a function where no line segment that joins two points on its graph ever goes below the graph. It is shaped like a U.

In the graph above, the red curve is concave up, while the green curve is concave down.

Functions in general have both concave up and concave down intervals. Inflection points exist when a function changes concavity. 
;
, A root of a function is the point where the function equals zero. In the graph above, we can see that the roots of the green parabola are at x=−1{\displaystyle x=-1} and x=3.{\displaystyle x=3.} These are the points at which the function intersects the x-axis.
, Before you can find an inflection point, you’ll need to find derivatives of your function. The derivatives of the basic functions can be found in any calculus text; you’ll need to learn them before you can move on to more complex tasks. First derivatives are denoted as f′(x){\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)} or dfdx.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}.}

Say you need to find the inflection point of the function below.


f(x)=x3+2x−1{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}+2x-1}



Use the power rule.


f′(x)=3x3−1+2x1−1=3x2+2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f^{\prime }(x)&=3x^{3-1}+2x^{1-1}\\&=3x^{2}+2\end{aligned}}} 




, The second derivative is the derivative of the derivative, and is denoted as f′′(x){\displaystyle f^{\prime \prime }(x)} or d2fdx2.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}f}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}.}


f′′(x)=(2)(3)x2−1=6x{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f^{\prime \prime }(x)&=(2)(3)x^{2-1}\\&=6x\end{aligned}}}


, Your answer will be a possible inflection point.


6x=0x=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}6x&=0\\x&=0\end{aligned}}}


, If the sign of the second derivative changes as you pass through the candidate inflection point, then there exists an inflection point. If the sign does not change, then there exists no inflection point.

Remember that you are looking for sign changes, not evaluating the value. In more complicated expressions, substitution may be undesirable, but careful attention to signs often nets the answer much more quickly. For example, instead of evaluating numbers immediately, we could instead look at certain terms and judge them to be positive or negative. 

In our example, f′′(x)=6x.{\displaystyle f^{\prime \prime }(x)=6x.} Then plugging a negative x{\displaystyle x} yields a negative f′′(x),{\displaystyle f^{\prime \prime }(x),} while plugging a positive x{\displaystyle x} yields a positive f′′(x).{\displaystyle f^{\prime \prime }(x).} Therefore, x=0{\displaystyle x=0} is an inflection point of the function f(x)=x3+2x−1.{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}+2x-1.} There was no need to actually evaluate for our chosen values.


, 


f(0)=(0)3+2(0)−1=−1.{\displaystyle f(0)=(0)^{3}+2(0)-1=-1.}


, The coordinate of the inflection point is denoted as (x,f(x)).{\displaystyle (x,f(x)).} In this case, (0,−1),{\displaystyle (0,-1),} as graphed above.

Evaluate.",How to Integrate," An integral ∫abf(x)dx{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x){\mathrm {d} }x} consists of four parts.

The ∫{\displaystyle \int } is the symbol for integration. It is actually an elongated S.

The function f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} is called the integrand when it is inside the integral.

The differential dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} intuitively is saying what variable you are integrating with respect to. Because (Riemann) integration is just a sum of infinitesimally thin rectangles with a height of f(x),{\displaystyle f(x),} we see that dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} refers to the width of those rectangles.

The letters a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the boundaries. An integral does not need to have boundaries. When this is the case, we say that we are dealing with an indefinite integral. If it does, then we are dealing with a definite integral.

Throughout this article, we will go over the process of finding antiderivatives of a function. An antiderivative is a function whose derivative is the original function we started with. 
;
, When we talk about integrals, we usually refer to Riemann integrals; in other words, summing up rectangles. Given a function f(x),{\displaystyle f(x),} a rectangle width of Δx,{\displaystyle \Delta x,} and an interval ,{\displaystyle ,} the area of the first rectangle is given by f(x1)Δx1,{\displaystyle f(x_{1})\Delta x_{1},} because it is just the base times the height (the value of the function). Similarly, the area of the second rectangle is f(x2)Δx2.{\displaystyle f(x_{2})\Delta x_{2}.} Generalizing, we say the area of the ith rectangle is f(xi)Δxi.{\displaystyle f(x_{i})\Delta x_{i}.} In summation notation, this can be represented in the following manner.


∑i=1nf(xi)Δxi{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i})\Delta x_{i}}

If this is the first time you have seen a summation symbol, it may look scary...but it's not complicated at all. All this is saying is that we are summing up the area of n{\displaystyle n} rectangles. (The variable i{\displaystyle i} is known as a dummy index.) However, as you can guess, the area of all the rectangles is bound to be slightly different from the true area. We solve this by sending the number of rectangles to infinity. As we increase the number of rectangles, the area of all the rectangles better approximates the area under the curve. That's what the diagram above shows (see the tips for what the graph in the middle shows). The limit as n→∞{\displaystyle n\to \infty } is what we define as the integral of the function f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} from a{\displaystyle a} to b.{\displaystyle b.}


∫abf(x)dx=limn→∞∑i=1nf(xi)Δxi{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x){\mathrm {d} }x=\lim _{n\to \infty }\sum _{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i})\Delta x_{i}}



Of course, this limit has to exist in order for the integral to have any meaning. If such a limit does not exist on the interval, then we say that f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} does not have an integral over the interval .{\displaystyle .} In this article (and in almost every physical application), we only deal with functions where these integrals exist. 


, One of the most common mistakes people can make is forgetting to add the constant of integration. The reason why this is needed is because antiderivatives are not unique. In fact, a function can have an infinite number of antiderivatives. They are allowed because the derivative of a constant is 0. 
,, This is the same power rule for derivatives, but in reverse. We increase the power by 1, and divide by the new power. Don't forget to add the constant of integration C.{\displaystyle C.}


∫xndx=xn+1n+1+C{\displaystyle \int x^{n}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {x^{n+1}}{n+1}}+C}

To verify that this power rule holds, differentiate the antiderivative to recover the original function.

The power rule holds for all functions of this form with degree n{\displaystyle n} except when n=−1.{\displaystyle n=-1.} We will see why later.


, Integration is a linear operator, which means that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals, and the coefficient of each term can be factored out, like so:


∫(axn+bxm)dx=a∫xndx+b∫xmdx{\displaystyle \int (ax^{n}+bx^{m}){\mathrm {d} }x=a\int x^{n}{\mathrm {d} }x+b\int x^{m}{\mathrm {d} }x}

This should be familiar because the derivative is also a linear operator; the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.

Linearity does not apply just for integrals of polynomials. It applies to any integral where the integrand is a sum of two or more terms.


, This is a polynomial, so using the property of linearity and the power rule, the antiderivative can easily be computed. To find the antiderivative of a constant, remember that x0=1,{\displaystyle x^{0}=1,} so the constant is really just the coefficient of x0.{\displaystyle x^{0}.}


∫(x4+2x3−5x2−1)dx=15x5+24x4−53x3−x+C{\displaystyle \int (x^{4}+2x^{3}-5x^{2}-1){\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{5}}x^{5}+{\frac {2}{4}}x^{4}-{\frac {5}{3}}x^{3}-x+C}


, This may seem like a function that defies our rules, but a moment's glance reveals that we can separate the fraction into three fractions and apply linearity and the power rule to find the antiderivative.


∫f(x)dx=∫2x2+3x−1x1/3dx=∫(2x2x1/3+3xx1/3−1x1/3)dx=∫(2x5/3+3x2/3−x−1/3)dx=2⋅38x8/3+3⋅35x5/3−32x2/3+C=34x8/3+95x5/3−32x2/3+C{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int f(x){\mathrm {d} }x&=\int {\frac {2x^{2}+3x-1}{x^{1/3}}}{\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\int \left({\frac {2x^{2}}{x^{1/3}}}+{\frac {3x}{x^{1/3}}}-{\frac {1}{x^{1/3}}}\right){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\int (2x^{5/3}+3x^{2/3}-x^{-1/3}){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=2\cdot {\frac {3}{8}}x^{8/3}+3\cdot {\frac {3}{5}}x^{5/3}-{\frac {3}{2}}x^{2/3}+C\\&={\frac {3}{4}}x^{8/3}+{\frac {9}{5}}x^{5/3}-{\frac {3}{2}}x^{2/3}+C\end{aligned}}}

The common theme is that you must perform whatever manipulations in order to get the integral into a polynomial. From there, integration is easy. Judging whether the integral is easy enough to brute-force, or requires some algebraic manipulation first, is where the skill lies. 


, Unlike the integration process in part 2, we also have bounds to evaluate at. 


∫23x2dx{\displaystyle \int _{2}^{3}x^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, This theorem is in two parts. The first part was stated in the first sentence of this article: integration is the inverse operation of differentiation, so integrating and then differentiating a function recovers the original function. The second part is stated below. 

Let F(x){\displaystyle F(x)} be an antiderivative of f(x).{\displaystyle f(x).} Then ∫abf(x)dx=F(b)−F(a).{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x){\mathrm {d} }x=F(b)-F(a).}

This theorem is incredibly useful because it simplifies the integral and means that the definite integral is completely determined by just the values on its boundaries. There is no need to sum up rectangles anymore to compute integrals. All we need to do now is to find antiderivatives, and evaluate at the bounds!


, Now that we have the fundamental theorem as a tool for solving integrals, we can easily calculate the value of the integral as defined above.


∫23x2dx=13x3|23=13(3)3−13(2)3=193{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{2}^{3}x^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x&={\frac {1}{3}}x^{3}{\Bigg |}_{2}^{3}\\&={\frac {1}{3}}(3)^{3}-{\frac {1}{3}}(2)^{3}\\&={\frac {19}{3}}\end{aligned}}}

Again, the fundamental theorem of calculus does not just apply to functions like f(x)=x2.{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}.} The fundamental theorem can be used to integrate any function, as long as you can find an antiderivative.


, Let's see what happens here.


∫32x2dx=13x3|32=13(2)3−13(3)3=−193{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{3}^{2}x^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x&={\frac {1}{3}}x^{3}{\Bigg |}_{3}^{2}\\&={\frac {1}{3}}(2)^{3}-{\frac {1}{3}}(3)^{3}\\&=-{\frac {19}{3}}\end{aligned}}}

We just obtained the negative of the answer we got before. This illustrates an important property of definite integrals. Swapping the boundaries negates the integral.


∫baf(x)dx=−∫abf(x)dx{\displaystyle \int _{b}^{a}f(x){\mathrm {d} }x=-\int _{a}^{b}f(x){\mathrm {d} }x}




, In the following steps, we list commonly encountered functions like the exponential and trigonometric functions. All are widely encountered, so knowing what their antiderivatives are is crucial to building up integrating skills. Remember that indefinite integrals have an extra C,{\displaystyle C,} because the derivative of a constant is 0.


∫exdx=ex+C{\displaystyle \int e^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x=e^{x}+C}


∫axdx=axln⁡a+C{\displaystyle \int a^{x}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {a^{x}}{\ln a}}+C}


, These are just the derivatives applied backwards and should be familiar. The sines and cosines are encountered far more often and should definitely be memorized. Hyperbolic analogues are similarly found, though they are encountered less often.


∫sin⁡xdx=−cos⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \sin x{\mathrm {d} }x=-\cos x+C}


∫cos⁡xdx=sin⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \cos x{\mathrm {d} }x=\sin x+C}


∫sec2⁡xdx=tan⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \sec ^{2}x{\mathrm {d} }x=\tan x+C}


∫csc2⁡xdx=−cot⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \csc ^{2}x{\mathrm {d} }x=-\cot x+C}


∫sec⁡xtan⁡xdx=sec⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \sec x\tan x{\mathrm {d} }x=\sec x+C}


∫csc⁡xcot⁡xdx=−csc⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int \csc x\cot x{\mathrm {d} }x=-\csc x+C}


, These should not really be considered an exercise in ""memorization."" As long as you are familiar with the derivatives, then most of these antiderivatives should be familiar as well.


∫11−x2dx=sin−1⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\sin ^{-1}x+C}


∫−11−x2dx=cos−1⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {-1}{\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\cos ^{-1}x+C}


∫11+x2dx=tan−1⁡x+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {1}{1+x^{2}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\tan ^{-1}x+C}


, Previously, we said that the function f(x)=x−1,{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{-1},} or f(x)=1x,{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{x}},} was an exception to the power rule. The reason is because the antiderivative of this function is the logarithmic function.


∫1xdx=ln⁡|x|+C{\displaystyle \int {\frac {1}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\ln |x|+C}

(Sometimes, authors like to put the dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} in the numerator of the fraction, so it reads like ∫dxx.{\displaystyle \int {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x}{x}}.} Be aware of this notation.)

The reason for the absolute value in the logarithm function is subtle, and requires a more thorough understanding of real analysis in order to fully answer. For now, we will just live with the fact that the domains become the same when the absolute value bars are added.


, Our function is given as f(x)=2cos⁡x+tan2⁡x−6.{\displaystyle f(x)=2\cos x+\tan ^{2}x-6.} Here, we don't know the antiderivative of tan2⁡x,{\displaystyle \tan ^{2}x,} but we can use a trigonometric identity to rewrite the integrand in terms of a function which we know the antiderivative of - namely, 1+tan2⁡x=sec2⁡x.{\displaystyle 1+\tan ^{2}x=\sec ^{2}x.}


∫π/4π/3f(x)dx=∫π/4π/3(2cos⁡x+tan2⁡x−6)dx=∫π/4π/3(2cos⁡x+sec2⁡x−7)dx=(2sin⁡x+tan⁡x−7x)|π/4π/3=(2sinπ3+tanπ3−7π3)−(2sinπ4+tanπ4−7π4)=23−2−1−7π12{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\pi /4}^{\pi /3}f(x){\mathrm {d} }x&=\int _{\pi /4}^{\pi /3}(2\cos x+\tan ^{2}x-6){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\int _{\pi /4}^{\pi /3}(2\cos x+\sec ^{2}x-7){\mathrm {d} }x\\&=(2\sin x+\tan x-7x){\Big |}_{\pi /4}^{\pi /3}\\&=\left(2\sin {\frac {\pi }{3}}+\tan {\frac {\pi }{3}}-{\frac {7\pi }{3}}\right)-\left(2\sin {\frac {\pi }{4}}+\tan {\frac {\pi }{4}}-{\frac {7\pi }{4}}\right)\\&=2{\sqrt {3}}-{\sqrt {2}}-1-{\frac {7\pi }{12}}\end{aligned}}}

If you need a decimal approximation, you can use a calculator. Here, 23−2−1−7π12≈−0.7827.{\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {3}}-{\sqrt {2}}-1-{\frac {7\pi }{12}}\approx -0.7827.}


, Even functions are functions with the property that f(−x)=f(x).{\displaystyle f(-x)=f(x).} In other words, you should be able to replace every x{\displaystyle x} with a −x{\displaystyle -x} and get the same function. An example of an even function is x2.{\displaystyle x^{2}.} Another example is the cosine function. All even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. 


∫−11(cos⁡x+x4)dx{\displaystyle \int _{-1}^{1}(\cos x+x^{4}){\mathrm {d} }x}

Our integrand is even. We can immediately integrate by using the fundamental theorem of calculus, but if we look more carefully, we see that the bounds are symmetric about x=0.{\displaystyle x=0.} That means that the integral from -1 to 0 is going to give us the same value as the integral from 0 to 1. So what we can do is we can change the bounds to 0 and 1 and factor out a 2.


∫−11(cos⁡x+x4)dx=2∫01(cos⁡x+x4)dx{\displaystyle \int _{-1}^{1}(\cos x+x^{4}){\mathrm {d} }x=2\int _{0}^{1}(\cos x+x^{4}){\mathrm {d} }x}



It might not seem like much to do this, but we will immediately see that our work is simplified. After finding the antiderivative, notice that we only need to evaluate it at x=1.{\displaystyle x=1.} The antiderivative at x=0{\displaystyle x=0} will not contribute to the integral. 


2∫01(cos⁡x+x4)dx=2sin⁡1+25{\displaystyle 2\int _{0}^{1}(\cos x+x^{4}){\mathrm {d} }x=2\sin 1+{\frac {2}{5}}}



In general, whenever you see an even function with symmetric boundaries, you should perform this simplification in order to make less arithmetic mistakes.


∫−aaf(x)dx=2∫0af(x)dx,  f(x) even{\displaystyle \int _{-a}^{a}f(x){\mathrm {d} }x=2\int _{0}^{a}f(x){\mathrm {d} }x,\ \ f(x)\ {\mathrm {even} }}




, Odd functions are functions with the property that f(−x)=−f(x).{\displaystyle f(-x)=-f(x).} In other words, you should be able to replace every x{\displaystyle x} with a −x{\displaystyle -x} and then get the negative of the original function. An example of an odd function is x3.{\displaystyle x^{3}.} The sine and tangent functions are also odd. All odd functions are symmetric about the origin (imagine rotating the negative part of the function by 180° - it will then stack on top of the positive part of the function). If the bounds are symmetric, then the integral will be 0.


∫−π/2π/2(2x3+2sin⁡x)dx{\displaystyle \int _{-\pi /2}^{\pi /2}(2x^{3}+2\sin x){\mathrm {d} }x}

We could evaluate this integral directly...or we can recognize that our integrand is odd. Furthermore, the boundaries are symmetric about the origin. Therefore, our integral is 0. Why is this the case? It is because the antiderivative is even. Even functions have the property that f(−x)=f(x),{\displaystyle f(-x)=f(x),} so when we evaluate at the bounds −a{\displaystyle -a} and a,{\displaystyle a,} then F(−a)=F(a){\displaystyle F(-a)=F(a)} immediately implies that F(a)−F(−a)=0.{\displaystyle F(a)-F(-a)=0.}


∫−π/2π/2(2x3+2sin⁡x)dx=0{\displaystyle \int _{-\pi /2}^{\pi /2}(2x^{3}+2\sin x){\mathrm {d} }x=0}



The properties of these functions are very potent in simplifying the integrals, but the boundaries must be symmetric. Otherwise, we will need to evaluate the old way.


∫−aaf(x)dx=0,  f(x) odd{\displaystyle \int _{-a}^{a}f(x){\mathrm {d} }x=0,\ \ f(x)\ {\mathrm {odd} }}




, U-substitution is a technique that changes variables with the hope of obtaining an easier integral. As we will see, it is the analogue of the chain rule for derivatives. 
, What do we do when the exponent has a coefficient in it? We use u-substitution to change variables. It turns out that these kinds of u-subs are the easiest to perform, and they are done so often, the u-sub is often skipped. Nevertheless, we will show the entire process.


∫eaxdx{\displaystyle \int e^{ax}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We choose u=ax{\displaystyle u=ax} so that we get a eu{\displaystyle e^{u}} in the integrand, a function whose antiderivative we are familiar with - itself. Then we must replace dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} with du,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u,} but we need to make sure that we are keeping track of our terms. In this example, du=adx,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=a{\mathrm {d} }x,} so we need to divide the whole integral by a{\displaystyle a} to compensate.


∫eaxdx=1a∫eudu{\displaystyle \int e^{ax}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{a}}\int e^{u}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, For indefinite integrals, you must rewrite in terms of the original variable.


∫eaxdx=1aeax+C{\displaystyle \int e^{ax}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{a}}e^{ax}+C}


, This is a definite integral, so we need to evaluate the antiderivative at the boundaries. We will also see that this u-sub is a case where you need to ""back-substitute."" 


∫01x2x+3dx{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x{\sqrt {2x+3}}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, Make sure to change your boundaries as well according to your substitution. We choose u=2x+3{\displaystyle u=2x+3} so that we simplify the square root. Then du=2dx,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u=2{\mathrm {d} }x,} and the bounds then go from 3 to 5. However, after replacing the dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} with a du,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u,} we still have an x{\displaystyle x} in the integrand.


∫01x2x+3dx=12∫35xudu{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}x{\sqrt {2x+3}}{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {1}{2}}\int _{3}^{5}x{\sqrt {u}}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, This is the back-substitution that we were talking about earlier. Our u-sub did not get rid of all the x{\displaystyle x} terms in the integrand, so we need to back-sub to get rid of it. We find that x=u−32.{\displaystyle x={\frac {u-3}{2}}.} After simplifying, we get the following.


12∫35xudu=14∫35(u−3)udu{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\int _{3}^{5}x{\sqrt {u}}{\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {1}{4}}\int _{3}^{5}(u-3){\sqrt {u}}{\mathrm {d} }u}


, An advantage when dealing with definite integrals is that you do not need to rewrite the antiderivative in terms of the original variable before evaluating. Doing so would introduce needless complications. 


14∫35(u−3)udu=14∫35(u3/2−3u1/2)du=14(25u5/2−3⋅23u3/2)|35=14(25(5)5/2−2⋅(5)3/2−25(3)5/2+2⋅(3)3/2)=14(−65⋅33/2+2⋅33/2)=144533/2=335{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {1}{4}}\int _{3}^{5}(u-3){\sqrt {u}}{\mathrm {d} }u&={\frac {1}{4}}\int _{3}^{5}(u^{3/2}-3u^{1/2}){\mathrm {d} }u\\&={\frac {1}{4}}\left({\frac {2}{5}}u^{5/2}-3\cdot {\frac {2}{3}}u^{3/2}\right){\Bigg |}_{3}^{5}\\&={\frac {1}{4}}\left({\frac {2}{5}}(5)^{5/2}-2\cdot (5)^{3/2}-{\frac {2}{5}}(3)^{5/2}+2\cdot (3)^{3/2}\right)\\&={\frac {1}{4}}\left(-{\frac {6}{5}}\cdot 3^{3/2}+2\cdot 3^{3/2}\right)\\&={\frac {1}{4}}{\frac {4}{5}}3^{3/2}\\&={\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\end{aligned}}}


, The integration by parts formula is given below. The main goal of integration by parts is to integrate the product of two functions - hence, it is the analogue of the product rule for derivatives. This technique simplifies the integral into one that is hopefully easier to evaluate.


∫udv=uv−∫vdu{\displaystyle \int u{\mathrm {d} }v=uv-\int v{\mathrm {d} }u}


, We know that the derivative of ln⁡x{\displaystyle \ln x} is 1x,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{x}},} but not the antiderivative. It turns out that this integral is a simple application of integration by parts. 


∫ln⁡xdx{\displaystyle \int \ln x{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We choose u=ln⁡x{\displaystyle u=\ln x} because the derivative is algebraic and therefore easier to manipulate. Then dv=dx.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }v={\mathrm {d} }x.} Therefore, du=1xdx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }u={\frac {1}{x}}{\mathrm {d} }x} and v=x.{\displaystyle v=x.} Substituting all of these into the formula, we obtain the following.


∫ln⁡xdx=xln⁡x−∫dx{\displaystyle \int \ln x{\mathrm {d} }x=x\ln x-\int {\mathrm {d} }x}

We converted the integral of a logarithm into the integral of 1, which is trivial to evaluate.

See the article on calculating the Laplace transform of the natural logarithm.,
Evaluate the Laplace transform of the (unnormalized) sinc function.",How to Calculate the Laplace Transform of a Function," Conceptually, calculating a Laplace transform of a function is extremely easy. We will use the example function f(t)=eat{\displaystyle f(t)=e^{at}} where a{\displaystyle a} is a (complex) constant such that Re⁡(s)<Re⁡(a).{\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (s)<\operatorname {Re} (a).}


L{eat}=∫0∞eate−stdt{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{e^{at}\}=\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{at}e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t}
;
, In our example, our evaluation is extremely simple, and we need only use the fundamental theorem of calculus. In other more complicated cases, techniques like integration of parts or differentiation under the integral may be used. Our constraint that Re⁡(s)<Re⁡(a){\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (s)<\operatorname {Re} (a)} means that the integrand converges, i.e. goes to 0 as t→∞.{\displaystyle t\to \infty .}


L{eat}=∫0∞e(a−s)tdt=e(a−s)ta−s|0∞=1s−a{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {L}}\{e^{at}\}&=\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{(a-s)t}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&={\frac {e^{(a-s)t}}{a-s}}{\Bigg |}_{0}^{\infty }\\&={\frac {1}{s-a}}\end{aligned}}}

Notice that this gives us two Laplace transforms for ""free"": the sine and cosine functions, if we consider the related function eiat{\displaystyle e^{iat}} via Euler's formula. Then in the denominator, we would have s−ia,{\displaystyle s-ia,} and all that remains is to take the real and imaginary parts of this result. We could also just evaluate directly, but that would take a bit more work.


L{cos⁡at}=Re(1s−ia)=ss2+a2{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{\cos at\}=\operatorname {Re} \left({\frac {1}{s-ia}}\right)={\frac {s}{s^{2}+a^{2}}}}


L{sin⁡at}=Im(1s−ia)=as2+a2{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{\sin at\}=\operatorname {Im} \left({\frac {1}{s-ia}}\right)={\frac {a}{s^{2}+a^{2}}}}




, Before moving on, we must determine the transform of the power function, for the property of linearity allows us to determine the transform for all polynomials. The power function is the function tn,{\displaystyle t^{n},} where n{\displaystyle n} is any positive integer. We can use integration by parts to determine a recursive rule.


L{tn}=∫0∞tne−stdt=nsL{tn−1}{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{t^{n}\}=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{n}e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t={\frac {n}{s}}{\mathcal {L}}\{t^{n-1}\}}

Our result is not written explicitly, but from substituting a few values of n,{\displaystyle n,} a clear pattern emerges (try it yourself), from which we can determine the following result.


L{tn}=n!sn+1{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{t^{n}\}={\frac {n!}{s^{n+1}}}}



We can also determine Laplace transforms of fractional powers by using the Gamma function. This allows us to find transforms of functions like f(t)=t.{\displaystyle f(t)={\sqrt {t}}.}


L{tn}=Γ(n+1)sn+1{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{t^{n}\}={\frac {\Gamma (n+1)}{s^{n+1}}}}


L{t1/2}=Γ(3/2)s3/2=π2ss{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{t^{1/2}\}={\frac {\Gamma (3/2)}{s^{3/2}}}={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2s{\sqrt {s}}}}}



Although functions with fractional powers must contain branch cuts (recall that for any complex numbers z{\displaystyle z} and α,{\displaystyle \alpha ,} we rewrite zα{\displaystyle z^{\alpha }} as eαLog⁡z{\displaystyle e^{\alpha \operatorname {Log} z}}), we can always define them such that the branch cuts lie in the left half-plane in order to avoid analyticity issues. 


, The results in the previous section have allowed us to take a glimpse at some interesting properties of the Laplace transform. The Laplace transform of functions like cosine, sine, and the exponential function seem to be simpler than the transform of the power function. We will see that multiplication by eat{\displaystyle e^{at}} in the t-domain corresponds to a shift in the s-domain.


L{eatf(t)}=∫0∞f(t)e−(s−a)tdt=F(s−a){\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{e^{at}f(t)\}=\int _{0}^{\infty }f(t)e^{-(s-a)t}{\mathrm {d} }t=F(s-a)}

This property immediately allows us to find transforms of functions like f(t)=e3tsin⁡2t{\displaystyle f(t)=e^{3t}\sin 2t} without having to directly evaluate the integral.


L{e3tsin⁡2t}=2(s−3)2+4{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{e^{3t}\sin 2t\}={\frac {2}{(s-3)^{2}+4}}}




, Let's consider multiplying by t{\displaystyle t} first. Then from the definition, we can differentiate under the integral to obtain a surprisingly clean result.


L{tf(t)}=∫0∞tf(t)e−stdt=−∫0∞f(t)∂∂se−stdt=−dds∫0∞f(t)e−stdt=−dFds{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {L}}\{tf(t)\}&=\int _{0}^{\infty }tf(t)e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=-\int _{0}^{\infty }f(t){\frac {\partial }{\partial s}}e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=-{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }s}}\int _{0}^{\infty }f(t)e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=-{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }F}{{\mathrm {d} }s}}\end{aligned}}}

By repeating this process, we arrive at the general result.


L{tnf(t)}=(−1)ndnFdsn{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{t^{n}f(t)\}=(-1)^{n}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{n}F}{{\mathrm {d} }s^{n}}}}



The exchange of the integral and the differentiation operators takes a bit of justification as far as rigor is concerned, but we will not justify it here except to note that the operation is allowed as long as our final answer makes sense. A bit of comfort can be sought in the fact that s{\displaystyle s} and t{\displaystyle t} are variables that are independent of one another.

Of course, using this property, Laplace transforms of functions like t2cos⁡2t{\displaystyle t^{2}\cos 2t} are easily found without having to repeatedly use integration by parts.


L{t2cos⁡2t}=d2ds2ss2+4=2s3−24s(s2+4)3{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{t^{2}\cos 2t\}={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}}{{\mathrm {d} }s^{2}}}{\frac {s}{s^{2}+4}}={\frac {2s^{3}-24s}{(s^{2}+4)^{3}}}}




, Using the definition, we can also easily determine this transform using a u-substitution.


L{f(at)}=∫0∞f(at)e−stdt,  u=at=1a∫0∞f(u)e−su/adu=1aF(sa){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {L}}\{f(at)\}&=\int _{0}^{\infty }f(at)e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t,\ \ u=at\\&={\frac {1}{a}}\int _{0}^{\infty }f(u)e^{-su/a}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&={\frac {1}{a}}F\left({\frac {s}{a}}\right)\end{aligned}}}

Previously, we found the Laplace transforms of sin⁡at{\displaystyle \sin at} and cos⁡at{\displaystyle \cos at} from the exponential function directly. We can use this property to arrive at the same result, starting from finding the real and imaginary parts of L{eit}=1s−i{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{e^{it}\}={\frac {1}{s-i}}}.


, Unlike our previous results that saved a bit of labor from integration by parts, we must use integration by parts here.


L{f′(t)}=∫0∞f′(t)e−stdt,  u=e−st, dv=f′(t)dt=f(t)e−st|0∞+s∫0∞f(t)e−stdt=sF(s)−f(0){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {L}}\{f^{\prime }(t)\}&=\int _{0}^{\infty }f^{\prime }(t)e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t,\ \ u=e^{-st},\ {\mathrm {d} }v=f^{\prime }(t){\mathrm {d} }t\\&=f(t)e^{-st}{\Big |}_{0}^{\infty }+s\int _{0}^{\infty }f(t)e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=sF(s)-f(0)\end{aligned}}}

Because the second derivative comes up in many physical applications, we list the Laplace transform of a second derivative as well.


L{f′′(t)}=s2F(s)−sf(0)−f′(0){\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{f^{\prime \prime }(t)\}=s^{2}F(s)-sf(0)-f^{\prime }(0)}



In general, it turns out that the Laplace transform of the nth derivative is given by the following result. This result is important in solving differential equations via Laplace transforms.


L{f(n)(t)}=snF(s)−∑k=0n−1sn−k−1f(k)(0){\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{f^{(n)}(t)\}=s^{n}F(s)-\sum _{k=0}^{n-1}s^{n-k-1}f^{(k)}(0)}




, A periodic function is a function that satisfies the property f(t)=f(t+nT),{\displaystyle f(t)=f(t+nT),} where T{\displaystyle T} is the period of the function and n{\displaystyle n} is a positive integer. Periodic functions show up in many applications in signal processing and electrical engineering. Using a bit of manipulation, we arrive at the following answer.


L{f(t)}=∫0∞f(t)e−stdt=∑n=0∞∫nT(n+1)Tf(t)e−stdt=∑n=0∞∫0Tf(t+nT)e−s(t+nT)dt=∑n=0∞e−snT∫0Tf(t)e−stdt=11−e−sT∫0Tf(t)e−stdt{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {L}}\{f(t)\}&=\int _{0}^{\infty }f(t)e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\int _{nT}^{(n+1)T}f(t)e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\int _{0}^{T}f(t+nT)e^{-s(t+nT)}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }e^{-snT}\int _{0}^{T}f(t)e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t\\&={\frac {1}{1-e^{-sT}}}\int _{0}^{T}f(t)e^{-st}{\mathrm {d} }t\end{aligned}}}

We see that the Laplace transform of a periodic function is related to the Laplace transform of one cycle of the function.


, This integral cannot be evaluated using the fundamental theorem of calculus because the antiderivative cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. The article discusses a technique using the Gamma function and its various series expansions to evaluate the natural log and its higher powers. The presence of the Euler-Mascheroni constant γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is enough to hint that the integral must be evaluated using series methods.


L{ln⁡t}=−γ+ln⁡ss{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\{\ln t\}=-{\frac {\gamma +\ln s}{s}}}


, The sinc function sinc⁡(t)=sin⁡tt{\displaystyle \operatorname {sinc} (t)={\frac {\sin t}{t}}} is a function widely encountered in signal processing, and may be recognizable from differential equations as equivalent to the zeroth-order spherical Bessel function of the first kind j0(x).{\displaystyle j_{0}(x).} The Laplace transform of this function also cannot be computed in the standard way. We resort to transforming term-by-term, permissible because the individual terms are power functions and therefore their transforms certainly converge on the prescribed interval.

We begin by writing out the Taylor series of this function.


sin⁡tt=∑n=0∞(−1)nt2n(2n+1)!{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin t}{t}}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{n}t^{2n}}{(2n+1)!}}}



Now we simply transform using the Laplace transform of the power function that we know. The factorials cancel out, and after staring at our expression, we recognize the Taylor series of the inverse tangent, the alternating series that looks like the Taylor series for the sine function but without the factorials.


L{sin⁡tt}=∑n=0∞(−1)n(2n)!(2n+1)!1s2n+1=∑n=0∞(−1)n2n+11s2n+1=tan−11s{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {L}}\left\{{\frac {\sin t}{t}}\right\}&=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{n}(2n)!}{(2n+1)!}}{\frac {1}{s^{2n+1}}}\\&=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{n}}{2n+1}}{\frac {1}{s^{2n+1}}}\\&=\tan ^{-1}{\frac {1}{s}}\end{aligned}}}

Check to make sure that the fraction you are trying to integrate is proper.,
Factor the polynomials in the denominator.,
Separate the fraction that you wish to decompose in to multiple fractions.",How to Integrate by Partial Fractions1," A proper fraction has a larger power in the denominator than in the numerator. If the power of the numerator is larger than or equal to the power of the denominator, it is improper and must be divided using long division.


∫x3−4x−10x2−x−6dx{\displaystyle \int {\frac {x^{3}-4x-10}{x^{2}-x-6}}{\mathrm {d} }x}

In this example, the fraction is indeed improper because the power of the numerator, 3, is larger than the power of the denominator, 2. Therefore, long division must be used.


x3−4x−10x2−x−6=(x+1)+3x−4x2−x−6{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{3}-4x-10}{x^{2}-x-6}}=(x+1)+{\frac {3x-4}{x^{2}-x-6}}}



The fraction is now proper. We can now split the integral into two parts. One of them containing the x+1{\displaystyle x+1} is easily evaluated, but we will evaluate at the end.


∫(x+1)dx+∫3x−4x2−x−6dx{\displaystyle \int (x+1){\mathrm {d} }x+\int {\frac {3x-4}{x^{2}-x-6}}{\mathrm {d} }x}




,


3x−4x2−x−6=3x−4(x−3)(x+2){\displaystyle {\frac {3x-4}{x^{2}-x-6}}={\frac {3x-4}{(x-3)(x+2)}}}


, The number of fractions in decomposition should equal the number of factors of x.{\displaystyle x.} The numerators of these decomposed fractions should be represented with coefficients.


3x−4(x−3)(x+2)=Ax−3+Bx+2{\displaystyle {\frac {3x-4}{(x-3)(x+2)}}={\frac {A}{x-3}}+{\frac {B}{x+2}}}

If a factor of x{\displaystyle x} in the denominator has a power higher than 1, then the coefficients in the numerator should reflect this higher power. For example, a term in the denominator like x2+1{\displaystyle x^{2}+1} that cannot be factored further can be represented with the term Ax+B{\displaystyle Ax+B} in the numerator.


Ax+Bx2+1+Cx−3{\displaystyle {\frac {Ax+B}{x^{2}+1}}+{\frac {C}{x-3}}}



Roots of multiplicity more than 1 should be represented where both the root and its decreasing powers are written out, like so. An example of this below concerns a root of multiplicity 3. Notice that three fractions are written, where (x+2)3, (x+2)2,{\displaystyle (x+2)^{3},\ (x+2)^{2},} and (x+2){\displaystyle (x+2)} are all written out.


x−1(x+2)3=A(x+2)3+B(x+2)2+Cx+2{\displaystyle {\frac {x-1}{(x+2)^{3}}}={\frac {A}{(x+2)^{3}}}+{\frac {B}{(x+2)^{2}}}+{\frac {C}{x+2}}}



Let's return to the original example. We have now split up the fraction into its constituent parts. We can proceed in two different directions here. One method is to multiply everything out and solve a system of equations. Another, more efficient method is to recognize which terms go to zero and directly solve for the coefficients. This method will be outlined in the Substitution section.

dydx=y∗(1+ln⁡x){\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=y*(1+\ln x)}


,
Replace the original value of y.",How to Differentiate Exponential Functions," Begin with a basic exponential function using a variable as the base. By calculating the derivative of the general function in this way, you can use the solution as model for a full family of similar functions.y=ax{\displaystyle y=a^{x}}
;
, You need to manipulate the function to help find a standard derivative in terms of the variable x{\displaystyle x}. This begins by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, as follows:


ln⁡y=ln⁡ax{\displaystyle \ln y=\ln a^{x}}


, Using the rules of logarithms, this equation can be simplified to eliminate the exponent. The exponent within the logarithm function can be removed as a multiple in front of the logarithm, as follows:


ln⁡y=xln⁡a{\displaystyle \ln y=x\ln a}


, The next step is to differentiate each side with respect to x{\displaystyle x}. Because a{\displaystyle a} is a constant, then ln⁡a{\displaystyle \ln a} is also a constant. The derivative of x{\displaystyle x} simplifies to 1, and the term disappears. The steps are as follows:


ln⁡y=xln⁡a{\displaystyle \ln y=x\ln a}


ddxln⁡y=ddxxln⁡a{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\ln y={\frac {d}{dx}}x\ln a}


1ydydx=ln⁡addxx{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{y}}{\frac {dy}{dx}}=\ln a{\frac {d}{dx}}x}


1ydydx=ln⁡a∗1{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{y}}{\frac {dy}{dx}}=\ln a*1}


1ydydx=ln⁡a{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{y}}{\frac {dy}{dx}}=\ln a}


, Multiply both sides by y to isolate the derivative. Using basic steps of algebra, multiply both sides of this equation by y{\displaystyle y}. This will isolate the derivative of y{\displaystyle y} on the left side of the equation. Then recall that y=ax{\displaystyle y=a^{x}}, so substitute that value on the right side of the equation. The steps look like this:


1ydydx=ln⁡a{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{y}}{\frac {dy}{dx}}=\ln a}


dydx=yln⁡a{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=y\ln a}


dydx=axln⁡a{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=a^{x}\ln a}


, Recalling that the original function was the exponential function y=ax{\displaystyle y=a^{x}}, this solution shows that the derivative of the general exponential function is axln⁡a{\displaystyle a^{x}\ln a}.

This can be expanded for any value of a{\displaystyle a}, as in the following examples:


ddx2x=2xln⁡2{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}2^{x}=2^{x}\ln 2}


ddx3x=3xln⁡3{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}3^{x}=3^{x}\ln 3}


ddx10x=10xln⁡10{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}10^{x}=10^{x}\ln 10}




, The prior section showed how to differentiate the general case of an exponential function with any constant as the base. Next, select the special case where the base is the exponential constant e{\displaystyle e}.e{\displaystyle e} is the mathematical constant that is approximately equal to 2.718.

For this derivation, select the special function y=ex{\displaystyle y=e^{x}}.


, Recall, from the prior section, that the derivative of a general exponential function ax{\displaystyle a^{x}} is axln⁡a{\displaystyle a^{x}\ln a}. Apply this result to the special function ex{\displaystyle e^{x}} as follows:y=ex{\displaystyle y=e^{x}}


dydx=ddxex{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {d}{dx}}e^{x}}


dydx=exln⁡e{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=e^{x}\ln e}


, Recall that the natural logarithm is based on the special constant e{\displaystyle e}. Therefore, the natural logarithm of e{\displaystyle e} is just 1. This simplifies the derivative result as follows:dydx=exln⁡e{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=e^{x}\ln e}


dydx=ex∗1{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=e^{x}*1}


dydx=ex{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=e^{x}}


, This proof leads to the special case that the derivative of the function ex{\displaystyle e^{x}} is that very function itself. Thus:ddxex=ex{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}e^{x}=e^{x}}


, For this example, you will find the general derivative of functions that have e{\displaystyle e} raised to an exponent, when the exponent itself is a function of x{\displaystyle x}.As an example, consider the function y=e2x+3{\displaystyle y=e^{2x+3}}.


, This solution is going to involve the chain rule of derivatives. Recall that the chain rule applies when you have one function, u(x){\displaystyle u(x)} nested inside another, f(x){\displaystyle f(x)}, as you have here. The chain rule states:dydx=dydu∗dudx{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {dy}{du}}*{\frac {du}{dx}}}

In summary, you will define the exponent as a separate function u(x){\displaystyle u(x)}. 

For this example, the exponent is the nested function u(x){\displaystyle u(x)}. Thus, for this example:


y=eu{\displaystyle y=e^{u}}, and


u=2x+3{\displaystyle u=2x+3}




, The chain rule requires you to find the derivatives of both functions y{\displaystyle y} and u{\displaystyle u}. The resulting derivative is then the product of those two.The two separate derivatives are:


dydu=ddxeu=eu{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{du}}={\frac {d}{dx}}e^{u}=e^{u}}. (Remember that the derivative of ex{\displaystyle e^{x}} is ex{\displaystyle e^{x}}.)


dudx=ddx(2x+3)=2{\displaystyle {\frac {du}{dx}}={\frac {d}{dx}}(2x+3)=2}



After finding the two separate derivatives, combine them to find the derivative of the original function:


dydx=dydu∗dudx{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {dy}{du}}*{\frac {du}{dx}}}


ddxe2x+3=e(2x+3)∗2=2e(2x+3){\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}e^{2x+3}=e^{(2x+3)}*2=2e^{(2x+3)}}




, Select another example, y=esin⁡x{\displaystyle y=e^{\sin x}}.Define the nested function. In this case, u=sin⁡x{\displaystyle u=\sin x}.

Find the derivatives of the functions y{\displaystyle y} and u{\displaystyle u}.


dydu=eu{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{du}}=e^{u}}


dudx=cos⁡x{\displaystyle {\frac {du}{dx}}=\cos x}



Combine using the chain rule:


y=esin⁡x{\displaystyle y=e^{\sin x}}


dydx=dydu∗dudx{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {dy}{du}}*{\frac {du}{dx}}}


ddxesin⁡x=eu∗cos⁡x=esin⁡xcos⁡x{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}e^{\sin x}=e^{u}*\cos x=e^{\sin x}\cos x}




, For this special example, sometimes called the “power tower,” choose the function such that:y=xx{\displaystyle y=x^{x}}


, As before, the solution here begins with the natural logarithm of each side of the equation:ln⁡y=ln⁡(xx){\displaystyle \ln y=\ln(x^{x})}


ln⁡y=xln⁡x{\displaystyle \ln y=x\ln x}


, On the right side of this equation, you will need to apply the product rule of derivatives. Recall that the product rule states that if y=f(x)∗g(x){\displaystyle y=f(x)*g(x)}, then y′=f∗g′+f′∗g{\displaystyle y^{\prime }=f*g^{\prime }+f^{\prime }*g}.ln⁡y=xln⁡x{\displaystyle \ln y=x\ln x}


1ydydx=x∗1x+1∗ln⁡x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{y}}{\frac {dy}{dx}}=x*{\frac {1}{x}}+1*\ln x}


1ydydx=1+ln⁡x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{y}}{\frac {dy}{dx}}=1+\ln x}


,, Recall from the first step that the function is y=xx{\displaystyle y=x^{x}}. Replacing this term in place of y{\displaystyle y} is the last step to find the derivative.dydx=y∗(1+ln⁡x){\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=y*(1+\ln x)}


dydx=xx(1+ln⁡x){\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=x^{x}(1+\ln x)}


ddxxx=xx+xxln⁡x{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}x^{x}=x^{x}+x^{x}\ln x}

Arrive at the answer.",How to Calculate Divergence and Curl," Divergence is a measure of source or sink at a particular point. – In other words, how much is flowing into or out of a point. Hence, it is only defined for vector fields and outputs a scalar. Below is an example of a field with a positive divergence.

The divergence is recognized by div{\displaystyle \operatorname {div} } or ∇⋅{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot }, where the dot signifies the similarity to taking a dot product.

, If the vector field F{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }} is given in cylindrical (ρ,ϕ,z){\displaystyle (\rho ,\phi ,z)} or spherical coordinates (r,θ,ϕ){\displaystyle (r,\theta ,\phi )} (where θ{\displaystyle \theta } is the polar angle), then the divergence does not have a simple form.

As you can see, we have mapped from a vector field to a scalar field. 


, The curl, defined for vector fields, is, intuitively, the amount of circulation at any point. The operator outputs another vector field. A whirlpool in real life consists of water acting like a vector field with a nonzero curl. Above is an example of a field with negative curl (because it's rotating clockwise).

The curl is recognized by curl{\displaystyle \operatorname {curl} } or ∇×{\displaystyle \nabla \times }, where the times symbol signifies the similarity of taking a cross product.


, The curl of a function is similar to the cross product of two vectors, hence why the curl operator is denoted with a ∇×.{\displaystyle \nabla \times .} As before, this mnemonic only works if F{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }} is defined in Cartesian coordinates.

f(x,y)=x3+x2y−2y3+6y{\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{3}+x^{2}y-2y^{3}+6y}
;
, Recall that in two dimensions, the gradient ∇f=(∂f∂x,∂f∂y).{\displaystyle \nabla f=\left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}},{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}\right).}


∂f∂x=3x2+2xy=0{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}=3x^{2}+2xy=0}


∂f∂y=x2−6y2+6=0{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}=x^{2}-6y^{2}+6=0}


, Generally, we will need to work with both components of the gradient to do this.

Let's start with the first component to find values of x.{\displaystyle x.} We can immediately factor out an x,{\displaystyle x,} which gets us x=0.{\displaystyle x=0.}  The quantity in parentheses can also be 0, but that only gets x{\displaystyle x} in terms of y.{\displaystyle y.}


3x2+2xy=0x(3x+2y)=0x=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}3x^{2}+2xy&=0\\x(3x+2y)&=0\\x&=0\end{aligned}}}


3x+2y=0x=−23y{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}3&x+2y=0\\&x=-{\frac {2}{3}}y\end{aligned}}}



Next, we move to the second component to find corresponding values of y{\displaystyle y} for the two values of x.{\displaystyle x.}


x=0:{\displaystyle x=0:}


6=6y2y=±1{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}6&=6y^{2}\\y&=\pm 1\end{aligned}}}




x=−23y:{\displaystyle x=-{\frac {2}{3}}y:}


49y2−6y2+6=0(6−49)y2=6y2=2725y=±335{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {4}{9}}y^{2}-6y^{2}+6&=0\\\left(6-{\frac {4}{9}}\right)y^{2}&=6\\y^{2}&={\frac {27}{25}}\\y&=\pm {\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\end{aligned}}}





We've found all possible values for y.{\displaystyle y.} Substituting y{\displaystyle y} only for the values that we got using the relation x=−23y,{\displaystyle x=-{\frac {2}{3}}y,} we obtain x=∓235{\displaystyle x=\mp {\frac {2{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}} (note the signs). 

Therefore, the four critical points are (0,±1), (∓235,±335).{\displaystyle (0,\pm 1),\ \left(\mp {\frac {2{\sqrt {3}}}{5}},\pm {\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\right).} These are only candidates for extrema, however.


, This matrix is a square matrix of second derivatives. In two dimensions, the matrix is as below.


H=(∂2f∂x2∂2f∂x∂y∂2f∂y∂x∂2f∂y2){\displaystyle H={\begin{pmatrix}{\dfrac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}}&{\dfrac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x\partial y}}\\{\dfrac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial y\partial x}}&{\dfrac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial y^{2}}}\end{pmatrix}}}


, Note that Clairaut's theorem guarantees that mixed partials commute (for continuous functions), so in two dimensions, the off-diagonal elements of the Hessian are the same. See the tips for another reason why this must be true.


∂2f∂x2=6x+2y{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}}=6x+2y}


∂2f∂x∂y=∂2f∂y∂x=2x{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x\partial y}}={\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial y\partial x}}=2x}


∂2f∂y2=−12y{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial y^{2}}}=-12y}


H=(6x+2y2x2x−12y){\displaystyle H={\begin{pmatrix}6x+2y&2x\\2x&-12y\end{pmatrix}}}


, If detH>0{\displaystyle \det H>0} (positive definite), then the point is either a maximum or a minimum. From an intuitive perspective, second partial derivatives of both components have the same sign. On the other hand, if detH<0{\displaystyle \det H<0} (negative definite), then the point is a saddle. Second partial derivatives of the components have opposite signs, so the point is not an extremum. Finally, if detH=0{\displaystyle \det H=0} (indefinite), then the second derivative test is inconclusive, and the point could be any of the three. See the tips for why this is the case. 

Let's substitute in the (0,±1){\displaystyle (0,\pm 1)} critical points. Since we are only interested in the sign of the determinant, and not the values of the elements themselves, we can clearly see that both points results in a negative determinant. This means that (0,±1){\displaystyle (0,\pm 1)} are both saddle points. We do not need to go further for these two points.


|±200∓12|<0{\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}\pm 2&0\\0&\mp 12\end{vmatrix}}<0}



Now let's check the (∓235,±335){\displaystyle \left(\mp {\frac {2{\sqrt {3}}}{5}},\pm {\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\right)} points.


|−635−435−435−3635|=35(216−16)>0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\begin{vmatrix}-{\frac {6{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}&-{\frac {4{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\\-{\frac {4{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}&-{\frac {36{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\end{vmatrix}}&={\frac {\sqrt {3}}{5}}(216-16)\\&>0\end{aligned}}}


|6354354353635|=35(216−16)>0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\begin{vmatrix}{\frac {6{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}&{\frac {4{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\\{\frac {4{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}&{\frac {36{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\end{vmatrix}}&={\frac {\sqrt {3}}{5}}(216-16)\\&>0\end{aligned}}}



Both of these points have positive Hessians.


, For candidate extrema, we still have to figure out whether the points are maxima or minima. In that case, we check the trace - the sum of the diagonal elements of H{\displaystyle H}. If tr⁡H>0,{\displaystyle \operatorname {tr} H>0,} then the point is a local minimum. If tr⁡H<0,{\displaystyle \operatorname {tr} H<0,} then the point is a local maximum.

From above, we can clearly see that tr⁡H(−235,335)<0,{\displaystyle \operatorname {tr} H\left(-{\frac {2{\sqrt {3}}}{5}},{\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\right)<0,} and therefore, (−235,335){\displaystyle \left(-{\frac {2{\sqrt {3}}}{5}},{\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\right)} is a local maximum.

Similarly, tr⁡H(235,−335)>0,{\displaystyle \operatorname {tr} H\left({\frac {2{\sqrt {3}}}{5}},-{\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\right)>0,} so (235,−335){\displaystyle \left({\frac {2{\sqrt {3}}}{5}},-{\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}}{5}}\right)} is a local minimum.


, For open domains, this step is not needed. However, since our domain is closed, extrema can occur on the boundaries. Although this becomes a single-variable extrema test, it is a tedious process for even the simplest type of domain - a rectangular domain - and for more complex domains, it can get quite complicated. The reason is because we need to take four derivatives corresponding to each side of the rectangle, set all of them to 0, and solve for variables. 

Let's check the right side of the rectangle first, corresponding to (1,y).{\displaystyle (1,y).}


f(1,y)=−2y3+7y+1dfdy=−6y2+7=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f(1,y)&=-2y^{3}+7y+1\\{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }f}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}&=-6y^{2}+7=0\end{aligned}}}


y=±76{\displaystyle y=\pm {\sqrt {\frac {7}{6}}}}

The critical points are therefore (1,±76).{\displaystyle \left(1,\pm {\sqrt {\frac {7}{6}}}\right).} Doing single-variable second derivative tests on both of these points, we find that (1,76){\displaystyle \left(1,{\sqrt {\frac {7}{6}}}\right)} is a local maximum and (1,−76){\displaystyle \left(1,-{\sqrt {\frac {7}{6}}}\right)} is a local minimum.



The other three sides are done in the same fashion. In doing so, we net the critical points below. Beware that you must discard all points found outside the domain.


(0,2),{\displaystyle (0,2),} local minimum


(−1,76),{\displaystyle \left(-1,{\sqrt {\frac {7}{6}}}\right),} local maximum


(−1,−76),{\displaystyle \left(-1,-{\sqrt {\frac {7}{6}}}\right),} local minimum


(0,−2),{\displaystyle (0,-2),} local maximum




, The four corners of the rectangular boundary must also be considered, just as how the two endpoints of a domain in single-variable calculus must be considered. Every extrema inside the domain and on the boundary of the domain, with the addition of the four corners, must be plugged into the function to determine global extrema. Below, we list the locations of the global maximum and minimum. They have values of f≈±6.041,{\displaystyle f\approx \pm 6.041,} respectively. Notice that neither of these global extrema were located inside the domain, but on the boundaries, which demonstrates the importance of identifying closed vs. open domains.

Global maximum: (1,76){\displaystyle \left(1,{\sqrt {\frac {7}{6}}}\right)}

Global minimum: (−1,−76){\displaystyle \left(-1,-{\sqrt {\frac {7}{6}}}\right)}

Above is a visualization of the function that we were working with. We can clearly see the locations of the saddle points and the global extrema labeled in red, as well as the critical points inside the domain and on the boundaries.

Compare several different maps of the world.",How to Become a Geography Master1," Though the study of geography is about more than just maps, it can be helpful to have a visual reference. Head to your local library or your school library and look for world maps in color and as large as possible. You may also be able to find a world atlas, which will likely have smaller images of different regions or areas of the world.It may also be helpful to have access to a world globe that has up to date names and locations.
You can also find world maps online, including 3D maps and maps where you can click to zoom in and get a closer look at certain locations or areas.;
, To become a geography master, you must first remember that geography is about more than just maps and cartography. In fact, to become proficient in geography, you will need to cover five fundamental themes:Regions: You should know the different regions on the Earth as well as how these regions form and change over time.
Location: You will need to be aware of where people and places are located on the Earth’s surface.
Place: You will need to note the physical and human characteristics that distinguish one place from another as well as what makes a place special or unique.
Relationships within places: You should be aware of how human interaction shapes the characteristics of the people and the environment.
Movement: You will need to know how movement on the Earth, from people to products to information, affects the characteristics of places.

, Start by looking at the names given to places in the world, such as the regions of the world (Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Oceania), the seven continents (Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America), and the four named oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic). You should think about how these regions were formed and how they changed over time.


You may want to look at 3D reenactments of Pangea, where geologists have shown how the world was broken into different regions over time through continental drift.You should also consider how the regions of the world are broken into continents. You may want to look at the official list of cities in each region of the world to get a better sense of each region., One of the most basic elements of geography is locations on the Earth. Every place on the map has a “global address,"" which tells you exactly where it is located. Note the two numbers in the global address; one number is for latitude and one number is for longitude. You can use latitude and longitude to find any place in the world and note its absolute location.Latitude and longitude is mapped out using the grid system, with latitude indicating a place’s location on a horizontal axis and longitude noting a place’s location on a vertical axis. There are also directions assigned to each number based on their location in the world, such as north, south, east, or west. Being aware of how to identify a place’s global address will allow you to get a better sense of where it is exactly in the world and find it easily on a map.
For example, you may note that your hometown of San Juan in Puerto Rico is at a latitude of 18° 27' N and a longitude of 66° 6' W. You may also note that your new home in New York City, NY is at 40° 42' N / 74° 0' W. You can then use this information to determine how much distance you and your family traveled on a map from your old home to your new home.

, Geography explores what distinguishes one area from another area. You should consider what makes one location unique or different from another location. This could be its proximity to another larger city or area as well as its proximity to the sun. The location may also have environmental attributes that make it unique, such as a distinct landscape or a certain climate.You may want to use two areas as an example and work through the differences between the two areas. You can use your hometown and a neighboring town or a town that is on the opposite side of the globe. Consider the climate and the landscape of each location. You should also think about the language spoken by the people who live in each location and how they interact with their environment.
For example, maybe you contrast your hometown of San Juan to your new home in New York City. The climate of San Juan is tropical, so it is usually humid and wet, with little to no dry season. In contrast, New York City is a subtropical climate but it is prone to freezing and snow in the winter months. San Juan is within a tropical rainforest, with a landscape of wetlands, but it is also located on the north coast and considered the country’s most important sea port. New York City is a port city as well but it is densely populated and urban, with only a few major green spaces.

, Another aspect of geography is looking at how humans influence their environment and how the environment influences the activities of people. You should also consider how the environment was changed to accommodate the movement of people, products and/or information. These kinds of changes are important for understanding how the geography of a location shifted and why it has shifted.The Panama Canal, for example, was built across a narrow strip of land in Central America. It was built as a shipping lane between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This was done because it made it easier to move goods back and forth between South America and other areas of the world. The Canal also shifted the environment of that area and affected the geography of that region.

, To get a better perspective on how geography is determined, you should look at several different maps of the world and compare them. This will help you better understand why locations are placed in a certain area on maps and how other elements like politics, class, wealth, and race have all affected how maps display the world.A map made by a European cartographer, for example, may always feature Europe prominently and place other regions as secondary. Many of the maps used in schools show the Eurocentric map, but scholars have started to flip around these maps to show how we can view the world map in different ways. An upside down Eurocentric map will show the East as the top of the map, with China, Indonesia, and Australia in the center of the map.You may also want to look at maps that showcase or highlight different areas of the world based on certain guidelines or distinctions. For example, a map may show where people live based on their economic status, or the major shipping routes during the colonial era."

The Mercator Projection is a mathematical projection that stretches out area to an infinite factor at the poles. While this projection displays areas near the equator accurately, there is an extreme amount of distortion near the poles. It is recommended to draw from this projection as the United States sits below the 50°N latitude where distortion gets really high.
The Winkel Triple Projection is a compromise projection designed to view the entire world with minimal distortion. This is not a good projection to draw from as the longitude of the USA is too far from the Prime Meridian to have an accurate drawing.
The Albers conic equal-area projection is a projection designed to conserve land area and shape. This is one of the best maps to draw from as it gives an accurate shape of the United States, and is most familiar with the general public. Just remember that the grid lines are not perfectly horizontal or vertical.;
, The four are political, physical, thematic, and cartograms. For now, you do not have to worry about cartograms.


Political maps will include:

Borders
Names of cities and capitals and location of them
Roads (major highways)


Physical maps will include:

Geographic data (mountains, valleys, waterfalls, rivers, etc.)
Elevation (usually denoted in color - green being low, brown high) - sometimes, a legend, or key, is used.
Landmarks


Thematic maps will be different. Instead of the usual thing, thematic maps depend on special characteristics, such as vegetation, oil consumption, urban density, climate differences, etc. A legend is going to be needed, as the map will almost certainly be colored to differentiate different areas.

, An example is the highest mountain in that state.

, Maps of the United States on the Internet is a fine source, instead of having to buy it.

, The more you zoom into the USA, the more details you will have to fill in. This is very important for drawing the USA as a whole, because even a minor blemish or streak here and there can significantly impact shape.

, While some states are literally just rectangles (e.g. Wyoming and Colorado), you can't forget states such as Maryland and West Virginia. Thus, it would be reasonable to practice tracing some of these states first, then put on the main map. A table of land area and a map of the state is useful.

, You don't have to fill in every necessary detail, but just a generalization of what the state will look like. This would be better than to start blindly, than to have a generalization. Since starting at the nooks and crannies right away usually would distort most maps, it is not recommended to start along that route.

, This does not mean that you draw the USA over and over again. It also does not mean to erase it over and over again and draw it. Rather, divide the places you are having trouble with and analyze the detail. Some examples are coastlines and rivers. Although not needed, it may be helpful to take notes about what goes here and there and such.


When you draw thematic maps, do not draw any artificial islands, oil rigs locations, or similar things, unless it is specified in your legend. Unnecessary information can confuse the reader, even in maps - not just books.
It is good if you plot or find out routes of major rivers that impact on state shapes. Some examples are the Mississippi, Missouri, Colorado and the two Red Rivers (Oklahoma/Texas and North Dakota/Minnesota). Since rivers impact shapes of the USA, especially in the eastern region, it significantly helps improve shape and reduces distortion.
Remember about Alaska and Hawaii. Although technically not in the Lower 48, they are still part of the USA, and thus needs to be included in your map. Many versions of maps made by computers have Alaska and Hawaii at the lower left corner of the paper, where Mexico shares its border with the USA. You may also wish to put them on a separate sheet of paper.

, A regular #2 pencil is fine, but serious sketchers may use a sketchers kit with 10 different pencils of all shades. This should include the following:


Color - very important for drawing maps of all kinds. On a political map, it is wise to choose colors that contrast with each other, and to not color in two bordering states with one color. That way, it will reduce confusion.
All features of the physical map - explained above. Only do this if you are drawing a physical map.

It is possible to color in a hybrid of political and physical. Colored pencils prevail over other methods of coloring as the map will be crowded. This will require borders, cities and capitals, and physical features. Color from the physical, not political map, will be used.


Thematic map: the data of your choice with a legend and color accordingly. Even though you will have to research on the internet or find out data from books, it is still a brilliant achievement to have drawn the USA, instead of copying and pasting.
A marker (dark colors preferred) - this is to clarify borders and to make it stand out. Without the marker, contrast would be low.

3x−4=Ax+2A+Bx−3B=(A+B)x+(2A−3B){\displaystyle 3x-4=Ax+2A+Bx-3B=(A+B)x+(2A-3B)}


, Because both sides are equal, that means that the coefficients of the x{\displaystyle x} terms are equal. We obtain a system of equations, where the number of equations depends on the degree of the denominator that you started out with. 


A+B=32A−3B=−4{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A+B&=3\\2A-3B&=-4\end{aligned}}}

Differentiate again and plug in x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2} to obtain C{\displaystyle C}.,
Plug the coefficients into the decomposed fractions and integrate.",How to Integrate by Partial Fractions3," Notice that the term with B{\displaystyle B} in it goes to 0, but A{\displaystyle A} doesn't. Furthermore, multiplying everything by that factor makes sure that we don't get any division by 0 problems.


3x−4(x−3)(x+2)=Ax−3+Bx+2{\displaystyle {\frac {3x-4}{(x-3)(x+2)}}={\frac {A}{x-3}}+{\frac {B}{x+2}}}

A=3(3)−4(3)+2=1{\displaystyle A={\frac {3(3)-4}{(3)+2}}=1}

This is a much more efficient method of solving for the coefficients as long as we think about which terms get sent to 0. Technically, when substituting these values, we are taking limits. But since our functions are easy to work with (polynomials), we don't need to worry about tricky discontinuity issues.


, This solves for B.{\displaystyle B.} Generally, we multiply by the factor and plug in the value of the root. That solves for the coefficient of the fraction whose denominator has that factor.

, We use the previous example of a function whose factors in the denominator have multiplicity 3, but our numerator is a bit different.


∫x2−4x+9(x+2)3dx=∫(A(x+2)3+B(x+2)2+Cx+2)dx{\displaystyle \int {\frac {x^{2}-4x+9}{(x+2)^{3}}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int \left({\frac {A}{(x+2)^{3}}}+{\frac {B}{(x+2)^{2}}}+{\frac {C}{x+2}}\right){\mathrm {d} }x}


, This immediately gets us A{\displaystyle A} if we plug in x=−2.{\displaystyle x=-2.}


x2−4x+9=A+B(x+2)+C(x+2)2{\displaystyle x^{2}-4x+9=A+B(x+2)+C(x+2)^{2}}


A=(−2)2−4(−2)+9=21{\displaystyle A=(-2)^{2}-4(-2)+9=21}

However, we find that B{\displaystyle B} and C{\displaystyle C} cannot be obtained directly. 


,

Let's start with where we are.


x2−4x+9=A+B(x+2)+C(x+2)2{\displaystyle x^{2}-4x+9=A+B(x+2)+C(x+2)^{2}}



We see that the largest term containing a B{\displaystyle B} is a term with an x.{\displaystyle x.} If we differentiate both sides, we know by the power rule that all that is left will be a constant. Meanwhile, A{\displaystyle A} goes away because that is already a constant. What does C{\displaystyle C} do? We can do the derivative for C,{\displaystyle C,} or we can recognize that, whatever it is, there will still be an (x+2){\displaystyle (x+2)} in the derivative, so after we plug in x=−2,{\displaystyle x=-2,} the term with C{\displaystyle C} vanishes as well.


2x−4=B+2C(x+2){\displaystyle 2x-4=B+2C(x+2)}


B=2(−2)−4=−8{\displaystyle B=2(-2)-4=-8}




, Differentiating twice sends both A{\displaystyle A} and B{\displaystyle B} to 0, while only C{\displaystyle C} is left over. Be careful with the coefficient, though. 


2=2C→C=1{\displaystyle 2=2C\to C=1}

Avoid going over the test with others.",How to Ace a Math Test," If you aren't listening to the teachings of the lesson, how will you possibly pass your test? That's why it's important to pay attention to the math instructor when he or she is talking. To pay attention, remove all distracting items from your desk; this includes iPads, laptops, a note from a friend or any juicy reading you're trying to catch up on. Also don't talk to other friends next to you. If your friends do talk to you, tell them not to, and if they carry on, just ask the teacher to move to a new seat away from them, temporarily. Look at the professor or teacher and listen attentively. If you need to be looking at the board, be sure that you are.


If you're at a spot where you can't see, hear, or concentrate, ask your instructor or teacher if you may move to a different seat (or just shift if permission isn't required).

Take notes. Writing notes is very important because they will serve as a recapping pathway to help you study for the test. Use lined paper and a pencil, and write down any key information that either the teacher or instructor is saying or writes on the board. Remember, you'll be looking at your notes to study, so write clearly and neatly. Write any practice problems if you think they'll be helpful.

Participate. Don't you hate it when you get called on and didn't know the answer? If you paid attention, you might have, but sometimes, you just don't know the answer. Try to participate in class. It'll help you understand the information, and it will show your math instructor that you understand the problem and can get involved.
Know that it's okay to get an answer wrong, so give it your best guess; it's better to show enthusiasm than to be perfectly right each time.;
, Everybody, even the smartest people, ask questions. Remember the Chinese saying if you feel stupid: ""People who ask a question are stupid for five minutes; people who never ask a question are stupid for a lifetime."" Speak up, and don't be afraid.


In actual fact, there are no stupid questions, only stupid answers.
Ask your teacher or instructor in class or a lecture, or privately after class, if you think you'll be embarrassed.

If you still don't get it, see your teacher or instructor after math class, during lunch, or after school to discuss the problems. It's their job to help you get it.



, Almost everybody despises homework, but it's assigned for a reason: to help you understand the lesson by coming to grips with the information on your own terms. When your have homework to do, write it right away in your agenda book to make sure you won't forget it. Remember to bring it home, and if you need your book for homework, take it home.


Ask your teacher or instructor if you can get the math book online so you won't have to bring it home; this is becoming more commonplace now.
When you do your homework, get comfortable but not too comfortable, remove distractions such as electronic devices, and be in a well-lit room. Try to be in a quiet place where you can always be alone. If you need to, put on some soft music in the background, which can help some people with work.
Always follow the directions, and check your work. If you're stuck on a problem, go back to it later, or ask a sibling/parent/friend/classmate for help. For short answers or word problems, write with labels and complete sentences.

, The study rules apply to homework, as far as your study space goes. Studying requires concentration, so don't think you can get away with studying while doing anything else. Gather all your materials needed to study, which could be your notes, math book, a study guide, and/or homework.


For math vocab, try making flash cards and looking over the words and their definitions.






Try some practice problems on the internet or in your math book to solve.
Focus the most on what you need help with, if you already know the rest.
Since repetition is very important in math, make sure you keep doing problems until they stick in your head.
Try studying with a buddy by having them check your answers and quiz you on math vocab. You could email answers back and forth if you're not physically together.
Include fun. Math can be fun as well. Pretend you're a contestant on a game show and have to answer math questions. Have a friend come round to do math homework together. Then flip flashcards and have you say the correct answers before another friend.
Be aware that there are many methods to studying, so find yours and go at a pace that works for you. Remember to study at your level. If you push too hard, you'll get tired and confused. Start easy, then gradually get more difficult on the problems.

, While it's great to study, you shouldn't be staying up all night doing it! Sleep matters too, so make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep (or get the amount of sleep you personally need within the 6-9 hour sleep range).


Sleep is a necessary part of remembering information long term; the material a student studies must be ""locked in"" by a period of sleep. After a certain period of time with no sleep, no new information can be retained.

, It will keep you focused on what you need to do on the test.

, While you should eat a well-balanced breakfast every day, it's especially important to eat breakfast the day of your math test, or before any test, so that your energy-hungry brain gets the energy needed to think straight. Eating before the tests will ensure that you won't be hungry, and you can focus on passing the test. Don't eat too much or you'll feel drowsy and sick. A well balanced breakfast that will keep you focused for the test contains the following:


Protein-Protein is great for the brain. Have some oatmeal or cheese slices in your breakfast.
Water - Drink water before and after the test so you'll be hydrated.
Fruit - Fruits are some of the best brain foods, especially bananas! Snack up on blueberries, which contain lots of powerful nutrients.
Iron and Vitamin B - These vitamins and minerals will weep you physically and mentally strong. Cereal, eggs, and whole grains (like toast) will be a big help.

, Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth slowly three times.


Get comfortable in your chair (but not too comfortable), close your eyes, and just focus on your breathing for a couple of seconds. If you need to, during the test, change positions to become more comfortable, and find a position in which you will do your best and focus.
Remove any possible distractions, such as a book or highlighter on your desk.
Don't think about any fear, just stay positive and calm. Promise yourself that you will do your best on this test, and know that, whatever grade you get, you deserve it based upon your effort.
Be confident. Say in your mind, ""I can do this"", or ""I'm going to get an A on this test"". Saying affirmations such as these actually helps relieve stress, and you'll already be off to a great start. Never say or even think, ""I'm going to fail""––that will make you stress even more. Instead, smile to yourself, sit up straight, and be ready to take your test!

, This may sound self-evident but time and again, exam takers often forget to read the basic instructions and lose points or marks for it.


The first thing you should put on a test, on any paper, is your name. If you don't have your name on your test, you will lose all credit for the test. You could also put the date on the test, the period, homeroom, teacher or instructor, etc.






Then, skim the test yourself, or while the teacher or instructor is explaining directions. Change any errors in the test if your teacher or instructor says to do so (you need to be listening carefully, not silently panicking), or ask them if there is a possible error if you find one.
Read the directions again before doing the problem, and pay attention to words such as least to greatest, sum, difference, product, quotient, and about.
While looking through the test, if you find any of the words above, make a note so that you'll follow the directions. Whether it's highlighting, underlining, circling, checking, or putting a box around, do something to draw attention to important directions, phrases, and/or words, be sure to do as asked.

, When you may begin, start the test and read the directions. It can be helpful to keep to the given order to guarantee no missed questions, or start with the easier problems first then go back to the more difficult ones, making sure you've missed none. However, it's up to you, so go in any order that will help you the most, as long as you have a method for checking for missed questions.


For multiple choice, read the question, then solve. Then look at the choices given. Make sure you read them all before selecting an answer. If your answer matches, check your work and select that answer.

If you are having a little trouble, realize that there will always be two choices that are far from the answer, and two that are close, but one of which is the correct answer. Two answers that are close to each other are both probably wrong, so you can rule those two out immediately and focus simply on the two possible correct ones.


Don't panic on word problems! Many people hate math word problems, you aren't alone. Read through the entire problem, highlighting/circling numbers and important information. Think to yourself, ""Is there information I don't need?"" and cross off unnecessary information.
Look at what is being asked (the last sentence, almost all of the time.)
Choose an operation to solve the problem. Will you add? Subtract? Multiply? Divide? Look for key words, such as ""more than"", ""product"", and ""divide"". Then solve the problem.

, Many people think they have answered everything perfectly, and don't even bother to check over their answers. This could become a bad habit as there may well be something missed or slightly wrong, so always check your answers, even if you think you got everything right. You could have easily made a silly mistake.


A good way to effectively check your work is to cover your answer and solve the question again. Look at your original answer and if the two match, you know you've probably got it right.
Check your test for your name, and see if any questions are missed. If you missed something, add it in, and check for labels and other silly errors. Then, hand in your test.

, You should be proud of yourself for completing the test, so sit back, relax, and wait for the results. Know that whatever grade you get, you deserve it, because of your effort.

, It's done and ruminating on what you should/could have done is only going to make for unnecessary worry.

Find values for average speed and time.,
Multiply average speed by time.,
Manipulate the equation to solve for other variables.,
Note that the ""savg"" variable in the distance formula refers to average speed.",How to Calculate Distance1," When you try to find the distance a moving object has traveled, two pieces of information are vital for making this calculation: its speed (or velocity magnitude) and the time that it has been moving. With this information, it's possible to find the distance the object has traveled using the formula d = savg × t.


To better understand the process of using the distance formula, let's solve an example problem in this section. Let's say that we're barreling down the road at 120 miles per hour (about 193 km per hour) and we want to know how far we will travel in half an hour. Using 120 mph as our value for average speed and 0.5 hours as our value for time, we'll solve this problem in the next step.;
, Once you know the average speed of a moving object and the time it's been traveling, finding the distance it has traveled is relatively straightforward. Simply multiply these two quantities to find your answer.


Note, however, that if the units of time used in your average speed value are different than those used in your time value, you'll need to convert one or the other so that they are compatible. For instance, if we have a average speed value that's measured in km per hour and a time value that's measured in minutes, you would need to divide the time value by 60 to convert it to hours.
Let's solve our example problem. 120 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 60 miles. Note that the units in the time value (hours) cancel with the units in the denominator of the average speed (hours) to leave only distance units (miles).

, The simplicity of the basic distance equation (d = savg × t) makes it quite easy to use the equation for finding the values of variables besides distance. Simply isolate the variable you want to solve for according to the basic rules of algebra, then insert values for your other two variables to find the value for the third. In other words, to find your object's average speed, use the equation savg = d/t and to find to find the time an object has been traveling, use the equation t = d/savg.


For instance, let's say that we know that a car has driven 60 miles in 50 minutes, but we don't have a value for the average speed while traveling. In this case, we might isolate the savg variable in the basic distance equation to get savg = d/t, then simply divide 60 miles / 50 minutes to get an answer of 1.2 miles/minute.
Note that in our example, our answer for speed has an uncommon units (miles/minute). To get your answer in the more common form of miles/hour, multiply it by 60 minutes/hour to get 72 miles/hour.

, It's important to understand that the basic distance formula offers a simplified view of the movement of an object. The distance formula assumes that the moving object has constant speed — in other words, it assumes that the object in motion is moving at a single, unchanging rate of speed. For abstract math problems, such as the ones you may encounter in an academic setting, sometimes it's still possible to model an object's motion using this assumption. In real life, however, this model often doesn't accurately reflect the motion of moving objects, which can, in reality, speed up, slow down, stop, and reverse over time.


For instance, in the example problem above, we concluded that to travel 60 miles in 50 minutes, we'd need to travel at 72 miles/hour. However, this is only true if travel at one speed for the entire trip. For instance, by traveling at 80 miles/hr for half of the trip and 64 miles/hour for the other half, we will still travel 60 miles in 50 minutes — 72 miles/hour = 60 miles/50 min = ?????

Calculus-based solutions using derivatives are often a better choice than the distance formula for defining an object's speed in real-world situations because changes in speed are likely.

Gather your materials.,
Measure out your wall space.,
Purchase some white panelboard.,
Cut your panelboard down to size.,
Secure your board to a wooden wall (option 1).,
Secure the board to a metal wall (option 2).,
Secure your board to a concrete or brick wall (option 3).",How to Make a Whiteboard1," You will need to purchase one or two pieces of white panel board as big as your the space on your wall you wish to hang it on. This can be found at home improvement stores and/or arts and crafts stores. You will also need to get:


Rotary saw or hand saw
Pencil
Measuring Tape
Four 2 inch screws(wood, concrete, and/or brick wall)
Four washers(wood, concrete, and/or brick wall)
Drill (wood, concrete, and/or brick wall)
Magnets (metal wall)
Super glue or hot glue (metal wall);
, Whether the space be in a classroom or your home, measure it out with a tape measure. Once you have a rectangular measurement (for example, 30 inches X 45 inches) decide whether you will have to divide this size into two, so that you have two separate boards. This all depends on a number of factors such as how you will be transporting the board to its final location (pick-up truck, van, car, etc.), the size of the door you have to get the board through, etc., This is board used solely for dry/erase purposes which can be found at arts and crafts stores as well as home improvement stores. They are usually bought in standard sizes, so you will not be able to get the board cut in-store. The board you purchase will need to be bigger than the measurements you made of your wall space. This means that you will need to have either a table or rotary saw to cut it down to the proper size., Lay the board face down so that the smooth side you write on is facing the table. Next, measure out the dimensions of your wall space on the back of your board. You can highlight your measurements with a light pencil mark. If you are using one large piece of board which will later be divided into two pieces, do ahead and draw the line down the middle where the board will be split.Transfer the board to a safe location such as outside or in your construction garage. Put on goggles before you begin sawing your board. Place the board face down again so that you can see your pencil markings.
Take out either a table saw or rotary saw. Cut along the pencil lines. If you have divided your board into two pieces, cut along the middle line as well.
Once you have cut the piece(s) use a piece of sandpaper to go around the edges. Rub them with the sandpaper until they are smooth.

, First you will have to transfer the board(s) to where you will hang them. Depending on the wall type, you will have to pick the best way to hang the board. If your wall is wooden, you should first pre-drill a hole in each of the four corners. Then have someone else hold the board against the wall in the exact spot you want it.For each hole, place a washer down over the hole, and then a screw through the hole. Take your drill and drill the top left (or right) screw into the wall. You might want to drill your first screw only partially through so that you can still swing and adjust the position of your board.
Make sure if you are doing this in a school that you have checked with the building codes and the school maintenance workers.

, Flip your board over so that the back is facing upwards. You will have to attach magnets onto the back. There are two options for this. One is to buy adhesive magnets, where all you have to do is to remove the adhesive strip and press it against the board. Make sure that you have a solid strip of magnet around all four edges of the board. Extra magnets will only further secure your board to the wall.


The second options is to buy more traditional magnet strips which need to be glued onto the back of your board. It is best to use either hot glue or super glue which will help the magnets stick the best.
Once again, make sure that there is at least a solid strip of magnet around each of the edges of your board. More magnets attached to the back are always a plus, and will help your board stick to the wall better.

, This is similar to wooden walls. You will have to pre-drill a hole into each of the four corners of your board. The difference between this and wood is that you will have to pre-drill holes into the wall as well.For this, you will need to first position the board against the wall exactly as you would have it hang. Trace around the board with a light pencil mark. Then eyeball where your pre-drilled holes are on your board (usually 1 inch down/up and 1 inch over from each corner) and make a mark on the wall. Drill a small hole into each of these marks.
Then have someone else hold the board up in the correct spot. Place a washer and a screw threw each hole. Drill the top left (or right) screw in first. Leave a bit of space between the screw and the wall to allow you to adjust/swing the board into the correct position.
Because you need to drill holes into the wall for this option, make sure you clear it with the building guidelines and school officials first.

Sketch your immediate geography at school or at home.,
Use cardinal directions to locate objects in your home.,
Watch current news and locate the events on a map.,
Play world mapping games online.,
Take a geography test.",How to Become a Geography Master2," To get a more intimate sense of geography, you can practice drawing free-hand sketch maps of your house, your neighborhood, your school, and your town. You may also try to map out your state and your country. Compare your maps to the maps in atlases and note the gaps in your knowledge. Consider how you might be able to find more information on certain areas that you were not able to draw on your own.You may also walk around your home or school and use your eyes to help you map out the space. This can also be a good excuse to take a walk around your neighborhood and make a map of the area through moving through the area. You may notice details you do not usually pay attention to and get a better sense of the geography of your neighborhood.

, One fun way to get better at identifying the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) is to have a friend or parent hide objects in your room and then locate them using directions. For example, the friend may say, “two steps to the east and four steps to the north."" You can then try to use your own sense of direction and/or a compass to help you locate objects using cardinal directions.You can also extend this game to identifying locations on a map based on cardinal direction. For example, maybe you note that your home town of San Juan is on the north coast of Puerto Rico and east of the equator.

, Connect the news of the day to geography by noting where events occur on a map. You may watch world news and try to place the events where they occurred based on city or region. You may also watch local news and place events on your map of your home state or your neighborhood. Doing this can help you notice any patterns of where certain events are taking place in the world and come up with theories on why this may be.You may also get a better sense of how events can be tied to geography. For example, an earthquake may occur in a region that is located on a fault line. Or a hurricane may go through a tropical area due to its location in the ocean.

, You can brush up on your geography knowledge by playing mapping games online. Use games that allow you to follow a certain character around the world on a search for clues or to solve a mission. You can also play games that require you to correctly identify the names of places in the world and certain details about the environment of these places.One popular mapping game is Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?You can find a list of mapping games for kids through the BBC at: http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/websites/4_11/site/geography.shtml.

, If you feel like your geography skills are close to masterly level, you may want to try taking a geography test. This can be a test that your parent or guardian comes up with for you or a test that you take online. You may also be able to customize quizzes online to focus on a specific area or region you are trying to study up on.A list of geography tests and quizzes can be found online."

Consider majoring in geography at the university level.",How to Become a Geography Master3," This may be a good option if you are in secondary school and would like to expand your knowledge of geography. Sign up for a world geography class at your middle school or high school. Some secondary schools have units in Social Studies that focuses on world maps. You may want to study more in depth during those units so you are more aware of the subject.If you are home schooled, you can access online tools to help you achieve a more well rounded study of geography. Work with your parents or guardians to integrate geography into your home school studies.

, There are many geography classes offered online for older students who have graduated high school and are looking for continuing education courses in geography. Many online geography classes can be taken module by module and at your own pace, under the guidance of an instructor or tutor., If you are interested in becoming a certified master of geography, you may want to enroll in a geography degree at the university level. Majoring in geography at the undergraduate level can allow you to delve deeper into the study of geography and open career doors, as there is a consistent need for geographers in the field."

Find two points spatial coordinates.,
Find 1-D distance by subtracting the value of the coordinates for the two points.,
Find 2-D distance by using the Pythagorean theorem.,
Find 3-D distance by modifying the 2-D formula.",How to Calculate Distance2," What if, rather than finding the distance that a moving object has traveled, you need to find the distance between two stationary objects? In cases like this, the speed-based distance formula described above won't be of any use. Luckily, a separate distance formula can be used to easily find the straight-line distance between two points. However, to use this formula, you'll need to know the coordinates of your two points. If you're dealing with one-dimensional distance (such as on a number line), your coordinates will be two numbers, x1 and x2. If you're dealing with distance in two dimensions, you'll need values for two (x,y) points, (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). Finally, for three dimensions, you'll need values for (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2).

, Calculating one-dimensional distance between two points when you know the value for each is a cinch. Simply use the formula d = |x2 - x1|. In this formula, you subtract x1 from x2, then take the absolute value of your answer to find the distance between x1 and x2. Typically, you'll want to use the one-dimensional distance formula when your two points lie on a number line or axis.


Note that this formula uses absolute values (the ""| |"" symbols). Absolute values simply mean that the terms contained within the symbols become positive if they are negative.
For example, let's say that we're stopped by the side of the road on a perfectly straight stretch of highway. If there is a small town 5 miles ahead of us and a town 1 mile behind us, how far apart are the two towns? If we set town 1 as x1 = 5 and town 2 as x1 = -1, we can find d, the distance between the two towns, as follows:

d = |x2 - x1|
= |-1 - 5|
= |-6| = 6 miles.



, Finding distance between two points in two-dimensional space is more complicated than in one dimension, but is not difficult. Simply use the formula d = √((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2). In this formula, you subtract the two x coordinates, square the result, subtract the y coordinates, square the result, then add the two intermediate results together and take the square root to find the distance between your two points. This formula works in the two-dimensional plane — for example, on basic x/y graphs.


The 2-D distance formula takes advantage of the Pythagorean theorem, which dictates that the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the square root of the squares of the other two sides.
For example, let's say that we have two points in the x-y plane: (3, -10) and (11, 7) that represent the center of a circle and a point on the circle, respectively. To find the straight-line distance between these two points, we can solve as follows:
d = √((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2)
d = √((11 - 3)2 + (7 - -10)2)
d = √(64 + 289)
d = √(353) = 18.79


, In three dimensions, points have a z coordinate in addition to their x and y coordinates. To find the distance between two points in three-dimensional space, use d = √((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 + (z2 - z1)2). This is a modified form of the two-dimensional distance formula described above that takes the z coordinates into account. Subtracting the two z coordinates, squaring them, and proceeding through the rest of the formula as above will ensure your final answer represents the three-dimensional distance between your two points.


For example, let's say that we're an astronaut floating in space near two asteroids. One is about 8 kilometers in front of us, 2 km to the right of us, and 5 miles below us, while the other is 3 km behind us, 3 km to the left of us, and 4 km above us. If we represent the positions of these asteroids with the coordinates (8,2,-5) and (-3,-3,4), we can find the distance between the two as follows:
d = √((-3 - 8)2 + (-3 - 2)2 + (4 - -5)2)
d = √((-11)2 + (-5)2 + (9)2)
d = √(121 + 25 + 81)
d = √(227) = 15.07 km

Gather your materials.,
Cut a small piece of cardboard.,
Cut out a piece of paper.,
Glue the cardboard and paper together.,
Add a clear plastic sheet.,
Attach the plastic to the top of the paper.,
Repeat the previous steps over again.",How to Make a Whiteboard2," You will need a large piece of cardboard. This can be found on a cardboard box, or you can buy sheets of cardboard at home improvement stores. You will also need:


Pencil
Ruler
Scissors
White, or light colored printer paper
Clear plastic sheets
Duct tape
Liquid glue or glue sticks
Masking tape (optional)
Sharpie/marker (optional)

, First purchase a large piece of cardboard from an arts and crafts store. You can also cut out one of the panels from a cardboard box using a knife or a pair of scissors. After you have a large piece of cardboard, you can then cut it down to the appropriate size for each individual whiteboard.Mark on the cardboard, using a pencil and ruler, a rectangular shape. You can use the standard size of a piece of notebook paper which is 8.5 X 11 inches. However, depending on how many boards you wish to create, and your own personal preference, you will want to maximize your use of the cardboard. This might mean you make slightly smaller boards so that you don't have to buy so many large sheets of cardboard, and have so much wasted cardboard left over.
After the rectangular shape is marked out with a pencil, go ahead and cut it out using either a knife or a pair of scissors. Don't worry about the edges being rough, as they will be covered up later.

, First purchase standard printer paper (8.5 X 11 inches). White is the best color to choose as the writings on the whiteboard will show more clearly. However, you can also choose lighter shades of primary colors, such as a light green, blue, red, etc. Next, lay one piece of paper over the rectangular shaped cardboard.If the piece of paper and cardboard are the same size, all you have to do is to glue them together.
If the piece of paper is slightly larger, lay the cardboard overtop of the piece of paper. Make sure that each exposed side of paper is equidistant in size. Trace around the piece of cardboard with a light pencil mark onto the piece of paper. Cut out the rectangle using a pair of scissors or a rotary blade.

, Glue the piece of paper onto the piece of cardboard so that each side is flush with one another. You can use either liquid glue or a glue stick. If you use liquid glue, make sure that it is spread evenly over the cardboard before you press the paper and cardboard together.Smooth over any bubbles or wrinkles in the paper with your hands.
After the glue has been applied, press the two tightly together with your hands. Hold for about a minute until the glue begins to dry.
If the paper is still slightly loose on the edges, you can either apply some extra glue, or wait until you secure the final product with duct tape later on.

, You can purchase what are commonly termed ""transparencies"" online. These are clear plastic sheets that used to be used on projectors in many classrooms. However, if you can't find these, you do have some other options. One is to go to your local arts and crafts store. They should have either precut plastic sheets, or large sheets on the bar that they will cut for you.You can also use the clear plastic in front and back of binders. You can cut the piece of plastic off the front and back with a pair of scissors or a rotary blade.
If the piece of plastic is the same size as the cardboard/paper, you can move onto the next step. If the plastic is slightly larger, place the cardboard/paper overtop of the plastic. Use a magic marker and trace around the cardboard/paper.
Cut out the rectangular shape with a pair of scissors or rotary blade. Take either an eraser, or a tissue with some windex, and wipe off the magic marker.

, Take the piece of plastic and place it overtop of the paper side of the cardboard/paper combination. Turn the entire board so that it is facing landscape style. Next, take duct tape and place the exposed sticky end of the duct tape at the bottom left hand corner. Note: you only want half the duct tape on the top of your board, the other half will be folded back.Gradually unwind your duct tape, pressing down the duct tape against the board as you go along. Remember, only half of the duct tape should be shown on top of the board. Once you get to the corner, rip the piece of duct tape or cut it with scissors.
Then, take the duct tape that is loose and fold it backwards against the back of the whiteboard. You can flip the board over entirely if this is easier for you. Smooth out the duct tape and press against it with your hands to ensure it sticks.
Repeat the same step but with the other three sides of your white board. It is fine if the duct tape slightly overlaps on the corners.

, Do so until you have enough boards for your entire classroom. Make sure that each student has at least one classroom safe magic marker, and a small eraser. Do not use the tissue/Windex combination as this could be unsafe for small children.


You do have some options when it comes to decorating them. You can add a small piece of masking tape to the bottom of the board. This way you can write your student's name on the board with either a pencil, pen or marker.
You can also go over the edge (duct tape) with a Sharpie and add designs such as vines, trees, flowers, sports balls, etc.

Gather your materials.,
Purchase a piece of galvanized steel.,
Cut a piece of wood down to size.,
Attach a wall hook to your board (option 1).,
Attach magnets to your board (option 2).,
Glue the board and steel together.,
Hang your board up.",How to Make a Whiteboard3," You will need a piece of galvanized steel (see step two). These come prepackaged and can be found at arts and crafts stores as well as home improvement stores. Since they are not cut on-site, please make sure to measure the space on your refrigerator or office wall before you purchase a piece of steel. You will also need:


A piece of wood or cork board, bigger than your steel (you will cut it down to size)
Pencil
Hand saw or electrical radial saw
Sand paper
Wall hook (if hanging on wall)
Nails (if hanging on wall)
Hammer (if hanging on wall)
Magnet strips (if hanging on refrigerator)
Hot glue or super glue (if hanging on refrigerator)

, The great thing about galvanized steel is that it is both magnetic and dry erasable. Most home improvement and arts and crafts stores have galvanized steel for sale for this exact reason. Galvanized steel is sold in standard sizes, not cut on site, so you will have to measure your wall/fridge space ahead of time before you go into the store.There are usually different shades of galvanized steel. Since you will be making a whiteboard out of it, it is best to pick a lighter shade of gray.
You won't be able to cut the steel unless you have serious construction equipment. Therefore, the standard size of steel you buy will have to fit within the wall/fridge space.

, You will need to purchase a relatively thin piece (1/4 inch) of wood or cork board that is the size of your galvanized steel. Wood/cork board which is cut on site to the perfect size is always your best option. However, if the store won't cut it for you, you will have to do it at home. Buy a piece of wood or cork that is larger than your piece of galvanized steel so that you can cut it down later on.If you are affixing the board to your refrigerator use cork board, not wood (will prevent scratching).
Place the piece of steel overtop of the board. Take a pencil and trace around the steel, onto the board. Lift away the steel and keep it somewhere safe.
Next, cut the rectangular shape out using a saw. You will want to do this somewhere safe (outside and away from children). You can either use a hand saw or an electric radial saw.
Once the board has been cut, take a piece of sand paper to the edge so that it is smooth all around.

, If you wish to hang your final product on a wall you will have to attach a wall hanger to your board. Flip your wooden/cork board landscape style. Place your hanger at the center top of your board, about 1 inch (3 cm) from the top. You can use a ruler to measure both sides of the hanger to make sure that it is in the middle. Nail it in using two nails and some gentle taps of a hammer.The nails will go through the board. Take some pliers and snip off the two pointy ends. Then sand them down using a piece of sandpaper or an electric sander.

, If you are hanging it on your refrigerator you will need to attach magnets. You can buy magnet that has an adhesive strip. All you have to do is to cut your magnet strip into the appropriate pieces (one for each corner, and one for the center) and then press the adhesive side onto the board.If you are buying regular magnets, simply cut the magnet into the appropriate pieces (one for each corner, and one for the center) and attach them using a small helping of super glue.
You can also buy metal clips which have magnets on them. Purchase two or three and clip onto the top of your final product. However, the board will be relatively heavy, so you will need to get clips with strong magnets in them.

, Apply a large helping of super glue or Gorilla glue to the side of your board without the hook or magnets. Have your galvanized steel nearby. Position it so that it directly overlaps the board. Press the steel against it. Run over the whole piece with your hands.Leave the two sit overnight so that you can ensure they are stuck together. If you want to, you can place a book overtop of them in order to ensure that they stick together.
The next day, press your hand against the steel and try to gently move it around. If it is secure, it will not move. If it is still loose, lift the steel up, apply some more glue, and wait another night for it to dry.

, If you attach it to the wall you will have to hammer in a nail so that you have something for your hanger to catch. Nails about 1 inch long should do the trick. If it is going on your refrigerator place the magnet side against the fridge. Because your board is magnetic you can also attach a small magnet to a magic marker.Either attach an small adhesive magnet to a marker, or hot glue on a small magnet to your marker.
When you car done writing with the marker, simply press the magnet against the galvanized steel and it should stick.
You can also add other magnets you buy from elsewhere, such as on a holiday vacation.

Confirm the dimensions of your board.,
Buy melamine sheet(s) from your local hardware store.,
For a clear board, use plexiglass or Lexan.,
Brace your board with a backer board if needed.,
If necessary, cut your board to size.,
Use glue/screws/hangers/etc.,
Use your board as you desire.",How to Make Your Own White Board (Dry Erase Board)1," The size of your makeshift white board is completely up to you. However, the types of material you will be using to create the white board often come in 4'x8' sheets, so, if you need something larger, you will need to plan to buy multiple sheets.;
, Melamine is a fiberboard sheet that has a hard plastic-like coating on one side. Sometimes, these sheets are textured to look like tile, which can be a plus in certain situations (like if you need to organize your information into squares), but, usually, this just gets in the way. So, you'll probably want to choose a sheet with a smooth finish, since they generally erase easier and look better when written on.

, Alternatively, try one of these thinner polymer materials to make a transparent dry erase board. Both are available at most local home improvement stores. Of the two, Lexan is preferable because it is about 1/2 as thick as plexiglass, weighs less, doesn't shatter during drilling, and has a nicer, ""glassier"" finish than plexiglass. However, Lexan is the more expensive choice.

, Regardless of the material you choose, your board will be very thin (only about 1/4"" - 1/2"" thick). Because of this, it will be somewhat bendable or flexible. This isn't a problem if you plan to attach your board directly to a wall with glue - in this case, the wall behind the board will provide support while you're writing. However, if you need to be able to move your board around, buy a backer board to glue it to for added stability.


The material of your backer board can be virtually anything - cork-board, wood, and even additional sheets of your board's base material work well.

, If your board needs to be smaller than 4'x8' (or other dimensions you may have bought it in), then you will need to cut it. If you don't have the right tools to do this on your own, don't worry - a lumberyard or home improvement store will be able to cut it for you. If you're cutting the material on your own, move the saw slowly through the material. Rushing can cause plexiglass, lexan, and melamine to chip very badly.


Be sure to have the backer board cut as well if you are using one.

, to hang your board. Don't forget that a dry erase board is only any good if you can hang it on the wall! In terms of which hanging methods to use, there are no right answers - anything that keeps the board steady on the wall so that you can comfortably write on it is fair game! Gluing, nailing, or screwing the board to the wall is a semi-permanent solution, while hanging it on hooks allows it to be easily removed.


Note that this type of board works best with smooth walls when gluing the board directly to the wall. If your wall has bumps or texture, there may be a few millimeters between the wall and board, which can make the board unstable when you write on it.
You may also want to dress up your board with some trim or a ""ledge"" to hold your markers - it's up to you.

, Congratulations! Your dry erase board is ready to use to your heart's content. If you're going to use the board for the same thing every day, you may want to split the board into subsections as needed. For instance, if the board is be going to be used to keep track of your schedule, you might want to divide it into ""days"" and ""weeks"" (and so on).


If you'd like to sub-divide your board, try using automotive pin striping (available at an auto repair store). Black pinstripe comes in two sizes, 1/4"" and 1/8"", which work well for a bold, yet uniform effect. Pinstripe is available in many colors, sizes, and patterns.

Buy sleeve protectors from the store.,
Insert a blank sheet of paper.

,
Insert a printed sheet of paper, instead.,
When you are done filling the sleeve protectors, add two sheets of white cardstock to the binder, one in the back and one in the front.,
Use a dry-erase marker to write on the sleeve and a piece of felt for an eraser.

",How to Create a Whiteboard with Sleeve Protectors," Usually these come in bulk and are really cheap. Look for the shiny plastic ones, not the ones with a matte finish. Make sure it can fit a standard piece of paper (8.5""x11"" or A4).;

Repeat if necessary.,
Clean and wipe the board.,
Clean the board every one to two days.,
Clean the board thoroughly with a wet solution.,
Wipe and dry the board.",How to Clean a Whiteboard," Pen and permanent marker will leave permanent marks on a whiteboard that can be very difficult to remove. Even dry erase marker that's left on for too long will stain the board. To remove such stains, start by completely writing over the stains with fresh dry erase marker., This should only take a few seconds.Then, rub the marks with a cloth or the whiteboard eraser.


The idea is that the fresh dry erase ink will help loosen and lift the stains off the board, so that when you wipe away the dry erase ink, the permanent marks will come off as well.

, For stubborn stains and permanent marks, repeat the process. Cover the marks again with dry erase ink, allow it to dry, and then rub the board with a cloth or eraser.

, Once you have removed the permanent stains or marks, clean the board to remove any remaining marks. Dampen a cloth with a cleaner and wipe the board vigorously with the damp cloth. Remove any excess cleaner and allow the board to dry. Some of the most popular cleaners for a whiteboard are:Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol
Hand sanitizer
Acetone or nail polish remover that contains acetone
Water mixed with several drops of dish soap.
Orange cleaners (such as Goo Gone and Fantastik)
Glass cleaner
Baby wipes
Pam or other spray cooking oils
Aftershave
Whiteboard cleaning solution like Expo, Solutions MB, or Quartet

, Start with a whiteboard eraser, which will remove the majority of fresh marks, as long as they haven’t been there for more than a couple days., Dampen a clean cloth or sponge with your favorite cleaning solution. Be sure you’re in a ventilated area if you are going to use harsh chemicals. Use the cloth to apply cleaning solution to the whiteboard and rub vigorously., Once you have successfully removed the marker, rinse out your cloth or sponge with clean water to remove the cleaning solution. Wring out the cloth and wipe the board down with the damp cloth. This will remove excess cleaning solution. Then, dry the board with a clean, dry cloth.

Clean you erasers of as much marker dust as possible by brushing, beating, and vacuuming.,
Erase the whiteboard with your dry eraser.,
Clean the whiteboard with a whiteboard cleaner and paper towel.,
Spray the whiteboard with WD-40, using a light misting over the whole board.,
Wipe the WD-40 clean with a fresh rag, spreading across the entire surface.,
Test the marker on a small corner of the board.",How to Restore a Whiteboard1," A lot of cleaning problems actually start with a dirty eraser. Be sure to beat them out, and take a vacuum hose to it as well to get as much dust out as possible. Your eraser will suddenly be much more effective., Get off as much as you can using this method, but don't sweat it if there are still marks. You simply want to get as much off as possible.

, If you can't get ahold of whiteboard cleaner, just use a damp cloth. Don't substitute in other cleaners, as many of them will simply strip off more of the essential coating that allows you to erase the markers.


Keep wiping down the board with your clean towel until it no longer picks up dirt and dust.
Always use gentle, soft towels or paper towels. Never use abrasive pads or scrubbers!


, WD-40 is a light oil that will keep the board slick. This allows you to write on it without the ink drying into the board and leaving permanent marks. While it may make the board a bit slippery, it will be usable., When done, dry everything with a paper towel. The board should feel a little slick with the oil, but it should not be pooling up anywhere or visible. Wipe in a circular motion to ensure the whole board is evenly coated.

, Make a few marks with a dry erase maker, then wait 10-15 minutes before trying to erase. If you did it all successfully, and the board isn't behind repair, the marker should wipe off easily even after all of this time to dry.

Grab or buy a piece of smooth material with suitable dimensions.,
Paint your board white.,
Finish your board with a clear outer coating.,
Consider installing trim or a ledge for markers.,
Install your board on the wall.",How to Make Your Own White Board (Dry Erase Board)2," Many dry erase boards aren't actually one uniform piece of material like the ones described in the step above. Instead, they're a solid core of hard, smooth material that's been painted with multiple coats of paint to create a smooth writing surface. A wide variety of materials are suitable for these types of boards. Generally speaking, you're looking for something durable that's thin, durable, rectangular, and perfectly smooth. Don't choose anything that's rough or textured, as this will produce an uneven writing surface.


Steel or aluminum sheets are perfect for this task - they are smooth, strong, and thin. Between these two materials, the choice is up to you. Aluminum is lighter, but more expensive. Steel, on the other hand, is heavier, but it is also cheaper and has the added benefit of being magnetic, which can allow you to pin things to it with magnets.

, While there are no rules saying that you have to have a white dry erase board, they are traditionally white for good reason - any color of ink will show up against a white background. Give your board a thorough coating of white paint, ensuring that one surface is entirely covered. You may want to allow your base coat to dry, then add another coat to ensure the board is thick enough.

, When your white base coat is dry, apply a clear outer performance coating. Generously paint the clear, smooth lacquer over the white layer and allow it to dry. As above, consider adding multiple coats to ensure uniform thickness.


There are lots of suitable paints and laminates that can give you a suitable clear performance layer. One of the best of these, melamine, is mentioned as a possible solid base material for your dry erase board in the previous section. Melamine is also available in liquid ""paint"" form and can be used to give your board a great writing finish.

, After your clear coat dries, the dry erase board is basically ready to use. However, as in the section above, you may want to consider adding extra features like trim and a ledge or tray to hold markers to make your board easier to use. Trim (usually metal or plastic) conceals the unfinished edges of the base material and gives the board a pleasing border. A tray or ""ledge"", on the other hand, is usually a thin piece of metal that runs along the bottom edge of the board, serving as a place to keep your markers when you're not using them. Install these features (or any others you'd like) before mounting your board on the wall.

, Your painted dry erase board should be hung in basically the same way as the melamine/plexiglass/Lexan examples from the previous section are. To fix the board directly to the wall, use glue, nails, or mounting screws (you may need to make holes in your board to be able to use nails or screws). On the other hand, if you'd like to be able to move your board, consider hanging it from mounting hooks. If you do so, you may want to consider adding a backboard so that the board sits securely against the wall.

"
"
Decide on the dimensions of your white board.,
Once you have decided on the desired dimensions of your dry erase board, either purchase a large piece of paper or cardstock that is your desired dimensions or cut a piece down to the right dimensions.

,
Take some plastic wrap or a large sandwich bag or some sticky back plastic which you can purchase from your local craft store and cut it to the exact same dimensions as your paper.

,
Rub a thin layer of transparent decoupage medium (such as Modge Podge) on to the plastic.You don't have to do this if you used sticky back plastic.

,
Stick the paper to the wrap and let it dry for a while.

Never use abrasive or scratching motions to clean a whiteboard.,
Use whiteboard cleaner and a dry towel at the end of every week to keep the board clean.,
Remove ""ghost marks"" or permanent marker by completely covering the board in black dry-erase marker, then erasing it quickly The wet marker actually has chemicals that keep the ink fluid, which will temporarily loosen the ghost marks or permanent marker.,
Never use degreasers, soap, or cleaners not specifically formulated for dry-erase boards.,
Always dry off a board after wiping it clean with a wet rag.,
Clean the dry eraser regularly to prevent build up of dust and marker residue.,
Know that restoration will only work so many times before you need a new board.",How to Restore a Whiteboard2," The non-porousness of the board is what allows the ink to come off easily, as a clean, Teflon-like coating protects the board from letting ink set in. But scratches and ""tears"" in this coating will allow the ink to seep through, ruining your board permanently. Always use soft, clean towels and rags.


Adhesives like tape and glue will also rip up the coating when removed., Regular cleanings will be essential to prevent the need to restore the board in the first place. A light spray of cleaner and a towel will remove marks before the set in, keeping your board beautiful for years to come.


Any marker left on for more than 24 hours is at risk to leave ""ghost"" marks.
Very stubborn stains can be removed with a little propyl alcohol. Wipe and dry it off after applying -- don't let it dry on the board., Work quickly, then erase with a dry, clean eraser to get most of these marks off.


Note, if you work too slowly you may dry the black marker on their, completely defeating the purpose!
You can also use this method to spot clean certain marks. Just make sure they are completely covered with ink before erasing., Most soaps break up oils and sheens that are not water-soluble, helping cut through tough stains and chemicals. But the sheen on a whiteboard is there on purpose, allowing the markers to write without ever truly drying out. Never use a cleaner that isn't made to specifically work with your white board.


In a pinch, denatured alcohol can work as a more powerful cleaner than water, and it shouldn't harm whatever original finish you have left.

, Don't let the board air dry. If you're wiping the board down at the end of the day, take a paper towel and clean rag and dry it as well. This will help protect the longevity of the board.

, Blot it on a kitchen towel. If you need to wash it, dampen a soft cloth and run over it to remove traces of ink, but do not wet it. You want to start with as little dust and debris as possible to keep the board clean and smooth.

, If someone has ruined the finish with a heavy cleaner, or you find that you have to add WD-40 more and more frequently, you'll likely hit the end of the line with your board. While you can try to resurface it again, you'll likely be best off with a new, factory sprayed finish.


WD-40 will make the board usable again, but it may also lead to slightly streaky writing. It is nothing that makes the board unusable, but it should be noted.

Use an eraser.,
Clean the eraser.,
Use a dry cleaning cloth.",How to Clean a Chalkboard1," Make sure it’s clean. The best way to erase a chalkboard is to use an up-and-down motion while cleaning the board. Start by removing the obvious chalk dust with the eraser.


Using an up-and-down motion will stop the chalk dust from forming irregular patterns. Begin wiping the chalkboard clean with the eraser by starting in the upper left corner of the board.
Wiping up and down across the board, end up in the upper right corner of the chalkboard. A felt eraser is a good choice for cleaning a chalkboard.You can also wipe the board straight across in horizontal lines. Avoid wiping the chalkboard in circular patterns, though.
Once you’re done using the eraser, wipe the chalkboard with a clean, lint-free and dry cloth or chamois.;
, If you use a felt eraser to clean a chalkboard, it’s likely that you will need to use it regularly. It’s a good idea to clean the eraser.Clap the erasers together to clean them on a daily basis. This will remove chalk dust from the erasers, so it’s best to do this outside.
To clean the erasers further, dip a cloth in warm water, and use it to wipe to erasers to remove more chalk dust from them.
There are special cleaning solutions you can use to clean erasers. Look in larger big box stores or office supply stores.

, Some people use dry cleaning cloths to remove chalk from chalkboards instead of the typical felt eraser.


You can buy such clothes that are specifically designed for cleaning chalkboards. Look in teacher or office supply stores. They’re designed to be reused and can last up to a year.
Try spraying Endust or another dusting product on the cleaning cloth before wiping it on the chalkboard.
Use the same up-and-down motion when cleaning the chalkboard with a dry cleaning cloth that you would use with a felt eraser.

Try lemon oil on the chalkboard.,
Try soda pop!,
Use vinegar and water.",How to Clean a Chalkboard2," The lemon oil will remove chalk dust from your chalkboard, leaving it smooth and clean and free of residue.


Lemon oil comes from the rinds of a lemon, and some people use it to clean guitar fingerboards as well. It’s anti-bacterial, and who doesn’t love a fresh lemony smell!Place two teaspoons of lemon oil on a dry cloth. Fold the cloth into a square, and put it into a sealed plastic bag. Lemon oil will also make your chalkboard shinier.After letting it sit for a day, remove the cloth from the plastic bag, and wipe the blackboard with the lemon-oil covered cloth. Try putting two cloths in the bag so you have another one for the next day as you should clean the chalkboard daily.

, Coke sounds like it would make your chalkboard sticky and unusable, but a lot of people have used the soda product as a cleaning agent, and they report that it cleans chalkboards more thoroughly than water.Pour a half cup of Coke into a bowl. Take a damp cloth, and dip it into the bowl, getting some of the Coke on the cloth. Any brand of soda should work, though, including Pepsi or diet soda.
Take the Coke-covered cloth, and wipe it on the chalkboard. People who have tried this report that it dries without leaving behind chalk dust.
It’s also probably not going to make your chalkboard sticky unless you use too much. Dab the cloth into it. You don’t want enough Coke on the cloth that it’s dripping from the cloth. The soda may actually make it easier for chalk to adhere to the board.

, Try mixing water and white vinegar together, and use a cloth to wipe the chalkboard with it. Not only will this concoction smell good, but it will also prevent streaks.White vinegar is the best choice because other vinegar (such as balsamic) has coloring that can harm the blackboard’s appearance.
Add half a cup of vinegar to four cups of lukewarm water before putting a cloth into the mixture. Wipe the board down. Wring out the cloth before wiping the board so it’s not dripping wet.
It’s best to let the chalkboard air dry when you’re done removing all of the chalk dust from its surface. It’s possible to use only water to wipe down a chalkboard; the vinegar increases the cleaning power.

Try water with household cleaner.,
Buy commercial chalkboard cleaner.,
Let the chalkboard dry thoroughly.,
Clean a chalkboard wall.",How to Clean a Chalkboard3," Sometimes chalkboards need tougher cleaning action. This is especially true if your chalkboard is marred with ink, fingerprint, or crayon stains.


Apply a mild cleaner to water, such as a few drops of dish soap, and use it to remove the stains with a cloth. Choose a non-oily cleaner that is not abrasive. You could try to clean the chalkboard with only water and a rag, but when it dries it may have gray residue on it from the lingering chalk.Applying water to a chalkboard will cause a phenomenon known as ghosting. This means that, even though you’ve wiped away the chalk dust, there’s an outline left. Applying cleaner to the water should reduce the chances this will happen.
You could use a squeegee to remove the water solution from the chalkboard after wiping the chalkboard with it.

, There are special commercial chalkboard cleaner specifically designed for this purpose. It can be found in many teacher and office supply stores, as well as some big box stores.


Some of the commercial cleaners are water-based and premixed. They come in spray bottles with applicators on the bottle’s top.
Spray some of the cleaner on a towel, and use it to wipe the chalkboard clean. Other commercial cleaners are foam-based. Some cleaners can damage the chalkboard’s surface if you use them repeatedly.
Commercial cleaners come in difference scents, such as mint. Foam cleaners can prevent streaking because the foam is less likely to drip down the board.

, You will want to let the chalkboard air dry, rather than speeding the process along.


Make sure that you leave enough time for the chalkboard to thoroughly dry before you really need to use it again.
If you write with chalk on a wet chalkboard, it can cause stubborn stains that can be very difficult to remove.
After you’ve cleaned the chalkboard, you can speed up the drying process by wiping down the whole board with a soft, dry cloth.

, Some people have chalkboard walls in their homes that can be pretty unsightly if they aren’t properly cleaned.

Try adding a drop of dish soap to a bucket of water. Using a soft cloth, wipe down the chalkboard.
Remove chalkboard paint with a regular eraser or damp cloth. Chalkboard paint can be removed the same way as chalk on a chalkboard.However, it’s possible that it will be harder to clean. Try wiping the area with a dampened cloth. After it dries, apply more chalkboard paint.

Create a magnetic chalkboard.Trim a thin sheet of galvanized sheet metal down to size using tin snips.,
Glue magnets on the back of the frame.,
Use chalkboard paint on other flat surfaces.Any flat, smooth surface can be turned into a blackboard simply by adding a few layers of chalkboard paint.,
Make a lightweight chalkboard.Use foam board instead of plywood or medium-density fiberboard.",How to Make a Chalkboard," Choose a picture frame based on your desired chalkboard size. The size of the frame will be the finished size of your chalkboard.









Any frame will work, so you can recycle an old frame you no longer have a use for or go to a second-hand store to purchase a cheap, thick wooden frame.
When selecting a frame, it is best to use one that still has its backing. The backing is not necessary, but it will help you to keep the chalkboard in place later on.;
, Take the glass or plexiglass out of the frame and put it away.









You will not be using the glass for this project, but if you enjoy crafting, you might want to save it among your crafting supplies so that you can use it for another project.
If working with a standard size frame, you could also save the glass to act as a potential replacement in case the glass from another frame breaks.
If you do decide to dispose of the glass, take precautions to ensure that it doesn't hurt anyone. You can either recycle it or throw it away, but if you throw it away, wrap it in several layers of cloth rag or plastic bag. These layers will prevent shards of glass from cutting anyone handling the garbage if the glass breaks.

, If the frame is in ragged condition, lightly sand it down with fine-grain sandpaper.









Temporarily remove the backing to prevent it from getting dirty or damaged.
After sanding the frame, wipe away particles and other dirt with a clean, dry cloth. Even if you do not need to sand the frame, you should still wipe it down with a clean cloth to rid it of dust and dirt.














, Use a sponge brush to apply a coat of white primer over the wooden frame.









Primer prevents the color underneath your paint from showing through and also prepares the surface for paint.
If you do not plan on painting your frame or just want to paint a fresh coat of the same color, primer is not necessary.
Primer is, however, essential if you plan on painting the frame a light color, especially if a dark color lies beneath it.
Lay out newspaper or plastic sheeting to prevent yourself from accidentally getting primer on the floor.

, Use a sponge brush or traditional paintbrush to apply several coats of paint.









You could also use spray paint for faster, easier application.
You could apply wood staining, too, as long as the frame is made with natural wood. Do not prime the wood before staining it and use a soft bristle paintbrush to apply it.
Apply paint or staining over a newspaper or plastic sheeting to prevent paint from accidentally getting on the floor.
Apply the paint or staining with the grain, not against it.
Allow the paint or staining to dry in between coats.

, Draw the outline on the board using a pencil instead of a pen.









If using a new frame, take out the paper insert that comes with it and trace the outline onto your board. You could also trace the inside glass window.
If you have an old frame with no glass, use a ruler or tape measure to measure the back opening of the frame. Draw a rectangle with the same dimensions on your board. Do not use the dimensions from the front opening of your frame.
Plywood would also work if you do not have medium-density fiberboard.

, Use an electric jigsaw or manual hand saw to cut along the outline you traced.









If you are unable to do the work yourself, bring the dimensions to the hardware store and ask a worker in the lumber section to trim the board down for you.
After cutting the board, use rough sandpaper to remove any splintering edges. You may also need to use the sandpaper to shave away some of the board if it will not fit into the frame.

, Apply one coat of white latex primer to one side of the board.









The primer will make it easier for the paint to stick to the surface of the board.













Use a large sponge brush or standard flat painter's brush.

, Use a painter's brush or roller to apply two even coats of black chalkboard paint to the primed board.









Chalkboard paint is formulated to develop the surface texture of a chalkboard upon drying. It can then be written on with chalk. Applying two coats will make the effect stronger.
Even coats will reduce the amount of ridges that develop on the surface after the paint dries.
Allow the paint to dry in between coats.














, Fit the chalkboard into the back of the frame with the chalkboard side facing the front.









If the backing will fit inside the frame with the board in place, insert it behind the board in order to help secure the board in place.
If you cannot use the backing, use masking tape or packing tape to fix the back of the board to the back of the frame.













Hang the chalkboard by the hook attached to the frame's backing. Alternatively, you could use heavy staples to attach thick twine or thin rope to the top two corners of the frame and hang the chalkboard on a hook using this string.

, Coat the metal with several layers of chalkboard spray paint.









The metal should be the same size as your plywood would be if creating an ordinary chalkboard.













Make sure that you use gloves when handling the metal to avoid getting cut.
Use the backing of the frame or another piece of board to secure the sheet metal in place.













Do not attempt to spray the chalkboard with magnetic paint before applying the chalkboard paint. The two cancel each other out, so the magnetic paint will be ineffective after you apply the chalkboard paint.

, If you plan to hang the chalkboard on a magnetic surface, fix moderately strong magnets to the four corners of the frame.









Use super glue or another strong adhesive.

,









Lightly sand the surface, if necessary, and apply painters tape to cover any area you do not want to get paint on.
If you need ideas for creative surfaces, consider using enamel bakeware, old cabinet doors, an old mirror, a glass window pane, or a dustpan.

, Cut it out as usual and paint it with two coats of chalkboard paint.









Note that this will not be a very durable chalkboard. It is best to use this method only if you plan on using the chalkboard infrequently.

As Simon Reich argues, ""Despite the breadth with which the term has been applied, the meaning of ‘globalization’ remains so elusive as to defy definition.""There are five primary ways in which ""globalization"" can be understood:An historical period
An economic phenomenon
The triumph of American values
A social and technological revolution.
The annihilation of distance;
, Globalization can be understood as a period running from approximately 1970 to the present and which follows the era of the Cold War (1945-1989), which in turn followed what has often been dubbed the Age of Extremes (1870-1945). This periodization is defined by either:


Structural shifts – The fall or the Soviet Bloc and the end of the social contract that linked labor representation, productivity, and wages within a mass production system of manufacturing.
A conjunction of more temporary factors – The oil crisis of the late 1970s, a GNP decline and inflation in the 1980s, and the elections of Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and Helmut Kohl.

, This definition sees globalization as the latest – and by far the most far-reaching and rapid – in a series of similar events that have created a greater worldwide spread of sales, production facilities, and manufacturing processes, and thus increased linkages between economies around the world. The characteristics of economic globalization include:


Liberalization and deregulation of markets
Privatization of assets
Retreat of state intervention in the economy (i.e. welfare)
Diffusion of technology
Spread of manufacturing across nations (e.g. the production of iPhones in China for sale in the US)
Integration of capital markets – settings where foreign currencies, stocks, bonds, and bank loans are traded (e.g. the New York Stock Exchange), This definition conceives of globalization as a global convergence of politics, economic practices, and culture around a specifically American version of democracy, capitalism, and ""commercial secularism,"" in which consumption of goods and culture (film, music, restaurants, etc.) takes the place of religion or other cultural traditions.The result is a world that – at least in major cities – feels increasingly similar no matter where you are.

, This revolution is creating a new economy in which the globe is a single market and a new social order in which people take part in a global culture and economy that is more open and flexible. It is typified by:Globally integrated production
Specialized but interdependent labor markets
The privatization of state assets
New technological linkages (phones, the internet, online markets) that transcend national borders

, If you have ever boarded a plane (in say New York), landed hours later in foreign city (Hong Kong), and been disoriented by the sudden shift, then you have experienced this form of globalization. The experience of space, it is argued, is intimately tied to the time necessary to connect distinct locations. Planes, cell phones, and the internet have combined to dramatically shrink that time, resulting in a fundamentally different human experience of space typified by:Increased interconnectedness that lead distant events to have local impacts
The transcendence of local and national boundaries
The increased speed of social activity mediated by technology

, Globalization is a massive phenomenon that has spawned a large literature. To truly understand it, you'll need to hit the books. Some good places to start include:


Clive Crook's article ""Globalisation and its critics: A Survey of Globalisation"" in Economist 360, no. 8241 (2001)
Paul Hirst and Grahame Thompson's Globalization in Question (2001)
Joseph Stiglitz's Globalization and Its Discontents (2002)
Martin Wolf's Why Globalization Works (2005)
Thomas Friedman's The World is Flat (2005)
The David Deese edited collection Globalization: Causes and Effects (2012)

, There have been international market integration and widespread cultural exchange in the past – most notably at turn of the 20th century. Much of what is different about current globalization can be traced to technological changes.Most notably:The internet has internationalized capital markets.
Containerized shipping – the use of containers that are easily transferred from ship to truck or train – has dramatically reduced the cost of shipping goods.
Real-time communications (via phone and internet) have allowed for the export of service jobs (e.g. call centers), easier cultural diffusion, and social and economic connections across national boundaries.
Worldwide access to news via networks like CNN and the internet has spread both political ideas and increased consumer knowledge., While technology has clearly played a key role in increased government integration, it is not the sole factor. Governments have the ability to limit globalization by setting up tariffs, restricting direct foreign investment, and limiting the flow of workers between countries. The rapid pace of globalization is largely due to the general embrace of policies – aimed at achieving a macroeconomic benefit – that do just the opposite:Allowing more direct foreign investment
Lowering or removing tariffs
Allowing foreign access to capital markets

, Technological change, and even more so, economic liberalization have occurred against the backdrop of historical events that helped to open new borders to the flows of goods and information and to make politicians more open to reducing tariffs. These include:


The fall of the Soviet Bloc – The end of communism in eastern Europe at just the time that communications technology was really taking off allowed for the opening up and integration of many previously isolated markets. It also discredited the major ideological competitor to American liberal democracy and capitalism.
The 1973 oil embargo – In response to US aid for Israel during the Yom Kippur war, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries imposed an oil embargo that caused prices to rocket and strained western economies.Stagflation – Declining GNP and rising inflation – partially related to the oil embargo – led to a desire for political solutions that took the form of market liberalization under Thatcher and Reagan, paving the way for globalization.

, At the level of global and national economics, globalization has produced significant changes that reflect a more integrated world economy.World trade rates (the ratio or world imports to gross world product) have grown from 7% in 1938, to 10% in 1970, to 18% in 1996, to almost 25% in 2013.Foreign direct investment in developing countries has gone from $2.2 billion in 1970 to $154 billion in 1997 to $778 billion in 2013.The foreign exchange market has grown from $1 trillion per day in 1992 to over $3.5 trillion per day in 2014., Globalization has been shown to increase income inequality in developed nations, where the owners of capital invested abroad take in huge profits, while workers find their wages depressed by competition with foreign workers. For instance, the owner of a call center might see huge profits by outsourcing to India, but workers in US call centers will lose jobs or see their wages depressed. On the other hand, globalization has decreased income inequality in the developing world, resulting in overall less inequality in the world., Many fear that globalization is causing the Americanization of the rest of the world through the spread of American brands (Nike, McDonalds, Gap) and culture (Hollywood films and American TV). However, recent studies indicate that American influence is actually on the wane. The internet has empowered localities to create distinct ""civilization clusters,"" while emerging new media (the internet, satellite television) have fueled local media production more than they have borrowed from America., Globalization has accelerated environmental degradation by encouraging rapid industrialization and resource extraction in the developing world, as well as increasingly intensive energy use in the developed world.Major impacts include:Green house gas emissions rose 60% from 1970 to 2004.
The extinction or massive reduction of many animal and plant populations. 22% of the world's mammals are threatened with extinction, 31% of amphibians, and 35% of birds.
Deforestation has accelerated in order to create farmland used to grow export crops. Between 1990 and 2005, the world lost 3% of its forests.

, Globalization is partly defined by the interaction of people across the globe. How many people do you know that are from another country, or who have lived or traveled in one? How many people do you know who live in foreign countries now or frequently travel to one for work? How many of those people do you stay in touch with via email or the phone?

, Walk around your home, and everywhere you look you will likely see the result of the global flow of goods. Your IKEA couch might be designed in Sweden and produced in China.Your Samsung TV might have been designed in South Korea and assembled in Malaysia. Your clothes likely hail from all over the world: China, Sri Lanka, Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and a dozen other countries.Your refrigerator, which might be made in Hungary or China or South Africa, probably contains foods produced around the world.

, If you live outside the US, chances are you have watched Hollywood movies and seen TV shows popular in the States. But the flow goes the other way, too. Downton Abbey, one of the most popular shows in the US, is from England. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo came from Sweden. Games from England's Premier League (their top football / soccer division) average over 400,000 viewers in the United States. Al-Jazeera and the BBC both have a strong presence in American news broadcasting.

Keep the text brief.,
Write with a pencil.,
Include a date or source label.,
Create picture cards.,
Add color.,
Put word games on your cards.,
Laminate your cards.,
Use a piece of paper instead.,
Test out a flashcard creation app.",How to Study Using Index Cards1," Stick with short phrases instead of full sentences. Use abbreviations for words when possible. You will want to review the cards quickly and condensing the text makes sure that only the most important ideas make it onto the card. The very process of choosing the card’s text will kick-start the learning process.For example, if you are studying history you might write, “US” instead of “United States.” A shortened sentence might look like, “CC-America-1492,” the longer version being “Christopher Columbus arrived in America in 1492.”;
, If you work with a pencil you can modify your notes as you continue to study. A pencil also will not fade through the paper or notecard allowing you to see the information from the other side. If you do choose to use a pen make sure it’s ink will not bleed through., At the very top of each card write down the date that the information came from in your class notes or the page number of the source and the abbreviated source name. You want a way to track back the information from your card to the original source. This is helpful when citing or if you choose to sort your cards.If you are making notecards for a multiple classes, use different colored cards or keep them in rubber banded stacks., There is no rule that notecards must only contain text. For visual learners, drawing a quick image on a card might be the most helpful. Keep the image fairly basic and make it easily recognizable. Label parts of the image, if that will help you study.For example, if you are taking a biology class you might create a rough sketch of a cell and label the parts. You can then put the “key” on the back of the card. Flipping the card back and forth will allow you to learn the material.
A student practicing a foreign language might draw a picture of an object, such as a flower, on one side of the card with the translation on other side.
You can also make image notecards by photocopying an image from the textbook or slide notes and then cutting it down to notecard size. If you do this many times you will create a slideshow to match your text notes., To fight off boredom and more fully engage your memory, try applying a color scheme to your cards. You could use write in colored pencils, highlighters, or even fine-tipped markers. Underline particularly important information with color. Or, assign specific colors to particular card themes or topics to make for easier sorting.Have a plan when you start to use color on your cards, otherwise your cards could get cluttered and more difficult to study from.

, If you’ve come up with a quick way to remember a piece of information, put that down on a card. All types of mnemonic devices (or memory boosters) are helpful when studying. Keep it simple and put only one major piece of information on each card.A history student might put the question, “Who sailed the ocean blue?” on one side of a card with the answer, “Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492,” on the other side. Rhyming is a mnemonic device that helps with knowledge retention.

, Go to a copy shop and pay to have your cards laminated. Or, use a quick, at-home laminating machine and do it yourself. Or, get small plastic sleeves to go over your notecards, available at office supply store. The point is to protect your cards from water damage, especially if you plan to use them over a long period and will carry them around.

, If notecards don’t appeal to you for whatever reason, you can do the same basic concept using a sheet of white, unlined paper. Draw a line down the center of the page. On the left you can write a series of questions matched with their answers on the right side of the paper. As you study simply cover up one side or the other.Shuffling is not possible with this method so make sure to mix up the order in which you study the question/answer pairs.

, There are many apps available for download that can help you create and use notecards for studying. You can often get a basic version for free with add-ons for an additional fee. Brainscape, iStudious, and StudyBlue are all good options. It is helpful to read through online reviews before downloading any one app.Brainscape is an app that customizes your studying by displaying future cards based upon your past performance during card quizzes.StudyBlue is an interesting app in that it allows you to trade cards on certain subjects with students from around the globe. This is a good way to study if you want one concept explained from a variety of perspectives."

Recognize the difference between a bar chart and a histogram.,
Read the axes of the graph.,
Identify the ranges used.,
Use the top of the bar to read the frequency of that group.,
Gather data to be graphed.,
Choose your range bins.,
Separate the data into the bins.,
Graph the histogram.,
Label both of the axes.",How to Read Histograms," Bar charts and histograms are similar, but with some very specific differences. A bar chart groups numbers into categories, while histograms group numbers into ranges. Histograms are generally used to show the results of a continuous data set such as height, weight, time, etc.A bar graph has spaces between the bars, while a histogram does not.
A histogram often shows the frequency that an event occurs within the defined range. It shows you how many times that event happens.;
, The x-axis is the horizontal axis and the y-axis is the vertical axis. Both give you essential information to reading the histogram. Many histograms show you the results of the frequency of an occurrence and will have a y-axis indicating frequency. The x-axis will tell you the ranges into which the data have been grouped.For example, a histogram detailing the frequency of heights of pitchers in professional baseball will have an x-axis of height and a y-axis of frequency.

, The data is grouped into ranges or bins for graphing. Choosing the correct bin size is important in yielding a graph that will help you interpret your results. You want to choose ranges that are not too broad or too specific and allow you to see an underlying pattern of frequency in the data.For example, the average height of a professional baseball pitcher is 6’2”, but there will obviously be exceptions. Because the ranges of height will likely be between 5’6” and mid 6’6”, the bins should only vary by about an inch or two.
Another note on the ranges: the very first group may range from 5’6” to 5’8”, but it does not include 5’8”. Each group includes everything up to the beginning of the next group., If you want to know how many times an event occurred within a specific range, simply look at the top of the bar and read the value on the y-axis at that point.


For example, looking at the histogram, the number of players in the range of 6’0” to just under 6’2” is 50.

, If you want to gather data on the frequency of something, then graphing a histogram is a good way to look at your data. Whether you’re looking at the number of copies sold of a specific book or the weight distribution of cows on a farm, histograms are an easy way to get a broad picture of the overall pattern of the distribution of the data.

, When plotting the data, you must first decide how you want to divide it up into ranges. You want to choose bins that will give you a good representation, so you don’t want them to be too broad or too specific.For example, let’s say you had 10 data points of the weight of cows on your farm: 1150, 1400, 1100, 1600, 1800, 1550, 1750, 1350, 1400, and 1300. These weights vary by hundreds of pounds, so you want your bins to vary by hundreds of pounds as well.
Set bins every 200 pounds, starting at 1100 pounds going up to 1900 pounds.
1100-1300, 1300-1500, 1500-1700, 1700-1900 for a total of 4 bins.

, Once you have chosen your bins, you need to order and sort the data into these bins. Start by putting all of your values in ascending order. Then draw a line at the division of the bins. Count the number of values that fall into each bin. This number is the frequency of each range.


Remember, if the value is equal to the boundary of a bin, it falls in the bin to the right.For example, let’s say you had 10 data points of the weight of cows on your farm: 1150, 1400, 1100, 1600, 1800, 1550, 1650, 1350, 1400, and 1300.
Sorting them into ascending order: 1100, 1150, 1300, 1350, 1400, 1400, 1550, 1600, 1650, 1800
Divide them into bins: 1100, 1150| 1300, 1350, 1400, 1400| 1550, 1600, 1650| 1800
Count the frequencies: Bin 1: 2, Bin 2: 4, Bin 3: 3, Bin 4: 1

, You can construct your histogram by hand using the data you’ve sorted, or you can use a program such Excel or another statistics program. To draw by hand, simply draw out an x- and y- axis and set the scale on each one. The x-axis will be set by the bins you’ve already chosen and the scale of the y-axis is set by the frequency data. Draw bars for each bin that go up to the frequency value associated with the bin. Color them in and make sure all of the bars are touching each other.For the weight of cows example, the x-axis will range from 1100- 1900 in increments of 200; the scale of the y-axis will range from 1 to 4 in increments of 1.
The first bin, 1100-1300, has a frequency of 2, so draw a bar up to 2 and color it in. Directly next to the first bar, draw the second bar for the second bin which has a frequency of 4. The third bar goes up to 3 and the final bar goes up to 1.

, No graph is complete without labeled axes. Make them large and bold so they stand out. Make sure the labels accurately represent the data being presented. The y-axis will be labeled frequency, while the x-axis label will depend on the type of data collected.


For the example, the x-axis will be labeled something like “Weight of Cows in Pounds” and the y-axis will be labeled “Frequency”.

Decide on an index card format.,
Take notes over a specific topic.,
Outline your essay on cards.,
Take notes over specific sources.,
Create practice tests.,
Treat studying as a game.",How to Study Using Index Cards2," You will want to choose a particular studying approach early on in the process. This will depend a great deal on the subject being studied and your personal preferences. Once you choose a format it is best to stick with it or only change once at most.


For example, if you are studying history facts it may be helpful to create quiz questions or ID term notecards. If you are learning a foreign language your notecards will likely focus on vocabulary practice or sentence structuring.

, This is probably the most commonly used notecard study method. You put a topic on one side of the card and you add your notes on that subject to the opposite side. These types of cards are also sometimes called “summary” or “concept” cards.If you notice that you are putting a great deal of information on the back of one card, it may be time to split that particular subject into multiple cards.
This system is also used quite frequently for quick memorization of specific terms. You put the term on one side and the definition or alternate translation on the other.

, Your cards can also help you to write a long or short paper. Arrange your cards with notes or key points in the order that they will appear in your essay. Move the cards around until the order makes the most sense. This is much easier than re-writing entire portions of your paper. When you are ready to write simply move from card to card adding additional information or transition sentences as needed.To keep everything clear, once you’ve established the order of the cards write a brief note at the top of each regarding its final location. For example, all introduction cards might have “Intro” in the upper corner.
Keep a set of notecards with your source information listed as well. One source per card. Include the title, author, publisher, publication date, etc. This information will be used to create your bibliography and references., Whether you are writing a paper or preparing for a test over various sources, you can use notecards to keep track of your research materials. Put the title and author on one side of the card and few statements about the argument, evidence, methodology, etc., on the other side.Depending on your end goal, you could also include a few points of criticism as well. For example, “Crit. for being unreliable in sourcing.”
As you take notes over sources, make sure to include quotations when pulling directly from the text. Otherwise, you could accidentally plagiarize if you use these materials when writing later.

, Put yourself in the mindset of your teacher or professor and ask: what questions would you include on an exam or test? Which topics must be covered? And, which ones are the least important? Come up with a list of the very best questions that you can think of and then transfer them to notecards. Put one question per card, leaving the flip side for brief answers.Use your cards to create a realistic practice test. Randomly select the same number of cards that will appear on the test. Give yourself the correct amount of time to finish answering. It is also helpful to write out your answers if that is what you’ll have to do on the actual test. When you are finished, flip the cards over and check your answers.You might also approach your professor or teacher after you’ve created the cards and ask them to look them over. Not all instructors will do this, but if they do it could help you a great deal., To make studying more exciting, it might help to get a bit competitive. Some apps with allow you to engage in flashcard competitions against your peers or classmates. This is like having a study group that meets virtually. You can even set-up the competitions to follow a timer. Quizlet is one of the more notable apps in this category."

Keep your study sessions brief.,
Make and stick to a study schedule.,
Carry your cards with you.,
Mix up the order of your cards.,
Set aside the cards that you know.,
Work with a study group.",How to Study Using Index Cards3," Aim for 20-30 minutes at a time. Give yourself at least a 10 minute break in between sessions. Studying for long periods of time without breaks can actually breed confusion, so short intervals are the key to retention.It might be helpful to turn on a timer as you start each session. This will ensure that you take your breaks., Procrastination and cramming can backfire when it comes time to take a test. Instead, spread out your studying over days or even weeks, if possible. Look at your exam schedule or paper deadlines and plan accordingly. Even a few minutes a day is better than none at all., In the period immediately before a test, keep your cards close to you and study them whenever possible. Look for a few minutes here or there in your everyday routine. If you are watching TV, study during the commercials. Repetition and exposure to the information will make the difference in retention.


Get creative and use clips to hang your notecards around the room. This allows you to study while cleaning up.Or, punch a hole in the corner of your card set and put them on a key ring for easy carrying., Your mind will become bored if you go through your cards in the same order over and over again. Shuffle your cards, throw them on a table and mix them up, or put them in a jar and pull one out at a time. The card that you see each time should be unpredictable, just as a question will be on a test.

, Once you feel comfortable with the information on a particular card, place it in a new stack with others like it. This will allow you to spend more time working with the topics or terms that you’ve yet to master. However, don’t forget this ‘known’ stack entirely, be sure to look it over too, just less frequently., Get together with a group of your classmates and go through your cards together. You may find that other people covered areas that you missed and vice versa. Try to teach each other the material to test your knowledge level. Quiz each other using the cards as a question bank."

Decide whether you want to do English or Literature.,
If you already know what university courses you want to do (or at least have a pretty good idea), take a look at their prerequisites.

,
Choose at least one List B subject.,
Decide whether you want to do a foreign language or not.,
Choose your other subjects based on what you enjoy and/or what you are good at.",How to Choose Subjects for WACE," In the English exam, you have to do two unseen analyses, an essay on a text you have studied and a creative writing piece. In the Literature exam, you have to do one unseen analysis and two extended responses on texts you have studied. Apparently they are about the same difficulty, just that they test different things (creativity and ability to analyse a range of texts versus analysing a few texts in depth).;
,, Maths is generally a good choice as many university courses do require at least 2CD maths. 2CD maths gets scaled down quite a lot though, so try to do at least 2CD in Year 11. Chemistry is also a good choice in covering prerequisites though most courses that require chemistry require maths as well.

, As well as being great for travel, your career and even just your everyday life, LOTE also gives you a little boost to your ATAR. Don't let LOTE classes in lower school put you off––by Year 11 and 12 you'll only be in class with people who want to be there, and you will learn at a much better pace so things will be kept interesting.

, If you like maths, doing Maths Specialist is a decent choice as the two courses complement each other well. Ditto with doing a mix of sciences or social sciences. If you aren't totally passionate about any particular field, it might be better to do a mix of subjects so that you don't get sick of doing an overload of maths/science/social sciences day in, day out. Also bear in mind that many Curriculum Council awards require you to do at least two List A and two List B subjects and that there are certain subject combinations that are ""banned"" (i.e. they can't both count towards your ATAR), like English/Lit and Bio/Human Bio.

Learn how a clock is divided.,
Use the little hand to read the hour.,
Use the big hand to read the minutes.,
Put these together to get the time.,
Differentiate between AM and PM.",How to Read a Clock1," A clock is divided into 12 sections. On top of the clock, you will see a ""12."" To the right of the ""12"", you will see a ""1."" If you follow the numbers, going right or ""clockwise,"" they will move from ""1"" to""12.""The numbers marking each sections are the hours.
The sections between numbers are divided into five minute segments. Sometimes, there are tiny lines running along the clock dividing these segments.;
, Clocks have two hands: a little hand and a big hand. The little hand marks the hour. Whichever number it's pointing at is the hour of the day.For example, say the little hand is pointing to ""1."" This means it's in the one o'clock hour.

, The big hand counts minutes rather than hours. Use it to determine how many minutes it is are into any given hour.When the little hand points to 12, it's the top of the hour. If the big hand was pointed to one, and the little hand was pointing to 12, you would say it's ""one o'clock.""
Otherwise, multiply the number the little hand points to by ""5"" to get the minutes. If the little hand is pointing to 3, for example, it's fifteen minutes past the hour. If you don't know how to multiply, add five minutes for every section on the clock. If the hand is pointing to one, it's five minutes past the hour. If the hand's pointing to two, it's ten minutes, and so on.
If the big hand is between numbers, estimate the rough time. For example, if the big hand is halfway between three and four, it's seventeen to eighteen minutes past the hour.

, Once you've found the hour and the minutes, you can tell time. For example, if the little hand is pointed to one and the big hand is pointed to three, it would be one fifteen (or 1:15)., You can't tell AM or PM by reading a clock. You have to know the time of day. From midnight to noon the next day, the time is in AM. From noon to midnight, the time is in PM.For example, say it's early in the morning and the big hand is pointed to nine and the little hand is pointed to twelve. Given the time of day, it's nine o'clock AM.

Understand the assignment.,
Determine what you hope to learn.,
Brainstorm ideas.,
Eliminate items from your list.,
Select a topic that interests you.,
Read background information about your topic.,
Get specific.,
Start with a fresh perspective.,
Improve upon something that already exists.,
Keep investigating.",How to Find a Topic for a School Project," As with any work your teacher assigns you, you want to know what is expected of you with regard to the project before you sit down to decide on a topic. Understanding the project is key for picking a topic that will meet the teacher’s requirements and keep you from getting frustrated as you work.


If the teacher has provided an assignment sheet, read it over with a pen or highlighter in hand and mark important details pertaining to the types of topic you may choose, the length of the presentation (if any), materials, sources required, etc. Pay attention to the due date as well—you don’t want to spend days working on a project only to run out of time before you finish!
Write down any questions or concerns with the project assignment and ask your teacher (or, if you’re on a tight deadline and the teacher is unavailable, ask a reliable classmate). Be as specific as possible with your questions. For example, instead of saying, “I don’t understand the presentation,” you can say, “I don’t understand how the presentation is supposed to be formatted.” The latter example is much more likely to get you a clear explanation of what you are supposed to do.;
, If you do a project “just to get it done” or “because you have to,” you’re less likely to enjoy it and less likely do your best work. Instead, try looking at the project as an opportunity to increase your skills, knowledge, and ability.Think about areas where you skills could use improvement and whether there things you’d like to or need to learn. How about areas where you’ve shown some weakness? It’s very common to shy away from working in areas that we don’t consider our strongest, but that can often be a mistake, as it keeps us from building ourselves up in those areas and widening our range of talents.

, Get out a piece of paper and a pen/pencil or open a blank document on your computer and set a timer for 5 minutes (don’t worry if 5 minutes isn’t long enough—you can always go longer if you need to). Then start the timer and write down every idea that comes into your mind with regard to your project assignment—words, phrases, sentences, whatever.


Write it all down! There are no good or bad ideas in brainstorming.Every idea is an essential element of finding the right topic for your project. So don’t judge what you’re writing…just write!
You’re going for a wide array of ideas as you brainstorm, so don’t be too focused or specific just yet.Remember—write down everything that comes to mind. Even if it seems kind of “out there,” just get it out. You’ll be able to get rid of or rethink ideas later on. Right now the task is just getting stuff down on paper.
If you work better with other people, enlist the help of a friend or family member in your brainstorming session. Make sure you tell him/her what is required by the assignment sheet (or let them read it), then trade ideas back and forth. This process will naturally take longer than a five-minute solo brainstorming session, but it can yield great results.
If you’re the technological type, there are a variety of free online tools, such as Bubbl.us and Popplet, that help with brainstorming., If you really did write down everything that came to your mind during your brainstorming session, then you’ve probably got a pretty sizable list. This is good! Now look it over and scratch off any items that don’t meet the assignment directions; any that won't allow you to learn what you determined you want to learn from this project; and any that don't interest you.


This should eliminate quite a few options from your list, which is the points. The goal is to start broad and then narrow the list down until you’ve got 3 or 4 topics more specifically tailored to your desires and the needs of the assignment.

, This may seem obvious, but it can’t be overstated. You don’t want to spend 5 hours—let alone 5 days or 5 weeks, depending on the size of the assignment—working on a topic that bores you to tears. This will make you unhappy and result in a project that’s less than your best work.When thinking about which of the remaining topics most interest you, consider things that overlap with your skills and hobbies, your future career, social or political areas of concern, or academic areas of strength.. If you have to do a history project on the United States in the nineteenth century, for example, and you plan to work in government, then you might choose an area such as “the Women’s Suffrage Movement.” Or if you need to do a project for photography class and you enjoy visiting the city, you might choose an area such as “urban renewal.”
If none of the topics on your list seems genuinely interesting, think about how some of them can be tweaked or revised so that they more fully reflect your interests, strengths, areas you’d like to improve in, etc.

, Reading about your selected area online or in the library will help you to get a sense of the subject or field.It will also give you an idea of what’s already out there and what’s been done, what kind of ideas you can build on, etc.


It’s important to do some research on the general area you’ve chosen before committing to a very specific topic. This way you can have a firm sense of what’s out there in terms of resources and the range of information.

, Though you start broad, eventually, you will want to narrow your topic down to a workable size.How specific you get will, of course, depend on the specific assignment you have been given by your teacher and your grade level, but you can’t expect to do a project about ALL of Antarctica in 2 days’ time.


It’s important to avoid project topics that are too broad and general because you will never be able to satisfyingly cover all of the relevant information, read all of the relevant sources, and so on.It’s much better to provide a detailed look at a smaller subject, something that you can speak or write (or draw) about in depth.
Again, go back to your assignment sheet to determine how specific your topic should be. Your teacher may have even provided example topics that you can compare your idea against. If so, you should definitely use the examples as a guide!

, If you’re genuinely excited and curious about your topic, chances are you’ll come up with something original. A curiosity to learn is essential for motivating you to pursue ideas in a creative way and to put the time and effort into making your project “new.”

, One way to create an original project is to improve on someone else’s idea, for example, by repeating a science experiment that someone else has already done and then adding onto the experiment to make it more complex or useful.In this instance you’re not creating something entirely new from scratch, but the originality comes in seeing a worthwhile project and finding a way to make it better.


This mode is especially valuable when coming up with ideas for a science project, as you can often take an experiment that someone else has already done and find a way to tweak it to test something new or prove something slightly different.

, Oftentimes you start a project out with what you do know, but one way to ensure that your project will lead to something that's truly original is to keep exploring the topic until it leads to what you don’t know.Usually, this means you’ve landed on a topic/information that most people in your class don’t know either.


Even if the topic you choose right out of the gate of your brainstorming process isn’t the most original thing in world, you still have the opportunity to shape and mold your topic and your project as you go through the tasks of reading and preparing to do the project. Originality can come in at a lot of different points throughout the process of doing the project—it doesn’t necessarily have to be something that’s there right from the start.

, darkfield microscopic documentation of presence of the Treponema pallidum bacteria from scrapes off a syphilitic sore, in collaboration with clinical findings. Use the gold standard test to determine who has the characteristic and who does not. For illustration, let us say 100 people have it and 900 do not.

, For example, let this test be a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test to screen for syphilis. Use it to test the 1000 people in the sample.

, Do the same for people that do not have the characteristic (as determined by the gold standard). You will end up with four numbers. People with the characteristic AND tested positive are the true positives (TP). People with the characteristic AND tested negative are the false negatives (FN). People without the characteristic AND tested positive are the false positives (FP). People without the characteristic AND tested negative are the true negatives (TN) For example, let us suppose you did the RPR test on the 1000 patients. Among the 100 patients with syphilis, 95 of them tested positive, and 5 tested negative. Among the 900 patients without syphilis, 90 tested positive, and 810 tested negative. In this case, TP=95, FN=5, FP=90, and TN=810.

, In the case above, that would be 95/(95+5)= 95%. The sensitivity tells us how likely the test is come back positive in someone who has the characteristic. Among all people that have the characteristic, what proportion will test positive? 95% sensitivity is pretty good.

, In the case above, that would be 810/(90+810)= 90%. The specificity tells us how likely the test is to come back negative in someone who does not have the characteristic. Among all people without the characteristic, what proportion will test negative? 90% specificity is pretty good.

, In the case above, that would be 95/(95+90)= 51.4%. The positive predictive value tells us how likely someone is to have the characteristic if the test is positive. Among all people that test positive, what proportion truly has the characteristic? 51.4% PPV means that if you test positive, you have a 51.4% chance of actually having the disease.

, In the case above, that would be 810/(810+5)= 99.4%. The negative predictive value tells us how likely someone is to not have the characteristic if the test is negative. Among all people that test negative, what proportion truly does not have the characteristic? 99.4% NPV means that if you test negative, you have a 99.4% chance of not having disease.

If the first number reads ""2"", for example, it's in the two o'clock hour., The second number on a digital clock, found after the colon, marks the minutes into the hour. For example, if it reads ""11,"" it is 11 minutes into the hour., Once you have both the numbers, you should be able to tell the time. If the clock reads ""2:11,"" this means the time is two eleven. The hour is two, and it's eleven minutes into that hour., Some digital clocks will say if it's AM or PM somewhere on the clock. In the absence of this label, remember time of day. Times are marked as AM if they fall between midnight and noon. Times are marked as PM if they fall between noon and midnight.

An ""I"" is counted as one, a ""V"" is counted as 5, and ""X"" is counted as 10. If a symbol appears before another symbol, it's subtracted from the value. If a symbol appears after another symbol, it's added to the value.One to three are simply written as ""I, II, III."" Four is written as ""IV."" The ""I"" subtracts one from the ""V"" (which symbolizes 5), adding up to four.
Five is then marked by a ""V"" and the numbers leading up to 10 are marked by adding ""I"" symbols. The number ""VI"" is six, ""VII"" is seven, and so on.
Ten is marked by an ""X."" Eleven and 12 are marked by adding to the ""X."" Eleven is written as ""XI"" and 12 is written as ""XII.""

, Not all clocks have numbers. They may have symbols marking the hours instead. Starting at the top of the clock, mentally mark this as twelve. Then, move to the right and count ""1, 2, 3, 4..."" and so on. This will help you determine which hour each symbol marks., Some digital clocks are written in military time but, luckily, this is easy to convert. From one AM to noon, military time is the same as civilian time. After noon, you have to do some work to determine time.Numbers lower ""10"" are marked by placing a zero in front of them. Nine o'clock PM, for example, is written as ""0900.""
Subtract ""1200"" from the time to determine times that do not start with a zero. For example, 1300 subtracted from 1200 is 100. In military time, therefore, 1300 hours is one o'clock PM.

This primary/elementary school math is essential before you start learning algebra. If you don't have these skills mastered, it will be tricky to tackle the more complex concepts taught in algebra. If you need a refresher on these operations, try our article on basic math skills.


You don't necessarily need to be great at doing these basic operations in your head to do algebra problems. Many algebra classes will allow you to use a calculator to save time when doing these simple operations. You should, however, at least know how to do these operations without a calculator for when you aren't allowed to use one.;
, One of the trickiest things about solving an algebra equation as a beginner is knowing where to start. Luckily, there's a specific order for solving these problems: first do any math operations in parentheses, then do exponents, then multiply, then divide, then add, and finally subtract. A handy tool for remembering this order of operations is the acronym PEMDAS. Learn how to apply the order of operations here. To recap, the order of operations is:



Parentheses

Exponents

Multiplication

Division

Addition

Subtraction
The order of operations is important in algebra because doing the operations in an algebra problem in the wrong order can sometimes affect the answer. For instance, if we're dealing with the math problem 8 + 2 × 5, if we add 2 to 8 first, we get 10 × 5 = 50, but if we multiply 2 and 5 first, we get 8 + 10 = 18. Only the second answer is correct.

, In algebra, it's common to use negative numbers, so it's smart to review how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide negatives before starting to learn algebra. Below are just a few negative number basics to keep in mind — for more information, see our articles on adding and subtracting negative numbers and dividing and multiplying negative numbers.


On a number line, a negative version of a number is the same distance from zero as the positive, but in the opposite direction.
Adding two negative numbers together makes the number more negative (in other words, the digits will be higher, but since the number is negative, it counts as being lower)
Two negative signs cancel out — subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number
Multiplying or dividing two negative numbers gives a positive answer.
Multiplying or dividing a positive number and a negative number gives a negative answer.

, While simple algebra problems can be a snap to solve, more complicated problems can take many, many steps. To avoid errors, keep your work organized by starting a new line every time you make a step toward solving your problem. If you're dealing with a two-sided equation, try to write all the equals signs (""=""s) underneath each other. This way, if you make a mistake somewhere, it'll be much easier to find and correct.


For example, to solve the equation 9/3 - 5 + 3 × 4, we might keep our problem organized like this:



9/3 - 5 + 3 × 4
9/3 - 5 + 12
3 - 5 + 12
3 + 7
10





, In algebra, you'll start to see letters and symbols appear in your math problems, rather than just numbers. These are called variables. Variables aren't as confusing as they may first seem - they're just ways of showing numbers with unknown values. Below are just a few common examples of variables in algebra:


Letters like x, y, z, a, b, and c
Greek letters like theta, or θ
Note that not all symbols are unknown variables. For instance, pi, or π, is always equal to about 3.14159.

, As mentioned above, variables are basically just numbers with unknown values. In other words, there's some number that can go in place of the variable to make the equation work. Usually, your goal in an algebra problem is to figure out what the variable is — think of it as a ""mystery number"" that you're trying to discover.


For example, in the equation 2x + 3 = 11, x is our variable. This means that there's some value that goes in the place of x to make the left side of the equation equal 11. Since 2 × 4 + 3 = 11, in this case, x = 4.
An easy way to start understanding variables is to replace them with question marks in algebra problems. For example, we might re-write the equation 2 + 3 + x = 9 as 2 + 3 + ? = 9. This makes it easier to understand what we're trying to do — we just need to find out what number to add to 2 + 3 = 5 to get 9. The answer is again 4, of course.

, What do you do if the same variable appears more than once in the equation? Though this situation may seem tricky to solve, you can actually treat variables how you'd treat normal numbers — in other words, you can add them, subtract them, and so on as long as you only combine variables that are alike. In other words, x + x = 2x, but x + y doesn't equal 2xy.


For example, let's look at the equation 2x + 1x = 9. In this case, we can add 2x and 1x together to get 3x = 9. Since 3 x 3 = 9, we know that x = 3.
Note again that you can only add the same variables together. In the equation 2x + 1y = 9, we can't combine 2x and 1y because they are two different variables.
This is also true for when one variable has a different exponent than another. For instance, in the equation 2x + 3x2 = 10, we can't combine 2x and 3x2 because the x variables have different exponents. See How to Add Exponents for more information.

, Solving an equation in algebra usually means finding out what the variable is. Algebra equations are usually set up with numbers and/or variables on both sides, like this: x + 2 = 9 × 4. To figure out what the variable is, you need to get it by itself on one side of the equals sign. Whatever is left on the other side of the equals sign is your answer.


In the example (x + 2 = 9 × 4), to get x by itself on the left side of the equation, we need to get rid of the ""+ 2"". To do this, we'll simply subtract 2 from that side, leaving us with x = 9 × 4. However, to keep both sides of the equation equal, we also need to subtract 2 from the other side. This leaves us with x = 9 × 4 - 2. Following the order of operations, we multiply first, then subtract, giving us an answer of x = 36 - 2 = 34.

, As we just saw above, getting x by itself on one side of the equals sign usually means getting rid of the numbers next to it. To do this, we perform the ""opposite"" operation on both sides of the equation. For instance, in the equation x + 3 = 0, since we see a ""+ 3"" next to our x, we'll put a ""- 3"" on both sides. The ""+ 3"" and ""- 3"", leaving x by itself and ""-3"" on the other side of the equals sign, like this: x = -3.


In general, addition and subtraction are like ""opposites"" — do one to get rid of the other. See below:



For addition, subtract. Example: x + 9 = 3 → x = 3 - 9

For subtraction, add. Example: x - 4 = 20 → x = 20 + 4






, Multiplication and division are a little harder to work with than addition and subtraction, but they have the same ""opposite"" relationship. If you see a ""× 3"" on one side, you'll cancel it by dividing both sides by 3, and so on.


With multiplication and division, you must perform the opposite operation on everything on the other side of the equals sign, even if it's more than one number. See below:



For multiplication, divide. Example: 6x = 14 + 2→ x = (14 + 2)/6

For division, multiply. Example: x/5 = 25 → x = 25 × 5






, Exponents are a fairly advanced pre-algebra topic — if you don't know how to do them, see our basic exponent article for more information. The ""opposite"" of an exponent is the root that has the same number as it. For example, the opposite of the 2 exponent is a square root (√), the opposite of the 3 exponent is the cube root (3√), and so on.


It may be a little confusing, but, in these cases, you take the root of both sides when dealing with an exponent. On the other hand, you take the exponent of both sides when you're dealing with a root. See below:



For exponents, take the root. Example: x2 = 49 → x = √49

For roots, take the exponent. Example: √x = 12 → x = 122






, If you're having a hard time visualizing an algebra problem, try using diagrams or pictures to illustrate your equation. You can even try using a group of physical objects (like blocks or coins) instead if you have some handy.


For example, let's solve the equation x + 2 = 3 by using boxes (☐)



x +2 = 3
☒+☐☐ =☐☐☐
At this point, we'll subtract 2 from both sides by simply removing 2 boxes (☐☐) from both sides:
☒+☐☐-☐☐ =☐☐☐-☐☐
☒=☐, or x = 1





As another example, let's try 2x = 4



☒☒ =☐☐☐☐
At this point, we'll divide both sides by two by separate the boxes on each side into two groups:
☒|☒ =☐☐|☐☐
☒ = ☐☐, or x = 2






, When converting a word problem into algebra, try to check your formula by plugging in simple values for your variable. Does your equation make sense when x=0? When x=1? When x = -1? It's easy to make simple mistakes by writing down p=6d when you mean p=d/6, but these are easily caught if you do a quick sanity check on your work before going further.


For example, let's say we're told that a football field is 30 yards (27.4 m) longer than it is wide. We use the equation l = w + 30 to represent this. We can test whether this equation makes sense by plugging in simple values for w. For instance, if the field is w = 10 yards (9.1 m) wide, it will be 10 + 30 = 40 yards (36.6 m) long. If it's 30 yards (27.4 m) wide, it will be 30 + 30 = 60 yards (54.9 m) long, and so on. This makes sense — we'd expect the field to get longer as it gets wider, so this equation is reasonable.

, Answers in algebra and other advanced forms of math aren't always round, easy numbers. They can often be decimals, fractions, or irrational numbers. A calculator can help you find these complicated answers, but keep in mind that your teacher may require you to give your answer in its exact form, not in an unwieldy decimal.


For instance, let's say that we narrow down an algebra equation to x = 12507. If we type 12507 into a calculator, we'll get a huge string of decimals (plus, since the calculator's screen is only so large, it can't display the entire answer.) In this case, we may want to represent our answer as simply 12507 or else simplify the answer by writing it in scientific notation.

, One of the trickiest algebra skills of all is factoring — a sort of shortcut for getting complex equations into simple forms. Factoring is a semi-advanced algebra topic, so consider consulting the article linked above if you're having trouble mastering it. Below are just a few quick tips for factoring equations:


Equations with the form ax + ba factor to a(x + b). Example: 2x + 4 = 2(x + 2)
Equations with the form ax2 + bx factor to cx((a/c)x + (b/c)) where c is the biggest number that divides into a and b evenly. Example: 3y2 + 12y = 3y(y + 4)
Equations with the form x2 + bx + c factor to (x + y)(x + z) where y × z = c and yx + zx = bx. Example: x2 + 4x + 3 = (x + 3)(x + 1).

, Progress in algebra (and any other kind of math) requires lots of hard work and repetition. Don't worry — by paying attention in class, doing all of your assignments, and seeking out help from your teacher or other students when you need it, algebra will begin to become second nature.

, If you're having a hard time getting the hang of algebra, don't worry — you don't have to learn it on your own. Your teacher is the first person you should turn to with questions. After class, politely ask your teacher for help. Good teachers will usually be willing to re-explain the day's topic at an after-school appointment and may even be able to give you extra practice materials.


If, for some reason, your teacher can't help you, try asking them about tutoring options at your school. Many schools will have some sort of after-school program that can help you get the extra time and attention you need to start excelling at your algebra. Remember, using free help that's available to you isn't something to be embarrassed about — it's a sign that you're smart enough to solve your problem!

, Graphs can be valuable tools in algebra because they allow you to display ideas that you'd usually need numbers for in easy-to-understand pictures. Usually, in beginning algebra, graphing problems are restricted to equations with two variables (usually x and y) and are done on a simple 2-D graph with an x axis and a y axis. With these equations, all you need to do is plug in a value for x, then solve for y (or do the reverse) to get two numbers that correspond to a point on the graph.


For example, in the equation y = 3x, if we plug in 2 for x, we get y = 6. This means that the point (2,6) (two spaces to the right of center and six spaces above center) is part of this equation's graph.
Equations with the form y = mx + b (where m and b are numbers) are especially common in basic algebra. These equations always have a slope of m and cross the y axis at y = b.

, What do you do when your equation doesn't use an equals sign? Nothing much different than what you'd normally do, it turns out. For inequalities, which use signs like > (""greater than"") and < (""less than""), just solve as normal. You'll be left with an answer that's either less than or greater than your variable.


For instance, with the equation 3 > 5x - 2, we would solve just like we would for a normal equation:



3 > 5x - 2
5 > 5x
1 > x, or x < 1.




This means that every number less than one works for x. In other words, x can be 0, -1, -2, and so on. If we plug these numbers into the equation for x, we'll always get an answer less than 3.

, One algebra topic that many beginners struggle with is solving quadratic equations. Quadratics are equations with the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are numbers (except that a can't be 0.) These equations are solved with the formula x = /2a . Be careful — the +/- sign means you need to find the answers for adding and subtracting, so you can have two answers for these types of problems.


As an example, let's solve the quadratic formula 3x2 + 2x -1 = 0.



x = /2a
x = /2(3)
x = /6
x = /6
x = /6
x = -1 and 1/3






, Solving more than one equation at once may sound super-tricky, but when you're working with simple algebra equations, it's not actually that hard. Often, algebra teachers use a graphing approach for solving these problems. When you're working with a system of two equations, the solutions are the points on a graph that the lines for both equations cross at.


For example, let's say we're working with a system that contains the equations y = 3x - 2 and y = -x - 6. If we draw these two lines on a graph, we get one line that goes up at a steep angle, and one that goes down at a mild angle. Since these lines cross at the point (-1,-5), this is a solution to the system.If we want to check our problem, we can do this by plugging our answer into the equations in the system — a right answer should ""work"" for both.



y = 3x - 2
-5 = 3(-1) - 2
-5 = -3 - 2
-5 = -5
y = -x - 6
-5 = -(-1) - 6
-5 = 1 - 6
-5 = -5




Both equations ""check out,"" so our answer is right!

Your English is going to be at its best. Find a book on tape or a clip online that you can mimic. Does your English sound the same?


Or record yourself reading from a book. You'll be able to actually hear yourself (which we surprisingly have trouble with in real time) and be able to pinpoint the quirks in your English and where you slow down and have trouble. Then rerecord it and see how you've improved!;
, If your hands are full or you don't have a recording device, simply read aloud -- ideally, every day for at least 15 or 20 minutes. You'll get used to speaking for longer periods of time and forming long sentences won't phase you. And you'll run into words you can add to your vocabulary.


It's best to choose books with lots of dialogue. The language is generally more real and a bit simpler; after all, dialogue is conversation. Being able to read poetry is great but conversations are a much more practical skill, you know?

, We live in such a digital age; even if you think you don't have native speakers at your disposal, you actually do. Scientific American, CBC, BBC and Australia's ABC Radio are great mp3s to get started with, but there's also a million podcasts out there and handfuls of news stations, too. And the best part is that these people generally speak clearly and have pretty generic accents.


Another bonus? You'll have interesting things to talk about in English! You'll be up on all the news - even if you're just repeating what you've heard (not like anyone will know!). You're improving your English by expanding your knowledge. Two birds with one stone, really.

, Alright, so it's not as good as listening to spoken news/podcasts/etc., but it is good. If you can concentrate on one song a day or so, even better. Just make sure you actively try to understand it. Google the lyrics and sing along!


It's best to stick to ballads -- songs that go a bit more slowly. Pick one a day until you have it mostly memorized and understand what the words actually mean. It's a great way to learn idioms and slang, too.

, An integral part of speaking is hearing or listening. Because of this, the easiest way to involve yourself in a conversation without actually having one is to watch English TV and movies. If you absolutely have to, turn the subtitles on -- but try to resist!


Movies are great because you watch them over and over; the more you watch them, the more things you'll pick up. TV is good though, too, because you develop relationships with the characters and you grow accustomed to how they talk and the quirks of their speech.

, As you go about your day-to-day, talk to yourself. What are you doing? What are you feeling? What do you see, taste, smell, hear? What are you touching? What are you thinking? Right now you're reading wikiHow. You're sitting in a chair (probably). Maybe you're listening to music or have the TV on in the background. The possibilities are limitless.


Think the future and the past, too. What are you going to do next? What did you just do? You gotta get to thinking in English consistently to truly get better. The more you think in English, the faster it'll come out.

, Every language has a musicality about it. You can have absolutely perfect grammar and if you don't have the rhythm down, you won't have that native sound. So whether you're talking to English speakers or you're watching on TV, look for emphasis, intonation, and emotion. How well can you mimic it?


In every sentence, there are parts that are longer, louder, and said at a higher pitch. In the phrase ""rock and roll,"" saying ""rock AND roll"" sounds very strange. But ""rockin roll"" sounds a lot more natural. This is the icing on the English cake!

, Just as every language has a musicality, it has a tendency to use certain mouth movements as well. You could be making the right sound, technically, but if your mouth is in the wrong place, it won't come out correctly. That's your lips and your tongue for the record!


You can't exactly stop someone and ask them about the current position of their tongue. But it is something you can be conscious of in your own language. If you hear someone say a word and you can't mimic it perfectly, experiment! Maybe it just needs to be a bit further back or higher in your mouth. It's in their somewhere!

, Whenever you're speaking to someone or hear others speaking and you catch a word you don't fully understand, write it down and look it up (you have the spelling skills, right?). Instead of thinking to yourself later that night, ""Man, what was that word again?"" you'll be able to flip to your notebook and remember. Boom. Learning!


It's good enough to write it down and look it up, though. Oh no, no, no. You gotta make it a point to use that word you just learned! (Or you'll forget it.) So later that night or the next day, work it into your speech. Make it part of your own.

, If you're in a class that meets every day, that's pretty good. You need exposure as often as possible. But you know what's better? Being in two classes so you're speaking all the time. One could be a big ol' group class that teachers you grammar and all that boring stuff and one could be a one-on-one course that gives you that individualized attention and concentration on your speech. Weekends aren't freebie non-English days, either!


There's also accent reduction classes, business classes, travel classes, and many other topicalized English classes. Heck, if you're into cooking, take a class (in English) about cooking. Maybe there's an intramural sports team or gym class you could join? If you find something you're interested in, you'll be interested in it in English, too.

, In order to become more than just a mediocre speaker of English, you have to take control of your life and force English into it. You have to let it infiltrate every domain of your life -- not just school or in your class. All of them. How to do that? Here are some ideas:


You have friends that are studying English too, right? Form a study group. Even though they're not native speakers, just getting your mind thinking in English is useful. You'll learn from each other and provide a non-stressful environment for learning.
Set up your home as a welcome place for tourists and foreigners looking to get situated in your county. There are a number of websites you can get into like AirBnB, Couchsurfing, Hospitality Club, BeWelcome, and Global Free loaders. Then you'll have to speak English at home!

, But when the tourists aren't knocking down your door, what do you do? Get on chat rooms, of course! (The safe ones, please.) So many people are just looking to talk. And if you find a friend, you can do video or voice chats, too.


There are chat rooms dedicated to everything. You do not have to enter a chat room called Strangers 101. Pick an interest of yours and do a quick search for those chatting about it.
Not your cup of tea? Then how about interactive video games like World of Warcraft or Second Life? You can assume an identity and still hone your skills.
Get a penpal! PenPal World and Pen-Pal are two sites you should get to checking out. The person on the other end is probably looking for the same thing you are.

, If that pocket dictionary and notebook isn't being used, you'll need to find another way to start expanding your vocabulary. In the books that you read, the Internet sites that you visit, the TV you watch, pick a couple of words to write down and to make a conscious effort of using. It's the only way you'll remember them!


If you don't use it, you'll lose it. Have all these words in a notebook that you can refer back to whenever you need. Take the time to go through it on occasion and have those lightbulb moments of the words you've forgotten.

, It may seem tedious, but it'll be totally worth it. The International Phonetic Alphabet is a system of symbols that correlate to sounds. If you run into a word you don't know how to pronounce, all you gotta do is look it up. The IPA is right there, you can read it, and tada! You know exactly how to pronounce it. It's almost like magic.


Since English is so messed up -- being the child of German, French, and Latin (and sprinklings of around 247 others) -- learning the IPA is primo. It's not such an issue for languages like Spanish where the sounds are fairly consistent. C'mon, ""cough,"" ""rough,"" ""through?"" What is going on?!

, It sounds a little harsh, but give it a second. Let's say you set up an ""English only"" rule at the dinner table at home (a really good idea, by the way); how long will it last? Probably not very long. But if you have some type of incentive program (if we speak only English for two weeks straight, we'll go out to eat, etc.) or punishment ($1 for every time the native language gets spoken, say), it'll be a lot more likely to stick.


These should be rules for your home, definitely -- you want to avoid slipping back to your native tongue as much as possible -- but they're good ideas for your classes or study groups, too. Maybe in your study group if someone doesn't speak English, they're bringing the food next time!

, If you do get in the presence of an English speaker, it's so easy to just have your mind freeze up, your body freeze up, and have every single word of English you know escape you. You end up stuttering if you can get anything out at all and leave feeling terrible, never wanting to speak English again. Rest assured it's not just you!


This happens to all of us. All. That's 8 Ls. The only way to avoid it is just to realize that it's not that big of a deal, it'll end shortly, and no one's going to judge you for it. English is becoming so prominent all over the world that even native speakers are used to hearing all different levels. You won't say anything they haven't heard before!

, Above all else, you need to be patient. Learning a language is a process that can take years. If you get frustrated with yourself, you risk quitting. That would yield the worst results of all! So don't be so hard on yourself -- it'll come. It will. You gotta trust.


The easiest way to not get super fed up with all of this is to have a good way to check your progress. That means keeping the same notebook, filling it up, rewatching those shows that you have mastered now, and once in a while revisiting things that used to be difficult. The reminder of how awesome you're getting will be quite the boost!

Choose a good course.,
Don't waste money on an 'introduction' or 'starter' course.,
Do not waste your time or money taking an online teacher certification course.,
The CELTA course generally takes 4 weeks, full time and can be very intensive.,
Take a good, accredited course, even if it costs more money and takes more time.,
Get a recognised qualification.,
The course is a combination of theory and practice.",How to Get Certification to Teach English As a Foreign Language," The main, initial qualification is called the CELTA (Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults) or Cert TESOL (Certificate in Teaching English as a Second Language).;
, They aren't worth anything to potential employers and are a waste of both your time and money.

, You will just be throwing your money away. Any half reputable school will not hire someone with such a qualification. Those who will are the bottom of the barrel types, that will hire anyone breathing that can speak a little English. Schools that are worth teaching for will still tell you to get a CELTA or a Trinity CertTESOL, even if you already have your online teaching certificate. Any reputable course will have at least 6+ hours of observed in class teaching practice with mentor feedback.

, Alternatively, you can study part-time over approximately 12 weeks.

, You will find that it is worth the investment when you start looking for jobs. With a proper certificate you are much more likely to be offered a good contract with decent conditions and salary.

, The two most recognised certificate qualifications are: Cambridge University's ESOL (English as a Second Language) CELTA and the Trinity CertTESOL. International House, London regularly offers Cambridge CELTA courses, both full-time and part-time, as well as an online course.

, There are input sessions which explain the theory of language teaching, grammar, vocabulary and skills teaching. There are also practice sessions in which you are expected to plan and deliver an English language lesson to a group of foreign students. In addition, you will observe other experienced teachers teaching so that you can see best practice.

Set up your expression.,
Find the factored form using one of the methods below.,
Check your work!",How to Factor Second Degree Polynomials (Quadratic Equations)1," The standard format for the quadratic equation is:ax2 + bx + c = 0

Start by ordering the terms in your equation from highest to lowest power, just like this standard format. For example, take:6 + 6x2 + 13x = 0

We will re-order this expression so it's easier to work with by simply moving the terms around:6x2 + 13x + 6 = 0

, Factoring the polynomial will result in two smaller expressions which can be multiplied to produce the original polynomial:6x2 + 13x + 6 = (2x + 3)(3x + 2)

In this example, (2x +3) and (3x + 2) are factors of the original expression, 6x2 + 13x + 6.

, Multiply the factors you identified. Then combine like terms and you're done. Start with:(2x + 3)(3x + 2)

Let's test it, multiplying the terms using FOIL (first - outer - inner - last), obtaining:6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6

From here, we can add 4x and 9x together since they're like terms. We know our factors are correct because we get the equation we started with:6x2 + 13x + 6

"
"
List the factors of the a term and the c term.,
Write down two sets of parentheses with empty spaces.,
Fill the spaces in front of the x's with a pair of possible factors of the a value.,
Fill in the two spaces after the x's with a pair of factors for the constants.,
Decide what signs (plus or minus) should be between the x variables and the numbers.,
Test your choice using first-outer-inner-last (FOIL) multiplication.,
Swap out your choices if necessary.,
Reverse the order if necessary.,
Double-check your signs if necessary.",How to Factor Second Degree Polynomials (Quadratic Equations)2," Using the expression format ax2 + bx + c = 0, identify the a and c terms and list out what factors they have. For 3x2 + 2x - 8, that means:a = 3 and has one set of factors: 1 * 3
c = -8 and has four sets of factors: -2 * 4, -4 * 2, -8 * 1, and -1 * 8.;
, You'll be filling in the constants for each expression into the space you've made:(  x    )(  x    )

, For the a term in our example, 3x2, there is only one possibility for our example:(3x   )(1x   )

, Let's say we chose 8 and 1. Write it in:(3x  8)(x  1)

, Depending on the signs in the original expression, it's possible to figure out what the signs for the constants should be. Let's call the two constants for our two factors h and k:If ax2 + bx + c then (x + h)(x + k)
If ax2 - bx - c or ax2 + bx - c then (x - h)(x + k)
If ax2 - bx + c then (x - h)(x - k)

For our example, 3x2 + 2x - 8, the signs must be:(x - h)(x + k), giving us the two factors:(3x + 8) and (x - 1)

, A quick first test to run is to see if the middle term is at least the correct value. If it is is not, you may have chosen the wrong c factors. Let's test our answer:(3x + 8)(x - 1)

By multiplication, we arrive at:3x2 - 3x + 8x - 8

Simplifying this expression by adding the like terms (-3x) and (8x), we get:3x2 - 3x + 8x - 8 = 3x2 + 5x - 8

We know now that we must have identified the wrong factors:3x2 + 5x - 8 ≠ 3x2 + 2x - 8

, In our example, let's try 2 and 4 instead of 1 and 8:(3x + 2)(x - 4)

Now our c term is a -8, but our outside/inside product (3x * -4) and (2 * x) is -12x and 2x, which will not combine to make the correct b term of +2x.-12x + 2x = 10x
10x ≠ 2x

, Let's try moving the 2 and 4 around:(3x + 4)(x - 2)

Now, our c term (4 * 2 = 8) is still okay, but the outside/inside products are -6x and 4x. If we combine them:-6x + 4x = 2x
2x ≠ -2x

We're pretty close to the 2x we were aiming for, but it's the wrong sign.

, We're going to stick with the same order, but swap which one has the minus:(3x - 4)(x + 2)

Now the c term is still okay, and the outside/inside products are now (6x) and (-4x). Since:6x - 4x = 2x
2x = 2x

We can now recognize the positive 2x from the original problem. These must be the correct factors.

"
"
Multiply the a term by the c term.,
Get the b term by factoring and testing.,
Substitute the two numbers you get into your equation as the sum of the b term.,
Factor the polynomial by grouping.",How to Factor Second Degree Polynomials (Quadratic Equations)3," In this example, a is 6 and c is also 6.6 * 6 = 36

, We're looking for two numbers that are factors of the a * c product we identified and also add up to the b term (13).4 * 9 = 36
4 + 9 = 13

, Let's use k and h to represent the two numbers we got, 4 and 9:ax2 + kx + hx + c
6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6

, Organize the equation so that you can factor out the greatest common factor of the first two terms and the last two terms. Both factored groups should be the same. Add the Greatest Common Factors together and enclose them in parentheses next to the factored group; the result will be your two factors:6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6
2x(3x + 2) + 3(3x + 2)
(2x + 3)(3x + 2)

"
"
Multiply the a term by the c term.,
Find two numbers with this number as a product and with a sum equal to the b term.,
Take these two numbers and test substitute them into the 'triple play' formula.,
Look to see which one of the two terms in the numerator is evenly divisible by a.,
Take the greatest common factor (GCF) out of either or both terms, if any.",How to Factor Second Degree Polynomials (Quadratic Equations)4," As with the decomposition method, this is going to help us identify candidates for the b term. In this example, a is 8 and c is 2.8 * 2 = 16

, This step is identical to the decomposition method - we're testing and rejecting candidates for the constants. The product of the a and c terms is 16, and the c term is 10:2 * 8 = 16
8 + 2 = 10

, Take our two numbers from the previous step - let's call them h and k - and put them into this expression:((ax + h)(ax + k))/ a

Here, we'd get:((8x + 8)(8x + 2)) / 8

, In this example, we're seeing if (8x + 8) or (8x + 2) can be divided by 8. (8x + 8) is divisible by 8, so we'll divide this term by a and leave the other one as is.(8x + 8) = 8(x + 1)

The term we're saving out of here is what's left after dividing by the a term:
(x + 1)

, In this example, the second term, has a GCF of 2, since 8x + 2 = 2(4x + 1). Combine this answer with the term you identified in the previous step. These are your equation's factors.2(x + 1)(4x + 1)

"
"
Factor out a greatest common factor if possible.,
Identify if your equation's coefficients are square numbers.,
Using the square roots you have identified, write out the factors.",How to Factor Second Degree Polynomials (Quadratic Equations)5," In this case, we can see that 27 and 12 are both divisible by 3, so we'll separate that out:27x2 - 12 = 3(9x2 - 4)

, To use this method you should be able to take the square root of the terms evenly. (Notice that we'll have left out the negative signs - since these numbers are squares they may be products of positive or two negative numbers)9x2 = 3x * 3x and 4 = 2 * 2

, We'll take the a and c values from our step above - a = 9 and c = 4, then find their square roots - √a = 3 and √c = 2. These are the coefficients for the factor expressions:27x2 - 12 = 3(9x2 - 4) = 3(3x + 2)(3x - 2)

"
"
Plug the corresponding values into the quadratic formula:x = -b ± √(b2 - 4ac)
      ---------------------
                2a

We obtain the expression:x = -4 ± √(42 - 4•1•1) / 2

,
Solve for x.,
Use your value for x to figure out the factors.",How to Factor Second Degree Polynomials (Quadratic Equations)6,", You should get two x values. As shown above, we obtain two answers:

x = -2 + √(3) or x = -2 - √(3)

, Plug the x values you obtained into two polynomial expressions as the constants. These will be your factors. If we call our two answers h and k, we're writing two factors like so:(x - h)(x - k)

In this case, our final answer is:(x - (-2 + √(3))(x - (-2 - √(3)) = (x + 2 - √(3))(x + 2 + √(3))

Rule of signs for real roots:


If a and c have opposite signs, the 2 roots have opposite signs.,
Rule for the Diagonal Sum:

Given a root pair of a quadratic equation (c1/a1), (c2/a2).,
Rule.,
Examples of solving quadratic equations in the form x^2 + bx + c = 0.,
Example 1.,
Example 2.,
Example 3.,
Example 4.,
Conclusion.",How to Solve Quadratic Equations when a = 1," Example: the equation 6X^2 -11X - 35 = 0 has 2 roots in opposite signs.






If a and c have same sign, the 2 roots have same sign






If a and b have opposite signs, both roots are positive. The equation: 21x^2 - 23x + 6 = 0 has 2 real roots, both positive.






If a and b have same sign, both roots are negative. Example: the equation 15x^2 + 22x + 8 = 0 has 2 real roots, both negative.







, Their product should equal to (c/a), meaning c = c1c2 and a = a1a2.






Their sum is: (c1/a1) + (c2/a2) = (c1a2 + c2a1)/a1a2 = -b/a.






The sum c1a2 + c2a1 is called the Diagonal Sum of a root pair.







,

The Diagonal Sum of a TRUE root-pair must equal to (-b).






If it equals to (b), the answer is opposite in sign.






If a is negative, the above rule is reversal in sign.







,


In this case, the diagonal sum becomes the sum of the 2 real roots. Solving results in finding 2 number knowing their sum (-b) and their product (c).





;
, Solve: x^2 - 9x + 14 = 0.


Solution. Both roots are positive. Write down all factor-pairs of c = 14. They are:






(1, 14),(2, 7). This second sum is: 2 + 7 = 9 = -b. The 2 real roots are: 2 and 7







, Solve: x^2 + 27x + 50 = 0.


Solution. Rule of Signs shows that both roots are negative. Write down all factor pairs of c = 50: (-1, -50),(-2, -25)...Stop! This sum is -27 = -b. The 2 real roots are: -2 and -25.







, Solve : -x^2 - 26x + 56 = 0.


Solution: Roots have opposite signs, a is negative. Factor pairs of ac = -56. They are:






(-1, 56),(-2, 28)... Stop!. This sum is: 28 - 2 = 26 = -b. According to the Rule when a is negative, the answer is opposite to the second set. The real roots are: 2, -28.







, Solve: x^2 + 34x - 72 = 0.


Solution. Roots have opposite signs. a is positive. Write down all factor pairs of -72. Stop when you find the sum = b (or -b).






(-1, 72), (-2, 36)...Stop!. The sum of this set is 34 = b.






The answer is opposite to this set. Two real roots are 2 and -36.







, When a = 1, solving quadratic equation in the form x^2 + bx + c = 0 by the Diagonal Sum Method is simple, fast and doesn't require factoring.

Be aware of the units.",How to Pass Integrated Algebra," The homework is there to check your understanding of the mathematical concepts you are learning. If you don’t understand how to do the homework, then you don’t understand the concept. Homework helps you identify what you do and don’t know.The more problems you practice with, the more you will understand how to problem solve.
If you have trouble remembering to do your work, keep a planner and write down all of your homework assignments.;
, Being in class isn’t enough; you actually have to pay attention and take notes. The act of taking notes will help you remember the material later. In addition to your class notes, take notes while you are studying the text and answering problems. These extra notes will help you gain a true understanding of the material.


Review your notes from the day that night to solidify the material in your head.

, If you are having trouble understanding an equation or concept, ask the teacher about it. More than likely, another one of your classmates has a similar question.The teacher is there to teach you, so ask all of the questions you need to.


If you feel like you are really behind and don’t want to speak up in class, stay after class and talk to your teacher one-on-one. They can help you then or setup a time to meet later to get you extra help.

, Integrated Algebra is a bit different from a traditional math class because it teaches algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and statistics together instead of separate classes. There are many concepts you must be familiar with including:Algebra: algebraic proportions; addition and subtraction of fractional expressions; polynomial, binomial, and monomial expressions; factoring expressions (FOIL method); absolute value and exponents; linear and quadratic equations; etc.
Geometry/Trigonometry: calculating area and perimeter of polygons and circles; determining volume and surface area of solids and cylinders; finding sine, cosine, and tangent of right triangles; using the Pythagorean Theorem; etc.
Statistics: evaluating reports and graphs; probability of an event occurring; determining the number of possible arrangements of a list of items; knowing conditional probabilities; differences between causation and correlation; etc.

, If you are close to a passing grade, you may be able to do some extra credit work to bump your grade into passing. If you show your teacher you are really serious about the extra credit and learning the material, they will be more likely to help you out.


Take the extra credit assignments seriously. They may be your only chance to get your grade up to passing.

, Through the school year you have been given tests and quizzes to track what you have learned. Use these materials to your advantage. Correct the questions you got wrong and retake the test or quiz like it’s the first time.


Some concepts may still be fresh in your mind, while others you may have forgotten. Spend more time focusing on the ones you have forgotten.

, There are many materials online that offer free practice exams.Take advantage of these. Sit down and the take the test as you would for the actual exam. Work in a quiet room or library to avoid getting distracted.


There are also books that can be purchased with even more practice tests available.

, Most teachers will give you a study guide before the exam that will cover the material presented on the exam. Answer all of the questions in the study guide. Go back and study the questions that were harder for you to answer.


If your teacher does not provide a study guide, ask them for other available study resources, such as the Regents Exam Prep Center., Ask your teacher if they have copies of exams from previous years. It is also possible to find some online.Go through the exam and answer as many questions as possible. Check your answers to make sure they are right.


If you don’t understand a question, ask your teacher to help you work through it.

, If you find that you are really behind and don’t understand most of what is happening in class, you may need a tutor. Getting a one-on-one tutor or signing up for a test prep class may be just what you need to pass the final exam.


Talk to your parents and your teacher about getting the extra help you need.

, There are a lot of formulas in math that get used on a regular basis. Although you are provided with a reference sheet, it will not have every formula that you will need for the exam.Identify the formulas that you will need that aren’t on the reference sheet and make sure you know those.Use flashcards to help you memorize.

, In order to maximize your time on a test, answer the easiest questions first. If you’re unsure about how to solve a problem, skip it and move on to one that you know. This will ensure you answer as many questions as possible.


While you’re answering other problems, you may remember how to do the harder ones.Don’t forget to go back at the end and tackle the harder questions.

, Tests can be daunting because you don’t want to run out of time, but taking the time to read the problem completely allows you to understand it and properly answer it. If you glance at it too quickly, you might answer the wrong question or answer it incompletely.Pay close attention to what the question is asking. If the question says “Give the answer to the hundredths decimal place”, you don’t want to lose points because you rounded to the wrong place.

, You may not be able to answer every question, but you can strive for partial credit. Showing that you know at least part of the concept can earn you points and get you that much closer to a passing grade.Work the problem as far as you can to maximize your partial credit.
Even if you only know equations, write these down and see if they jog your memory about how to go about solving.

, Drawing a diagram allows you to properly visualize the problem, label everything appropriately, and view the problem from different perspectives. Take the time to sketch out the diagram as accurately as possible.This is particularly helpful for geometry problems.

, You may not have to use every number because some math problems include extra information that you don’t actually need. These types of problems are testing your ability to recognize only the needed information.If you realize that some numbers aren’t necessary to the problem, cross them out so you don’t get distracted by them as you solve.

, When you finish the exam, don’t turn it in right away. If you have extra time, go back and double check your answers. Start with the problems you had the most trouble with.Ask yourself: Does this answer make logical sense? If a question is asking about the area of something and your answer is negative, that doesn’t make sense. Some part of the calculation is wrong.

, Pay close attention to the units used in the problem. You may need to convert to different units for the final answer. Write down the units at every step and make sure everything cancels out properly to give you the correct units at the end.If the units don’t match up, you may need to rethink the way you are solving the problem.

Note that a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} is an even number.,
Substitute a=2k{\displaystyle a=2k} into the original equation.,

Recognise that this is a contradiction.",How to Prove That the Square Root of Two Is Irrational," Then it can be expressed as a fraction ab{\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are both whole numbers, and b{\displaystyle b} is not 0{\displaystyle 0}. Furthermore, this fraction is written in simplest terms, meaning that either a{\displaystyle a} or b{\displaystyle b}, or both are odd whole numbers.

,


2=a2b2{\displaystyle 2={\frac {a^{2}}{b^{2}}}}


,


2b2=a2{\displaystyle 2b^{2}=a^{2}}


, a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} is even number because it is equal to two times a whole number. Since a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} is even, a{\displaystyle a} must be even too, because if it were odd, a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} would be odd as well (an odd number times and odd number is always an odd number). a{\displaystyle a} is even, so that means it can be written as two times a certain whole number, or in other words, a=2k{\displaystyle a=2k}, where k{\displaystyle k} is this whole number.
,


2=(2k)2b2{\displaystyle 2={\frac {(2k)^{2}}{b^{2}}}}.


, (2k)2=22k2=4k2{\displaystyle (2k)^{2}=2^{2}k^{2}=4k^{2}}.


2=4k2b2{\displaystyle 2={\frac {4k^{2}}{b^{2}}}}


, 


2b2=4k2{\displaystyle 2b^{2}=4k^{2}}.


,


b2=2k2{\displaystyle b^{2}=2k^{2}}


, b2{\displaystyle b^{2}} is even number because it is equal to two times a whole number. Since b2{\displaystyle b^{2}} is even, b{\displaystyle b} must be even too, because if it were odd, b2{\displaystyle b^{2}} would be odd as well (an odd number times and odd number is always an odd number).
, You have just proven that b{\displaystyle b} is even. However, you have also proven that a{\displaystyle a} is an even number. This is a contradiction because in the beginning of this proof, it was assumed that ab{\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}} was written in simplest terms, but if both a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are even, the numerator en denominator can be divided by 2, which means it was not written in simplest terms. Since this is a contradiction, the original assumption that 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is rational is false, thus leading to the conclusion that 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is irrational.

Determine whether you have a linear polynomial.,
Set the equation to equal zero.,
Isolate the variable term.,
Solve for the variable.",How to Solve Polynomials1," A linear polynomial is a polynomial to the first degree.This means that no variable will have an exponent (or an exponent greater than 1). Because this is a first-degree polynomial, it will have exactly one root, or solution.For example, 5x+2{\displaystyle 5x+2} is a linear polynomial, because the variable x{\displaystyle x} has no exponent (which is the same as an exponent of 1).
;
, This is a necessary step for solving all polynomials.

For example, 5x+2=0{\displaystyle 5x+2=0}


, To do this, add or subtract the constant from both sides of the equation. A constant is a term without a variable.For example, to isolate the x{\displaystyle x} term in 5x+2=0{\displaystyle 5x+2=0}, you would subtract 2{\displaystyle 2} from both sides of the equation:5x+2=0{\displaystyle 5x+2=0}5x+2−2=0−2{\displaystyle 5x+2-2=0-2}5x=−2{\displaystyle 5x=-2}


, Usually you will need to divide each side of the equation by the constant. This will give you the root, or solution, to your polynomial.

For example, to solve for x{\displaystyle x} in 5x=−2{\displaystyle 5x=-2}, you would divide each side of the equation by 5{\displaystyle 5}:5x=−2{\displaystyle 5x=-2}5x5=−25{\displaystyle {\frac {5x}{5}}={\frac {-2}{5}}}x=−25{\displaystyle x={\frac {-2}{5}}}So, the solution to 5x+2{\displaystyle 5x+2} is x=−25{\displaystyle x={\frac {-2}{5}}}.

Determine whether you have a quadratic polynomial.,

Set the equation to equal zero.,
Rewrite the expression as a four-term expression.,
Factor by grouping.,
Factor the second group.,
Rewrite the polynomial as two binomials.,
Find the first root, or solution.,
Find the second root, or solution.",How to Solve Polynomials2," A quadratic polynomial is a polynomial to the second degree.This means that no variable will have an exponent greater than 2. Because this is a second-degree polynomial, it will have two roots, or solutions.For example, x2+8x−20{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20} is a quadratic polynomial, because the variable x{\displaystyle x} has an exponent of 2{\displaystyle 2}.


, This means that the term with the exponent of 2{\displaystyle 2} is listed first, followed by the first-degree term, followed by the constant.For example, you would rewrite 8x+x2−20{\displaystyle 8x+x^{2}-20} as x2+8x−20{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20}.


, This is a necessary step for solving all polynomials.

For example, x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0}.


, To do this, split up the first-degree term (the x{\displaystyle x} term). You are looking for two numbers whose sum is equal to the first degree coefficient, and whose product is equal to the constant. For example, for the quadratic polynomial x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0}, you need to find two numbers (a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}), where a+b=8{\displaystyle a+b=8}, and a⋅b=−20{\displaystyle a\cdot b=-20}. 

Since you have −20{\displaystyle -20}, you know that one of the number will be negative.

You should see that 10+(−2)=8{\displaystyle 10+(-2)=8} and 10⋅(−2)=−20{\displaystyle 10\cdot (-2)=-20}. Thus, you will split up 8x{\displaystyle 8x} into 10x−2x{\displaystyle 10x-2x} and rewrite the quadratic polynomial: x2+10x−2x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0}.


, To do this, factor out a term common to the first two terms in the polynomial.For example, the first two terms in the polynomial x2+10x−2x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0} are x2+10x{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x}. A term common to both is x{\displaystyle x}. Thus, the factored group is x(x+10){\displaystyle x(x+10)}.


, To do this, factor out a term common to the second two terms in the polynomial.

For example, the second two terms in the polynomial x2+10x−2x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0} are −2x−20{\displaystyle -2x-20}. A term common to both is −2{\displaystyle -2}. Thus, the factored group is −2(x+10){\displaystyle -2(x+10)}.


, A binomial is a two-term expression. You already have one binomial, which is the expression in parentheses for each group. This expression should be the same for each group. The second binomial is created by combining the two terms that were factored out of each group.

For example, after factoring by grouping, x2+10x−2x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0} becomes x(x+10)−2(x+10)=0{\displaystyle x(x+10)-2(x+10)=0}. 

The first binomial is (x+10){\displaystyle (x+10)}. 

The second binomial is (x−2){\displaystyle (x-2)}. 

So the original quadratic polynomial, x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0} can be written as the factored expression (x+10)(x−2)=0{\displaystyle (x+10)(x-2)=0}.


, To do this, solve for x{\displaystyle x} in the first binomial.For example, to find the first root for (x+10)(x−2)=0{\displaystyle (x+10)(x-2)=0}, you would first set the first binomial expression to 0{\displaystyle 0} and solve for x{\displaystyle x}. Thus:x+10=0{\displaystyle x+10=0}x+10−10=0−10{\displaystyle x+10-10=0-10}x=−10{\displaystyle x=-10}So, the first root of the quadratic polynomial x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0} is −10{\displaystyle -10}.


, To do this, solve for x{\displaystyle x} in the second binomial.For example, to find the second root for (x+10)(x−2)=0{\displaystyle (x+10)(x-2)=0}, you would set the second binomial expression to 0{\displaystyle 0} and solve for x{\displaystyle x}. Thus:x−2=0{\displaystyle x-2=0}x−2+2=0+2{\displaystyle x-2+2=0+2}x=2{\displaystyle x=2}So, the second root of the quadratic polynomial x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0} is 2{\displaystyle 2}.

Combine all of the like terms and move them to one side of the equation.,

Solve each ""zeroed"" equation independently.,
Check x = -1/3 in (3x + 1)(x – 4) = 0: We have (3+ 1)(– 4) ?=?,
Check x = 4 in (3x + 1)(x - 4) = 0: We have (3+ 1)(– 4) ?=?",How to Solve Quadratic Equations1," The first step to factoring an equation is to move all of the terms to one side of the equation, keeping the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term positive. To combine the terms, add or subtract all of the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} terms, the x{\displaystyle x} terms, and the constants (integer terms), moving them to one side of the equation so that nothing remains on the other side. Once the other side has no remaining terms, you can just write ""0"" on that side of the equal sign. Here's how you do it:2x2−8x−4=3x−x2{\displaystyle 2x^{2}-8x-4=3x-x^{2}}


2x2+x2−8x−3x−4=0{\displaystyle 2x^{2}+x^{2}-8x-3x-4=0}


3x2−11x−4=0{\displaystyle 3x^{2}-11x-4=0}
;
, To factor the expression, you have to use the factors of the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term (3), and the factors of the constant term (-4), to make them multiply and then add up to the middle term, (-11). Here's how you do it:

Since 3x2{\displaystyle 3x^{2}} only has one set of possible factors, 3x{\displaystyle 3x} and x{\displaystyle x}, you can write those in the parenthesis: (3x±?)(x±?)=0{\displaystyle (3x\pm ?)(x\pm ?)=0}. 

Then, use process of elimination to plug in the factors of 4 to find a combination that produces -11x when multiplied. You can either use a combination of 4 and 1, or 2 and 2, since both of those numbers multiply to get 4. Just remember that one of the terms should be negative, since the term is -4. 

By trial and error, try out this combination of factors (3x+1)(x−4){\displaystyle (3x+1)(x-4)}. When you multiply them out, you get 3x2−12x+x−4{\displaystyle 3x^{2}-12x+x-4}. If you combine the terms −12x{\displaystyle -12x} and x{\displaystyle x}, you get −11x{\displaystyle -11x}, which is the middle term you were aiming for. You have just factored the quadratic equation.

As an example of trial and error, let's try checking a factoring combination for 3x2−11x−4=0{\displaystyle 3x^{2}-11x-4=0} that is an error (does not work): (3x−2)(x+2){\displaystyle (3x-2)(x+2)} = 3x2+6x−2x−4{\displaystyle 3x^{2}+6x-2x-4}. If you combine those terms, you get 3x2−4x−4{\displaystyle 3x^{2}-4x-4}. Though the factors -2 and 2 do multiply to make -4, the middle term does not work, because you needed to get −11x{\displaystyle -11x}, not −4x{\displaystyle -4x}. 


, This will lead you to find two values for x{\displaystyle x} that will make the entire equation equal to zero, (3x+1)(x−4){\displaystyle (3x+1)(x-4)} = 0.  Now that you've factored the equation, all you have to do is put the expression in each set of parenthesis equal to zero. But why? -- because to get zero by multiplying, we have the ""principle, rule or property"" that one factor must be zero, then at least one of the factors in parentheses, as (3x+1)(x−4){\displaystyle (3x+1)(x-4)} must be zero; so, either (3x + 1) or else (x - 4) must equal zero. So, you would write 3x+1=0{\displaystyle 3x+1=0} and alsox−4=0{\displaystyle x-4=0}.
, In a quadratic equation, there will be two possible values for x. Find x for each possible value of x one by one by isolating the variable and writing down the two solutions for x as the final solution. Here's how you do it:

Solve 3x + 1 = 0

 3x = -1 ..... by subtracting

 3x/3 = -1/3 ..... by dividing

 x = -1/3 ..... simplified



Solve x - 4 = 0

 x = 4 ..... by subtracting



x = (-1/3, 4) ..... by making a set of possible, separate solutions, meaning x = -1/3, or x = 4 seem good.


, 0 ..... by substituting  (-1 + 1)(-4 1/3) ?=? 0 ..... by simplifying  (0)(-4 1/3) = 0 ..... by multiplying  therefore 0  =  0 ..... Yes, x = -1/3 works
, 0 ..... by substituting  (13)(4 – 4) ?=? 0 ..... by simplifying  (13)(0) = 0 ..... by multiplying  0  =  0 ..... Yes, x = 4 works

So, both solutions do ""check"" separately, and both are verified as working and correct for two different solutions.

Write the terms in descending order of degrees, so that the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term comes first, followed by the x{\displaystyle x} term and the constant term. Here's how you do it:

4x2 - 5x - 13 =  x2 -5

4x2 - x2 - 5x - 13 +5 = 0

3x2 - 5x - 8 = 0


, The quadratic formula is: −b±b2−4ac2a{\displaystyle {\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}}, The variable a is the coefficient of the x2 term, b is the coefficient of the x term, and c is the constant. For the equation 3x2 -5x - 8 = 0, a = 3, b = -5, and c = -8. Write this down.
, Now that you know the values of the three variables, you can just plug them into the equation like this:

{-b +/-√ (b2 - 4ac)}/2

{-(-5) +/-√ ((-5)2 - 4(3)(-8))}/2(3) =

{-(-5) +/-√ ((-5)2 - (-96))}/2(3) 


, After you've plugged in the numbers, do the remaining math to simplify positive or negative signs, multiply, or square the remaining terms. Here's how you do it:

{-(-5) +/-√ ((-5)2 - (-96))}/2(3) =

{5 +/-√(25 + 96)}/6 

{5 +/-√(121)}/6 


,  If the number under the radical symbol is a perfect square, you will get a whole number. If the number is not a perfect square, then simplify to its simplest radical version. If the number is negative, and you're sure it's supposed to be negative, then the roots will be complex. In this example, √(121) = 11. You can write that x =  (5 +/- 11)/6.
, If you've eliminated the square root symbol, then you can keep going until you've found the positive and negative results for x. Now that you have (5 +/- 11)/6, you can write two options:

(5 + 11)/6

(5 - 11)/6


, Just do the math:

(5 + 11)/6 = 16/6

(5-11)/6 = -6/6


, To simplify each answer, just divide them by the largest number that is evenly divisible into both numbers. Divide the first fraction by 2, and divide the second by 6, and you have solved for x.

16/6 = 8/3

-6/6 = -1

x = (-1, 8/3)

2x2 - 12x - 9 = 0

In this equation, the a term is 2, the b term is -12, and the c term is -9.




, The constant term is the numerical term without a variable. Move it to the right side of the equation:

2x2 - 12x - 9 = 0

2x2 - 12x = 9


, If x2 has no term in front of it, and just has a coefficient of 1, then you can skip this step. In this case, you'll have to divide all of the terms by 2, like so:

2x2/2 - 12x/2 = 9/2 =

x2 - 6x = 9/2


, The b term in this example is -6. Here's how you do it:

-6/2 = -3 =

(-3)2 = 9 =

x2 - 6x + 9 = 9/2 + 9


, Factor the terms on the left side to get (x-3)(x-3), or (x-3)2. Add the terms on the right side to get 9/2 + 9, or 9/2 + 18/2, which adds up to 27/2.
, The square root of (x-3)2 is simply (x-3). You can write the square root of 27/2 as ±√(27/2). Therefore, x - 3 = ±√(27/2).
, To simplify ±√(27/2), look for a perfect square within the numbers 27 or 2 or in their factors. The perfect square 9 can be found in 27, because 9 x 3 = 27. To take 9 out of the radical sign, pull out the number 9 from the radical, and write the number 3, its square root, outside the radical sign. Leave 3 in the numerator of the fraction under the radical sign, since that factor of 27 cannot be taken out, and leave 2 on the bottom. Then, move the constant 3 on the left side of the equation to the right, and write down your two solutions for x:

x = 3 +(√6)/2

x = 3 - (√6)/2)

Recall that a quadratic equation has two roots.,
Recall the Rule Of Sign For Real Roots.,
Assume that the quadratic equation has two real rational roots and express them as fractions in reduced terms with positive denominators.,
Factor both a and c. Compose all pairs of fractions whose numerators multiply to c (r.t = c) and whose denominators multiply to a (s.u = a).,
Check the diagonal sum of each candidate.",How to Solve Quadratic Equations by the Diagonal Sum Method," Their sum must be -(b/a) and their product must be (c/a).;
, This is needed to reduce the number of test cases.


If a and c have opposite signs, the 2 roots have opposite signs. Example:






6x2 - 11x - 35 = 0 has 2 roots that have opposite signs since a is positive 6 while c is negative 35.


If a and c have the same sign, the 2 real roots have same sign and it is further possible to determine if both are positive or both are negative.






If a and b have opposite signs, the 2 roots are both positive. The equation 21x2 - 23x + 6 = 0 has 2 real roots, both positive. Actually, we can't yet rule out that it might have no real roots (like 21x2 - x + 6 = 0), but can say that if the roots are real, then both are positive.
If a and b have same sign, the 2 roots are both negative. Example: The equation 15x2 + 22x + 8 = 0 has 2 real roots, both negative. Again, as above, complex roots are still possible, though in this example, both roots are real and negative.



, If the roots are r/s and t/u, then the diagonal sum, ru + ts = -b. This ru + ts is the ""diagonal sum"" this method is named after. Note, this formula assumes that a is positive. If a is negative then, ru + ts = b.


If the 2 real roots are -1/3 and 3/5, the diagonal sum is (-1)*(5) + (3)*(3) = -5 + 9 = 4. The quadratic equation they satisfy is 15x2 - 4x - 3 = 0. Note that b is the opposite of the diagonal sum as expected.







, If the information form the rule of signs shows that both roots must be positive or negative, use the correct sign. Otherwise, if the roots have opposite sign, it is not necessary to check both {1/3, -3/5} and {-1/3, 3/5}. If the diagonal sum of one of those root pairs gives the right absolute value, but the wrong sign, then the other one is the solution. Therefore it's only necessary to check one.

, If any diagonal sum equals -b, then that is the solution. If any diagonal sum equals +b, then that is the negative of the solution. If none of the diagonal sums are b or -b, then the roots of the quadratic are either irrational or complex and will probably need to be found with the quadratic formula.

Start with the Rs.,
Pronounce U in stupid and in duty with the ew or ""you"" sound.,
Enunciate on heavy consonant words.,
Sometimes drop the Ts.,
Observe that some words are pronounced as written.,
Observe that H is not always pronounced.,
Say ""bean,"" not ""bin"" for the word been.,
Notice that two or more vowels together may prompt an extra syllable.,
Listen to the ""music"" of the language.,
Get a British person to say well known sentences: ""How now brown cow"" and ""The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain"" and pay close attention.,
Immerse yourself in the British culture; this means surround yourself with individuals that speak, live, walk and talk British English.",How to Speak in a British Accent," Understand that in most British accents speakers don't roll their Rs (except for those from Scotland, Northumbria, Northern Ireland, and parts of Lancashire), but not all British accents are the same. For example, a Scottish accent varies greatly from an English accent. After a vowel, don't pronounce the R, but draw out the vowel and maybe add an ""uh"" (Here is ""heeuh""). In words like ""hurry"", don't blend the R with the vowel. Say ""huh-ree"".


In American English, words ending with ""rl"" or ""rel"" can be pronounced using either one or two syllables, completely interchangeably. This is not the case in British English. ""-rl"" words like ""girl"", ""hurl"", etc, are pronounced as one syllable with silent R, while ""squirrel"" is ""squih-rul"", and ""referral"" is ""re-fer-rul"".
Some words are easier to say in a British accent. For example, mirror, which sounds like ""mih-ra"". Do not say ""mirror"" like ""mere""; British people almost never do that.
Some awkward pauses in sentences are also removed by the addition of 'r' before a vowel. For example, ""I saw it"" becomes ""I saw-rit"", to avoid the pause between the words 'saw' and 'it'. Another example is ""Bacteria are small"", pronounced ""Bacteria-rar-small"".;
, Avoid the oo as in pronounced ; thus it is pronounced stewpid or commonly schewpid, not stoopid, etc. duty would be pronounced dewty or more often jooty. In the standard English accent, the A (for example, in father) is pronounced at the back of the mouth with an open throat—it sounds like ""arh"". This is the case in pretty much all British accents, but it's exaggerated in RP. In southern England and in RP, words such as ""bath"", ""path"", ""glass"", ""grass"" also use this vowel (barth, parth, glarss, grarss, etc.). However, in other parts of Britain ""bath"", ""path"", etc. sound like ""ah"".

, Pronounce that T in ""duty"" as T: not as the D as doody so that duty is pronounced dewty or a softer jooty. Pronounce the suffix -ing with a strong G. This way it sounds like -ing rather than -een. But sometimes it is shortened to in as in lookin.


The words human being are pronounced hewman being or yooman been in certain areas, though it could be pronounced hewman bee-in.

, With some accents, including cockney accents, Ts aren't pronounced in words where Americans use D to replace it. However, there is usually a short pause or ""hiccup"" in its place. So ""battle"" might be pronounced ba-ill but it would be a rare occasion to find someone saying ""Ba-ill"" catching the air behind the back of the tongue at the end of the first syllable before expelling it on pronunciation of the second syllable. This is known as the glottal stop. use glottal stops, too, for words like ""mittens"" and ""mountain"". It's just that British use them more often.


People with Estuary English, RP, Scottish, Irish and Welsh accents do consider it lazy and rude to drop the Ts, and this feature doesn't exist, but in almost all accents it's accepted to do it in the middle of words in casual contexts and almost universal to put a glottal stop at the end of a word.

, The word ""herb"" should be pronounced with an H sound. The word ""been"" is pronounced ""bean"", rather than ""bin"" or ""ben"". For RP, ""Again"" and ""renaissance"" are pronounced like ""a gain"" and ""run nay seance"", with the ""ai"" as in ""pain"", not ""said."" The words ending in ""body"" are pronounced as written, like ""any body"", not ""any buddy."" But use a British short O sound.

, The ""H"" is pronounced in the word ""herb,"" in contrast erb. However, in many British accents, the H at the beginning of a word is often omitted, such as in many Northern accents and the Cockney accent.

, In an American accent, this is often pronounced been. In an English accent, been is a common pronunciation, but ""bin"" is more often heard in casual speech where the word isn't particularly stressed.

, For example, the word ""road"" would usually be pronounced rohd, but in Wales and with some people in Northern Ireland it might be pronounced ro.ord. Some speakers may even say ""reh-uud.""

, All accents and dialects have their own musicality. Pay attention to the tones and emphasis of British speakers. Sir Johnathan Ive is a good example, listen to his accent at Apple revealings. Do sentences generally end on a higher note, the same, or lower? How much variation is there in tone throughout a typical sentence? There is a huge variation between regions with tonality. British speech, especially RP, usually varies much less within a sentence than American English, and the general tendency is to go down slightly towards the end of a phrase. However, Liverpool and north-east England are notable exceptions!


For example, instead of saying, ""is he going to the STORE?"" Say, ""is he GOING to the store?"" Have the question descending in tone as opposed to ascending in tone (going up in tone is more common in American or Australian English).

, Rounded mouth vowels in words such as ""about"" in London, are usually flattened in Northern Ireland.

, It's the surest way to learn a British accent quickly. Soon, you'll find yourself naturally able to speak with the variations above. Anything with a British speaker will work—try listening to the BBC (which provides free radio and television newscasts on the web) songs with British singers, or movies with British characters.

It’s pronounced “birds of a feathah flock togetha.” A famous phrase used to teach this principle is “pahk yuh cahr in hahvuhd yahd.” You might know it as park your car in Harvard Yard. The reason Bostonians drop their ""r"" is because English immigrants to Boston did so. However, the Boston accent doesn’t sound exactly like a British accent because of the influence of other cultural groups, like the Irish.

Because they don’t round out their consonants, Bostonians are able to say a sentence faster. It takes some effort to round out the ""r"" in words. Demonstrating the speed of the Bostonian accent, try saying the sentence ""how are you."" It's pronounced ""hahwahya.""

, You will need to pronounce the letter ""a"" differently depending on whether it's at the end of a word or not.


Add an “r” to the end of words that end in “a."" The word pizza is pronounced pizzer. Other examples of this pronunciation are the words soda and pasta. They are pronounced ""pahster"" and ""soder"" in Boston. Say ""Californiar"" instead of California and ""arear"" instead of area.
To pronounce the letter ""a"" when it's not at the end of a word, open your mouth and say “ah” like you are at a doctor’s office. For example, the words aunt and bath are pronounced ""ahnt"" and ""bahth"" in Boston. In Boston English, ah is pronounced more like “aw,” though. For example, the word tonic is pronounced tawnic.

, In addition to the “r,” Bostonians often leave out consonants. This is another reason they speak so fast.


For example, they will drop the ""d"" and ""t"" at the end of words. There are a lot of vowel sounds in Bostonian as a result.
The word “don’t” is pronounced “doan.” Plenty becomes “plenny.”

Use words unique to Boston accent speakers.,
Put the adjective ""wicked"" in front of words.,
Understand local geographical references.",How to Speak With a Bostonian Accent2," Bostonians have different words for some common things. For example, if you say “water fountain,” people will know you’re not from Boston. A Bostonian would call it a “bubblah.”


It's important to master how slang is used in common language, especially if you are practicing a Boston accent for a movie role. In some areas of Boston, sandwiches are called “spuckies.” They are also called subs. If you are trying to find a liquor store, ask for the packie.
Bostonians don’t drink soda or pop. They call it “tonic.” So if someone offers you tonic, they aren’t offering you gin in Boston. They might be offering you Pepsi.
Steamed clams are one of the most common local foods. They are called steem-ahs.
Roundabouts – those circles in roads – are called rotaries in Boston (but pronounce it rotah-ree). Instead of turn signal, say ""blinkah."" Instead of remote control, say ""clickah."" Instead of trash can, say barrel.

, This is one of the most distinct Boston terms. If you like something, say it’s wicked.


For example, if you think the Boston Red Sox are a good team, tell people you think they are wicked good.
The word pissa means something is great. Often, people in Boston will combine it with the word wicked to say something is wicked pissa (but remember to pronounce it ""pissah"").

, If you don’t have a handle on how to say words relating to the local geography, it’s not going to matter if you drop your rs.


If you say you want to go to the Public Gardens or Boston Commons, everyone who is really from Boston will know you aren’t. These are singular words. So, you should refer to Public Garden and Boston Common, instead. But if you really want to do it right, say ""Public Gahden.""
Tremont should be pronounced ""Treh-mont."" Say COPley, not COPEly Square (but pronounce it ""Squayah"").
The way you pronounce many Boston locations is very different from how they are spelled. So don’t try to puzzle it out phonetically.
Avoid Boston clichés. It annoys people from Boston when you refer to the city as “Beantown.” Only tourists call the city that.

Speak in a Brahmin dialect.,
Learn neighborhood differences.,
Listen to people speak with the accent.",How to Speak With a Bostonian Accent3," This is the John F. Kennedy accent that is so famous. It’s the elite version of the Boston accent. It’s a very different Boston accent from, say, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in “Good Will Hunting.”


Obviously, Kennedy is the gold standard for Brahmin dialects. To master it, why not watch some of his old speeches on You Tube? For example, you can find his opening statement in the 1960 presidential debate online. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is another politician who speaks with a Brahmin accent.
If trying to speak in a Boston Brahmin accent, use the Boston English, but with a British tone.
Some people think the Boston Brahmin accent is harder to find these days. It’s the upper-crust accent more associated with English immigration. Brahmin accents are more likely to put the emphasis on a back vowel not a front or center vowel. For example, Harvard is pronounced ""Hahvid."" , Blue-collar Boston accents can change slightly depending on the specific working class neighborhood they derive from.


Speak in a Southie Boston dialect. The South Boston dialect is sometimes called “Southie.” Southie is the dialect used in working class Boston areas that were made up of Irish, Italian and other immigrant groups.
Some blue-collar Bostonians replace ""r"" with ""v."" For example, the word brains becomes “bvains.”
An example of a Southie accent would be Ben Affleck’s role in the movie, the Town. This accent is closest to the stereotypical Irish accent, and is most heavily influenced by the Irish.
The north end and east end dialects have some Italian immigrant influence.

, To learn a Boston accent, strike up conversations with real Bostonians or watch videos of real Bostonians speaking. Observe how they speak. If you listen to a lot of people speaking with a real Boston accent, it will be easier to pick up.


You can also look up “Boston to English” dictionaries online that will translate common words into different dialects used in Boston. Study people who speak who have the strongest accents possible. It's easier to learn it that way. Finding a native speaker of the accent and speaking with them in person is the best yet. So go to Boston. Don't just listen to them talk, either. Study their facial movements when they talk and try to mimic them by looking into a mirror while you speak.
You could hire a voice coach. They will have you listen to a native speaker, and then they will record you saying the same words. Or, they will ask you to answer questions. Then, the conversation will be more natural.
There are many You Tube videos that describe how to speak a Boston accent. One of the best ways to learn how to do it is to watch the locals speaking in their natural habitat, such as a city council member talking at a meeting. You can find books with CDS that will teach you how to speak different Boston accents, such as Southie. "

Understand what multi-variable equations are.,
Know that you are trying to figure out the values of the variables, or unknowns.,
Know what a numerical coefficient is.,
Understand the difference between solving with elimination and solving with substitution.,
Understand that there can be linear equations that have three or more variables.",How to Solve Multivariable Linear Equations in Algebra1," Two or more linear equations that are grouped together are called a system. That means that a system of linear equations is when two or more linear equations are being solved at the same time.For example:


8x - 3y = -3
5x - 2y = -1
These are two linear equations that you must solve at the same time, meaning you must use both equations to solve both equations.;
, The answer to the linear equations problem is an ordered pair of numbers that make both of the equations true.


In the case of our example, you are trying to find out what numbers ‘x’ and ‘y’ represent that will make both of the equations true. In the case of this example, x = -3 and y = -7. Plug them in. 8(-3) - 3(-7) = -3. This is TRUE. 5(-3) -2(-7) = -1. This is also TRUE.

, The numerical coefficient is simply the number that comes before a variable.You will use these numerical coefficients when using the elimination method. In our example equations, the numerical coefficients are:


8 and 3 for the first equation; 5 and 2 for the second equation.

, When you use elimination to solve a multivariable linear equation, you get rid of one of the variables you are working with (such as ‘x’) so that you can solve the other variable (‘y’). Once you find ‘y’, you can plug it into the equation and solve for ‘x’ (don’t worry, this will be covered in detail in Method 2).


Substitution, on the other hand, is where you begin working with only one equation so that you can again solve for one variable. Once you solve one equation, you can plug in your findings to the other equation, effectively making one large equation out of your two smaller ones. Again, don’t worry—this will be covered in detail in Method 3.

, Solving for three variables can actually be done in the same way that equations with two variables are solved. You can use elimination and substitution, they will just take a little longer than solving for two, but are the same process.

Pronounce S and Z as TH.,
Try writing it out for the sake of visualization.,
Be considerate.",How to Talk With a Lisp1," This is the simplest way to speak with a lisp. Practice consciously replacing the S syllables in your speech. Be aware that a lisp can run a spectrum from serious speech impediment to subtle tongue adjustment. Err on the side of subtlety – don't overdo it., Pick a sentence with a lot of S syllables. Then, write out the same sentence with ""th"" in the place of each ""s."" Read the sentence aloud until the lisp becomes second nature.


""Sally sells seashells by the seashore,"" would become ""Thally thellth theathellth by the theathore.
""I am speaking with a lisp,"" would become ""I am thpeaking with a lithp.""

, Remember that a lisp is a legitimate speech disorder. A person who speaks with a natural lisp does not have the option to switch it off. If you imitate a lisp with the intent of poking fun at the speech pattern, you might offend or otherwise disrespect people who speak with lisps.


Consider also that the lisp is sometimes associated with certain stereotypes and subcultures. This is perhaps most notable in a particular ""lisp-y"" stereotype of members from the LGBTQ community. Ask yourself whether it is discriminatory to imitate a lisp in this context.

Look at your equation.,
Choose a variable to eliminate.,
Add or subtract the two equations to remove one of the variables and solve the other variable.,
Plug in your solution to solve for the remaining variable.,
Plug your findings into both equations to make sure that they are correct.",How to Solve Multivariable Linear Equations in Algebra2," In order to solve the problem, you will need to familiarize yourself with the components of the equations. Let’s use the following example to learn how to eliminate variables:


8x - 3y = -3
5x - 2y = -1

, To eliminate a variable, the numerical coefficient (the number in front of the variable) of a variable must be opposite to one another (for instance 5 and -5 are opposites). The goal is to get rid of one variable, so that you can solve for the other variable by eliminating one through subtraction. This means making the coefficients of the same variable in both equations cancel each other out.For instance:


In 8x - 3y = -3 (equation A) and 5x - 2y = -1 (equation B), you can multiply equation A with 2 and equation B with 3 so that you get 6y in equation A and 6y in equation B.
This would look like: equation A: 2(8x - 3y =-3) = 16x -6y = -6.
Equation B: 3(5x - 2y = -1) = 15x -6y =-3

, Now that you have a variable that can be eliminated, you can do so by adding or subtracting. Whether you add or subtract will depend on how you will be able to remove the variable. In our equation we would subtract, because 6y is in each of the equations:


(16x - 6y = -6) - (15x - 6y = -3) = 1x = -3. Therefore x = -3.
For other cases, if the numerical coefficient of x is not 1 after we add or subtract, we must divide both sides by the numerical coefficient to simplify the equation.

, Now that you have found what ‘x’ equals, you can plug that number into one of the original equations to solve for ‘y’.When you know that it works in one of the equations, you can try plugging it into the other equation to make sure:


Equation B: 5(-3) - 2y = -1 so -15 -2y = -1. Add 15 to both sides so -2y = 14. Divide both sides by -2 so that y = -7.
Therefore x = -3 and y = -7.

, Once you have found your variables, plug them into the original equations to make sure they are correct. If one of the equations doesn’t work with the variables you have found, you will have to try again.


8(-3) - 3(-7) = -3 so -24 +21 = -3 TRUE.
5(-3) -2(-7) = -1 so -15 + 14 = -1 TRUE.
Therefore, the variables we have found are correct.

"
"
Begin by solving one equation for either variable.,
Substitute your findings in Step 1 into the other equation.,
Solve for the other variable.,
Solve the second variable.,
Double check that the variables you have found work for both equations.",How to Solve Multivariable Linear Equations in Algebra3," It doesn’t matter which equation you decide to work with or even which variable you choose to solve for, as you should find the same solution no matter what. However, you do want to make the process as simple as possible. You should choose the equation that you think will be easiest to work with.For instance, if there is an equation where one of the coefficients is 1, such as x - 3y = 7, you would choose that as it will be easy to solve for ‘x’. For example, let’s say our equations are:


x - 2y = 10 (equation A) and -3x -4y = 10 (equation B). You would choose to work with x - 2y = 10 because the coefficient of x in this equation is 1.
Solving for x in equation A would meaning adding 2y to both sides. Therefore, x = 10 + 2y.

, For this step, you will need to insert (or substitute) your solution for ‘x’ into the other solution that you did not work with. This will allow you to find the other variable, in this case ‘y’.Let’s try it:


Insert the ‘x’ of equation B into equation A: -3(10 + 2y) -4y = 10. You can see that we have taken ‘x’ out of the equation and inserted what ‘x’ equals.

, Now that you have removed one of the variables from the equation, you can solve for the other variable. This is is simply solving a regular one-variable linear equation. Let’s solve ours:


-3(10 + 2y) -4y = 10 so -30 -6y -4y = 10.
Combine the y’s: -30 - 10y = 10.
Move the -30 over to the other side: -10y = 40.
Solve for y: y = -4.

, To do this, plug your findings for ‘y’, or the first variable, into one of the equations. Then solve for the other variable, in this case ‘x’. Let’s try it:


Solve for ‘x’ in equation A by plugging in y = -4: x - 2(-4) = 10.
Simply the equation: x + 8 = 10.
Solve for x: x = 2.

, Plug both of the variables into each equation to make sure that they create true equations. Let’s see if ours work:


Equation A: 2 - 2(-4) = 10 is TRUE.
Equation B: -3(2) -4(-4) = 10 is TRUE.

Push your tongue between your teeth.,
Imitate the ""dentalized lisp."",
Gently press your tongue against the front of your palate.,
Try the ""palatal lisp.""",How to Talk With a Lisp2," When you properly pronounce the letter S, your tongue lays against the roof of your mouth. To change this S sound to a lisping TH sound, keep your upper and lower teeth slightly parted, then move your tongue down and forward so that the tip just barely sits between them. Now, try saying the word “lisp”: it should come out as “lithp.” This is the classic lisp, known as the interdental lisp., Press your tongue against the back of your front teeth. This position is somewhere between a true S and the TH sound that characterizes the interdental lisp. This makes the dentalized lisp a slightly less conspicuous version of the interdental lisp., When you do this, air is forced to escape along the sides of your tongue, making the S sound slightly wet. This is known as a lateral lisp. It is perhaps the most exaggerated-sounding of the lisps., This is the hardest lisp to imitate. It produces a somewhat more grating sound, rather drier than the lateral lisp. Gently press your tongue against the middle/back of your palate."

Develop a large vocabulary.,
Work on your grammar and sentence structure.,
Pronounce your vowels and consonants more clearly and quickly.,
Pronounce the consonants and vowels in the middle of words.,
Read a book about accent modification.,
Practice imitating your new accent in private.,
Practice your new accent with a friend.,
Practice using your new accent with strangers.",How to Get Rid of a Southern Accent1," Start by reading glossaries of southern ""colloquialisms,"" or vocabulary. Learning more about your own speaking habits will help you to recognize when you’re slipping into a a more ""southern"" speech pattern. Then, use vocabulary-building books to find more neutral alternatives to replace these local colloquialisms..


Start a vocabulary journal to help you learn and remember the new words. Focusing on the new words will force you out of your accent comfort zone, and will go even further to help you present a more educated and professional image
For example, minimize the use of ""ain't"" and ""y'all, replacing them with ""am not"" and ""you"" or ""you all,"" respectively. Additionally, say ""preparing to"" instead of ""fixin’ to."";
, Some grammatical constructions not only seem quaintly southern, they’re also incorrect or confusing to non-southerners. Use concise and concrete language to provide directions or descriptions.


For example, don’t use an extra pronouns in instructions: ""Go get you a stapler from the supply room,” emphasizes a regional dialect, while “Go get a stapler from the supply room"" is straightforward and correct.
Avoid double-prepositions like stating that an object is ""Up under"" something. Instead, just use the preposition “under.”

, Southerners tend to speak more slowly than Northerners, so picking up your pace a bit can offset the impression of a drawling speech style. ""Clip"" or shorten your vowels. The vowel “i” often gets drawn out in southern speech styles, which is called ""glide deletion,"" so when saying the pronoun “I,” for instance, pronounce with the sharper “ai” rather than the softer “ah.”You can try to speak with your mouth in more of a circular shape to achieve the effect of rounding out your vowels instead of flattening them. Try it with the word “wine,” so that you’re saying “waiyn” and not “waihn”
Place the accent on the second syllable of words such as cement and umbrella. For example, the word “cement” should be pronounced “suh-MENT” and not “SEE-ment”

, Leaving out letters sounds less professional, and also indicates a regional accent, and so gives a less polished impression. For instance, pronounce the “r” in “library,” to avoid saying “liberry.” Other examples are the “y” in “crayon” and the second “a” in “caramel;” Without those letters, they sound like “crown” and “carmel.”


Include the final /ng/ sound at the ends of verbs and gerunds, such as “walking,” so that you say “Are you walking to the park?” instead of “Are you walkin’ to the park?”
Be sure to include both words in short phrases like “going to” and “want to,” and avoid saying “gonna” and “wanna.”

, Some are specifically designed to help you reduce your southern accent, such as Say Goodbye to Your Southern Accent, a book and CD set. These texts provide information and practice exercises to help you to change your speech patterns through exposure to neutral dialects and repetition exercises.

, You may feel nervous about practicing in public at first, so try a repetition method that will allow you to become more comfortable. Try listening to national radio new broadcasts and repeating the sentences back while you drive to work or run errands, or while working around the house.


Consider recording yourself repeating the words or reading some text. You can then listen to yourself and make notes about problem areas. You can then try the whole process again until you feel confident that you’ve modified your southern accent to a more neutral one.
Watch yourself in a mirror so that you can monitor your mouth shape as you speak.

, Find a friend with a more neutral American accent and ask him or her for help. Plan to meet them in a comfortable place where you can talk about a variety of topics, like a coffee shop or on a shopping trip, and explain your plan to practice speaking with less of an accent.


Decide, with your friend, how you will practice. You might ask your friend if he or she notices any words that seem particularly accented, and you can practice repeating those words back to your friend in a more neutral accent.
You might also simply have a conversation, as usual, with your friend will occasionally stopping you to point out accented speech or southern colloquialisms. You can then discuss and try new ways of saying the same things.

, Trying out your new standard American dialect on strangers might feel awkward to you, but it’s a powerful way to practice in real-life situations. Try speaking to baristas in coffee shops, servers in restaurants, store clerks, and flight attendants, since you may not see these particular service personnel again and you can avoid later embarrassment if you feel uncomfortable."

Knowing these highly specific terms will help you to avoid them, and, thus, avoid sounding particularly ""southern.""


The New York Times dialect survey is a popular quiz and uses mostly vocabulary to place your dialect. If you’re looking for a wider variety of accents, there are a number of surveys and quizzes on worldwide accents, as well as varieties of English., While music DJs on the radio are trained speakers, they often use the regional dialect associated with their audience. Instead, listen to programs that are broadcast nationally, as those hosts practice speaking in a more neutral, and conversational, dialect. , National news stations, like CNN, MSNBC, FOXNews, have anchors and hosts who have had significant training in modification of their speech patterns. They speak clearly and with engaging enunciation, and are a good model of standard American English dialects.Watching the news anchors speak also provides you the opportunity to watch the way these trained speakers form the words with their mouths.
Documentary television channels with voice overs, like the History Channel, NatGeo, and Animal Planet, are also good options, as the narrators are often trained actors.

, The most powerful influence on your accent comes from your peers in everyday interactions, so the more you listen and respond, the more confident you’ll be in both knowing the sounds of a neutral American accent, and also speaking with one. , If you’re going on a long drive, of if you have some down time, you might find it helpful to simply listen to someone read in a standard American accent. You can control the subject by choosing a text in your area of interest, and you’ll be exposed to higher-quality vocabulary, even in simpler books.


Choose texts that relate to the area of your life that a modified accent will be of benefit, such as your career.
Consider choosing a text about accent modification, so that you’ll have the double-exposure of a neutral accent and information on modifying your own.

, Audio book narrators are often trained actors who know how to speak clearly and in standard American accents, as well as other dialects. Listening to them as they read a book can be both enjoyable and informative, especially if the text includes multiple dialects and accents.Several texts on accent modification are available as audiobooks, and include practice exercises to do while listening.

Individual sessions are an option if you want to build more confidence before you practice with others, or if you need a more flexible training schedule.

, Some clinics and professionals will request a phone consultation to evaluate your needs and goals before beginning your training., In order to help you meet your particular goals, your SLP will first evaluate your speech patterns. He or she will ask you to read texts and words of various lengths, as well as engage you in a conversation. He or she will be listening to your pronunciation, intonation, rhythm, and syllable stresses.The SLP will also listen to your speech in conversation., With your SLP, determine your goals for your accent modification process. These goals should be based on your personal and professional needs, as well as the evaluation of your southern accent you completed.Some goals are highly career related, such as preparing for presentations, performances, or interviews. Be as specific as possible when having this conversation with your SLP.
Your later sessions, in some cases, will be aimed at achieving these specific goals, so be clear about them early. You can also adjust them along the way, as your skills and needs change., The sounds of your first language, including regional dialects, were imprinted by the time you were a year old, so you’ll always have the hint of your original accent in your voice. Continued practice with your new, neutral dialect will reduce the effect of your accent over time."

When you’re writing a speech, it should discuss something you care about. If you don’t care about it, your audience will notice. Brainstorm ideas on a piece of paper. You can also look at topics online. Some ideas for inspiration include:

Reading newspaper headlines.



 


Watching videos on important issues.






Finding something you’re passionate about. Maybe you want to talk about women’s rights or the wars the U.S. has become involved in. However, you don’t need to choose a serious topic, either; your topic can be something as simple as how to make a truly superb omelet.






Consider choosing a personal topic rather than a national issue. For instance, you can give a speech on how you became a successful business owner, beginning with what inspired you as a child.





;
, Once you’ve decided on your topic, you need to research it. Use the internet to learn more about the topic. Read in-depth articles from major newspapers. Find books at the library, and try searching in research databases, which you can access through your local library or university library. Some topics you will need to research less, and others you will need to research more.


For instance, if you are writing a personal speech, you obviously won’t need to do any research unless you want to add interesting facts. On the other hand, major topics like women’s issues will need more research.

, Serious topics can be treated seriously, but you can also lighten the mood, too, and still make your point. It’s up to you how you want to approach it.

, Decide how you want it to progress. Where do you want to begin? A good place to begin for a topic is with a general introduction of the issue. Move on to what you want to discuss in the middle. Finally, decide what you want to end with.


Great speeches often end with a call to action or a call to give serious thought to an idea. Make sure you leave your audience with a lasting impression.

, You can tell a joke to break the ice or use a statistic that brings to light your issue. You can also consider telling a weird story, such as the time you tried to fly off the shed as a kid, which inspired you to become a pilot.

, Whether it’s an issue or a personal story, a short introduction is appropriate. Give them an overview of what’s ahead.

, Fill in the details. Give your audience a nuanced description of both sides of the issue. If you are telling a personal story, fill in the details of how you got from point A to point B.


For example, how did you go from a kid jumping off the shed to a professional pilot? What did it take to make that journey? Who helped you get there?

, The ending is where you inspire people to apply what you’re talking about in your own life, so you need to spell out what you expect them to do with the information.


How can your professional journey help them? What can they do to help with the issue you are addressing?

, Repetition, alliteration, and metaphorical language can contribute to a speech’s power.


A good example of repetition is Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream Speech,” where his repetition of the phrase “I have a dream” serves to build power through the speech.

, If you are just trying to present both sides of an issue, that’s fine, just make that clear from the beginning. However, if you are taking a particular side, you can present both sides and then make it clear why you chose one side or the other.

, For a lighthearted speech, don’t be afraid to crack a few jokes. However, remember to keep your audience in mind, and keep it clean.


As a rule, if you wouldn’t tell the joke to your grandmother, maybe you shouldn’t tell it in your speech.

, If you are writing a persuasive speech, make sure you use persuasive language. Back up what you have to say with facts, so that you will be even more persuasive.


Remember trying to needle your parents into a better allowance? Think about using that type of language when writing a persuasive speech.

, You don’t want to conclude, only to have someone knock down your credibility at the end by bringing to light facts you didn’t know. In the same vein, don’t pick and choose your information; that is, don’t use only the information you like.


When writing a researched speech, you have to address all the research out there you can, not just what you favor.

, If you’re writing an inspirational speech, focus on what drives you to be better, what helped you achieve what you wanted. Alternatively, think about what needs to change and offer a way forward.


Speeches like “I Have a Dream” were powerful because they addressed a very real need and offered a vision of what could be.

Know basic differences in pronunciation.,
Know differences in word use.,
Recognise common Irish phrases.,
Identify common British phrases.,
Listen to examples.,
Listen for more specific differences.,
Try mimicking the accents.",How to Tell the Difference Between an Irish Accent and a British Accent," Although it is easy to over emphasise the consistency of British and Irish accents, there are certain basic differences in word sounds and pronunciation which you can look out for. When you hear someone speaking, listen carefully and try to identify the following characteristics:


In Irish English, the ""r"" after vowels is pronounced. In British English it is often dropped.
The sound for ""e"" in Irish accents is more like ""e"" in ""bet,"" instead of like ""ei"" in ""bait.""
The sound for ""o"" in Irish accents is more like vowel sound in the ""paw"" instead of like the ""ou"" sound in ""coat.""
The sound for ""th"" in Irish accents usually sound more like ""t"" or ""d"" sounds.""Thin"" sounds like ""tin"" and ""this"" sounds like ""dis."";
, Irish English often has different word use and sentence structure than British English. As well as the word sounds, with exposure to different accents you will learn to identify key features which indicate which country the speaker is from. The differences in syntax and diction gives accents there unique qualities and meter.


Irish people say ""be"" or ""do"" instead of ""usually."" I do work...= I usually work.
Irish speakers use ""after"" for things that just happened. Instead of ""I had just drank the beer,"" ""I was after drinking the beer.""
Irish people use ""don't be"" as an imperative, as in ""Don't be worrying about that.""
Irish speakers leave out ""if,"" ""that,"" and ""whether,"" as in the sentence, ""Tell me did you see the show.""
Irish speakers begin sentences with ""it is"" or ""it was,"" as in ""It was Sam had the best wife.""
Irish speakers will often use the definite article where British speakers wouldn't. For example, ""I'm going to the Malone Road."", Just as there is a wide variety of accents across the regions of Britain and Ireland, so are there numerous distinctive phrases and sayings that can indicate where someone is from. It can be helpful to recognise some of these if the speaker has only a soft accent, or one that has faded over time living somewhere else. There are countless examples, but here are few of the most well-known ones for Irish English speakers:


You will hear Irish people say ""what's the craic?"", or explain that they are doing something ""for the craic."" ""Craic"" basically means ""fun,"" but ""what's the craic?"" is another way of saying ""how are things?"" or ""what's going on?""
Irish people may also ask you ""where's the yoke?"" This is nothing to do with eggs, ""yoke"" is a general word for ""thing,"" but you are very unlikely to hear a British person using it in that way.
An Irish person might ask you not to ""give out."" This basically means ""complain,"" so if someone is always ""giving out,"" they are always complaining., As well as recognising key phrases that can indicate an Irish person, there are plenty of phrases used in Britain that are not used in Ireland. The only way to really learn these is by exposing yourself to plenty of film, TV, books, music and other things written by Brits. Phrases will often give away the regional identity of the speaker too.


You might hear somebody ask ""how's tricks?"" meaning ""how are things?""
If you hear somebody say ""owt"" or ""nowt,"" it probably indicates that they are from Yorkshire.
If you hear somebody say ""you're 'aving a bubble!"" they are probably from London. ""Having a bubble"" is rhyming slang for ""having a laugh,"" bubble bath = laugh.
If someone says ""ye cannae be serious,"" as in ""you can't be serious,"" they are probably Scottish., It shouldn't take too much exposure to be able to identify the difference between an Irish accent and a different accent, but as there is no such thing as a singular British or Irish accent the best way to get accustomed to the variety is by exposing yourself to it. Listen to lots of accents in online videos, movies, and music.


Choose your favorite celebrities from Britain and Ireland and listen to them speak in their normal accents.
Just search online for a particular accent and listen to what you find, but always try to listen to a native speaker for the most authentic accent.
There are useful online audio databases you can use to listen to recordings of regional Irish accents and regional British accents., To really hone in on the differences, listen to the way British and Irish people pronounce the same words differently. There are samples of people with Irish and British accents reading the same words on the dialect studies websites.

Listen to Irish accents at this page from the Dialects Archive.


This page has sample voices from all over the British Isles.
Sometimes listening to how numbers are pronounced is a good way to highlight differences in accents.
Numbers like three, seven, and eleven are pronounced differently in Ireland and Britain.

, Once you have a good idea of the differences in the accents, a good way to attune your ear some more is to practice trying to mimic the specific tone and sounds. Do this in private to start with, and don't risk giving the impression that you are mocking somebody's accent.


Practising reproducing the distinctive sounds of certain accents can help you understand how the sounds are formed in the mouth and recognise them more easily in the future.
Lyrical uses of language and accents in songs and poetry is perhaps the best way to be exposed the distinctiveness and beauty of a particular accent.

Visit with a doctor or speech language pathologist.,
Practice controlled fluency.,
Ask your doctor about electronic devices that reduce stuttering.,
Work with a cognitive behavioral therapist.,
Relax when speaking.,
Discover what the main causes of stuttering are.",How to Stop Stammering1," Health care professionals and specialists in speech problems can work with you or your child to overcome the effects of stuttering. Stuttering is best treated sooner, rather than later, as it may become more difficult to treat later in life. Contact your doctor if your notice any of the following aspects to your stuttering:Stuttering that develops during adulthood.
Any muscle tightening or visible difficulty speaking.
If your stuttering is affecting your social life, work life, or quality of life.
Any stuttering that causes anxiety, fear, or loss of self-esteem needs to be addressed.
Stuttering that lasts for longer than six months.
If stuttering occurs along side other speech problems.
If you notice stuttering worsening either in yourself or in your child.;
, Speaking quickly or in a hurried fashion can have an effect on the amount of stuttering that occurs in conversation. By slowing down and speaking deliberately, a person can learn exactly when and what triggers their stuttering.Speak slowly and simply. Try saying one syllable words, one at a time. Strive to have each word come out clearly before moving on to the next word.
Monitor your speech as you talk, looking for which words or mental states might cause stuttering to occur or worsen.
Don't be afraid to leave pauses or silence in your speech. Go at your own pace as you practice.
Practice words that you notice as problematic.
Gradually increase the length of words and sentences. Overtime you will work towards implementing problematic words in your speech.

, There are two main types of devices today that can help with stuttering problems. Some of these are small enough to be worn throughout the day by the person who stutters.One device plays back a persons voice to them in an ear phone, with a delay. This delay causes the person to slow their speech down, which can reduce stuttering.
Another method makes it sound like your own speech is in unison with the speech of another person. Hearing your own speech in this way can also reduce any stuttering.

, By applying the techniques and practices of cognitive behavioral therapy, a person who stutters can learn which mental states might be responsible for worsening their stutter. An added benefit of this therapy is that it can help reduce anxiety, stress or self-esteem issues that may have arisen from the stuttering., Taking your time and saying what you want to say can help you reduce your stuttering. Give yourself plenty of time when speaking and try to remain as calm as you can.Don't always change your words or what you want to say.
Take your time and say the words that you want to use.
Relaxing and reducing anxiety about speaking can help reduce stuttering.
Don't force words. Say them at your own pace. Forcing words can make them more difficult to say.

, There are three causes of stuttering that are understood today. The two main types are called, developmental and neurogenic. The third, and most rare type, is termed psychogenic.Developmental stuttering arises early in a child's life when they are learning to speak. Most children will have some level of stuttering as they grow, but some will have problems that persist. There is also some evidence that stuttering of this type is genetic and can run in families.
Neurogenic stuttering can arise after a serious medical issues such as stroke or head trauma. The connections between language centers of the brain and the muscles that are used in speaking are weakened or disconnected.
Psychogenic stuttering is caused by exposure to an emotionally traumatic event.

Move the variables to different sides of the equation.,
Divide both sides of the equation to ""solve for x."",
Plug this back into the other equation.,
Solve for the remaining variable.,
Use the answer to solve for the other variable.,
Know what to do when both variables cancel out.",How to Solve Systems of Algebraic Equations Containing Two Variables1," This ""substitution"" method starts out by ""solving for x"" (or any other variable) in one of the equations. For example, let's say your equations are 4x + 2y = 8 and 5x + 3y = 9. Start by looking just at the first equation. Rearrange it by subtracting 2y from each side, to get: 4x = 8 - 2y.


This method often uses fractions later on. You can try the elimination method below instead if you don't like fractions.;
, Once you have the x term (or whichever variable you are using) on one side of the equation, divide both sides of the equation to get the variable alone. For example:


4x = 8 - 2y
(4x)/4 = (8/4) - (2y/4)
x = 2 - ½y

, Make sure you go back to the other equation, not the one you've already used. In that equation, replace the variable you solved for so only one variable is left. For example:


You know that x = 2 - ½y.
Your second equation, that you haven't yet altered, is 5x + 3y = 9.
In the second equation, replace x with ""2 - ½y"": 5(2 - ½y) + 3y = 9.

, You know have an equation with only one variable. Use ordinary algebra techniques to solve for that variable. If your variables cancel out, skip ahead to the last step. Otherwise, you'll end up with an answer for one of your variables:


5(2 - ½y) + 3y = 9
10 – (5/2)y + 3y = 9

10 – (5/2)y + (6/2)y = 9 (If you don't understand this step, learn how to add fractions. This is often, but not always, necessary for this method.)
10 + ½y = 9
½y = -1
y = -2

, Don't make the mistake of leaving the problem half-finished. You'll need to plug the answer you got back into one of the original equations, so you can solve for the other variable:


You know that y = -2

One of the original equations is 4x + 2y = 8. (You can use either equation for this step.)
Plug in -2 instead of y: 4x + 2(-2) = 8.
4x - 4 = 8
4x = 12
x = 3

, When you plug x=3y+2 or a similar answer into the other equation, you're trying to get an equation with only one variable. Sometimes, you end up with an equation with no variables instead. Double check your work, and make sure you are plugging the (rearranged) equation one into equation two, not just back into equation one again. If you're confident you didn't make any mistakes, you have one of the following results:If you end up with an equation that has no variables and isn't true (for instance, 3 = 5), the problem has no solution. (If you graphed both of the equations, you'd see they were parallel and never intersect.)
If you end up with an equation without variables that is true (such as 3 = 3), the problem has infinite solutions. The two equations are exactly equal to each other. (If you graphed the two equations, you'd see they were the same line.)

Follow-up with the critique.,
Use transition words.,
Be honest.,
End the conversation with praise.,
Follow-up with the person.,
Use the compliment sandwich sparingly.,
Avoid lessening the problem.,
Be direct with your employee about serious matters.",How to Use the Compliment Sandwich to Critique," Before you approach your colleague with negative feedback, think about how to structure the conversation. Preparing an outline can help you clearly deliver your message, which will help the recipient focus on and correct the problem. Having a well-planned, sincere conversation will help enact change and spare the recipients feelings and self-esteem.


Write down a draft of what you would like to say to your friend or employee. This will help you create an effective, thoughtful compliment sandwich.;
, Be mindful of your posture when you approach an employee. If you are feeling nervous, remind yourself to strand straight and lean toward the person when you are speaking to them. When in an uncomfortable situation, you may be more likely to physically close off from those around you.Remember to smile, keep your arms at your sides, and avoid crossing your arms and feet.

, Create a comfortable and open conversation by maintaining a calm, steady voice. Relax your shoulders and take deep breathes to create a calm and positive demeanor. Remember to smile throughout the conversation. Studies have shown that smiling also helps reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and your heart rate, which will put you at ease during the critique as well as the recipient.Start the conversation with a friendly greeting and an invitation to sit down. ""Hi Derek, please come in and have a seat. How was your weekend?"" Speaking in a calm, relaxed tone will help put the employee at ease and will help set up a positive interaction.

, Before delving into a critique, open with a sincere compliment or praise. Beginning with the criticism can create a combative, aggressive situation, and the recipient may be less likely to fully understand your message.Opening with positive feedback helps create a friendly tone that will help set both you and the recipient at ease.


After greeting the employee, give them some positive feedback. ""Your manager and I reviewed your finance reports. They are very strong, and you are doing an excellent job.""

, Provide the recipient with a thoughtful, genuine compliment that is unique to them. The key to giving a sincere compliment is to be truthful. Do not create a generic compliment that does not apply to your employee, otherwise it may appear contrived and out of place. Providing a sincere, truthful compliment can help build a positive relationship.In addition, showing the recipient that you notice their individual efforts and contributions will make them more likely to react positively.


Use examples of their successful completion of a recent project or task. “You did a great job preparing the agenda for yesterday’s meeting, Jane. I know the material was difficult to organize, and you did a fantastic job. Thanks a lot for your help!”
Highlight the person’s skills or positive attributes when praising them. “Your friendliness and eagerness to help has made the volunteer program a huge success. Thanks for greeting everyone with a smile each morning! I know it makes their day.”

, If you can link the compliment or praise to the criticism, it can make your transition into the critique easier. It will also help create a cohesive, streamlined conversation.


Perhaps your employee is always on time, but it takes them a while to settle in and begin to do their work. “Hi Tom, thanks so much for clocking in on time each day. I know traffic can be really congested at that time, so I appreciate all your efforts to get here. I have noticed that you hang out in the break room afterward for long periods of time before you go to your desk.” When possible, linking the opening compliment to the critique can help drive your message home.

, After opening the conversation on a friendly, positive note, follow-up with a discussion about the problem at hand. Avoid having the conversation in a public place or in the presence of other employees. Address only one or two issues. Do not use this time to list several pieces of negative feedback.Select the most pressing issues and focus on those so that you do not overwhelm the recipient.

, When moving from the compliment to the critique, use transition words to create a more powerful message. Use words like “however,” “regrettably”, or “unfortunately” to indicate a contrast between the two sections.A transition word can help pivot the conversation and ease it into the critique. “I am really thankful that you have offered to help out in the mentoring program. However, some mentees have indicated that you are not responsive to meeting requests. It is important to make time for your mentees to help them along with their projects.”

, Although you are trying to maintain a positive atmosphere and lessen the blow to the employee, you should still be straightforward when discussing the problem. The employee should be aware of the problem and its effects to fully understand why this behavior needs to be corrected going forward.


Be clear and concise when offering the critique. “I was reviewing your expense report from your last business trip to Chicago. I did not approve the after-dinner drinks you shared with our client since our expense policy does not cover alcohol purchases. Please keep that in mind next month when you travel to San Diego.”
Be honest about the effects that the problem has created. “Because you did not check to see if the projector was working in the conference room, the committee was not able to start the meeting on time. We’ve had to push back out budget due date because of this.”

, Once you have addressed the problem, it is important to end the conversation with a compliment. This will help build the recipient’s self-esteem and will encourage them to make the suggested changes going forward. This last compliment will help sandwich the negative feedback, making the overall conversation positive and effective.


Wrap up the conversation with encouragement about any upcoming project. “I saw your draft for next month’s presentation. It looks fantastic! The topic is really interesting and relevant to our department. I’m really looking forward to it!” This will help build your employee’s confidence, which will help them strive to do great work.
Remind the employee that this problem is not detrimental to their progress at the company, if applicable. “I’m really looking forward to discussing your growth in the company. I think you would be a great addition to the Education Committee. Let’s discuss this option at the end of the quarter.”

, Be sure to check in a few days later. Ask if they have any questions or concerns or if they have resolved the issue. Let them know that you are available for a meeting to discuss possible solutions., If you frequently use the compliment sandwich to offer feedback or criticism, the recipient will notice and may perceive your compliments as disingenuous and insincere.In addition, the recipient may expect to hear criticism each time you pay them a compliment or offer praise.This may make your future attempts to provide feedback ineffective.

, Sandwiching a major problem between two compliments could mask the severity of the negative feedback.Be sure that you are not downplaying the problem and focusing too much on the compliments and praise. This can weaken the recipient’s understanding that there needs to be improvement

, If you have discussed a reoccurring issue or if the employee’s behavior is cause for serious concern, avoid using the compliment sandwich. It may cause the recipient to think that the problem is not that pressing, important, or crucial. Address unsafe, unhealthy, destructive, or recurrent issues in private with the employee."

Don't finish sentences.,
Keep things calm.,
Stay engaged during a conversation.,
Offer praise and acceptance to children who stutter.",How to Stop Stammering2," When you are speaking with someone who stutters, you may be tempted to finish a sentence for them. This can be even more frustrating for the person who stutters. Avoid cutting them off and finishing what you think they are about to say., When speaking to either an adult or child who suffers from stuttering, keeping the conversation calm and relaxed can help. By speaking slowly and without a sense of urgency, it allows both people to communicate without pressure, helping to reduce the effects of stuttering., While speaking with someone who stutters, give them the same attention and care that you would in any conversation. Maintain focus on the speaker, make appropriate eye contact, and practice good listening skills as they speak.Don't assume you know what they are going to say and lose interest.

, If you are speaking with a child who stutters, never criticize or become frustrated with them. Treating anyone who stutters poorly will only lead to the development of self-esteem and confidence issues.Give praise to children when they are speaking clearly. Never punish or criticize them when they stutter.
Accept them as they are, offering encouragement and support.

Find the variable that cancels out.,
Multiply one equation so a variable will cancel out.,
Combine the two equations.,
Solve for the last variable.,
Solve for the other variable.,
Know what to do when both variables cancel out.",How to Solve Systems of Algebraic Equations Containing Two Variables2," Sometimes, the equations will already ""cancel out"" a variable once you add them together. For instance, when you combine the equations 3x + 2y = 11 and 5x - 2y = 13, the ""+2y"" and ""-2y"" will cancel each other, removing all the ""y""s from the equation. Look at the equations in your problem and figure out if one of the variables will cancel out like this. If neither of them will, read the next step for advice.

, (Skip this step if the variables already cancel out.) If the equations don't have a variable that cancels out naturally, change one of the equations so they will. This is easiest to follow with an example:


You have the system of equations 3x - y = 3 and -x + 2y = 4.
Let's change the first equation so that the y variable will cancel out. (You can choose x instead, and you'll get the same answer in the end.)
The - y on the first equation needs to cancel with the + 2y in the second equation. We can make this happen by multiplying - y by 2.
Multiply both sides of the first equation by 2, like this: 2(3x - y)=2(3), so 6x - 2y = 6. Now the - 2y will cancel out with the +2y in the second equation.

, To combine two equations, add the left sides together, and add the right sides together. If you set your equation up right, one of the variables should cancel. Here's an example using the same equations as the last step:


Your equations are 6x - 2y = 6 and -x + 2y = 4.
Combine the left sides: 6x - 2y - x + 2y = ?

Combine the right sides: 6x - 2y - x + 2y = 6 + 4.

, Simplify the combined equation, then use basic algebra to solve for the last variable. 'If there are no variables after simplifying, skip down to the last step in this section instead. Otherwise, you should end up with a simple answer to one of your variables. For example:


You have 6x - 2y - x + 2y = 6 + 4.
Group the x and y variables together: 6x - x - 2y + 2y = 6 + 4.
Simplify: 5x = 10

Solve for x: (5x)/5 = 10/5, so x = 2.

, You've found one variable, but you're not quite done yet. Plug your answer in to one of the original equations so you can solve for the other variable. For example:


You know that x = 2, and one of your original equations is 3x - y = 3.
Plug in 2 instead of x: 3(2) - y = 3.
Solve for y in the equation: 6 - y = 3


6 - y + y = 3 + y, so 6 = 3 + y

3 = y

, Sometimes, combining the two equations results in an equation that makes no sense, or at least that doesn't help you solve the problem. Double check your work from the beginning, but if you didn't make a mistake, write down one of the following as your answer:If your combined equation has no variables and is not true (like 2 = 7), there is no solution that will work on both equations. (If you graph both equations, you'll see they're parallel and never cross.)
If your combined equation has no variables and is true (like 0 = 0), there are infinite solutions. The two equations are actually identical. (If you graph them, you'll see that they're the same line.)

"
"
Only use this method when told to do so.,
Solve both equations for y.,
Draw coordinate axes.,
Draw the y-intercept for each line.,
Use the slope to continue the lines.,
Continue plotting the lines until they intersect.,
Find the answer at the intersection.",How to Solve Systems of Algebraic Equations Containing Two Variables3," Unless you are using a computer or graphing calculator, many systems of equations can only be approximately solved using this method.Your teacher or math textbook may require you to use this method so you are familiar with graphing equations as lines. You can also use this method to double-check your answers from one of the other methods.


The basic idea is to graph both equations, and find the point where they intersect. The x and y values at this point will give us the value of x and the value of y in the system of equations.

, Keeping the two equations separate, use algebra to turn each equation into the form ""y = __x + __"".For example:


Your first equation is 2x + y = 5. Change this to y = -2x + 5.
Your second equation is -3x + 6y = 0. Change this to 6y = 3x + 0, then simplify to y = ½x + 0.

If both equations are identical, the entire line will be an ""intersection"". Write infinite solutions.

, On a piece of graph paper, draw a vertical ""y axis"" and a horizontal ""x axis."" Starting at the point where they intersect, label the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. moving up on the y-axis, and again going right on the x-axis. Label the numbers -1, -2, etc. moving down on the y-axis and left on the x-axis.


If you don't have graph paper, use a ruler to make sure the numbers are spaced precisely apart.
If you are using large numbers or decimals, you may need to scale your graph differently. (For example, 10, 20, 30 or 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 instead of 1, 2, 3).

, Once you have an equation in the form y = __x + __, you can start graphing it by drawing a dot where the line intercepts the y-axis. This is always going to be at a y-value equal to the last number in this equation.


In our examples from earlier, one line (y = -2x + 5) intercepts the y-axis at 5. The other (y = ½x + 0) intercepts at 0. (These are points (0,5) and (0,0) on the graph.)
Use different colored pens or pencils if possible for the two lines.

, In the form y = __x + __, the number in front of the x is the slope of the line. Each time x increases by one, the y-value will increase by the amount of the slope. Use this information to plot the point on the graph for each line when x = 1. (Alternatively, plug in x = 1 for each equation and solve for y.)


In our example, the line y = -2x + 5 has a slope of -2. At x = 1, the line moves down 2 from the point at x = 0. Draw the line segment between (0,5) and (1,3).
The line y = ½x + 0 has a slope of ½. At x = 1, the line moves up ½ from the point at x=0. Draw the line segment between (0,0) and (1,½).

If the lines have the same slope, the lines will never intersect, so there is no answer to the system of equations. Write no solution.

, Stop and look at your graph. If the lines have already crossed, skip ahead to the next step. Otherwise, make a decision based on what the lines are doing:


If the lines are moving toward each other, keep plotting points in that direction.
If the lines are moving away from each other, move back and plot points in the other direction, starting at x = -1.
If the lines are nowhere near each other, try jumping ahead and plotting more distant points, such as at x = 10.

, Once the two lines intersect, the x and y values at that point are the answer to your problem. If you're lucky, the answer will be a whole number. For instance, in our examples, the two lines intersect at (2,1) so your answer is x = 2 and y = 1. In some systems of equations, the lines will intersect at a value between two whole numbers, and unless your graph is extremely precise it will be difficult to tell where this is. If this happens, you can write an answer such as ""x is between 1 and 2"", or use the substitution or elimination method to find the precise answer.

,, Every year, the money increases by 3%, so every 12 months the money increases by 3%. Since you need to give t in months, you have to divide t by 12, so h=12. Your equation is f(t)=1,000(1.03)t/12. If the units are the same for the rate and the t increments, h is always 1.

Consider an example.,
Know the basic form.,
Plug in the initial value.,
Find the continuous growth rate.,
Plug in the k value.",How to Write an Exponential Function Given a Rate and an Initial Value2," When you use the value e as the base, you are using the ""natural base."" Using the natural base allows you to pull the continuous growth rate directly from the equation.

, Suppose a 500 gram sample of an isotope of Carbon has a half life of 50 years (the half life is the amount of time for the material to decay by 50%).

, The form for an exponential equation is f(t)=aekt where a is the initial value, e is the base, k is the continuous growth rate, and t is the time variable.

, The only value you are given that you need in the equation is the initial growth rate. So, plug it in for a to get f(t)=500ekt
, The continuous growth rate is how fast the graph is changing at a particular instant. You know that in 50 years, the sample will decay to 250 grams. That can be considered a point on the graph that you can plug in. So t is 50. Plug it in to get f(50)=500e50k. You also know that f(50)=250, so substitute 250 for f(50) on the left hand side to obtain the exponential equation 250=500e50k. Now to solve the equation, first divide both sides by 500 to get: 1/2=e50k. Then take the natural logarithm of both sides to get: ln(1/2)=ln(e50k. Use the properties of logarithms to take the exponent out of the argument of the natural log and multiply it by the log. This results in ln(1/2)=50k(ln(e)). Recall that ln is the same thing as loge and that the properties of logarithms say that if the base and the argument of the logarithm are the same, the value is 1. Therefore ln(e)=1. So the equation simplifies to ln(1/2)=50k, and if you divide by 50, you learn that k=(ln(1/2))/50. Use your calculator to find the decimal approximation of k to be approximately -.01386. Notice that this value is negative. If the continuous growth rate is negative, you have exponential decay, if it is positive, you have exponential growth.

, Your equation is 500e-.01386t."

Get used to some words that are pronounced differently without a general rule.,
Invite someone to attend something with you by saying “Do you wanna go with?” or “Do you wanna come with?” Although the sentence may end in a preposition, you are likely to sound like a local.

,
Understand the cultural stereotype called “Minnesota nice”.,
Do the “Minnesota wave”.,
Say, “That’s different” instead of saying you don’t like something.,
Don’t look directly at the person.,
Avoid telling your opinion directly if it may hurt someone’s feelings.",How to Talk Minnesotan," Contract the corners of your mouth to form a round shape with your mouth before phrases like “Oh dear” or “Minnes-ohhh-ta” and extend the emphasis on this vowel.


This is a similarity to Canadian accents in some areas.
Practice by saying the word “Sound”. While it only has one syllable and can be said quickly, a Minnesotan might say “S-ownd” or “S-ow-und” as a part of regular speech.;
, The “I” should be drawn out and spoken with the mouth open and the tongue behind the bottom front teeth. This is also true when using names and words with the letter “y”.


Practice by saying the word “Why” and drawing out the vowel.

, For example, the words “are,” “work” and “mother” rely more heavily on the letter “R” in the Minnesota dialect. Stress the “err” sound.


Try saying the phrase “Oh, dear” to practice the “O” and the “R” together. It can sound like “Oo-ha, De-arr”.

, This is often called “Minnesota nice” because they use an inquisitive tone when speaking with other people. There are several changes in tone throughout a sentence.


Use the phrase “Oh, that’s interesting”. Although it is a statement and shouldn’t end with an inflection, the Midwestern accent would include an upward inflection with the word “interesting”. it is basically being passive in an aggressive way.

, Thanks to a large influx of Swedish and Norwegian immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Minnesota accent has a sing-song quality, employing inflections and words like “Yah” for “Yes”.Try the comic phrase “Ya sure, you betcha” to practice your use of the regional pronunciation.

, For example, “Have to” is often “hafta”, while “I’m going to” is “eye-mina” and “what are you” is “what-cha”.

, It is a generic, but common reply to questions like “You doing alright?” or “Are you full?”

, Almost all of Minnesota and most of the Midwest call Coke, Pepsi and other sodas “pop”.

, For example, “I didn’t buy that dress because it was too spendy”.

, Other like “can” are pronounced with a similar soft “eh” sound.

, This phrase and “Nice to meet you” are used to indicate you’d like to depart. You also might want to draw out your goodbye like a true Minnesotan and talk about the weather, sports, and politics. This is known as the ""Minnesotan goodbye"".

, For example, “cash” is sometimes pronounced “caish”. The word “different” is often pronounced with two syllables as “diff-rent”.,, This is the act of being outwardly nice, without conveying your real opinions or emotions. It is often referred to as “passive aggressive” or “enthusiastic neutral” tone because of the friendly inflections while saying something negative.

, This form of non-verbal communication is used when driving and greeting oncoming cars or pedestrians. You lift your index finger off the steering wheel for a second and set it back down.

, If someone asks your opinion and you want to show a little opinion, “that’s different” will show that you don’t like it, without having to go into detail., Minnesotans may talk while at a 45-degree angle or while looking out at something else. This is a way of remaining nice, non-confrontational, but not too personal.

, It’s better to say “Not bad” than “Not good”.


Pronounce “Not Bad” as “Naaht Bah-d”.

,
Check your answer.,
State the answer.",How to Use Equations," This will determine the meaning of your equation. Unless you're dealing with algebra by itself, your equation will be useless if you don't know what it means. An example of a useful equation is .15p = t, which will determine how much tip(t) you should give for a meal that costs p.;
, In the example above, p is the price of the meal, and t is the tip given.

,


The independent variable will be the ""input"" of the equation; basically, it will determine the dependent variable. In the example, this would be the price of the meal, because it is what determines how much tip you should give.
The dependent variable will be the ""output"" of the equation; basically, it depends on the independent variable. In the example, this would be the tip you should give, because it is determined by how much the meal costs.

, Variables can be anything, but in most cases not every value of a variable would make sense for the situation described by the equation. In the example, you can exclude any negative values and zero, because you'll never have to pay a negative amount for a meal, and if it's free, you don't have to pay a tip.

, Usually you'll be trying to solve for the dependent variable when you're given the independent variable, but sometimes you'll need to solve for the independent variable when you're given the dependent variable. In the example, you could either be trying to figure out how much you'll have to tip for a meal that costs something like $10.00, or you could be trying to figure out how much a meal would cost if you had to tip $5.00.

, This will help organize your thoughts.

, This means that if you know the cost of the meal, put that everywhere you see a p in the equation. .15p = t would become .15(10.00) = t if the price of the meal is $10.00.

,, Ask yourself if your answer makes sense. Does paying a negative tip make sense? Does paying a $50.00 tip for a salad that cost $2.00 seem reasonable? If it doesn't, you need to review your work, and see if you made any errors. Check your calculator's memory if it seems like you didn't make any errors on paper.

, Once you're reasonably sure about your answer, go ahead and use it for whatever you need it for.

Determine whether you have a perfect square binomial.,
Set up the formula for a perfect square trinomial.,
Square the first term of the binomial.,
Multiply the first and last term.,
Multiply the product by 2.,
Square the last term.",How to Use the Perfect Square Identity As a Shortcut in Expansion1," A binomial is a two-termed expression. If the binomial expression is a perfect square, it will be expressed as either (a+b)2{\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}} or (a+b)(a+b){\displaystyle (a+b)(a+b)}. Note the binomials could also have a subtraction symbol.

For example, (5y+3)2{\displaystyle (5y+3)^{2}} is a perfect square binomial.
;
, The formula is (a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}}. If the binomials show subtraction, the formula is (a−b)2=a2−2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a-b)^{2}=a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}}. Note that a{\displaystyle a} is the first term of the binomial, and b{\displaystyle b} is the second term of the binomial.
, This will become the first term of the trinomial. Remember that squaring a term means to multiply it by itself.

For example, if you are expanding (5y+3)2{\displaystyle (5y+3)^{2}}, you would first calculate (5y)2=25y2{\displaystyle (5y)^{2}=25y^{2}}. So, 25y2{\displaystyle 25y^{2}} is the first term of the trinomial.


, Make sure you are using the original a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} terms from the binomial expression.

For example, if you are expanding (5y+3)2{\displaystyle (5y+3)^{2}}, you would calculate (5y)(3)=15y{\displaystyle (5y)(3)=15y}.


, If the binomials show subtraction, you should multiply by -2. The result will be the middle term in the trinomial.

For example, (2)(15y)=30y{\displaystyle (2)(15y)=30y}. So, your trinomial now looks like this: 25y2+30y+b2{\displaystyle 25y^{2}+30y+b^{2}}.


, Again, make sure you are using the original b{\displaystyle b} term from the binomial expression. The square will give you the last term in the trinomial.For example, 32=9{\displaystyle 3^{2}=9}. So, (5y+3)2=25y2+30y+9{\displaystyle (5y+3)^{2}=25y^{2}+30y+9}

Recall the formula for a perfect square trinomial.,
Determine whether the first term in the trinomial is a perfect square.,
Determine whether the last term of the trinomial is a perfect square.,
Determine whether the middle term follows the formula 2ab{\displaystyle 2ab} or −2ab{\displaystyle -2ab}.",How to Use the Perfect Square Identity As a Shortcut in Expansion2," The formula is (a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}}. If the binomials show subtraction, the formula is (a−b)2=a2−2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a-b)^{2}=a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}}, A perfect square is a number whose square root is a whole number.Since the first term in the perfect square formula is a2{\displaystyle a^{2}}, the first term in your trinomial must be a perfect square.Note that the square root of the first term is equal to a{\displaystyle a} in the squared binomial.

For example, in the trinomial 36x2−48x+16{\displaystyle 36x^{2}-48x+16}, the first term is 36x2{\displaystyle 36x^{2}}. The square root of 36x2{\displaystyle 36x^{2}} is 6x{\displaystyle 6x}. So, the first term of this trinomial is a perfect square. Also, in the squared binomial, a=6x{\displaystyle a=6x}.


, Since the last term in the perfect square formula is b2{\displaystyle b^{2}}, the last term in your trinomial must be a perfect square.Note that the square root of the last term is equal to b{\displaystyle b} in the squared binomial.

For example, in the trinomial 36x2−48x+16{\displaystyle 36x^{2}-48x+16}, the last term is 16{\displaystyle 16}. The square root of 16{\displaystyle 16} is 4{\displaystyle 4}. So, the last term of this trinomial is a perfect square. Also, in the squared binomial, b=4{\displaystyle b=4}


, That is, if you multiply the square roots of the first and last term of the trinomial, and then multiply that product by 2 or -2, the result will equal the middle term of the trinomial, if the trinomial is a perfect square.For example, if a=6x{\displaystyle a=6x} and b=4{\displaystyle b=4}, then the middle term of the trinomial should follow the formula (−2)(6x)(4){\displaystyle (-2)(6x)(4)}. Since (−2)(6x)(4)=−48x{\displaystyle (-2)(6x)(4)=-48x} the middle term of the trinomial does follow the perfect square formula. Since the first and last terms of the trinomial followed the formula as well, you know that your trinomial is a perfect square.

Expand the following expression.,
Consider the following trinomial.,
Factor the following trinomial.",How to Use the Perfect Square Identity As a Shortcut in Expansion3," Use the perfect square identity rather than the FOIL method: (3y+7)2{\displaystyle (3y+7)^{2}}.

Set up the formula (a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}} and plug in the a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} values: (3y+7)2=(3y)2+2(3y)(7)+72{\displaystyle (3y+7)^{2}=(3y)^{2}+2(3y)(7)+7^{2}}.

Square the first term: 9y2+2(3y)(7)+72{\displaystyle 9y^{2}+2(3y)(7)+7^{2}}.

Multiply the first and last term, and multiply the product by 2: 9y2+42y+72{\displaystyle 9y^{2}+42y+7^{2}}.

Square the last term: 9y2+42y+49{\displaystyle 9y^{2}+42y+49}.


, Determine whether it is a perfect square: 9y2+36y+4{\displaystyle 9y^{2}+36y+4}.

Recall the formula for a perfect square trinomial: (a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}}.

Determine whether the first term of the trinomial is a perfect square: 9y2=3y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9y^{2}}}=3y}. So, a=3y{\displaystyle a=3y}.

Determine whether the last term of the trinomial is a perfect square: 4=2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {4}}=2}. So, b=2{\displaystyle b=2}.

Determine whether the middle term of the trinomial follows the formula 2ab{\displaystyle 2ab}:36y=(2)(3y)(2){\displaystyle 36y=(2)(3y)(2)}36y=12y{\displaystyle 36y=12y}Since this is not true, the middle term does not follow the formula, and therefore the trinomial is not a perfect square.


, It factors into a squared binomial: 4x2−20x+25{\displaystyle 4x^{2}-20x+25}.

Since you know this factors into a squared binomial ((a−b)2{\displaystyle (a-b)^{2}}), you know that it follows the perfect square formula.

Find the a{\displaystyle a} term of the binomial, which is equal to the square root of the first term of the trinomial: 4x2=2x{\displaystyle {\sqrt {4x^{2}}}=2x}.

Find the b{\displaystyle b} of the binomial, which is equal to the square root of the last term of the trinomial: 25=5{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}=5}.

Write the squared binomial. Since the second term of the trinomial is negative, you know that the second term of the binomial will also be negative: 4x2−20x+25=(2x−5)2{\displaystyle 4x^{2}-20x+25=(2x-5)^{2}}

Understand how the vowels work.,
Get to know the pronunciation of vowel combinations.,
Pronounce consonants as in English.,
Treat double consonants as one letter.,
Try it out!",How to Pronounce Welsh Names," Most people think that Welsh is very short of vowels. The truth is, the Welsh language has more vowels than the English language, so Welsh speakers, English seems like it has less vowels!

'w' and 'y' are vowels in Welsh, so don't freak out when you see a name without any English vowels!
The vowel 'a' is pronounced like the English 'a' in the middle of 'bat'.
The vowel 'e' is pronounced like the English 'e' in the middle of 'bet'.
The vowel 'i' is pronounced like the English 'i' in the middle of 'bit'.
The vowel 'o' is pronounced like the English 'o' in the middle of 'bot'.
'U' is pronounced differently between the north and south of Wales. In the South, 'u' is pronounced like the Welsh 'i' and the English 'i' in 'bit'. But in the North, it is more like the French 'u' or the German 'ü'. As a beginner, it would be easier to stick with the Southern pronunciation.
'W' is also pronounced differently between the north and south of Wales. The Southern pronunciation is like the middle of 'book', and the Northern pronunciation is like the beginning of 'wit'.
'Y' is similar to the 'er' in 'her', although if there are multiple 'y's in a word, the last 'y' is pronounced like the Welsh 'u' for some reason.
You have now mastered the Welsh vowels! Luckily for you, the Welsh vowels stay the same in every word or phrase, unlike English, except for the last 'y' in every multiple 'y' word!;
, Welsh is a phonetic language; therefore, in order to pronounce two vowels such as 'eu' all you need to do is pronounce the 'e' vowel then the 'u' vowel.

Unlike the English language, vowels do not merge together to make new pronunciations.

, The consonants 'b','d', 'h', 'l', 'm', 'n', 's', 'p', and 't' are the same as they are in English. They are pronounced like the beginning of 'bat', 'dad', 'hat', 'let', 'mat', 'not', 'sad', 'pot', and 'tot'.

'C' and 'g' are pronounced in Welsh like they are pronounced in English, but the hard way, never the soft.
The Welsh 'c' is pronounced like the 'c' in 'cat' and 'g' is pronounced like the 'g' in 'goat'.
'F' is pronounced like the English 'v', like in 'violet'.
'R' is always trilled in Welsh.

, 'Ch', 'dd', 'ff', 'ng', 'll', 'ph', 'rh', and 'th' are the double consonants in Welsh and are considered as one letter.

'Ch' is like the 'ch' in the Scottish 'loch', or the sound you make when you have a hair in the back of your throat (kind of).
'Dd' is pronounced like the 'th' in 'the'.
'Ff' is like the 'f' in 'find'.
'Ng' as the 'ng' in 'hang'.
'Ll' is tricky for non-Welsh people. Move your mouth to say an 'l', but instead of using your voice, just blow gently. If you spit everywhere, you're probably overdoing it.
'Ph' is like the Welsh 'ff' but used when mutating letters (which is something you don't need to worry about if you are only trying to pronounce certain words rather than trying to speak the language).
'Rh' has the same logic as 'll'. Pronounce a Welsh 'r' without using your voice, just blow. This letter is particularly hard to pronounce as a beginner, but practice and hoping for the best is all you can do!

When you begin saying the sounds, you’ll want to keep your lips open like this to be able to see your teeth the whole time., Line up your teeth so that the bottom row rests just below the top row, touching them lightly. Hold them together like this. If you have a natural slight over-bite when you smile (many people do) you’ll need to shift your bottom jaw forward a little bit to get your teeth in the right position. It may no longer look like a genuine smile in the mirror, but that’s okay., Keep your tongue back away from your teeth. It should be sort of in the center of your mouth, slightly pulled back and just behind the upper teeth. You don’t want it to be locked to the roof of your mouth, otherwise the air won’t be able to come through to make the sounds., Practice saying /sssss/, as though you’re hissing like a snake. To do this, blow air through your teeth while they are lined up as explained above, being sure to keep your tongue back away from the teeth. Do this several times, until it sounds like a clear /s/ sound.


To practice /z/, you keep your teeth and tongue in the same position, but you “turn your motor on” as a speech therapist would say. This means you vocalize a sound in your throat instead of just blowing silent air., After you’ve tried this method, a good way to check and make sure you’re making the right sound is to ask someone. Ask someone who doesn’t speak with a lisp, who will genuinely want to help and won’t make fun. They should be able to tell you if the sounds you’re making sound like clear /s/ and /z/ sounds.


Ask them to make the sounds too, and try to copy what they do. Watch their mouths and teeth, and try doing the same thing in the mirror., You’ll need to work up to saying the sounds correctly while speaking naturally. Practice saying just the /ssss/ and /zzzz/ sounds to yourself, and continue using the mirror and someone else for feedback. The more you practice, the faster you’ll be able to say the sounds clearly while speaking sentences., For each step in this section, you’ll want to begin slowly and once you’re comfortable saying the sounds correctly, you can start doing each step faster. Soon you’ll be saying the sounds clearly at a natural pace!, Practice saying the sounds with syllables first. Try saa, see, soo, sie, and sor. Then, try zaa, zee, zoo, zie, and zor. Repeat these gradually and then quickly, trying to maintain the correct sounds for /s/ and /z/.


Next practice words: sun, soup, Sue, sigh, saw, see, sip, soap, silly, seven, seals, zoo, bizarre, zippers, Try repeating sentences containing the sounds /s/ and /z/. For instance, “I see a sock,” and “We saw the store.” Here are some more you can try:


The striped zebra made me sneeze.
I eat spaghetti with a spoon.
He laughs when using scissors., Once you’re able to say sentences using clear /s/ and /z/ sounds pretty easily and quickly, try some tongue twisters:


Sister Suzie sat on the sea shore sewing shirts for sailors.
The shrewd shrew sold Sarah seven silver fish slices.

, Changing how you’ve been speaking can take quite a bit of work. Don’t give up if you don’t see results right away. Practice the techniques for at least 20 minutes every day. Ask your friends and family for feedback on whether or not they think you are improving your pronunciation during conversations.


Children in school often participate in speech therapy for months or even years to improve their lisps. If you’re not finding any improvement in a couple of months, try contacting a speech therapist for more help.

, Using a straw can help promote oral strength by strengthening your tongue because you have to keep it pushed back while drinking. So, get some straws and pop them into your cups, cans, or bottles when you’re getting a drink.

, Blowing of any kind, whether through an instrument mouthpiece, whistle, horn, kazoo, etc. helps to strengthen the mouth area muscles.


You can also blow bubbles. Sure, it’s for kids, but it can be fun for adults too. And if you have kids of your own or nieces/nephews, they’ll love doing it with you., Say “lalalalalalalala” without moving your jaw up and down. Just move the tip of the tongue. Rest and repeat.


Do this with other tip of the tongue sounds such as “tatatatatata” and “nanananana” and “dadadadada.” Any sounds getting your tongue moving quickly will help to strengthen it. , Suck the tongue up onto the roof of your mouth for a 1-2 seconds and then pop it. Try working up to 25 repetitions of this. Doing these types of exercises should cause you to gradually feel more control over the use of your tongue, which will help when you’re speaking to avoid making unclear sounds. "

Break the word into its syllables.,
The most common American pronunciation is generally believed to be “Wi-KI-pee-dee-ah.” You will sometimes see this written as “Wick-IH-pee-dee-ah” with the emphasis on the second syllable.,
Understand regional differences.,
Pronounce wiki correctly.,
Say it as Hawaiians would.",How to Pronounce Wikipedia," It will be easier to pronounce that way. “Wikipedia” has five syllables.It’s how the first and second syllables are pronounced that generates the controversy. As for Wikipedia itself? It suggests two versions as acceptable, both presented here.
The bottom line is that sometimes a word's pronunciation shifts because so many people deviate in how they say it that the new version becomes the most common. That’s happened here.;
, The key point is that the “i” in “wi” and the ""i"" in “ki” sound like the “i” in “sit.”However, Wikipedia itself presents that version as only one correct option, and it flies in the face of the word’s Hawaiian etymology.There is a great deal of confusion over how to pronounce “Wikipedia” but the “wi-ki” version is the most commonly used in America and in dictionaries., The British and American English pronunciations of Wikipedia are similar, but they are not exact. The British version is, ironically, more similar to the native Hawaiian.


Although the American English version is “Wi-KI-pee-dee-ah,” the British version pronounces the first and second syllable differently.
Instead of “wi” and “ki,” the first syllable is pronounced “wee” and the second syllable is pronounced “kee” in British English. So, Brits say “Wee-kee-PEE-dee-ah"" (or ""we-key-PEE-dee-ah.) Brits also put the emphasis on the third syllable.Some Australians and UK speakers will say this word more like “wi-kee-PEE-dee-ah” but they still elongate the second syllable more than most American speakers., What confuses people sometimes is that some believe the proper pronunciation of “wiki” is “we-key” or ""wee-kee,"" not “wick-ee” when it stands on its own. However, “whicky” or “wi-ki” is a term preferred by some big brands, including when added to another word.


”We-key” matches the British pronunciation of the first two syllables of “Wikipedia” but it’s different from the American version. There are many other words that start with “wiki” in addition to Wikipedia, such as (obviously since you’re reading it), wikiHow, and wikileaks.

, If you want to be a purist, you should know that those who argue the word should be pronounced “we-key” or “wee-KEE-pee-dee-ah” say they are basing that on the Hawaiian language. And they have a point.Wiki is a Hawaiian word. It means “quick.” When you repeat the word, such as saying “wiki wiki,"" you are saying “very quick” in Hawaiian.The developer of the first wiki decided to use the word after discovering a “wiki wiki” shuttle bus on a trip to Hawaii. He thought it would work for what he was considering the “quick Web.” In Hawaiian, the proper pronunciation of the word is “we-key” or “wee-kee.” However, “wick-ee” or “wi-ki” has widely taken over that usage with many people.
It’s become so common that most dictionaries now present the “correct” pronunciation as “wick-ee"" or ""wi-ki"" when used with ""Wikipedia.""Bottom line: To be a purist, say ""we-key-PEE-dee-ah"" but realize that many people won't think you are saying it right and that ""wi-KI-pee-dee-ah"" is also now considered correct usage, especially in America.

Pause briefly between words if you are signing your full name.
If your name contains two identical letters in a row (such as the O's in spoon), ""open"" and ""close"" your hand to repeat the letter. For letters that cannot be easily repeated (such as the m's in Emma), instead move your hand a short distance to the side for the second letter, without changing the hand shape.

, Practice this again in a smooth motion: ""Hi, my name _____."" Keep the words in exactly this order.

, Name signs, discussed below, are not necessary for introductions. If you are being formally introduced, you'll typically stick with the fingerspelling. A name sign may come later, in a more casual setting. However, if you are being introduced casually, for instance by a close mutual friend, you might change the introduction to ""Hi, my name (finger spelled name), (name sign).""

Start with fingerspelling.,
Learn about name signs.,
Allow Deaf people to name you whenever possible--don't make up your own name sign.,
Watch names change and multiply.",How to Say Your Name in Sign Language2," At this point, since you don't have a name sign, you can introduce yourself by fingerspelling your spoken name. First, learn how to fingerspell the ASL alphabet from this wikiHow article, online videos, or a Deaf contact. Spelling your name is as simple as signing each letter in turn. Practice until you can sign it at a steady pace, holding your hand in the same position in front of you.


Signed languages are not based on alphabets, so spelling most words (signs) is not important. Fingerspelling is useful for situations like this, when you need to introduce a proper noun (your name) that doesn't have a sign.
If your name is short and easy to fingerspell, this might be your permanent name.

, Your ""name sign"" is a special word invented for you personally. There's no such thing as a translation of an English name into a name sign. Instead, it's up to Deaf signers to invent a name for you, when they feel you are part of the community. Here are a few patterns that name signs tend to follow.



The arbitrary name sign: One common way to create a name sign is to form one hand into the fingerspelled letter that begins your name. Tap this letter a couple times against a specific spot on your body, usually your forehead, cheek, chin, shoulder, or chest. Alternatively, move your hand between two nearby locations, or move it back and forth in ""neutral space"" a short distance in front of your chest.






There's no reason to choose one spot over another, which is why this type of name sign is called ""arbitrary.""The descriptive name sign: These name signs reference a characteristic, usually an obvious, physical one.For instance, you could sweep your hand along a scar on your face, or twirl your fingers down past your neck to refer to your long hair. Novice signers often prefer these to arbitrary signs because they seem more fun. However, it's even more difficult to make one of these up on your own. Signed languages use a visual grammar that limits hand shape, location, and movement. Unless you've taken courses in ASL or practiced it for a long time, the name you make up might not look like a word at all.







The hybrid name sign: There's a third and final type of name sign: a sign that refers to a physical characteristic, but uses the hand shape for the first letter of your name. Although this is common in many Deaf circles, some people see this as a modern, hearing introduction that doesn't fit in the traditional naming system.It's entirely possible that a Deaf person eventually gives you a hybrid name. Trying to invent one of these yourself could come across as annoying or rude, even more so than inventing a different type of name.







, When a prominent Deaf adult gives you a name sign, she has decided you are a part of the Deaf community. This is a major moment for a non-native signer, and in many circles it can take years of friendship to happen. Even if you aren't convinced by this argument, there are several risks to inventing your own name sign:You might use a hand shape or motion that's difficult to follow, or breaks grammar rules. (""Hi, my name is Zzxqbub."")
You might invent a sign that looks like a rude word.
A local signer might already be using that name sign.
Your name sign might look like the name of a prominent person. (Imagine a foreigner trying to adopt the name Martin Luther King.)
It also goes against Deaf culture for a Hearing person to create their own name sign.

, If you learn ASL and get to know experienced signers, you might notice people referred to by multiple name signs. This usually happens when they receive a name sign from several different communities.Over time, a name sign might shift in location or hand shape to keep it apart from a similar name, make it faster to sign, or remove a reference that's become embarrassing or irrelevant.

Take full advantage of Text Replacement.,
Use ‘tap method’ short-cuts.,
Enable the right keyboard settings.,
Allow Siri to dictate.","How to Type Faster on Your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch1"," This function allows you to create shortcuts by pairing short abbreviations, even symbols, with longer phrases or even images which will be inserted in the text. Go to Settings, select General, select Keyboard, and you will see Text Replacement. You will see a blue plus sign located in the upper-right hand corner. Tap this sign and you will see two text fields: Phrase and Shortcut.


In Phrase, put the longer statement that you want inserted automatically. In Shortcut, put the text that you want to type originally that will be replaced by the longer statement that you put in Phrase. For example, you might put, “I don’t know,” in the Phrase box and “idk” in the Shortcut box. Every time you type “idk” it will be replaced by “I don’t know” automatically.When you first arrive at the Text Replacement page, prior to tapping the plus sign, you will see a search bar to navigate your shortcuts. You will also notice a list of shortcuts presented below the search bar. This is a good way to refresh your memory as shortcuts are only useful if you stay familiar with them.
Some iDevices will show the label “Shortcuts” in the iDevice keyboard menu instead of “Text Replacement.” The function is essentially the same.
The shortcuts that you established will apply in Messages and in other applications such as Calendar and Reminders.;
, Once you have the standard iDevice keyboard open there are a variety of shortcuts that are built-in, that you do not need to install. Most of them use a tap sequence that then prompts a certain action, cutting down on your keystrokes.You can double-tap your space bar to insert a period at the end of a sentence, allowing you to move on to the next one seamlessly.
You can double-tap your shift button to start and end a period of caps lock.
If you tap and hold a letter, you will see a handful of accent options. You can then slide your finger over to select one.
Adding symbols will often slow down your typing. To include a symbol quickly, select and hold the “123” button. Then, move your finger over to the symbol that you want to include. Once you let go, it is added in.
You are not limited to just the symbols showing on the initial page. To see more options, tap and hold one of the keys. For example, the dollar sign key will expand to show you the Euro symbol as well.

, Go to Settings, select General, select Keyboard, and you will be presented with a handful of customization options. As a general rule, you want to enable all of the items listed in order to increase your typing speed. Auto-capitalization, auto-correction, caps lock, predictive, character preview, and spell check should all be activated.

, You can also turn on dictation via the keyboard settings menu. Siri will take dictation for those iPhones (4s or newer) and iPad (third-generation or newer). To activate the dictation process, simply tap the microphone button on the keyboard. Then, you can begin speaking and Siri will type it out for you.Siri’s dictate function allows you to add punctuation as well. For example, if you state, “how does ten work for you question mark,” it will appear as, “How does ten work for you?” The capitalization process is automatic as well.
Always check your transcriptions for accuracy as additional noise can interfere with the dictation process.

Consider your typing needs.,
Research your keyboard options.,
Install a third-party keyboard.","How to Type Faster on Your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch2"," Think about what you want in your ideal keyboard. Focus on your daily patterns of use and how certain functions could improve your speed and lifestyle. Some questions you could ask are: Do you type a great deal and want a keyboard that adapts to your phrasing over time? Are you comfortable with swiping or do you want to stick with typing methods? Do you need a keyboard where numbers or symbols are especially accessible?

, There are a wide variety of third-party keyboards available for download via the App Store. To choose the one that is right for you, browse the App Store and narrow it down to five keyboards of interest. Then, type the names of those five into major search engines to see what kind of user reviews are available.


You can also find websites that will list your keyboard options in a side-by-side comparison, allowing you to quickly scan competing features, etc.You will also want to consider cost. Some keyboards are free, others require a small upfront cost, and others are a bit pricier. Many of the keyboards encourage in-app purchases which could also impact your bottom line.
Some of the keyboards will also ask for access to your emails, files, Facebook information, etc. SwiftKey, for example, uses this information to predict your word usage patterns, thus increasing the speed of your typing by offering tailored suggestions. But, you will want to consider if you are comfortable sharing this information with a keyboard app.Don’t discount non-traditional keyboards. If you are fond of using emojis, there are emoji keyboards available for purchase from the App Store. They can help you type strings of emojis at an accelerated speed., Once you’ve decided on a particular keyboard, go to the App store. Find your keyboard, download and install the app. Go to Settings, tap General, tap Keyboard, tap Add New Keyboard, and select your Keyboard from the list shown. Enable “Allow Full Access” and you will be good to go.


To switch between installed keyboards when typing, select the “Globe” button next to the spacebar.
Decide to keep it or delete it. Remember that making an app purchase doesn’t necessarily have to be a permanent move. If you play with your new keyboard for a few days and don’t particularly like it, you can uninstall the keyboard or simply work from another keyboard in the future.

"
"
Try landscape mode.,
Focus on the text.,
Purchase a typing trainer app.,
Connect a Bluetooth keyboard.","How to Type Faster on Your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch3"," Turn your iDevice sideways and it will transition to landscape mode. This will extend the size of the keyboard and keys, giving you more room to maneuver. It will also allow for a more comfortable handhold. To type faster in this position, use both thumbs instead of your index fingers.

, Instead of watching the keyboard as you type, look at the text as it appears on the screen. You will gradually train your thumbs to move ahead on the keyboard, increasing the pace of your typing. This is similar to a training exercise used by typists on traditional keyboards.


You will make mistakes as you practice. If you touch the wrong key, hold your finger down and slide over to the correct key. The key will not be entered until you release the pressure. Other than that, don’t worry about fixing errors until you finishing typing or it will slow down your pace.

, You can purchase one of a variety of typing trainer apps via the App Store. Some are pretty basic and focus on retention of short-cuts while others are more elaborate and include practice tests. The expanded versions usually include a fee. This is a good option if you are going to be typing a great deal and need to increase your speed and accuracy as soon as possible.

, If you’ve tried third-party keyboards, but still yearn for a tangible typing device, you may want to look into purchasing and using a Bluetooth keyboard. These keyboards are very compact (some even roll up) and can be connected to any iDevice. This is a good option if you are going to be typing extensively and are worried about hand cramps or ease of editing."

Maintain texting boundaries.",How to Text Your Crush," If you want to text with someone you're crushing on, it's usually better to get to know them a bit in real life first. If it's someone you've noticed from afar or someone you're already friends with, lay the groundwork for conversing via text by starting a real-life conversation and getting their number to continue talking later. Approach them comfortably and casually and start a conversation.;
, Make sure the person you're talking to knows your name and who you are. It's important to avoid coming off like a creep, so put the person at ease by starting a conversation with an intro: ""Hey, I'm Steve. We've got bio together, I think?""

, Find something that you've got in common to talk about to start conversation. Common classes, recent sports events, or even the weather are all common conversation starters. This will put the person at ease and help conversation flow normally: ""What did you think of that movie we had to watch last week in Mr. Smith's class?""



Ask lots of questions to put them at ease and make the conversation flow smoothly. You'll make it easier on the person you're engaging with to ask questions. Just don't make it seem like you're interrogating them.

Judge their interest in the conversation and use good listening skills to show that you're interested in them and what they have to say: ""What are your summer plans?"" or ""What are you thinking of studying in college?"" Always make them open-ended questions to keep the conversation flowing.

Follow their lead. Pay attention to the person's cues and put them at ease. If Mr. Smith is your favorite teacher but your crush says, ""Ugh. I hate that class. He's such a dork!"" bring up that time Smith spelled ""pencil"" wrong on the board or the time he spilled his coffee. He'll forgive you.

, Show your sense of humor to make the conversation fun and make them want more. Avoid dour subjects and Debbie Downer moments: ""School is boring. Can you keep a secret? I'm organizing a jailbreak. I just need to find a pole vaulter with math skills and a stuffed rhino. What do you say? You in?""

, When the conversation is flowing smoothly and you're having a good time, ask to exchange numbers. It doesn't need to be a big deal, so don't treat it like one: ""Hey, you want to exchange numbers? I like talking to you but I've got to get going."" When you exchange numbers, keep the door open: ""Text me sometime. You're cool.""


Don't ask if the conversation dies or your crush seems uninterested. Don't put them in an awkward position in which they'll have to say no. Keep it casual and wait for a more natural conversation and a more comfortable moment. It shouldn't be a big deal.
If they say no, back off immediately. Don't press or try to give them your number as a consolation.

, If you're shy and intimidated by the idea of approaching your crush and starting an analog conversation, consider waiting for a situation in which it would be less awkward to ask for their number for practical reasons.


Ask to exchange numbers for homework purposes: ""Hey, I'm gonna miss class next week and I don't want to fall back. Could you help me out? You could just text me to make it easy.""
Ask to exchange numbers to organize rides for sports or school: ""I could give you a ride after the game. You can text me to let me know, either way.""
Exchange numbers during group projects: ""Let's all exchange number so we can talk about the project this weekend.""

, Different people have different definitions of privacy when it comes to their phone. Some give it out regularly and freely and text with acquaintances, while some take the phone number very seriously and only let a few select people have it. If your crush has posted their number on their Facebook page, or wouldn't be offended if you got it from a mutual friend, you could take it from there to text them. Use caution, be tactful, and follow their lead always.


Getting someone's phone number from a mutual friend or from Facebook is much less desirable than asking them upfront. It can seem creepy, even if they've posted it publicly.
Make sure you have a good reason to text if you've gotten their number without them knowing directly: ""Hey Mike, it's Jill! Sorry to bother you, but Steve gave me your number because I just had to ask about this math problem. It's driving me crazy.""

, If you want to start texting your crush, come up with some good reasons to talk and some good conversation topics to stimulate a text exchange, just as you would when you're starting a conversation in real life. Always keep it fun and light and text at the right times. Some text starters:


""What are you up to? I'm really aggressively procrastinating.""
""Whoa, have you started reading for English yet? Brace yourself.""
""Man, I don't know what to think about colleges. Are you nervous yet?""
""Dude, did you see Mark today? He looked like a hippie toad.""
""Hey this is weird, but what's a dashiki?""

, A good text conversation means you've got to give them something to work with, too. Just asking questions will make them feel like they're being interrogated (creepy), especially if you respond with ""Oh"" or ""lol"". Vary your responses creatively and give them something else to respond to.


""You did?? That's awesome! Are you excited?""
""No way. What happened next?""
""Wow. You're the coolest. It's official.""

, ""Hey what's up"" and ""what are you doing today?"" will probably be texted between you at some point, but try to vary the content of your messages to keep it fresh and interesting. If you're trying to catch the eye and the attention of your crush with your words, make them stand out. Make them unique. Make them funny, exciting, mysterious, and attention-grabbing.


If you're wondering what they're up to, make a wildly incorrect guess: ""You're watching Pee-Wee Herman re-runs again, aren't you?""

, When you're texting, you have to control your tone and make sure that your exchanges appear light and won't be interpreted any other way than what you mean. Texting ""where are you"" or ""what are you doing"" comes off a lot creepier than ""Hey if you're still at school, I was thinking about going to the donut shop after I finish practice. Wanna come?""


Before you send each text, take a second to read back over it for typos and other mistakes that might give the person the wrong impression.

, Many texters, especially boys, have problems with closed-off and dull text habits. Make funny observations, tell stories, and ask open-ended questions if you want to have a text conversation.


Never try to start a text conversation with ""Hey."" It gives the other person nothing to respond to, nothing to say, and suggests that you're a boring person, or--worse--that you're just wasting your crush's time. Say something with substance and have a real conversation.
Even if you're just texting because you want to talk, give them something to respond to: ""OMG I'm so bored at this basketball game. My brother plays bench. Also it smells like sweaty mustard in this gym. Gross.""

, Keep them wanting more. If you're the one that starts the conversation, go out on a high note and end it: ""haha, well good. I gotta get back to this, ttyl?"" If they want to keep talking, take it as a sign you've done some good text-flirting and kept your crush interested.


This will give your crush the impression that you're thinking about them often, but not obsessing. You took a few minutes out of another activity to make conversation with them, but you didn't overstay your text welcome or just text them out of boredom.

, Over texting should be avoided at all costs. Pay close attention to their responsiveness and let dead conversations die. If someone texts ""lol"" and nothing more you don't have to try to reinvigorate it with, ""So…this rain sure is annoying, huh?"" That's annoying. Just leave them alone and wait for another opportunity to talk.


If you're doing a good job writing engaging texts and they're still not responding, you can probably take this as a sign that they're not that interested. Both boys and girls will make special effort to talk to people at length that they like, even if the convo is less than fascinating. So, if you've been your charming lovable self and it isn't working out, know to walk away.
Learn to recognize long term disinterestedness. If you're texting them twice a day and they're not responding more than a word or two twenty minutes after you sent the message, you should stop texting them and trying to start conversations. If they never initiate text conversations, you should probably take it as a sign they're not interested in talking more.

, Texts that compliment are almost always warmly received. If you want to get flirty with your crush, starting with a compliment is always a pretty safe bet: ""You were so awesome in the play. So. Awesome.""

, Express your more-than-a-friend interest in your crush by being playful and teasing them in a fun and polite way: ""I mean, I'm not really sure what happened in the play because I had trouble paying attention to anyone else. You were great though. Like a young Marty Feldman from the Frankenstein movie but, you know, like way hotter and stuff : )""

, Be honest and relax when you're texting. Don't try too hard to be funny and attract their attention, but be honest and express genuine emotions that will let them know who you are and where you're coming from.


Boys don't need to be aloof and act like they're uninterested during texts. If you like someone, show it. Be honest and open with your crush to let them know you're a genuine and complicated person, not a ""player.""
Girls don't need to be cutesy or play dumb in text messages. Overusing omg's and lol's may seem like a shortcut to your crush's heart, but it may be a bit of a turnoff for some. Be real and be serious sometimes too., Text messages aren't the best format for having serious conversations or hash-out emotional turmoil. If you want to have a text-talk, keep it light and keep it brief. If it ventures into more serious territory, talk on the phone or Skype to make it more personal, or--better yet--wait until you've got some face time to be really genuine.


It's too awkward to try to have mushy or heavy conversations via text message. If you think things might be getting serious between the two of you, don't risk a misinterpretation of an ""I like you text"" and declare your undying love for someone who's just being casual and saying they like your sense of humor. Wait for face-to-face time to have ""the talk."", Using "":P"" faces and ""I <3 you"" texts on a regular basis is a fine way to color your messages and use the format to its fullest potential, but it can also get a little ridiculous. It's always better to spell out full words and use as much punctuation as possible.


Some emoticons are difficult to interpret, especially for those who might be less familiar with texting. It might be easier to text back a smiley face if someone texts you something complimentary, but it also doesn't really give them anything to say back. Be conversational.
""U"" and ""ur"" in particular look especially childish and not serious. Remove them from your texting repertoire.

, Learn your crush's texting style and frequency and stay within the boundaries of your texting relationship. Don't text your crush in class or when they're busy doing other things and risk getting them in trouble.


Don't text too much. They're nothing flirtatious about bugging someone fifty times a day. Save it for the real world. If they're big texters, let them decide when and how much is appropriate.
If the flirting takes a dirty turn, use restraint and stay polite. Never send unsolicited picture messages or unsolicited dirty texts.

It's important to give her something interesting or complicated to respond to, or she'll quickly get bored and so will you. Start with a comment, question, or observation, always.""Do they sell bus tickets to Acapulco in this town? I'm bored of being in my house watching this dog lick its paw. Planning an escape. What do you say?""
""Whoever said I'm not creative. Just found a way to make a sandwich out of chips and rice. Totally winning at Saturday. Can you beat that?""
""Coach keeps talking about 'grabbing the brass ring' and I keep thinking about Frodo. YOU SHALL NOT PASS. So I'm thinking, LOTR movie night? Thoughts?"";
, What are you doing right now? If you want a response, and want to have an actual conversation, it's better to talk about something that matters right now, instead of something that you could talk about any time. ""Hey how are you"" doesn't count.


""Math homework = killing me. Not sure I'll finish. How far have you gotten? Help with number five?""
""Done with practice. Pretty sure mom forgot to pick me up. Looks like I live in the parking lot now.""
""Quick: Channel Five. That girl from our English class is being interviewed and she looks totally ridiculous.""

, If you're texting with a girlfriend, it's a good idea to be a little flirty with your texts. You don't have to go over-the-top, but learning to steer something around to your feelings with this girl is always a plus.""I'm walking past the park. Thinking of that time we kissed on the swings. Miss you.""
""Just saw a mallard duck couple waddling around. NOT SO CUTE AS WE : )""
""Saturday is free for me. Got all day to spend with you. What should we do?""

, Questions are a great way to start conversations via text. But don't ask questions that can be answered with one word, especially if those words are ""yes"" or ""no."" Instead, coax her into a conversation by asking more complicated questions that will take a little more thought on her end, and give you more to respond to on yours.


Don't ask, ""What are you up to?"" Instead, ""Thoughts?""
Don't ask, ""Did you have fun at practice?"" or ""How was school?"" Instead, ask ""What did you think of that test today?"" or ""What was the worst part of practice?""
Don't ask, ""Do you like Italian food?"" ask, ""What do you think of Italian food?""
Don't probe, or ask inappropriate questions.

, You don't always have to text words to get a conversation started. If you see a picture of something funny, snap a quick pic and send it to your girlfriend with a funny caption, or ask her to comment on it to get a conversation started.


If you see something strange, like a pigeon with its head in a box of Chinese takeout, snap a pic and send it with the line, ""Not sure what's going on here, other than winning at life. Is it weird that I'm jealous of this guy?""
If you just read something funny, like a Buzzfeed list of dog pictures, or a silly article from the Onion, send it to her via text and tell her what you thought was funny about it. Then text about it after she's read.
Be careful about picture texting. Never send unsolicited naked pictures to a girl. Keep it PG.

, Conversations are like plants, you have to water them or they'll just shrivel up and die. You need to give something for a girl to respond to in a conversation, or the conversation will die. When you respond to something she has said, avoid lame replies, single-word answers, and you'll keep the conversation going.


If she asks, ""What's up?"" don't say, ""Nothing"" or ""Just chilling."" Be specific and give her the light-hearted details: ""Helping my dad comb through ten years of strange auto-parts in the garage. We are the automotive Indiana Jones of the block. You?""
If she says something funny, it's ok to write a quick ""ha"" or ""lol"" if you must, but it's a lot better to actually respond to what she says. If she sends you a hilarious picture of a bulldog on a waterslide, laugh at it, but then say, ""Current mood?"" or ""That dog is my spirit animal"" or ""I suddenly feel so close to you.""

, Even if she doesn't ask you a question directly, or say something that's pretty interesting, try to respond in a specific way to reignite the conversation. Keep following up to keep her at ease and talking. Let her talk about herself and be a good ""listener"" while you talk via text.


If she says, ""School was so boring today"" don't just let it drop, follow up. Say, ""What was the most boring thing?"" or ""But what was the most EXCITING thing that happened in your boring day?"" Get her talking by asking questions.
If she's being really closed, just saying, ""lol"" or something to that effect, it may be better to just end the conversation instead of doing all the work yourself. She might be distracted, or just not that into talking right now. Don't get upset, just talk later.

, Some studies show that we're actually attracted to gentle teasing, because it creates a kind of electric energy in the conversation.If you want to inject a little tension into your texting conversations, teasing her just a little (be nice now) can make your texts a little more thrilling.


If she just put up a bunch of selfies on Facebook, text her: ""Scrolling through all these selfies. I'm going to guess what you're thinking in each of them. This first one says, 'This mirror is SO DIRTY.'""

, Texts are great for quick, witty, light conversations, not for in-depth talks about your relationship. If you're unsure what to talk about, keep it jokey and focused on silly topics or fun. Talk about any of the following topics:


Silly things you saw or read on the Internet
Dumb things you overheard someone say
Ironic things that happened to you
Your siblings, your pets, or your family
Fun plans for the future, or talking about a date you just went on

, You may be in a chatting mood, but your girlfriend might be sitting in class, or busy with a family event, or working in the library. Just as you might not bug someone in person if they were doing any of these things, it's a good idea to avoid texting her while she's busy.


Avoid texting late at night, while you're busy, or any time you suspect your girlfriend might be driving. If she's texting you, don't respond or tell her that you'll text her later.

, You don't have to write like you're in writing class, but it's still important to make sure you're spelling words (mostly) correctly so that your girlfriend can read them. Take the time to write out full sentences when you can, making each text full of content, so she doesn't have to scroll through 50 to get what you're saying.


While you might not care, some people are turned off by too many uses of ""ur"" and ""gr8.""

, That ""..."" bubble can be nerve-wracking to wait for, but it's important to give her a chance to respond before you start blasting off extra texts. This can seem aggressive and impatient. Don't assume she'll always be right by her phone ready to respond.


Don't text too much. Keep the ratio at roughly 1 : 1. Save some stuff for real-life interactions.If she doesn't respond to your texts, or isn't giving you interesting responses, just stop sending messages. Never send angry texts, or lash out via text.

, When she writes something, or asks you a question, respond when you have something to say. It's not good to play ""hard to get"" when you're texting with a girl. Just respond as soon as you see she's written something and try to have a conversation.


If she asks you a question and you don't have an answer right away, still respond to her text. If she says, ""Dinner Friday?"" Write back, ""Sounds fun! But let me make sure my schedule is clear. I'll get back to you later today."" Don't just keep her waiting.

, Sometimes, your meaning can be hard to interpret, and your texts can seem overly aggressive or harsh with just the words. Most phones have a variety of emojis that you can use to help color your texts, to make them a little easier to read.


""What are you doing?"" or ""Where are you?"" can seem a little needy via text. But, ""On the way yet? : )"" is a lot more friendly.
Emojis can be funny, but don't make them do too much of the work. If you send the devil and poop emojis simultaneously when your gf asks what you're doing, that's just weird.

, All conversations fizzle out. While you can comfortably share silence in person, texting requires the conversation to end. When they just kind of trail off, that can be awkward, so it's a good idea to be the one who ends the conversation on a high note.


If you've got her laughing, say you've got to get going and make plans to talk later: ""Well, I gotta go to dinner. Talk to you later?"" Leave her wanting more.

Start out with a casual greeting.,
Wait for a response.,
Ask what he's doing.,
Use what you're doing as an opening.,
See if he gets the hint.,
Talk about sensory details.,
End the conversation while he's still interested.",How to Turn a Guy on Through Text Message," You can open with something simple like ""Hey"" or ""Hi."". Alternatively, step it up with a subtle compliment and say something like ""Hey handsome!"";
, If he's interested, he'll respond and you can continue putting yourself out there. If not, move on!

, Starting the conversation by asking what he's doing gives you an opening to talk about what you're doing in a second. For now, though, text something like ""So... what are you up to tonight?"" or ""How's it going?""


If you feel bold, fish for a compliment. Instead of asking what he's doing, say something like, ""I hope I'm not interrupting anything, but I miss you! Hope that's ok. :)"". If he likes you, he'll take it as an opportunity to let you know he loves it when you text him.

, Once he asks what you're up to (or you're just ready to tell him), use it as a way to start flirting. For instance:


If it's late and you're getting ready to go to sleep, tell him you're lying in bed but it's harder to fall asleep without someone to cuddle with.
If it's cold, tell him you're in bed FREEZING, or some variation of that. It's a perfect opening for talking about him ""warming you up"".
If you're not doing anything particular, tell him you're ""...distracted thinking about this really hot guy..."".

, If he does, he'll probably text back saying something about how he wishes he could be there to ""help you fall asleep/warm you up,"" or he'll slyly ask you who you're thinking about.


If he doesn't get it, don't give up! You'll just have to be a little more obvious. For instance, if you're talking about being cold, say something like, ""If you were here, maybe I wouldn't have this problem... ;)"". That should get him thinking about being with you.

, If you have him thinking/texting about being with you, now's the time to get him fantasizing about seeing you. Try these areas:


Discuss what you'd do with him. This can be vague (like talking about spooning in general), or specific (like talking about how you'd like to slowly kiss him).
Talk about what you're wearing (whether or not it is what you're actually wearing; he's not there to tell the difference, right?). Again, you can be subtle (""I wish you could see what I have on right now..."") or more specific, like discussing your favorite thing to wear to bed.
Hint at what you might do with him in the future. Dropping hints about doing the things you've talked about the next time you see him is a surefire turn-on. (Just be sure that's what you actually want before you promise anything.)

, Don't let the texting get stale before you leave; bow out while it's still sexy and interesting and you'll be on his mind for the rest of the day/night.

Know your instructor.,
Make sure your phone is accessible.,
Scan the perimeter.,
Make sure the time is right.,
If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, you are ready to proceed to the following step.,
Take your phone out and begin texting.,
Wear a jacket with big sleeves.,
Slink low in your chair and text in your lap.,
Put it on silent not vibrate.,
Use your environment.,
Put your phone away, in a safe and accessible place such as in your pocket, or the front zipper compartment of your backpack.",How to Text Unnoticed During Class," If you have a teacher that is oblivious or that does not care if you have cellular devices visible, this whole process will be a lot easier. With other teachers that are more strict, it can be a better idea to not even embark on this endeavor.;
, Have it in an easily reachable, yet not obvious, place on your person. Put it on vibrate (or preferably, silent) so it will not be seen or heard.

, Make sure nobody is watching you, student, teacher, or otherwise. All of your other efforts will be fruitless if you cannot follow this first step. Try to see if your teacher is looking away, preoccupied with something else, sleeping, etc. Sitting in a strategic location (i.e., in the back row where it is hard to see you) can also work to your advantage.

,


Is it loud in the class?
Is nobody watching?
Is your phone on vibrate or silent?
Will your phone make a minimal amount of noise when you're texting?

, If not, wait for a proper opportunity.

, Make sure that it is not obviously visible. Some strategic locations to place it include behind a binder or book, under your desk, or under some papers. Do not set these up as vertical barriers or walls around you - this will make the act obvious. The key is to look as natural as possible. Try the following methods prescribed by high school students:

, Hold your phone and envelope your entire hand into the sleeve. Then use the other hand to pull on the piece of the sleeve facing you so you can see the screen and buttons.

, It helps if you can text without looking.

, You can still hear it. Especially if the class gets really quiet.


Use the small part of the table in science classes.

, Use props such as your pencil case, sit the pencil case on your table and in the bottom pocket place your mobile. You can easily slip your hands in and use the top half of the pencil case to hide your mobile when you are texting and be able to look up a the appropriate times.


Don't use your backpack... That's how everyone gets caught. Sometimes being more open is better then being sneaky - you could text all the time with my phone on your desk and kids who did it in their purse would get yelled at... Don't look like you're being sneaky. The best thing to do is learn to text with out looking at your phone, keep it at level with your desk or just below, that way you're looking up constantly except for a few seconds... Also if they notice you can easily drop it into your backpack or whatever.

, Make sure you will still be able to receive and send messages easily.

Send or receive a text from a landline.",How to Text Someone," Texting doesn’t vary that much depending on the phone, but there can be some slight differences, especially between older cell phones and smart phones.


For example, you might see “messaging” on a phone’s menu to start the texting process. Or you might see “Send SMS” instead. It means the same thing.
Newer smart phones will offer keyboards that are touch screens. You will use this to type the message. On older phones, you will need to use a keyboard built into the phone itself, that doubles as the buttons you press with numbers to call people.;
, Be aware that you may have to pay to receive or send texts.Some cell phone plans have unlimited texting built into the plan. If you’re going to be texting a lot, this might be a better idea. Some plans will only let you send a certain number of texts per month before incurring overcharges, though.
If you don’t have an unlimited plan, you could be charged something like 20 cents per text, so make sure you research the costs beforehand.

, Find the text messaging function in the menu. Usually you are looking for the icon that says “messages” or messaging” on the main menu of the phone.


On some phones, it will say messages on the bottom of the screen. Choose it. Select “new text message.”
With an iPhone, you may see a green messages box on the home page. Touch it or click OK, depending on the phone., You should see a list of your old texts organized by recipient if you’ve texted people before. If you haven't, it will take you to a blank page.


To continue texting a person you’ve texted before, simply click on their name or phone number first.
If you’ve never texted the person, you will need to have their phone number handy in order to text them. You will be texting directly to their cell phone (or landline).

, On newer smart phones, choose “new message” or “write message” or choose the icon for creating a new message.


This icon is a + sign in some phones. In iPhones, it’s a little square with a line. This should open up the new text message box.
When you click on the icon, a new message box opens. This is where you will type your message. First you need to decide who you will be sending the text to and obtain their contact information.

, You will type this in the message’s “To:” field at the top of the message box. Make sure to include the area code.


You could also select the number from the contact list in your phone’s address book. Just type their name in the field, and it might autofill the number in for you. If you’ve texted the person before, when you start typing in the number, it might also show up automatically for you.
To send a text to more than one person with a smart phone, simply click on the plus sign icon. Or you can just add more contacts in the To: field by adding more phone numbers or names (if they are in your contact list).

, How you do this depends on your phone type. If you have a smart phone with a keyboard (push button or touch screen), you simply use that to type the message.


If you have an older handset that has a numeric keypad, you will see letters under each of the numbers you use to call people. You may need to press the key several times to enter the letter you want if the number key has several letters on it.
On some phones you will press “O” to type a space. If you have a newer smart phone, like an iPhone or Android, you can just tap out letters on a touch screen keyboard, so it will be a lot easier.

, Perhaps you want to add a video or photo to your text. This is pretty easy to do.


Click the camera icon for some newer smart phones. The phone’s photo library will pop up. You can select a preexisting photo of video from it. Clicking on it will add it to your text.
Some newer phones also have a “take photo or video” function. If you click it, you can take a photo or record a video right into the text message.
Some phones also allow you to record an audio text. To do this, click on the little microphone sign (or similar icon) on the bottom right of the text message box. Tap and hold to send audio. This allows you to record your voice instead of texting via written word.

, To send the text, after you’ve typed in your message in the message box, you will simply need to hit “send.”


If you want to reply to a text message, it works the same way. You click on the text you’ve received, and then type your reply in the smaller message box that appears at the bottom of the screen.
Then hit “send” after you’ve completed your reply, and it will text the reply back to the person who wrote to you. The benefit of a text message is it should reach the recipient immediately.
To forward a text message, tap and hold the message. Select the option to forward the message. You will probably find this under the “options” menu.
Again you will have to type the recipient’s phone number into the To: field and send it.

, Texting format is usually pretty short. In fact, you will be limited in how much you can write. The purpose of texting is to allow people to send short bursts of messages to each other quickly.


You can only write 160 characters for each text, so get to the point. Think of a text email as a short email.You can keep texting, but the cell phone will break your text into multiple texts. Watch your tone. People can misperceive it, thinking you are angry when you are not. Stay polite in text messages and remember that people could save them to use against you.

, Because texting is short and people are often texting others on the fly, a texting lingo has developed in which people use shorthand abbreviations for longer sentences.


You may receive these codes from someone texting you, and you will need to know what they mean. Some common ones are: BRBR (Be right back). BTW (by the way). IDK (I don’t know). IMO (in my opinion).
Other codes include LOL (laugh out loud). ILY (I love you). FWIW (For what it’s worth). And CUL8R (See you later)., Sometimes people add emoticons to their texts to indicate their emotion. For example, you can choose a smiley face emoticon. This is the most common and would indicate you’re happy.


There are also emoticons for kisses, love, anger, sadness, crying, and basically every emotion you might be feeling. People use emoticons in texts to express how they are feeling in a way that is less ambiguous.Newer smart phones, such as iPhones, are going to have more complex and elaborate emoticons than the typical smiley faces. You will usually see the emoticons as a choice at the bottom of your keyboard screen or text message box when texting.

, It’s possible to sign up to receive text alerts. Sometimes, commercial products will allow you to do this and will send you information about sales and things like that.


Sometimes people sign up for text alerts because they want to receive information about breaking news, traffic, or weather information.
Some television shows allow automated voting or contest participation via text messaging. It’s also possible to forward your emails to your mobile device.

, Some phone companies, like AT&T allow your to pay an extra charge to send and receive text messages from a landline.You can also send text messages to landline phones using “text to landline” services.The service will convert your text into a voicemail.
You create and text the message the same way, simply plugging in the number of the landline. However, you may have to purchase the service first. Call your phone provider. Some phone plans include text to landline automatically. If the landline is eligible to receive the text, the message will be sent, usually with a recorded female voice. Some landline recipients can reply with voice message.

Make sure your phone is set to T9 mode.,
Examine your keyboard.,
Open a blank text message or note.,
Check to see if the word is entered correctly.,
Determine if the number combination creates multiple words.,
Send your first text message using T9 word.,
Download the Type Nine app if you want to use T9 on an iPhone.,
Press 1 to enter commonly-used punctuation.,
Hold down a key to enter a number.",How to Text Message Using T9Word," You can open a blank message to test this. If your phone starts predicting the word you’re typing as you hit buttons, T9 is already on and you’re all set! If not, your phone is set to the multi-tap method, and you’ll need to turn on T9. Check your “Settings” or “Options”– you may have to explore your phone a bit to figure out how to do this.;
, As you can see, each number on the keypad has three or four letters on it. For example, the number 2 has “ABC,” the number 3 has “DEF,” and so on. Familiarize yourself with the keyboard, especially if you’ve never used it before or you’re used to typing with a full keyboard.


At first, you’ll probably do the “hunt and peck” method to find the letters you need, but it will become second nature once you use T9 enough!

, It’s time to practice! Use the word “HELLO” to practice. In multi-tap texting, you would need to press the 4 button twice to get to the “H,” then the 3 button twice to get to the “E,” and so on. With T9, you only have to press the number that the letter is on, and you do not need to double or triple press it to get to the letter you want.For “HELLO,” you would only need to press 4-3-5-5-6. These are the numbers containing the letters that spell “HELLO.”

, If the word you wanted is not showing up, make sure you’re spelling it correctly. T9 can only predict words found in the dictionary. However, most phones allow you to save or “remember” words you use often, such as names or places not found in the dictionary. Try entering your word again, remembering to only press the number for the letter you need once.


Take the time to store words that you want your phone to remember.Different phones have different ways to do this, but play around with your phone to figure out how to create your own personal dictionary. Add anything you know you’ll be typing often, like your best friend’s name, the town you live in, and so on. If you can't figure out how your specific phone stores words, google ""Storing words in T9"" along with the model of phone you're using.

, In other words, the letter combination 2-2-5-5 can create the words “call,” “ball,” and “balk.” Your phone doesn’t know which one you need, so this might be your issue. There are a couple ways to fix this, depending on the type of phone you’re using.


On some phones, you can press the 0 key to shuffle between words with the same number combinations.
Some phones use the up and down arrow buttons to shuffle through the words.

, Make sure you read over your text before you press send. It’s not uncommon for T9 mishaps to create awkward or confusing moments, so proofread always. I’m sure you’d rather text your opponent that you can’t wait to “kick their butt” rather than “lick their butt”!


It may be a slow process at first, but you’ll get the hang of it. Soon, you’ll be able to type out a T9 message faster than someone with a full keyboard.

, Because iPhones have full keyboards, you can’t simply turn on T9 messaging. You can find the Type Nine app in the iPhone app store, and it will give you a traditional, old school keyboard for $1.99.The Type Nine app has larger keys than the full iPhone keyboard, so it can be good for someone who struggles to hit the correct keys.
Additionally, T9 word can be much easier to do one-handed, where full iPhone keyboards work best with two hands. People who prefer one-handed texting will love the Type Nine app.

, If you need something like a period, a comma, a question mark, or an exclamation mark, you can repeatedly press 1 to cycle through these symbols and find the one you need. If you need a punctuation mark that is less common, you may need to press and hold the pound symbol (#) to get a full list to choose from., If you want to enter the number 5, you would have to press the 5 key four times to get there, cycling through J, K, and L first. Instead, you can simply hold down the 5 key, which is the quickest way to get the number you need."

You may have to pay off the extra charges yourself.;
, You don't want to text bomb someone who is too sensitive or might actually get angry. Choose someone that you can joke around with and who might get annoyed, but will ultimately think it's funny or forgive you quickly.

, It will be easy to trace the messages back to you and there could be some very serious consequences. A victim of text bombing could claim harassment and you could have to go to civil court."
"
Greet the person respectfully.,
Don't be desperate.,
Understand that most people will not put anything more in a text message than they need to, especially if they don't know you like them, or if they don't have feelings for you.,
End the texting well.,
Try to be the first one to say goodbye.,
Do not bother the other person.,
Every once in a while, it's okay to ask them if you're being annoying, like if you suspect they may be doing work or writing an essay when you text them.,
Don't use Internet slang too much.,
Acknowledge that it's always about them.,
For the girl: Sometimes, it may seem like the guy should always start the conversation.,
For the guy: Nobody likes a player, so just get to know her before you decide if you really do like her.,
Be interesting!,
Be Funny, Playful, and a little cocky.,
Do not text any of the following messages: “hey” “how are you?” “what’s up” “how was your weekend?” “what”s going on?” “hope you're have a great day!”.",How to Text Message Someone You Like," Everyone loves the phrase ""what's up"", but honestly, it's gotta go. Because those of you who use it, what's the answer you always get? ""Nothing much, you?"" or ""nm u?"". So think outside of the box, and try something more along the lines of ""What are you up to?"" ""Whatcha doing?"" Something playful that will catch their attention. They may answer something like ""Hanging out"", which is perfectly okay, because at least you know that they're hanging out and not dying in the void of ""not much""-ness.;
, If you text her and she doesn't respond, be patient. Don't text her again or ask her if she got your text. Play it cool; otherwise you will look needy.

, Just deal with it for now, because sometimes they may be interested in you and are just shy, or they don't have very good typing skills on their phone.

, You have to excuse the single-lined ""lol"" text messages that may come. If the conversation comes to a halt with one of these, just stop it right there. If you reply afterwards with something like, ""So... That paper we had to write last week was really hard,"" you might seem a bit desperate, so just end it right there. If you two are closer, like friends, you may want to say goodbye first, like ""I'm gonna go listen to music. ttyl?"" If not yet, just end it. Seriously, it's always annoying when you desperately want the conversation to end, but it never does because they won't leave you alone.

, It leaves the other person possibly wanting more. Try to recognize when the conversations are slowing down so that you can be the first one to cut it off. She/he will love you for this eventually, because bad, lazy conversations usually end in bored pauses and no actual interesting points.

, Unless it's a fantastic day where you're both flirting and having a great time texting each other, never start a conversation more than twice a day.


Moreover, never, ever try to keep talking after they've stopped the conversation. This is considered annoying and is often disliked in most cultures.

, Only ask this when they say something that might mean that they're busy or need to concentrate


For example, if they say they're working on an essay for English, you can say ""Just let me know if I'm distracting you, I don't want to bother you."" This they can reply to politely. If to this they reply that they'll text you back later, don't expect them to. If after an hour or two they don't, don't freak out. Just let them text you when they want to.

, Using constant chat speak is seldom attractive. It's okay to use it among regular conversation, but never compose your entire text of all chatspeak.


Remember to blend to their style. For example, if they use ""idk"" often enough, but they prefer to speak in actual words, try it. They probably speak like this because they don't like chatspeak, and it would make it easier for them to talk to you if you use their form of dialogue. It goes the same way for people who speak in all chatspeak, try their language if you haven't already.

, The title says it all. It's all about the other person. Remember that people LOVE to talk about themselves, and this benefits you too because you'd be finding out more about them. Ask them questions, like ""what do you like to do?"" or ""do you play any sports?"" However, you must wait until you know them a bit before you start asking these questions.


Perhaps during the third text conversation, begin questioning about their personality and interests. After a few questions, just let them know that you're kinda bored or whatever and want to know what they're into anyway, so that's why you're asking so many questions.
In a conversation, it is also pretty crucial not to creep them out, so try to veer into a conversation after one of the questions, like ""What sport do you play?"" -""I fence."" -""Oh, that's cool! I've always wanted to do that, but I never got to."" -""It's a lot of fun, you should try it."" -""What's it like?"" Etc., etc. Even if you're not interested, try to make it seem like you are.

, No, you're the one interested. Granted, you shouldn't text him every single day; try every other day or every few days, giving him a chance to initiate as well. Maybe he likes talking to you, who knows.


Also, never act like an obsessive one. Don't immediately flirt with him the moment you text him, pretend that he's another girl that you just met and want to be friends with, and after a while flirt a little, and as everything progresses, flirt some more.

, She could be pretty and have an absolutely horrendous personality, so just try talking to her in person as well as texting her to see who she really is. Flirt with her once you've actually decided that you like her.

, ""Hey."" ""hi."" ""What's up?"" ""Nothing much. you?"" ""Same."" ""Yep."" ""We won our Hockey game, yesterday."" ""Congrats."" ""Thanks."" ... No. Fill your conversation with color! Act like you're genuinely excited to talk to this person, you're happy to!


Saying ""Hey! Whatcha doing?"" will save you a text, in case you have limited texting. Always have a backup topic to start, such as ""So, Merry Christmas! Did you get anything good?"" Or ""I can't believe it's already 2014.""
Or ""Any idea what the word 'zyzzyva' means? I just found out and wanted to know if you did ;)"" Be someone fun to talk to! And overall, be someone reliable, so that they won't be afraid to say, ""Can you help me out...?"" when they need someone. Trust is key in a relationship.

, Text things like “Hey! Stop thinking about me! :P” or “I just made you look at your phone for no reason… looks like I got you in check =]”

, Be more creative, these are common messages that everyone gets all the time. It gets boring quickly so text something more interesting to differentiate yourself.

Once you are out the door and headed in the right direction, pick up your phone.

,
See if you received a text or decide if you need to send a text.

,
If you have anything else in your hand, try to put it in your purse/backpack so that you can use two hands to text.,
Type in the name of the person you are texting.,
Hold your phone in front of your face at an eye level of about 1 foot (0.3 m) away so that you can see it well, but make sure you are still watching where you are walking every few steps.

,
Write a few words of the text, then look up every 10-20 seconds to make sure you are going the right way and are not about to trip over something or someone.

,
If you happen to run into something or someone, this is not a big deal as long as you don’t hurt yourself.,
As you are doing the combination of texting and watching where you walk, make sure you keep a steady pace so you are not late.,
Once you are finished with the text, send it and wait until you receive a reply (This waiting period is a good time to actually watch where you are going).

,
When you get a reply or need to make another call, that is when you start the process again.",How to Text While Walking," Don’t just think of the final destination but think of your path as well!;
,,, However, this becomes a problem if you have a coffee in hand like most students! In this case, result to using 1 hand. This is tricky and will take longer, but it can be done.

, Then, before you begin texting, watch where you are going and think of exactly what you want to say so that you don’t waste more time simply staring at your phone.

,,, Just say ""excuse me"" and keep going.

,


Texting and walking is serious multitasking, so before sending the text, make sure you read it over first. You do not want to rely on auto-correct… ever!

,, This gets easier with practice.

Know your phone.,
Prepare your phone.,
Choose your seat.,
The text.,
Make it normal.,
Also another fantastic tip is to get a phone covering that is not to bright or take your bright phone cover off if it is an eye-catching.

,
If your desk is not a rack desk (also known as a see-through) place the phone in the desk and pretend to be getting books out of the desk.

,
Never put the phone out in the open.,
If you put your cell-phone in your binder in your desk, don't forget about it.",How to Text in Class," An important part of texting in class is being able to do it 'blind', or without looking. You will need to know where all of the buttons are on your phone, and how to navigate to them using only touch. This is easier if you don't have a plastic case. You'll also need to navigate to the text input screen. This is as simple as mathematically memorizing the key order you have to use to get there. All of this amounts to being able to looking as though you're paying attention to the teacher, when in fact you are texting under the desk.;
, Phone preparation is highly important. You will need to set up your phone before class, to make it less obvious. Firstly, turn off the back-light. Considering that you won't be looking at the screen it seems a bit superfluous. Without the screen on, the teacher won't be able to see those tell-tale flashes of white light when you take your phone out. Secondly, you'll need to turn all sound off, or at least put it on vibrate. That means key-tones, ring-tones, alerts, everything. You can usually do this by pressing the 'Volume Down' button until it reads 'Vibrate All'. The jig will be up if someone texts you and the 1812 Overture starts up in your pocket.You can also get the mosquito ringtone. It is a very high pitched ringtone that adults can't hear because of their age. WARNING: be careful! everyone else that can hear your mosquito ringtone will look around to find the source of the sound. The teacher will know if the class starts to awkwardly look around the classroom.

, You need to pick the seat you use very carefully. There are several things to assess:

Entrance. If someone comes through the door, will they be able to see my phone?
Tell-tales. Am I sitting next to the teacher's pet who will almost certainly tell the teacher as soon as I open my phone?
Windows. Can anyone see me from outside?
Enemies. Do you have anybody that your dislike in your class? Will they tell just to get back at you?
Bullies. Are you sitting near a bully that could tell on you or crush your phone into pieces?
The teacher. Will the teacher be able to see me?
Once you've determined that none of these are threats, you can take your seat.

, Keep your phone in your blazer/trouser pocket that you will be able to access easily with your texting hand. During class, shift your weight as though you were getting a sore behind, and as you do it slide the phone out of your pocket. You now have two options. Either pretend to get something out of your bag, or text with it at your side. If you aren't confident about blind texting the first maneuver is for you. To do it just:


Announce that you can't find something. With your free hand look for it on your desk. Then move to your bag. Put your hand with the phone in it into your bag. Pretend to be looking for the right book, while you rapidly fire off a text. The trick to this is to make the text quickly, and then actually pull a book out of your bag, so that it is hiding the phone as you slip it back into your pocket. Smooth, fast maneuvers are the key here. Practice the last part so that the phone is in your pocket by the time the folder is above the desk line.
If you're writing a short text, the teacher isn't moving around and you know you can blind text, the second option is for you.
Bend over your work, pretending to write. Slip your texting hand, with phone, into your lap. The trick with this is to pretend to be writing, moving your free hand across the page. The advantage with this one is you can glance at your phone, but its more obvious than the bag technique. Once you're done, lean back, pretending to wring out your free hand from writing too much while you slip your phone back into your pocket. For posterity and realism, don't go back to writing with your other hand immediately. Pretend to write with that one for a bit longer, then wring it out again and keep going with your normal hand.

, In every class, perform your chosen maneuver at least once, regardless of whether you're actually texting. This will make your peers believe that you do just need to get a book, or your hand really is tired from writing. It will subconsciously become normal to them, and they won't question your actions. It will take longer for your teachers to get accustomed to these though.

,,, You are in serious danger.

, You could pull it out and it will drop to the ground. This may still be dangerous so do it at your own risk.

Open your text messaging app and choose your friend from your contacts.,
Send random, one-letter texts or emojis.,
Send a longer message by texting one word at a time.,
Block their number.",How to Text Bomb People2," Try to wait until you know your friend is doing something important, like on a date or at work, and that s/he will have his or her phone.

, This is the quickest way to send rapid-fire texts. Hold one thumb over the ""send"" button and use your other phone to randomly tap letters, numbers, symbols or emojis.


Alternate between thumbs, quickly tapping a letter with one thumb, then tapping send with your other thumb, almost like playing a video game.
Send as many messages as you can for as long as you can. The longer you text bomb, the more annoyed the person will be., If you actually want to say something and not just send as much gibberish to your friend as possible, break the message up and send it word by word. Don't worry about spelling--you still want to type and send as quickly as possible.


Try sending the lyrics to an entire song, word by word.
Send the same word over and over again. Connect with your inner two-year old and respond to everything they say by texting ""why?"" again and again.
If you are sending the same message repeatedly, save time and copy and paste into your text box instead of typing it out each time.

, To prevent the person from retaliating, temporarily block their phone number from your phone. They will get even more annoyed when they realize they can't text you back to yell at you or to get you back with their own text bomb attack.

"

Use a website to text bomb your friend.,
Search for a text bombing app for your phone.",How to Text Bomb People3," There are websites that will allow you to enter the phone number, your message, and the number of times you'd like it sent. Then the website can do your dirty work for you, sending sometimes hundreds of text messages to the phone number.

, Many text bombing apps have been removed from app stores after complaints, so it might be hard to track down one that works well or doesn't charge a lot of money."

Be original.,

Show that you care about her.,
Don't overdo it.,
Know when it's time to end the conversation.,
Leave on a good note.,
If you've established a connection and feel like you and her are having a great time talking, then go ahead, ask her out.",How to Text a Girl That You Like," Try to send your girl a text that not just any guy could send. Don't just say hi or send her a weird emoticon; find a way to make her smile or to pique her interest. Do whatever you have to do to make her think, ""Hey, there's something special about this guy. I want to keep talking to him."" Here are some ways to be original:


Charm her with your wit. Make a witty observation that shows the girl your unique way of looking at the world.
Make her laugh. Show her that you can be clever--even over texting.
Tell her something she hasn't heard before. If you just heard an amazing piece of news that you know will make her jaw drop, share your knowledge.;
, A question is a great place to start because then your girl will know that you're waiting for an answer. You don't want to leave her with that, ""What am I supposed to say to that?"" feeling, so the more direct and specific you are, the better. Here are some great ways to ask a question:


Ask about her day or her week. If you knew she had an important event on the horizon, ask how it went.
Make sure the question is something she can easily answer. Don't ask about the meaning of life; ask the girl what she's doing for the 4th of July.
Keep it simple. Just one short sentence can communicate a large message.
Keep it open-ended. Instead of asking, ""What time did you get home from the concert last night?"" say, ""How was the concert last night?"" This will give your girl more to work with. If you ask a question that can be answered in just one or two words, then you may be cutting off the conversation before it had a chance to start.

, This may seem silly, but you should make sure to watch your spelling and punctuation before you text the girl. Though you don't have to sound like the F. Scott Fitzgerald of texting, you should show the girl that you care enough about her to construct grammatically correct sentences.


Take the time to actually use capitalization and apostrophes when you need to. Don't go overboard and start using semi-colons and dashes all over your texts, but just give your texts the same quick scans you would give to an email before you send it.

, If you're trying too hard when you're first texting a girl, she'll be able to tell right away. Remember to be yourself and don't go out of your way to say something that doesn't even sound like you just because you think it will impress her. The worst part about trying too hard is that the girl will be able to tell that you're doing it right away.


Remember to relax. Don't send her a long or feverish-sounding text message. Just one sentence at a time is just fine.
Don't try too hard to be funny. If being funny comes natural to you, great, but if you find yourself writing ""hahaha"" after your own sentences to show her that you're making a joke, then you should take a step back.
Remember that your girl is probably a little nervous too. This should make you feel better about conversing. Just be yourself, and don't sweat over trying to say the perfect thing.

, Show your girl that you're capable of keeping up a fun conversation over the phone. In turn, she'll think that you can hold up your end of a conversation in person. Your goal in texting the girl you like is giving her just a sliver of your personality and making her want more. If you fascinate the girl, she'll keep wanting to talk to you. Here's how to do it:


Find a common interest. Though you don't have to talk about your political or religious beliefs while texting, you should find a common interest. Even if it's just a TV show or a band, this will allow you to continue.
Mention something you're passionate about, such as soccer or even cooking pasta. This will catch her eye.
Communicate that you're willing to spend time on things that interest you. If you're hanging out with friends or practicing with your band, tell her. She'll be more interested in you if she knows you have a life.
Show off your wit. If she says something funny, don't just say ""Ha ha"" and end the conversation. Instead, say something funny back and show her that you can keep up.

, Flirting with your girl will not only make her want to keep talking to you, but will give her the hint that you're actually into her. You should flirt just enough to show her you're interested, but don't go overboard or she'll want you to back off. Here's how you can keep up the conversation by flirting:


Be playful. At the right time, show her your silly side by making a goofy comment. No woman likes a guy who takes himself too seriously.
Tease her. If you know her well enough, tease her gently and wait for her to tease you back. Just make sure that she can pick up on your tone from the text and knows that you're joking.
Don't be afraid to send the occasional "";-)"" emoticon. Though you shouldn't overuse these, a well-timed emoticon is a great way to flirt.

, There are a few easy ways to show the girl that you care about her without being obvious about it. Sending a text at the right time can let her know that you're thinking about her and that she's important to you. Here's how to show your girl that you care through your texts:


Show that you value her opinion. Ask her what she thinks about a certain subject, like a new movie that's playing or a new restaurant that just opened-up.
Ask her open-ended questions about herself. You shouldn't get too personal, but if it comes up, ask what she's up to or what she likes to do on the weekends.
Show that you remember your conversations. If she told you that she had a big test coming up, impress her by sending her a ""good luck"" text the evening before.

, You need to make sure that your feelings are reciprocated and that you're not bombarding her with texts that aren't welcome. You can show you're interested, but should avoid coming off as needy, annoying, or just plain embarrassing. Here are some ways to avoid coming on too strong:


Make sure there's an equal flow of conversation. If you text her ten times for every one or two responses you get, it's time to back off.
Don't text her the second you hear from her. If it takes her a day to get back to you, just chill. If you fire back a text five minutes after she finally responds you'll seem overeager -- and even desperate. Keep it cool, confident ,and comfortable.
Avoid excessive emoticons. Though the occasional well-placed emoticon is a great way to flirt, don't overdo it.
Avoid crazy punctuation or capitalization.

, If you want to keep your girl interested, then you should stop your texting sessions at the right time, or she'll get bored with your lengthy exchanges. Whether the girl seems busy or if you simply have nothing left to say: it's important to know when to stop texting her and try again later. Here are some signs that you should end the conversation:


If the girl is always the one to end the conversation, then maybe you should avoid texting her for a while until she initiates something herself.
If the girl is only giving you one-word responses, she may be too busy or not just interested enough to chat with you.
If the girl takes hours or even days to text you back, then maybe it's time to take it easy. Respect the fact that she has her own life to deal with, and move on with your own. But don't be upset, leave it in peace and remain positive. The opportunity to connect with her could be around the corner.

, You should always leave the conversation open so it will be easy for you to chat again. This is as easy as telling the girl that you're looking forward to seeing her later, or tell her what you'll be up to that evening so you can talk about it later. Here's what you should do at the end of the conversation:


Tell her you hope she has fun with whatever she's doing or wherever she's going.
Find a subtle way to let her know you'll be thinking of her.
Tell her ""good morning"" and ""good night"" at the appropriate times in the day (Of course avoid doing this too much at first, make sure the feelings are mutual. Otherwise you may come off as needy and/or annoying).
Let her know where you're going. Maybe she'll take it as a hint that you would like to meet up with her.

, Let it come naturally. The worst thing that can happen is that she says no, and that won't be the end of the world. If it's going well, then go for it. Here's how to do it:


You don't have to be formal about it. You can just tell her that you're going to a bar, restaurant, or concert with a few friends and ask if she and any of her friends want to come.
If you're having a long and detailed conversation, you can also just say, ""I'd love to pick up this conversation in person. How about we keep talking over dinner or a drink?"". Boom, it's a date.

Test the waters.,
Wait for the person to respond in a sexy way.,
Up the ante.,
If the person responds favorably, raise the stakes even higher.,
Get creative.,
Have fun with mutual masturbation.,
See the person you're texting.,
End the exchange.",How to Send Dirty Texts," Even if you've been dating a girl or guy for months, it may turn out that this isn't the type of communication that she or he is comfortable with. For that reason, it's important to test the waters before you get into raunchy or explicit messaging and completely throw the person off. Start with a simple greeting like, ""hey, baby"" or ""hey, sexy,"" and see how the person responds.


If you're not too explicit at first, you can also just play it off and deny that you were even trying to send a sexy text if the person gets angry or accuses you of trying to start something.
Just start with a sexual undertone. If you just say, ""What's up?"" or ""How are you?"" it'll be more difficult to transition to a sexy mindset. It's better to set the tone right away so the person knows what to expect.
You can also say, ""I'm a little bored. I could use some excitement in my life.""
Try this: ""I saw a girl who looked just like you in this movie I was watching. She was really hot -- but you're even hotter."";
, Once the person on the other end responds to the opening text in a favorable manner, it's time to play ball. If you see that the person is also up for dirty or sexy texting and is game, you can start to increase the sexual content of your texts -- but only by a little bit. Have patience as the person gets back to you. If it takes too long, you may not be in the mood anymore, and you can have fun another day.


Don't keep sending dirty texts if you get no response. If the person comes back to his or her phone to a slew of dirty text messages, that will just look weird.
If the person isn't into it, don't try to pursue it. Just apologize quickly and move on with your day -- there's no need to make a big production of it.

, Continue to send dirty texts but make them more explicit. You can even start to suggest that you can come over to put your dirty words into action. If the girl you're texting says she's studying sex ed, you can ask if you can come over for a ""hands on"" tutorial. Here are some other things you can say to up the ante:


""Hang on, let me put on some clothes.""
""It's so hot in here. I'm going to take my shirt off.""
""What are you wearing on this balmy night?""
""What if I showed you what I meant?""
""Can you guess the color of my underwear?""

, If you see that the person you're texting loves the dirty texts and maybe even wants to connect in person, then you can make the conversation even more explicit. You can talk about actually seeing the person you're texting, or about touching yourself or taking off your clothes. Here are some things you can say:


""I took off all my clothes. I'm just lying under a blanket now.""
""I'd text you, but I'd rather close my eyes and imagine you were here.""
""What would you do if you were next to me?""
""It's freezing in here. Why don't you come keep me warm?""
""Sorry it's taking a while to text you back. My hands are a little busy.""

, If both you and the other person are really into the dirty texting, then you can keep going until you start touching yourselves or plan to meet up. Whatever happens, bring some imagination and creativity into your texting so the person on the other end doesn't get bored. Be as detailed and descriptive as you can, and respond quickly so the other person knows she has all of your attention. Here are a few more things you could say:


""If you were here, I'd start stroking your hair. But then I'd start stroking something else...""
""I'm so excited I can barely text.""
""I'm wearing this tight shirt. Do you want me to take it off for you?""
""I'm taking off your belt -- I'm thinking about whipping you with it...""
""I just got out of the shower, so my hair is soaking wet. Do you have a towel?""

, If the dirty texting is going in the right direction, then you and your texting partner may slowly be removing your clothes and starting to touch yourselves. If both people are into it, then this can be a fun and stimulating activity. Just tell each other what you're doing to each other, what you're doing to yourselves, and what you would do if you were together.


All you have to do is let loose and talk dirty until you've both orgasmed.
You can say, ""I want you to my ."" This can make the sexy experience feel more real.
Tell the person how your body feels during the exchange -- describe every little sensation, even what you're feeling in your toes.

, Mutual masturbation is fun, but so is hooking up in person. If the conversation is going in that direction, then you can ask the person if she wants you to come over, or invite her over to your place. If it's clear that this is what the dirty texting is building towards, then you can suggest that the person should come over, and then be more explicit if you have to. Here are some things you can say:


""I'm trying to picture how hot you look, but I'd rather just see you in person.""
""Why don't you come climb into bed next to me? I want to see if it's as good as I'm imagining it to be.""
""I guessed the color of your underwear. But how will I know if I was right?""
""Why don't we continue this in person? I want to use my hands for something other than texting.""
""Why don't I drop in on you? I'll be in the neighborhood anyway -- if you want me to be.""

, Whether you're ending the exchange because you're coming over to see the person, or because you both got what you wanted, you should be suave when you end things. You can also just end the exchange because you've both had some fun with dirty texting and it's time to go. Whatever the reason, you should be smooth and should continue to set a sexy tone even at the end.


Don't just say, ""Bye!"" or ""See ya!"" when you're done texting. Say, ""I can't wait to text you again soon."" Or, ""I'll get in touch with you on another hot, lonely night."" Make the person want to hear more from you.
Don't switch to a non-sexy topic at the end of the conversation. Don't say, ""By the way, are you going to Kelley's birthday party tomorrow?"" Save that question for another time.
If you're ending the conversation because you're going to see the person, just say, ""I can't wait to continue this in person"" and make your way over to her place to take your dirty texting to a physical level.

Ask for her number.,
Introduce in your first text if she doesn't have you number.,
Send texts every now and then.,
Wait and look for signs that you're doing something right.,
Pay attention to signs that she's not as interested as she could be.,
Think about the sort of things that you want to text her.,
Try to put humor into your writing.,
Be sure to read what her texts say.,
Don't always try to flirt with her.,
Be sure to eventually move beyond texting.",How to Talk to a Girl by Texting," Texting will only work if you know her phone number. It's hard to ask a girl for her number, but try to be casual about it. A simple ""Hey, I don't think I have your number yet. Wanna exchange information?"" should get the job done most of the time.


When getting her number, avoid:

Getting her number from another friend. If she didn't personally give you her number, she's not going to expect you to text her. She could find it creepy that you got her number without asking her.
Asking her over IM or the internet. Asking her in person will make it very hard for her to refuse. Unless she's really in control and plain doesn't like you, you should get the number 9 times out of 10.
Making a big deal out of it. The less it looks like you care about getting the number, the better off you should be. If you look like you really care about getting it, she could be a little put off.

;
, If she gave you her number and is waiting for you to text her, start off with something like this:


""Hey, it's Geoff from yesterday. How's it going?""
""Hi there. It's Joey. Don't want to bother you long but have you seen this video? I almost died a second ago....""
Or try for something a little more self-consciously funny if you think you can pull it off:""The guy who just embarrassed himself in front of you by trying to ask for your number? That's me!""


, Send texts gradually to see how she responds. Don't break her phone with hundreds of texts in the beginning. A few texts a day, followed by a break of a day or two, will show her that you aren't absolutely crazy about her (which can be a turn off for some girls).

, We all have body language. You probably knew that. What you might not have known is that body language can bleed through texts. Signs that you're texting her the appropriate things include:


Quick responses. Is she responding back really quickly whenever you text her? If she's playing hard to get, she might be purposely waiting, so don't put too much stock in this.
Laughter and other emoticons. Is she laughing all the time with ""haha"" or ""lol?"" That's a good sign. Smiley faces and other emoticons are definitely good signs, too.
Flirting back with you. You'll know a flirt when you see one. If she texts you something like ""Oh I wouldn't have missed it for the world,"" or ""Anytime I talk to you, it's a good day"" means you're doing something good. Keep it up!

, Just like there are positive signs that you should be picking up on, there are negative signs that you can pick up on, too. Pay attention to these as you begin texting.


She doesn't respond to some of your texts. She just plain ignores them. If you said something impolite or insensitive, make a mental note not to text that again. Try giving her a little more space.
She writes back with very few words. If you sent her a couple of really nice, well thought-out texts, and she just responds with ""That's nice,"" it means she's not in the mood or doesn't think what you wrote is very interesting.
She's never the one to start texting you. If you always have to text her, and she never makes an effort to text you, things probably aren't going great — yet!

, It can be a good idea to start with generic things and build up to more personal things over time.


For example, you might tell her about upcoming parties and events at the start.
Later, you can send texts telling her what you're doing and where you're going.
Finally, you can send texts just letting her know that you're thinking about her and the sorts of things you like/love about her. (Do this only if you're in a relationship or you're not worried that she'll find that uncomfortable.)

, Texting her funny things will help make texting much easier. If you're a funny person, use that. If you're not, try developing inside jokes, playfully teasing her, or simply commenting on funny situations you both are part of.

, Respond to questions that she asks and also respond in a way that shows that you have read and taken in the things that she has been texting generally. She'll like that.


Don't always respond immediately every time she texts you. Wait a couple of minutes before you text back. Switch it up. Sometimes, wait a big longer, sometimes a bit more.

, Don't lay it on thick, all day, every day. If you've started flirting with her, do it sparingly. A little bit will go a long way. Learn to make your texts a little more diverse by texting about:


Her day-to-day life. ""Hows it going?"" ""How was your day?"" and ""Do anything fun over the weekend?"" are all normal texts.
Any problems she is dealing with. Let her come to you with the problems. Don't pry into her life. But try to offer advice if she seems open to it.
Things that are happening in your life. You're probably giving her a lot of attention, and that's fine. But maybe, just maybe, she wants to learn about what's happening to you. Share what you're doing, who you saw, and where you're going. A little goes a long way here. Don't get carried away.

, If you start to develop a relationship with a girl, don't just rely on texting forever and ever. Eventually, you're going to need to move past texting and start hanging out with her, calling her on the phone, and going out on dates. If this girl likes you, that's what she'll expect.

Text them about something you did together.,
Ask them a question.,
Text something attention grabbing.,
Let them know who you are if they don't have your number.,
Go for it.",How to Start a Text Conversation1," If you recently spent time with the person, you can always make the initial text about the last thing that you did together. Using an event as a reference point allows them to give you their opinion and is a casual way to start a conversation.For instance, you can say something like, ""Whoa, I'm so full. That restaurant was so good!""
Or you could say, ""Wow, Ms. Thornberry's class was so boring today. I was falling asleep."";
, Asking a question as your initial text puts the ball in their court and they can either respond or ignore you. If they respond with another question, make sure to follow up with them.Your question can be something as simple as ""What are your plans for the weekend?"" or ""What kind of shoes were you wearing today? I want to pick up the same pair.""

, Adding humor to an initial text is a great way to get the ball rolling. Avoid mundane openings like ""Hi"" or ""What's up?"" as your first text. If you text them something that they aren't used to seeing, there's a better chance of them texting you back.


You could say something like, ""So, I just walked 20 blocks for a sandwich only to realize that today's Sunday and the store is closed. How's your day going?""

, While a bit of mystery can build interest, you don't want to withhold your identity for too long or else it can come off as creepy. When you have a person's number, but they don't have yours, it's always good to let yourself be known.


Start the text with a question like ""Guess who this is?"" followed by your name, or ""Hey you, It's Garrett. I got your number from Kelly.""

, The only way you can start a conversation over text is by going for it. If you have their contact information but are too nervous or scared to reach out, you'll never be able to have a conversation with them. Don't wait too long and build up the event in your head. The worst that can happen is that they don't text you back, which is the same result you'd achieve by not texting them at all."

Search their phone when they're busy or distracted.",How to Spy on Text Messages1," Never throw around false accusations and never judge your current lover by what people in your past did to you. Only resort to monitoring someone's device usage if these tips fail and your suspicions are not simply based on jealousy, but reasonable suspicion. It is always better to be upfront and simply ask to see your significant other's phone. Same thing applies when wondering who your child is texting. Have a conversation about your trust issues, insecurities, suspicions doubts or concerns before resorting to spying on someone. Always be respectful and mindful of someone else's privacy.


Talk to your child about appropriate cell phone use. Do not be afraid to set limits such as when they can use their phone and regularly monitor their web and text behavior. There is nothing wrong with a parent that is trying to be completely aware of his/ her child's phone and internet activities.Set up a time to sit and talk with your significant other without any distractions. Set aside a couple hours for just the two of you. Use that time to discuss any concerns, doubts or fears that you have. You could also try writing them a letter in advance and then arrange a meeting in a neutral location (if that would be easier for you). Never jump to conclusions or hurl unproven accusations at them. That will simply push the person away. They will not view these issues as simple concerns that you have (that you two can work through). They will instead view your hostility and accusations as proof that you do not trust them, at all.
Just express how you feel and what actions led you to feel this way. Surely, if they are indeed not hiding anything, then they'll understand your honest concerns. They would likely be more than willing to let you see what you wish to see. Keep in mind, information can be deleted and people do lie. You should still always attempt to talk with your partner.;
, This is the most simple means of spying on a person’s phone. Wait for a time that they set their phone down due to being in a hurry. If they have to rush to leave a room or run an emergency errand. You must then quickly read text messages and search their call/web history, and if time permits check social media as well. Most times, if someone is doing something dirty behind your back they will delete the messages/ calls that could prove it. If you have a chance to get the device when they are busy, distracted, or caught off guard then they may have not had a chance to wipe away evidence, yet. So act quickly, and be smart. If you find anything, screenshot the evidence, send it to yourself, then store it in a private protected folder or print it out, to be kept safely in a lock box. Always make sure to delete the screenshots and messages that you send to yourself.

Select ""Messages"" from the main menu.,
Create a new message.,
Add a Contact to message.,
Write your message.,
Send your message.,
Send a picture or video if you want to.,
Customize your texting options.",How to Text1," On the Apple devices, this icon looks like a talk bubble from a comic strip. On the Samsung Galaxy and some other phones, the icon looks like an open envelope.
;
, On the iPhone, an icon appears in the top right corner of the Messages menu that looks like a pencil being put to a tablet. This will open the new message window. On other phones, you may select ""Create New Message"" from a menu.

, You can either message a contact from your Contacts List, or you can message a new phone number you haven't added into your contacts list yet. You can also select more than one person to message.


If you start typing the name of the person you want to message, the phone should provide a list of options you can browse through and select from. This will automatically enter their phone number in the ""To"" field.
Alternatively, you can also select someone from your Contacts List to start messaging. When you click on their name in the list, simply select ""Send Message"" from the list of available options and the phone will open the correct window.
If you've already messaged with someone previously, your existing or open conversations should pop up as soon as you select ""Messages"" from the main menu. Scroll through the list and select the conversation you'd like to reopen. 


, When you select the blinking cursor in the messaging field, your keyboard should pop up. Use the keyboard to type out the message you'd like to send.



Alternatively, you can select the Microphone icon near the keyboard on the iPhone to send a voice-activated message. After you select this icon, speak the message you'd like to send as clearly as possible. The phone won't add punctuation to the message, but this is an effective way to send messages if you can't or don't want to type.
Check for error corrections. If you misspell something while you're typing, some phone models will try to guess what you were trying to type and provide an alternative. If you want to use the substitute word, add a space and the word will be added automatically. If you don't want to use the word, hit the X on the suggested alternative.


, When your message is finished, simply click send. Most smart phones will display your conversation with comic-book style ""talk bubbles"" that correspond to you and the person you're texting with. That way, you can look back over most of the conversation or refer to it later.


The iPhone and other smartphones will display ellipses in a talk bubble when the other person is typing. It can take a few seconds for the message to arrive, so if you see this icon, you can wait until the person isn't typing to respond. This helps the conversation flow more smoothly. 


, Select the Camera icon to the left of the message field on an Apple product, or select ""Send Picture"" under your messaging options on another phone to send a picture message. You can either select a photo that you've already taken on your phone, or take a new photo to send. Once you've selected the photo, click ""Use"" and ""Send.""


Alternatively, you can select a photo from your Photo Album. Under the options, you can select ""Messages"" and then select a contact to send the picture to.

, Familiarizing yourself with your text messaging options under the phones Settings tab can help you make texting more user-friendly and fun. You can customize your notification settings, including whether or not you want your phone to vibrate or make a particular sound when you receive or send text messages.


Under your text settings (Go to Settings and then Texting) you can toggle between On/Off for ""Send Read Receipts."" This notifies the person you're messaging with that you've opened the conversation once they've sent the text. This is useful when you're texting time-sensitive things like driving directions, or when you're trying to text someone on the down-low. They don't need to respond with ""ok"" if you already know they've seen the message.

"
"
Use emojis often.,
Take your time in between texts.,
Send them photographs of things you're doing.,
Keep the conversation lighthearted.,
Send appropriate texts.",How to Start a Text Conversation2," Emojis are useful because the person that you're texting can't see your face or gauge your mood. Things like sarcasm can sometimes get lost in a text, so emojis help clarify how you actually feel about something. Don't go overboard and use emojis to replace every word because it can be too much for some people.You can say something like ""Chemistry was really interesting today. :)""
Or something like ""Chemistry is the most interesting subject in the world. :|""

, It may seem counterintuitive to take your time when you're in a text conversation, but it will actually help build interest. Texting too frequently may turn the person off. Try to act naturally and text when you have the time. This approach also allows the other person to think about their responses, which may make the conversation more meaningful., Pictures are a great way to give the person you're texting insight into what you're doing. Remember to keep the images appropriate and don't send too many selfies. If you send interesting photos to the person, they will want to keep texting you., Long detailed conversations about serious things can sometimes get lost in a text. It's best to leave these conversations for when you can talk on the phone or have a conversation with them in person.


If the person opens up to you, don't be afraid to respond. Try to follow their lead.
Lighthearted topics include how their day went, a show you both enjoy, or a song that you just heard.

, Try to assess their comfort level and your relationship with them. If you are exclusively friends, avoid saying flirtatious things or you may make them uncomfortable. If you are on more flirtatious terms, however, feel free to flirt with them over text.


If they don't respond to your texts, they are busy or they aren't interested in talking to you. Either way, you should back off and give them time to respond.
If you are just friends, you can say something like ""Hey dude. I'm monumentally bored. Wyd right now?""
If you are on romantic terms you can text something like ""Hey there. I'm bored. Trying to entertain me? ;)""

"
"
Ask them questions about themselves.,
Don't be judgemental.,
Don't be afraid to be yourself.,
Go with the flow.,
Don't text them too much if they don't respond.",How to Start a Text Conversation3," If you're unsure of what to talk about, you can ask them about themselves. Read what they have to say and ask them questions that relate to what they are texting you. The more that they open up and text you about their lives, the more often they will want to text., Once a level of trust has been built, they will likely open up to you and talk about more serious things. The worst thing that you can do is to be judgemental about the things they are sharing with you. Try to be understanding instead of judging them.If you're judgemental, they may be afraid to open up to you in the future and may not want to text you anymore.

, Don't second guess every text you want to send. If you find yourself typing out long texts and deleting them, stop and try to relax. The more that you act like yourself in the texts, the less pressure you'll have in future conversations. Be yourself and don't filter what you are going to say., A text conversation can sometimes get interesting and there's no way to direct the conversation. Instead of trying to force things, just go with the flow and text naturally. Listen to what they have to say and open up when they start opening up to you. If you want to ask for a date or to ask a deeper or more intimate question, wait until it feels appropriate to do so.


Don't get personal too fast or else they may be turned off by you.

, Being pushy or sending too many texts in a row can turn a person off and cause them to ignore you. Instead, play it cool and wait for them to respond. If they don't initially respond quickly, it could be because they are busy.As a rule of thumb, you should wait for a response after sending two texts.

"
"
Ask for their password.,
Simply ask to borrow the phone.,
Check her phone while she is sleeping.,
Ask a trusted friend to look at or borrow the other person's phone.",How to Spy on Text Messages2," Many smartphones have passwords and are pin or pass code protected, rendering them otherwise inaccessible. In relationships, suspicions tend to arise when their significant other has a password on their mobile device that you don't know. Simply ask for the password, your reason being: in case you have to use their phone during an emergency or when yours is inaccessible. Dead, no service etc. If they have nothing to hide they will usually gladly and freely offer the information, If not, certainly seek other means of obtaining actual proof, before accusations.


Do not delete any texts, call logs, or other data. Not only will this provide evidence of your spying, but can be considered theft and lead to criminal charges. Try to leave no trace of your spying, this can be difficult but always remember to mark messages you've read as unread and to close tabs that you've opened (that they haven't.)
View and scan the target phone's web history, texts and all calls visually at first. Only visually. If you must take notes for memory, take mental notes only or capture ""screenshots."" Then send the screenshots to yourself, always be sure to delete the screenshots and messages that you sent! (The screenshot method is effective.) Do not create a paper trail by writing anything down, ever! Even if you intend to throw out any notes, you run the risk of being implicated in a privacy violation. Capturing the screenshots and sending them to yourself via text or email is a much safer method of visual note taking and viewing. It also makes it much harder for anyone to track (delete at will), So long as you delete the screenshots and messages that you send!

, Again, If they're up to no good then they more than likely take the time to regularly delete any incriminating evidence i.e. texts, calls or instant messages. Try this trick out: Intentionally leave your phone at home or claim that it is dead or malfunctioning. This gives you the perfect opportunity to ask if you can borrow theirs. Use it to make a call or send a message. This may catch them off guard and unprepared, with evidence still on the phone. They will probably seem antsy and reluctant to give it to you if their is something incriminating on the phone. Do feel free to walk away for some privacy, especially if you are pretending to make a phone call, or you need to use the rest room or even need to check an account balance. Open internet tabs that would interest you and do not close them. This will assert to them that you were using the phone instead of snooping through their stuff. Be aware that if you are caught, there may be personal, as well as legal implications.


If they act strange, and seem very nervous, be suspicions. If he/she suddenly says they need to do something first on the phone, ""real quick,"" you watch them, closely. They may be deleting evidence.
If they flat out refuse, that's weird and seems like they definitely have something to hide. Go straight to method 3 in that case. You should never refuse your spouse or significant other your phone. That looks bad, it sounds bad, and it is bad. How could you ever trust that?

, Though any evidence is probably deleted at this point, it never hurts to check, especially when you're deeply troubled. Only resort to this if any of the other options have been unavailable. Be aware that if you are caught, there may be personal as well as legal implications against you. Read on:


If caught, unless you are afraid the other person may become verbally or physically violent, be honest as to why you are searching the texts. People often send texts without thinking, and they can be construed in ways other than their original meaning. You can also play this off as ""checking the time"" or saying that your own phone is dead, or you couldn't sleep and wanted to search the web a bit. Have a fall back plan (open links on the web to something you're interested in; this will make it seem like you were just browsing the internet).If you find something incriminating, always allow the other person to clear--up any misunderstandings. If you still mistrust them, try method 3. If you find incriminating evidence of adultery you should think about contacting a lawyer, if you are married.

, If you know someone you can trust who has easy access to the person’s phone you want to search, ask them to visually search the phone history. It is your responsibility to inform them of all personal or legal risks prior to obtaining their consent. This technique is risky, you are bringing another person in on your spying and run the risk of them telling.

"
"
Know the risks and laws.,
Find more about state and federal laws by going to National Counsel of State Legislatures (NCSL) website and type ""electronic surveillance state laws"" into the search box.,
Tell your partner that you'd like to install an advanced security and monitoring program on their phone (like you did with yours) for extra protection.",How to Spy on Text Messages3," Before proceeding to the mobile spying application section, read over this carefully. Remember to always research federal and state laws on remote cellphone monitoring. Most U.S. states require consent from only one party to record electronic communications and phone calls.,


Consent from both parties to record electronic data is required in 12 states: California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington.
Material stored on cellphones is considered private property and cannot be accessed in most situations without both parties consent.
Another way around this (with prepaid devices you should be able to log into the account via the providers website (or built in application) and change the account name.) All without changing or interrupting service.

, This is not a lie and could easily persuade them to let you install the program. You may now proceed to the ideal mobile monitoring method.

"
"
Download a mobile-spy app (the easiest and most convenient way of monitoring a mobile device).",How to Spy on Text Messages4," These are discrete programs that upload, copy or forward all history from the phone to a secure server that can be accessed by your personal phone/computer. These programs include monitoring of placed and received calls, texts, url's, picture messages; sometimes email services and application data. Some apps also offer tracking options that use geolocation data to send updates on that person's location or if they go outside a designated area.


You can monitor the phones whereabouts by it emitting regular GPS signals at specified intervals, (so long as the target device has GPS location turned on.)Some apps are hidden, however others require them to be downloaded on both parties' phones.
While cellphone spyware programs are legal, you must either obtain permission from the person's phone you wish to monitor, or the phone (and number) must be under your name. You can bypass this by informing them that you'd like to install a security monitoring program on their mobile device, just as you have on yours. They will more than likely consent. You have not lied or done anything illegal (they agree to have the application installed). Furthermore, if the device you wish to monitor is a prepaid device, you can log into the providers website (or access an application on the phone) and add your name on the account or change account names entirely. If you do not feel comfortable doing so, you can pay to have their service refilled a few times using your own credit/debit card. You already have a card associated with the account, so having your name on it shouldn't feel like such a bad thing after you take this step. These programs automatically save all texts, phone calls, and pictures, so even if something has been deleted off the phone it will be saved in a secure server online for you to view at any time.
This type of spyware only works on smart phones, requires the user of the phone has internet access either through their cellular data network or WiFi.
Some are completely free, most offer free trials and sometimes charge a for a monthly subscription."
"
Give them a chance to be truthful with you.,
If you're married, present the printed evidence to your attorney.",How to Spy on Text Messages5," Reiterate all of your concerns, tell them you're giving them an opportunity to come clean. Tell your significant other that you deserve honesty and you are hurting. If they still lie, right to your face then you have a few options. Calmly present the evidence, make sure they know that you know. Then tell them you're done. ""You hurt me, you lied to me and you played me, I'm moving on."" If you followed the tips of how to legally attain the information then you shouldn't have to worry about legal backfire.


You can also choose to not present the evidence and tell them that you know. You can quote directly from the evidence (ensuring that they know, that you know.) Let them know you're done. You deserve happiness.

, You now have proof of adultery. Again, if you followed the tips of how to legally attain the information then you shouldn't have to worry about legal backfire.

Protect your phone from being monitored.,
Look for signs of a spying app.,
Perform a factory reset if you cannot remove the program.,
Make sure your phone is password protected or install a security app.",How to Spy on Text Messages6," If you suspect spyware may have been installed on your phone, there are several things you can do to check and, if necessary, remove spyware or tracking software., These signs might include a battery draining faster than normal, random start or shutdown, higher data use or higher cellphone bills, or receiving 'nonsense' texts that contain numbers and symbols (very rare occurrence)Rest easy because in the Android operating system you will/may receive notifications and warnings that a certain app may be used to spy on you. This will pin point the app, for an easy uninstall

, First back-up all data such as contact numbers, photos, music, and purchased apps top your external SD card or cloud storage.


Reinstalling your phone's operating system (OS) also removes any spyware without deleting apps and data., Although, if a spy program is already installed on your device, a password will do nothing to stop the monitoring.

Select the Messages, Text, or SMS icon on your main menu.,
Select the ""Create New Message"" option.,
Enter a recipient in the address bar.,
Begin typing your message by using the keypad.,
Consider using predictive text.,
Add a space after you are done with a word.,
Add punctuation marks with your 1 key.,
To send your completed message, go to ""Options"" and select ""Send.""",How to Text2," SMS stands for Short Messaging Service. The labelling may be different for different phones. Scroll over to the icon and push your Select or Enter button.
, You should be presented with a blank text on your screen.

, You can either type a phone number into the bar or you can click the first letter of a person in your contact list to scroll through and select.

, Each number on your keypad corresponds to a set of alphabetical letters, which should be labeled on the key. Hitting a number key will type out the first letter that it corresponds with. For example, ""2"" accesses the letters A, B, and C, so hitting the 2 key once will type out an A. To type a B or C, you have to hit the 2 key twice quickly or three times, respectively.

If you want to type ""Hi,"" for example, hit 4 key twice quickly, pause, and then hit the 4 key three times quickly. The pauses take some getting used to, so you might practice typing some before you get the hang of doing it quickly. If you make a mistake, delete the letters you've mistyped and start over.

, T9 is a program written to guess the word you are trying to spell as you type out the letters, so you only have to hit each number key once per letter. On some older model flip phones, this option will be the default and can be confusing to some first-time texters. Once you get the hang of it, though, it can make texting much faster and easier.

To type ""Hi,"" you can just hit the 4 key twice. T9 will process the possible letters (GHI) and guess that you are trying to write ""Hi.""
If you choose to use T9, make sure your phone is set to ""T9 mode."" You should be able to toggle this with the pound or asterisk key on your phone.
Make sure T9 guesses the right word. ""Good,"" ""home,"" and ""gone"" can all be spelled by pressing 4663, so make sure the word that appears is the word you want. On most phones, press the asterisk or pound key to access an alternate word combination.

, This is typically done by pressing the 0 key. You can then begin typing a new word.

Inserting a space also resets T9, so you can initiate a new string of numbers for a new word.

, You may have noticed that 1 does not correspond to any letters, but instead, can be used to access punctuation marks of all sorts.

Hitting the 1 key once will display a period, and hitting it twice quickly will display a comma. Keep hitting 1 in succession until you find the desired punctuation mark.

,

If prompted to specify the phone number that you are sending the message to, either directly enter in the message receiver's number OR access ""Phonebook"" and select the message receiver's number.

Use text lingo and shortcuts sparingly.,
Check your tone.,
try to acknowledge that you've received a text message.,
Prioritize in-person communication over your phone.,
Cut to the chase.",How to Text3," ""LOL"" and ""BRB"" are instant-message stand-bys that have mostly entered into the popular lexicon. But still, overusing short-cuts like leaving out letters and using acronyms to get messages across can make your communication seem immature and difficult to read for some texters. Use full words and complete sentences whenever possible, and try to use at least some punctuation.

, When you're getting the hang of texting, your texts will sometimes sound meaner than you intend. try to include words like ""please"" and ""thank you"" to soften the tone of your messages.


""Come pick me up now"" sounds much more rude as a text, for example, compared to, ""I'm ready to be picked up now. Thanks!""
Never communicate bad news or frustration via text, save it for in-person or phone conversations.

, Increasingly, some people use text messages as a go-to first means of communication. When you're first getting into it, it can be difficult to know how, when, and if to respond. A quick ""Ok"" or ""Thanks"" to let the person know you've read and received the message is often appreciated, or you can also shoot them a quick call if you'd rather.

, Situations in which it would be inappropriate to talk on the phone are often also inappropriate to text. No one wants to sit at dinner with someone who's constantly checking their phone for new text messages.


If you're texting somewhere quiet, like the library or a movie theatre, make sure your phones notification messages are turned off. The marimba jingle that you like so much is just as annoying as a conversation at a dramatic moment in a movie.

, Text messages are most effective for brief missives and short communications of information. Be judicious and save the dramatic pauses and intricate details of a story for when you're with someone in person. Likewise, don't get frustrated if you message someone ""hi"" and they don't want to have an IM-style chat.Try asking a specific question or offering a particular piece of information in a text. Rather than asking ""What's up"" to your friend you're hoping to make plans with, you might type, ""Do you want to get sushi later?"" If you want to have a longer and more personal conversation, call them.

To enter a ""c"", you have to hit the ""1"" key three times., When you are done typing, scroll to the OK or Send button on the screen. Hit select to send your message."

Select the message option.",How to Send Text Messages3," On some phones, there will be a physical button that takes you straight to your contacts. That will be indicated by a label on the main menu that says contacts, near the button that opens it. On some, you'll have to scroll through the menu to find the contacts application. Smartphones will have an app for contacts, or it will be an option in the phone menu.

, Once you've opened your contacts, find the name of the person you'd like to send a message to. You should be able to either search (entering the first letters of the person's name) or scroll to find who you'd like to reach.


On a non-smartphone, you'll hit the ""Okay"" or ""Select"" button.
On a smartphone, you'll generally just tap the person's name to open the contact details.

, Look for something that says ""send message"" or, on a smart phone, a message icon (usually a cartoon-like speech bubble icon). Selecting this option should take you to a window where you can compose your message. Type your message and select send.

Don't send multiple texts without a response.,
Keep your texts brief.,
Avoid tone misinterpretations.,
Sign off if you haven't texted this person before or in a while.,
Double check the text before sending.",How to Send Text Messages4," If you text someone and you don't get a response within a day, it's generally considered okay to send one more text just in case they were meaning to respond but forgot. But don't blow up someone's phone with messages. The point of texting is so that people can get to it in their own time, so just wait it out., Texts are meant to be efficient tools of communication. Phones aren't the easiest things to read on, so don't send someone a novel. Keep your texts brief and to the point., The nature of text-based communication leaves tone much more up to interpretation than speaking. Be wary of this when sending text messages. Don't be afraid to use exclamation points and emoticons like "":)"" to make your tone clearer., Getting a text from someone whos number is not in your phone can be confusing. If you want to avoid potentially getting a text back that says ""Sorry, who is this?"" just put a dash and your name at the end of your text. Something like ""-Your Aunt Marcy"" will do just fine., People in general are forgiving when it comes to typos and grammar mistakes in text messages, but it still can't hurt to look over your text message. Correct any simple mistakes you see. Give it a quick edit or two if you think it could be simplified. Then hit send."

Identify who is texting you.,
Think about the sender.,
Control your emotions.,
Wait before responding.,
Draft your reply.,
Understand that somebody's perception is not reality!,
Stop texting all together.",How to Prevent Yourself from Misinterpreting a Text Message," Take a minute to understand who is sending the message. Don't be too quick to respond.;
, Once you identify the sender, think about the type of relationship you have with this person. Text messages can be very easy to misread. Past experiences with a particular person can change the meaning of the text completely, either positive or negative, and everything in between.

, Whatever the content of the text is, be sure to read it in an assertive way rather than in an emotional way. Remember that once you reply, you cannot take it back. It is all about perception and it is up to the reader to take it as it really is. Having a good or a bad day will determine your outlook on life and everything around you. Don't let your personal emotions determine the meaning of the information. When in doubt, be sure to ask the sender for clarification––this will avoid confusion and an unnecessary argument in the future.

, Take some time to think before replying; in the end, it is better to be late than sorry. Often when we re-read the information after a little while, our perception changes completely and the meaning of the text will do too. More times than not, your reading of it will soften with the passing of the hours and it won't seem such a harsh comment.

, Again, once you reply, you cannot take it back. Be sure to answer with your head and not with your heart, as you may regret any rash comments in the future. Therefore, draft a message so that you can edit as many times as you want.

, Be sure that your replies are short and to the point. That way, there are less chances that the receiver will create a mental movie of you turning into a monster writing crazy offensive things or a martyr crying a river when, in reality, you were at the beach having a great time and wanting to text him/her a joke, a kind comment or to resume a previous conversation.

, If you cannot get it right and misunderstandings are very common between you and your texting buddies, you may want to opt for cancelling your free text messages option on your cell phone plan and save a few bucks. Go for a coffee and discuss the latest news. If you need to discuss something more heated, take a nice walk along the beach or downtown to iron out any kind of misunderstanding. Although technology has become an important part of our lives, it has eaten into many other more constructive modalities of social habits.

Text like you mean it.,
Rely heavily on humor.,
Use your words.",How to Send a Flirty Text Message1," Your genuine interest in another person is the most attractive and meaningful message you could possibly send. Don’t play games by being intentionally vague. Read all of your texts to yourself before sending them. Ask yourself if it’d be a text you’d be happy to receive.


If the person knows you’re interested, and they’ve reciprocated their interest in you as well, you don’t have to say much to get them smiling. Try, “Thinking of you.”
If you’re feeling more direct, go with “Wish you were here.” This is more forward, as it explicitly indicates your desire to be in someone’s company. It also adds an element of intrigue if the recipient doesn’t know what you’re up to, so you’ll get their imagination whirring.Know that we’re all in this together. That includes whomever you’re texting. Just relax and be yourself - be simple, be honest, be true.;
, It’s always best to shoot for a smile, and even better if you can get your crush laughing. Be casual. Don’t overthink it. Remember, we’re talking about texting.


Be a cheeseball. Quote something ridiculously melodramatic or throw a ridiculously cheesy pick up line out there.There’s nothing like a bit of Shakespeare or Thoreau. Emerson once declared, “Thou art to me a delicious torment.” Steal lines like this (and credit them to the appropriate authors for added drama).
There are some officially bad pick-up lines that will almost should never work, and that’s the point – which means they somehow work. Making light of your affection for someone can be a great way to convey interest casually. There are some classics, but you probably already have a go-to in mind.

, Don’t abbreviate everything. It can be misleading, confusing, and may even seem a bit childish. You can get away with “lol” – it’s practically a part of the English language – but don’t send acronyms or abbreviations your recipient might not familiar with it. If you’re interested in them, the least you can do is thumb out complete words. Relatedly, be aware that emoticons should not completely take the place of words.


Cap your emoji-use. There is definitely, definitely such a thing as too many emoticons. Personal preference is a legitimate argument here, but don’t forget to occasionally mention that you’re interested in having a genuine conversation if they would too.Comedy is the only realm in which it is appropriate to overuse emoticons. In particular, feel free to indulge in storytelling with emoticons. If you can wind together a solid, ideally humorous narrative using only tiny 2D images, by all means, emoji-away.
Even emoticons are getting raunchy these days. Hold off on the emoji innuendos until you have an appropriate relationship with someone who might appreciate your smiley face based sultriness.

Turn off text notifications.,
Silence incoming texts completely.,
Try BreakFree.,
Give your phone to a friend.,
Become more active.,
Turn your phone off in class.,
Turn your phone off at work.",How to Resist Texting All the Time1," A simple way to reduce the amount of time you spend texting is to turn off your notification sounds. Since you won't know every time a text comes in, you won't check your phone as frequently., The app Live2Text helps you manage your texting addiction by allowing you to silence incoming texts for a period of time. The app will send callers a message saying you can't be disturbed at the moment.Consider using this type of app while you are in a meeting, when you're at the movies, or when you are driving.

, Assess your addiction by installing BreakFree to monitor the number of texts you send and receive – it may be more than you'd expect. The app will give you a daily “score” to warn you when you are using your phone too much, and lets you set limits on phone usage.

, If you have a friend who understands what you are trying to do, ask them to take care of your phone when you're together. You can ask them to check it in a couple of hours, in case there is an emergency, or just ask them to keep it until you go home.

, Be the kind of person who does exciting things. You won't have time to text so much, and you will have more interesting things to talk about when you do text.


Learn a new skill – take a dance class or guitar lessons.
Plan a trip, and learn a new language to use while you're there.
Take up a new hobby - go skydiving, biking, or hiking.

, Switch your phone off and pay attention in class. You'll be showing that you respect your teacher's time, and your grades will probably improve as well.


Put a key charm with a bell on your phone. You won't be able to check your phone during class without jangling the bell.

, Switch your phone off and take care of business. Limit message-checking to your lunch break and you will probably see an improvement in your work.

Take photos of the fun, unique activities you do.,
Limit the selfies.,
Watch your mouth.,
Don’t be creepy.,
Keep a firm grasp on reality.",How to Send a Flirty Text Message2," This can sometimes include photos of yourself, especially at impressive locations, doing interesting things, or when you have a pre-established understanding regarding photo exchanges. Or take photos of the random things or moments that remind you of your crush. Send these along, with a quick note to provide some context. Again, don’t overthink it, just let your crush know you’re thinking about them.


For example, if you go on a hike and catch the sunset, send your favorite photo along with something like, “Hey! Check it out: another epic battle between the mighty sun and the steadfast horizon. Who’s your money on?”

, Sending photos via text can be an absolute blast, but they should convey something interesting or thoughtful. Don’t pepper all your love interests with unsolicited, non-stop photos of yourself as soon as you get their number. Don’t do it. Just… don’t do it.


If you are the selfie-taking type, that’s great, but make sure the recipient of your selfies actually wants them before you send them. If they don’t, you’re probably just making it seem like you like taking photos of yourself.
One way to tell if someone may be interested in receiving selfies is by examining their social media. If they’re a big fan of selfies themselves, you’ll be able to tell pretty quickly, and you can rest assured they probably feel that selfies are a legitimate way of presenting oneself. They might even be interested in seeing other people’s selfies too. You should still make sure.

, The bravado facilitated by interacting with someone through a screen sometimes gives us the momentary courage to text someone we’ve had a hard time convincing ourselves to talk to. This is great, because it can get the romantic ball rolling. That being said, communicating via text does not give you the liberty to say whatever you want.


If it’s not something you’d say to someone in real life, don’t say it via text.
Maybe it’s easier to ask your crush out on a date via text than in person – there’s nothing wrong with that. If you do go this route, be respectful about it. Understand that they may rather have that type of conversation in person, especially if its someone you see frequently or already know.

, Don’t risk comments that may be misunderstood. You may be intending humor, but texting off-color jokes like, “your bedroom looks good from your backyard” is equally likely to elicit a restraining order as it is a response. Though you may be wondering about your crush’s interest in going straight from texting to the bedroom, there are better ways to gauge someone’s interest in you than making questionable comments.


Hold off on the seduction attempts. If the person you’re texting is at all interested in you, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to tell them how fine they look or how much you’d like to nibble on their ear. Even if you’re just looking for a casual, predominantly physical relationship, you need to determine whether that’s even a possibility before bursting in guns-a-blazing.
It’s poor form – both in terms of mature behavior and in terms of effectiveness in actually seducing someone – to immediately make sexual comments or implications of any type.
Don’t just booty text people. Texting people late at night is fine if you have an established relationship, but if you only tend to text someone later in the evening, they may feel as though you’re only interested in one thing., Sure, it can be fun to stare at your phone imagining what your crush is doing, but knowing that they’re probably just re-reading your texts and that they’ll respond any second now. It’s also supremely exciting when you feel a buzz in your pocket and immediately assume it’s definitely a witty response to your witty text and not just a weather update.


If you become angry because someone has not responded, you need to sit down and do some serious reflection. Do not ever continue sending increasingly angrier text messages. Recognize that no one owes anybody a response to a text message.
Similarly, don’t be discouraged if you don’t get a quick response. Your crush may be busy, or they may simply not feel like dealing with a cell phone for a while. Respect people enough to know that they have life outside of the realm of their pocket computer.

It’s intimate to text in the evening, as you may be the last person your crush interacts with before drifting off to sleep. “Sweet dreams,” is also an old standby, but if you’re feeling more forward, you can always go with “Trying to fall asleep, but I can’t stop thinking about you.”, This is the simplest step of the article: actually go out with the person you’re so hype about texting with. You’re already standing on lava, why not dive into the volcano? After a few rounds of compliments and wisecracks, ask your crush if they’d like to meet up. If nothing else, you’ll have more to text about after a real world interaction.


You’ve got options. There’s the tried and true, “What are you up to tonight/ tomorrow night/ this weekend?” The implied spontaneity of deciding to get together on a whim can make meeting seem more casual, and allows your crush the space to respond casually.
Alternatively, asking “Can you sneak away for coffee?” adds the intrigue of the unexpected, and can get your crush thinking about you for the rest of the day even if they’re unable to meet up.Be explicit. If you invite someone to hangout, specify what you have in mind. At least mention a place, a day, or an activity. You don’t have to plan a whole date in one text, but you should at least accompany an invitation with an idea.Before a date, let your crush know you’re excited. Be explicit. Try, “I’m really looking forward to tonight.”, The date went well? (I knew you could do it.) What did you talk about? Did your crush say something especially interesting, or tilt their head in a way that caught the streetlight just right? If so, mention it.


Say things like… “You looked great tonight,” but also mention more substantial aspects of your affection by saying things like, “I really liked how you described ________.”

, So you’ve spent an evening together. It went exactly how you’d hoped, and you’re hoping for more. You don’t have to immediately start texting about sex positions or genitalia. Go more for reaffirmations of contentment and attraction. Here’s a few examples: “Last night was incredible,” “I’ve been thinking about you all day,” or “It really turned me on when you______.”
Even better: “Can’t wait to see you again,” or “I have a feeling our next date will be even better.”
Describe the sensations you’re feeling. You know they’re into you. You’re into them. It’s time to text about it. Send a series of messages, with each one describing a different sensation you’re feeling, or that they’ve made you feel. Be creative, and reference the time you’ve spent together and specific experiences you’ve shared."

Focus on talking about topics that are positive, fun, and happy in nature.,
Follow up on previous topics you’ve discussed with the other person.,
Start generating a list of potential conversation topics.,
Practice having long conversations with people face to face.",How to Keep a Text Conversation Going," Open-ended questions that require responses other than “yes” and “no” allow the other party to deliver detailed explanations that create opportunities for additional conversation topics. For example, ask a person what they like best about their job, instead of asking whether or not they like their job.;
, Talking about your shared, common interests is a natural way to prolong conversation since you’re both familiar with the topic. For example, if you both enjoy watching basketball, discuss your favorite players, your favorite teams, and upcoming playoffs.

, Small-talk conversations about topics such as the weather or traffic can seem forced and uninteresting, and lead your conversation to a dead end.

, When you’re getting to know someone new, avoid topics normally viewed as controversial, such as religion, politics, and health care. Conversations about these topics can turn negative if you both have opposing views -- leading to disagreement, frustration, and the end of your text conversation.

, Whether you’re feeling excited, frustrated, or stressed out, sometimes sharing what’s on your mind naturally leads to longer conversations. For example, if you’re dealing with a situation you don’t know how to resolve, share your dilemma with the other person to gain their feedback and opinions.

, Conversation threading is where you dissect a sentence into several parts and follow one of those parts to keep the conversation going. For example, if the other party sends a text stating their vacation to Mexico was fun because they went parasailing and ate tacos, start a new conversation about Mexico, parasailing, or tacos, or all of the above.

, This helps keep conversation authentic, meaningful, and easier for both parties to understand. For example, respond to comments with questions and meaningful conversation instead of using acronyms and text jargon such as “LOL.” This also prevents you from appearing dismissive and uninterested in what the other person is saying., This allows you to proofread your texts and verify they make sense so the other party isn’t confused and stops responding to your messages.

, This is one of the more natural ways to keep a text conversation going, since most people enjoy talking about themselves and their own interests. For example, ask the other person about their favorite movie or what they enjoy doing most in their spare time.

, Most people prefer spending their time talking about enjoyable, fun topics, rather than topics that are negative and depressing., This shows you’re an active listener and interested in the other person’s life and well-being. For example, if the other party mentioned buying tickets for a concert last time you spoke, ask them to tell you about their experience at the concert.

, This prolongs conversation by allowing you to change topics quickly when a conversation ends. Next time a conversation reaches a dead end, refer to your list of topics to revive the conversation., This exercise helps you learn and become more comfortable with prolonging conversation in general so you can struggle less via text message.

Consider who you're texting.,
Figure out what you want to say.,
Write a purposeful and clear message.",How to Make Someone Text You Back1," Depending on what your relationship with this person is, there are going to be different boundaries based on social hierarchy, family ties, gender and cultural norms, etc. Are you close with this person, or are they relatively new to your life? Determine the nature of your relationship with them and you already have the foundation of healthy communication.


Amongst close friends and family there is often more space for being vulgar and less consequences for being awkward. However if we're texting potential lovers, coworkers, business partners, or anyone with whom we have a formal relationship, different rules of appropriateness apply. Keep this in mind when phrasing your text.;
, Starting strong, and composing a meaningful message can help you avoid this problem in the first place. Many people lead busy lives and choose not to respond to texts that are vague or do not have an obvious purpose or appeal. And so a lot of us are more likely to respond to messages that have a clear purpose. Ask yourself these questions:


What do I want to communicate?
Is there a purpose to what I'm saying?
How do I think they will receive my message?

, You've given a sincere effort at understanding who you're talking to, what you want to say, and how you want to/should say it. So now you know at least that whether or not they respond has less to do with your actual text, than their situation, or the nature of your relationship.

Move on.",How to Make a Guy That Is Mad at You Like You Again Through Text," He may not be talking to you or hanging out because he’s either angry about something you did or he’s made new friends and is busy with other things.


If he’s changed how he acts around you because he’s no longer interested in being friends (or partners or whatever), there’s not much you can do to change that. In those situations, it has to do with him, not with you.
If you think he may be angry, think about why. People get angry when they feel like you did something that had a negative impact on them. So the first step on the road to reconciliation is figuring out what you did to trigger him.
Remember that sometimes what seem like minor actions or decisions to us can have big impacts on others, so think not only about what you’ve done recently but about which of your actions might have had negative effects on him.
Once you have an idea of what you did that upset him, you can start working on de-escalating the situation.;
, Key to getting someone past their anger or upset is showing them you understand their perspective and recognize how what you did affected them.


Put yourself in his position and imagine how whatever you suspect upset him must have made him feel. Empathize with those emotions and approach him with that empathy in mind.
For example, to you, you were just late picking him up because traffic was crazy and you realized you forgot your phone halfway there. It wasn’t a big deal, it just happened that way. But to him, he had to stand out on the curb for 45 minutes when it was dark and cold, even though he told you what time to be there three times, and you promised you would be.

, Once you have a sense of what may have upset him, make a genuine effort to empathize with how he may be feeling.


If you were late picking him up, in addition to thinking about how it might have appeared from his perspective, imagine what it may have felt like. For example, to him, it may feel like you didn’t make him a priority, you didn’t care about his discomfort or whether he had other things to do, and you broke a promise. Think about how you would feel about those things and empathize with him.

, Apologize early and often; admit that you were wrong (if you were) and take responsibility.Tell him that you were wrong and that you won’t do it (whatever it was) again. And then don’t do that thing again.
Don’t use the sorry-not-really-sorry line of “I’m sorry you got so upset.” It shifts the responsibility onto him and makes it sound as if you’re not sorry for your actions, you just wish he wouldn’t get mad about it.
If he responds with a--potentially justified--angry text, apologize again. Continue apologizing if he comes at you with more angry responses. Simply say something like, “I’m sorry--I was wrong.”, Just apologizing or trying to explain that your intentions were good won’t work.


Saying you’re sorry isn’t enough--you need to show you recognize the negative consequences your actions had on him and that you sincerely regret it.If he feels like you genuinely understand why your actions made him mad, he’s more likely to feel validated and begin forgiving you.
Even if you don’t necessarily think his feelings or reaction is justified, apologize anyway. If you want him to like you again, you want him to see you understand how he’s feeling., Even if you say you’re sorry, it won’t be enough to make him like you again if you then start saying things that will escalate the situation.Don’t, for example, say anything about thinking his reactions were irrational or unjustified. It will make him feel like you aren’t really sorry and don’t really understand the situation--and he’ll go back to being mad.Don’t bring up things he’s done to upset you in the past. Turning the conversation into a tit-for-tat about who did what to who isn’t going to diffuse the situation. It will only make it drag on longer and make him less likely to forgive you., Asking for his input on what you can do shows that you’re listening to him and genuinely want to know what would make things better from his perspective.For example, you might say something like, “I know you had to wait 45 minutes for me and that it probably felt like I wasn’t making you a priority. How can I make it up to you in the future?”

, Humor is disarming. If you can make him laugh, or even smile a bit, you can get your foot in the metaphorical door.


Try being humorously self-deprecating. If humor is disarming, affable self-deprecation is doubly so. So try poking a little fun at yourself or acknowledging one of your endearing flaws.
You might text him something purposefully ridiculous, like, “I’m really sorry I was late picking you up--we both know I’m a klutz, and I must have walked into at least five walls trying to get here.”
Or you could text something more honest but still gently self-deprecating, like, “You know how I look at the time on the clock as a challenge instead of a warning? Well...the clock won.”

, Particularly if the guy’s mad because he feels like you ignored him or his needs in some way, remind him that you do think about him--often.


For example, you might text him with an affectionate reference to something you saw that reminded you of him (bonus if it relates to a private joke between you), like, “I just saw a car with a Florida license plate and it reminded me of all the stories you tell about growing up there. It made me smile.”

, Don’t text him excessively. Apologize, and if he doesn’t immediately respond or forgive you, back off.


If you keep texting him, you’re going to undo any potential good you’ve done by irritating him rather than charming him.
If he needs time to get over it, give him that time. Let him come to you when he’s ready.

, If he won’t tell you what’s upsetting him, it’s either because he’s so mad he can’t talk about it or it’s a ploy for attention. In either case, you need to let the issue rest and let him come to you.


If he seems truly angry but can’t or won’t tell you why, he probably needs time to process and let the worst of the anger pass. Even if you don’t know what you did and it’s driving you crazy not to know, let it be. Don’t insist that he tell you; let him take the time he needs. When he’s ready, he’ll come to you and you can work things out from there.
If his anger doesn’t seem entirely genuine, he’s probably acting angry to get attention, and the more you ask what’s wrong and what happened, the more he’ll prolong the situation to get as much out of it as he can. Just tell him you don’t know what’s angering him and that you’re sorry if it’s something you’ve done. Then leave it at that and let him come to you when he’s done trying to manipulate your attention.

, If he’s so mad about something that none of your attempts to empathize or apologize are working, step out of the situation.


There’s nothing else you can do or say at this point to make him like you again, so it’s best just to back off.
After some time has passed, he may be feeling less upset and may come to you when he’s ready to talk. You can’t force him to talk to you before he’s ready, so your best option is to wait.

, If he’s constantly getting angry with you over things you either don’t understand or feel are unreasonable, consider whether the relationship is really worth it.


If being around him causes you more grief than pleasure, maybe it’s time to just let the relationship go.
If he verbally, emotionally, or physically abuses you when he’s mad, get out of the relationship immediately.

, If all else fails and the guy probably isn’t going to give in no matter what you do, you might as well have a little fun.“Makeup apps” allow you to choose the gender of the person you’re trying to make up with and which excuse you want to use to win them back.Obviously, if your sincere efforts were unsuccessful, an app probably isn’t going to do any better, but if you’ve got nothing left to lose, you might as well. Worst case scenario, you’ll be entertained by the messages the app sends on your behalf saying you were kidnapped by Russians.Try coming up with clever responses to his non-responses. If he won’t text you back and you know he’s probably never going to, you might as well go out on a high note. Be hyperbolic (“I spent so long waiting for you to text back that feral cats ate my face and hands and now I’m texting you with my toes and will soon be dead.”) or incorporate some spot-on memes or gifs into your final sign-off., Don’t dwell on the situation or stay up nights thinking about what you should have said or what a jerk he is.


Accept that he’s upset and that the relationship might have to end. Start to go on with your life.

Use an entertaining photo or GIF.",How to Make Someone Text You Back2," When someone texts you ""Hey,"" or even ""What's up?"" it might not seem important enough to break your focus and merit a response. But being clear about what you want to know from someone can make it more likely you get a reply. , If you're sending time-sensitive or emergency information to someone, using ALL CAPS and using the word URGENT (or even marking it as urgent using your phone's software) is a useful technique. People are more likely to respond once they understand it is a serious matter.

, Maybe ""hey, what's up?"" and ""yo, what are you up to?"" aren't cutting it. Try engaging them about their passions, work life, school work, an artist/show/type of music you know they enjoy. People are often more eager to talk if it's centered on something they already care about.

, These days texting has merged with the likes of Tumblr, Vine, and Instagram.Incorporating a hilarious cat meme, or celebratory GIF from RuPaul's Drag Race can make someone smile and warm them up to conversation.


If you find yourself at a loss for words with what you want to express, using photos, GIFs, and other media also allows you to get your message across in a different way.

Ask directly why they didn't text you back.,
Watch your body language and tone.,
Work out the issue at hand.,
Have a laugh.",How to Make Someone Text You Back3," There may be a legitimate reason why they didn't respond. Casually bringing it up gives them a chance to explain.

, At first, give the person the benefit of the doubt, and ask in lighthearted ways:


So you've been too busy with your cat grooming business to text me lately, huh?
What's up with your response time? It's like texting with a dial up computer.

, If the person is being evasive or not giving a legitimate answer, you may need to be more direct. Know that this can make people feel uncomfortable and create tension in relationships. So gauge how close you and this person are, how serious your communication usually is, and whether it would be appropriate to be direct. If this is a real frustration for you, then bringing it up directly creates an opportunity for understanding you wouldn't otherwise have.Ask more directly:


Why don't you respond to my text messages?
Why does it take you so long to respond to my text messages?

, When dealing with conflict it's important to approach things with an attitude that it can get better. So expressing understanding through your posture, voice, and choice of words are important.Equally important is understanding other people's style of communication. For instance, a professor may say, ""I have no clue what you are referring to,"" while a surfer would say, ""No clue, dude."" Being able to appreciate the meaning and not just the register will help you to better understand others.
Sometimes we can run into criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and other emotions that block real communication. When you become aware of yourself doing this, take a deep breath and try to relax and open to understanding.

, Limited to electronic devices, we tend to think of texting as separate from other forms of communication. Ultimately though, it's still two or more humans sharing thoughts, feelings, actions, and intentions. And so when there is a problem in communication between you and someone else, it follows that texting will be difficult in its own way.


Listen to the other persons perspective and try to see why they feel how they do. It's possible they have a legitimate frustration and you could benefit from changing your behavior. Possibly they are actually focused on something they did and doesn't respond because of that. Either way, airing the circumstances will guide you back toward healthy communication.
If there are apologies that need to be made on either side, be kind and say or listen to what needs to be said.

, After all it is only texting, so on another hand, there's no need to take it too seriously.

Think about your relationship with this person.,
Consider other people's lives.,
Know that texting decreases privacy and social boundaries.,
Consider technical issues.,
Consider who the person is.,
Consider their skill level with technology.,
Be patient.",How to Make Someone Text You Back4," Do they maybe have a crush on you, and vice versa? Depending on the romantic intentions either of you has, they may hesitate to text back immediately. This way they avoid seeming over eager.

, They may be working, in the middle of a conversation, still sleeping, or even at a movie. Many people choose to leave their phones at home or keep them out of sight as a way to disconnect from electronics. When you start to use your imagination, many reasons appear for why people don't text back. Oftentimes we take it personally that other people don't respond to us when it's just a matter of circumstance.

, Texting someone in the middle of the night, or while they are on vacation will likely not get a response. It's important that people have the right to choose how accessible they are. Although it can be frustrating and often we can be impatient with text messaging specifically, it's important to simply acknowledge that people do not owe us an immediate response.

, Since most of us are using phones and laptops with rechargeable batteries, it's always possible that the battery is just dead. Or that someone dropped their phone in a liquid or cracked the screen beyond use. Or, if you're asking someone you don't know well to text you, like someone who has something for sale, remember not everyone has a cell phone and that some people only keep one for emergencies.

, Depending on the nature of your relationship to this person, their could be any number of social reasons you haven't gotten a response. If it's a potential lover, maybe they're nervous, or maybe they're not interested. If it's your friend, maybe they are focused on their creative endeavors and figure you'll understand. If it's family, maybe they're angry at you for something undiscussed and just don't want to talk to you.

, If you're texting an older person, it's common they are unschooled in the ways of smart phones and texting. Maybe they need help getting comfortable with the medium before they can meet your response expectations.


One way to get people texting that are unfamiliar, is to include them in group texts with other people who are more comfortable and respond regularly. For example you could have a group chat with your parents and siblings, so they can learn by example how most people text.

, Oftentimes if we let go of focusing on whether someone is responding to us or not, we end up doing something more purposeful. And then sooner or later you get the text back you were waiting on.

See if the person removes personal pronouns.",How to Know if Someone Is Lying in a Text," One study found that people take 10 percent more time to respond to a question over text if they are lying. This is natural, of course—they need more time to come up with a believable answer. This can be especially obvious if you’ve been having a rapid back-and-forth conversation and suddenly it’s taking forever for the person to respond.If you have the iPhone and can see the ellipses (“...”) at the other end of the text exchange, indicating that it’s taking your texting partner forever to craft the perfect response, then this can be a red flag.
Just remember that, just because it takes a person a longer time to respond, it doesn’t guarantee that the person is lying. If the person really likes you, it can just take him longer to respond because he wants to sound impressive. Of course, it’s also possible—though less likely—that the person got held up just when you asked an important question.;
, If you asked a fairly simple question, such as, “What did you do last night?” and the person sends you back three paragraphs of text, then it may be to compensate for the fact that he’s not telling the truth. Some people think that, the more detailed their response is, the more convincing it is, but this can actually be quite the opposite, especially if the person normally doesn’t send you long, descriptive texts.


If the person is describing every little detail of his or her night when all you wanted was a simple answer, then it may be to convince you that whatever story he made up really did happen.
If the person is really a novice at lying, then they may even backtrack to correct themselves in the middle of the text exchange.

, If the person tries to change the subject, then this is another red flag that he or she is lying. This would also be true for the situation in person; if the guy or girl you’re talking to isn’t telling the truth, then it’s only natural that he or she wouldn’t want to linger over the topic. If the person gives you a quick answer and then asks a more complicated question, this can be a great way to create a diversion away from the fact that he or she is lying.


He can say something like this: “I ended up staying out late with John. How about you? How was your night?”

, Well, this is another dead giveaway. If the person you’re talking to pulls this one, then chances are he’s probably not a master liar. If you’ve been having a great conversation and then suddenly think you’ve caught him in a lie, and then the next thing you know, he has to suddenly get going, then yeah, this is probably a not-so-subtle way of not wanting to deal with the consequences of the lie.


This will be especially suspicious if the person leaves with no explanation, and if you didn’t think he had any plans during that time.

, If the person you’re talking to tries to suck up to you or sweet talk you after he’s told the lie, then chances are that something fishy is up. If he normally doesn’t tell you how much he misses you or how beautiful you are and you’re suddenly hearing this kind of thing after he gives you a dodgy answer to one of your questions, then it’s likely that this is just his way of trying to cover up the lie.


Of course, if the person is normally sweet to you, then it may not mean anything out of the ordinary. But if he suddenly tells you all of the sweet things you’ve always wanted to hear, then something may be up.
If the person who is lying doesn’t have a romantic relationship with you, then he or she may still jump to give you a quick compliment or some positive reinforcement to take your mind off the lie.

, Though emphatic language doesn’t mean that the person is lying, if the person isn’t usually too emotional or emphatic in his texts and all of a sudden he is very emphatic, then it may be because he is really desperate for you to believe him because he’s lying. This is as true for lying girlfriends as it is for mail order bride scams.If your girlfriend says something like, “I really, really missed you last night. Though I was out with the girls, I really wish you could have been there,” then she might be trying a bit too hard because she’s not telling the truth.

, Though there’s no way to know if someone is lying 100% unless you find proof or ask and get the truth, you can certainly listen to what your heart and gut are telling you. If you just sense that something is up and know that you’re not getting all of the right answers, then chances are that the person you care about is lying to you. If it’s a big deal and you feel betrayed, then the only way to clear the air is to ask and get the truth.


Unfortunately, one study shows that people can only tell if others are lying 54% of the time, which makes the chances that you can tell if someone is lying to you not much better than a coin flip. Still, your instincts should be leading you in the right direction, especially if the person in question is a repeat offender., If the person keeps qualifying his answers, then this may be another sign that he’s lying and really, really wants you to believe him. These little comments can go a long way in showing that he doesn’t trust that his answer alone is going to convince you and that he feels he has to make an extra effort. Here are some choice phrases to look out for when you’re trying to spot a liar:


“To be honest…”
“What I really mean…”
“I don’t want you to get the wrong idea, but…”
“Actually, it was really more like…”

, Another way to spot a liar is to see if the person refuses to really pin down his or her story and keeps giving you vague answers that could get him off the hook more easily. If the person isn’t confident about what happened last night or in whatever answer he is giving you, then it’s likely that this is because he’s not telling the whole truth. Here are some phrases to watch out for:“It must have been around midnight when…”
“Maybe it was because…”
“I probably got home around two.”
“I’m not sure if…”
“It seemed kind of like…”

, You know what it’s like to text with this person. If he’s normally a guy who is pretty casual with his texts, or if you’re talking to a girl who writes perfect, error free text messages, and suddenly you feel like the text is almost coming from a different person, then the person may be lying. The person may not sound like himself because he’s too busy trying to craft the perfect answer; what’s worse, this may even be the case because he’s with someone who is telling him what to say.


Scroll through your past texts with this person. Does it sound like the same person is texting you, or like their phone has been abducted by aliens? Even if you can’t pinpoint why, if the text just feels different for some reason, then you’ll know.

, Tense hopping, or jumping between the past and present tense, is another sign that the person is lying to you. If a person does this, then it means they may be lying because they're so busy crafting a story in his head that he forgets that it happened in the past tense, not the present. If the person you’re talking to normally doesn’t tense hop and suddenly his tenses are all over the place after you think you may have caught him in a lie, then this can be a red flag.Look out for when someone speaks like this: “Last night, I went out with the boys for a few drinks. But I only had a few beers. Then I’m going home before midnight…”
People can tense hop when they’re lying because once they start fabricating the story in their heads, it may naturally switch to the present tense.

, If the person gives you too much insignificant detail and he normally doesn’t chat so much over text, then this may be because he’s trying to cover his tracks by making his story seem really believable. If he tells you what music was playing at the club when all you wanted to know was who he was there with, then it may be a sign that he’s lying.


If they say something like, “I was out late at the diner with Jim. He was talking on and on about The Raiders. We had the best cheese fries, though,” when they normally never give details like this, then this may be a sign that he’s lying.

, If the person you’re texting normally doesn’t try to have perfectly crafted, grammatically correct sentences, and all of a sudden the response you get from him could have come out of your English textbook, then this is a sign that he’s trying too hard to seem like he’s telling the truth. Of course, if the person usually talks like this, then it doesn’t mean anything.


If the person usually uses lots of abbreviations, doesn’t always use punctuation or capitalized letters, or just generally is a sloppy texter, then he may be lying if he suddenly sends you four perfect, grammatically sound sentences.

, Another sign that the person is lying is if he or she removes all personal pronouns when he explains what happened or gives you an answer. This is a way of taking away accountability and making it seem as if the situation just “happened” to that person, as if there wasn’t anyone to blame. In general, using the passive voice out of the blue can indicate that something is up.If a person is telling the truth, he’s more likely to say, “I was out late with the boys. Eventually we called a taxi to get home. I didn’t even realize it was so late.”
If he’s lying, he can say the same thing without using the first-person pronoun: “The whole group was out. A cab came for us eventually. The night just flew by…”

Appeal to her interests.,
Compliment her.,
Let her know you think about her.,
Ask a question.",How to Reply to One Word Texts from Girls1," Have the last few things you've written her been boring or commonplace? If you are not saying anything interesting, she won't want to reply back to you. Try to liven up your texts with a topic she is interested in or something that you know she would like to talk about. This way, she might be more willing to respond and hold a longer discussion with you over text.;
, A good way to get her to respond is by letting her know you are thinking about her. Text her things like: ""I really liked that outfit you wore yesterday."" or ""You kicked butt when we all went bowling last week."" These things make her pay attention to the conversation, feel special, and know you like her., Bring up something that reminds you of her. Text her something like: ""There is this flower outside that is the same colour as your eyes. It makes me think about you when I see it."" It lets her know that you think about her outside of the current conversation. It will also likely bring her back into the conversation with you.


Make sure you don't say anything inappropriate at this stage. Match what you say with how close of a relationship you have. If you just met her, you will not say the same things to her as you would if you've known her for a long time., If you are trying to get a longer response from her, ask her a question that has more than a one word answer. You can even turn it into something flirty. Ask her something like: ""What is your idea of a perfect date, and why?"" This puts the idea of romance in her head and requires a longer response. It also has the added benefit of helping you get to know her a little better."

Wait a long time before responding to text messages.,
Reply with short answers.,
Block texts or activate an auto-reply message.",How to Pretend You're Angry Over Text1," After receiving a text from someone that you dislike or want to trick, wait a while before replying. Unreturned text messages can be frustrating and irritating, and not responding right away can make you seem uninterested, cold and rude.The silent treatment is a passive aggressive expression of rage, and it can have quite an impact in communicating anger., Short sentences can sound abrupt or harsh in a text message, creating a negative tone for the exchange.Texting is already a form of communication with very little intimacy, so using this medium to communicate in a curt manner is especially dismissive.Use simple ""yes"" or ""no"" answers, or terse responses such as ""okay"" or ""fine"", to convey your disinterest in prolonging conversation. For example:


""No thanks.""
""That's okay.""
""Yes, I am.
""That's fine.""

, Blocking someone's texts demonstrates anger through an unwillingness to communicate. Alternatively, you can activate an auto-response to texts that an individual will receive whenever they text message you. To give the impression that you're angry, customize a message that suggests that you are avoiding the text; do not indicate any intention to respond later, as most auto-reply texts generally do.


Example- ""I am not responding to texts.""

Write out numbers that use only one or two words.,
Use numbers when referring to measurements.,
Stick to either numbers or numerals in the same sentence.,
Punctuate your numbers correctly.",How to Include Numbers in a Text1," For example, you would write out words like “five” or “fifty”, rather than using numerals.;
, When a number is a part of a measurement, such as “inches” or “years,” always use the number instead. For example:


“50 feet (15.2 m)” or “121 centiliters.”

, When a sentence would require you to use both numbers and words for numbers that are related, choose one or the other.


For instance, in the phrase “5 out of 2,400 agree” use numbers or words, don’t mix them.

, Use commas in large numbers. A comma goes every three digits to the left from the decimal point. When dealing with money, use numbers rather than numerals. If you are writing down a percent, or a date or address, you should also use numbers.


Use commas for large numbers, like 100,000,000.
Use numbers for money, such as “$4.50.”
Use numbers with percentages, like “73%”
For dates and addresses, use numbers like September 20, 2014, or 2489 29th Avenue.

Tease her.,
Make up ridiculous stories.,
Exaggerate your responses.,
Make fun of yourself.,
Make up answers for her.",How to Reply to One Word Texts from Girls2," Since she is only sending you one word text messages, try turning it into something funny. Say something like: ""A cat has your tongue, huh? I hope you're not allergic :)"" It makes her one word response funny instead of weird or uncomfortable. It also shows her your playful side.You can also say something like: ""You must be on some important spy business today. Tell James Bond I said hi :)""
Make sure you are appropriate with your teasing. You don't want to offend her or make her feel uncomfortable. Try to feel out her boundaries to know what kind of teasing is best for her.

, If you want her to respond to your texts, you need to hook her in with something interesting and funny. Start off with something like: ""Something so weird just happened to me."" When she responds, make up something ridiculous like: ""A zombie just ran into my room. But I took care of it. Good thing I know about apocalyptic survival.""


The more ridiculous you make your story, the more likely she will be to respond.
Make sure you don't take it too far. You want to make her laugh, not make her uncomfortable., Whenever she answers, exaggerate your responses to her one word replies. For example, you ask her how her day was and she replies ""Okay."" You can respond with something like: ""Woah, calm down there. You don't need to be so enthusiastic :)"" The added emoticon helps her know that you are saying it in jest and aren't mad at her reply. It will also hopefully make her want to respond with more detail in the future., Since she isn't responding to you, lay the blame on yourself for the lull in conversations. Make fun of your conversational skills with quips like: ""Wow, I must really be off my game today. I'm not usually this boring :)"" The added emoticon lets her know that you are not mad at her and are poking fun at yourself.


Don't be self deprecating. You want your quips to be funny, not make her uncomfortable or make you look sullen and unhappy., If she isn't being super responsive, you can make up playful answers for her to get her interested in the conversation and let her know how funny you are. When you ask her a question, make up a playful answer for her. Tell her something like: ""What are you doing this weekend? Let me guess, you're going to take your dog on a rocket ride to the moon. That's so sweet of you :)"" This playful banter can help bring her back into the conversation, even if it is to tell you how silly you are.Make sure whatever you say is appropriate. You don't want to take your scenarios over the top.

Send unhappy or angry faced emojis.,
Text in capital letters.,
End your sentences with periods.",How to Pretend You're Angry Over Text2," If subtlety fails, you can use emojis to convey anger via text. Emoticons and emojis make the expression of emotions more concise and accessible, and reduce the ambiguity of a message’s meaning.The vast number of emojis available can make pretending to be angry over text a creative endeavor!

, Typing in capital letters has come to signify yelling, making it an ideal way to sound angry in a text message.It is a visually intense and attention-grabbing way of letting someone know how you feel, and a good strategy for conveying rage. To sound angry, try writing neutral statements all in caps.


Example- ""Don't worry about it!"" vs. ""DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT!""

, Ending a sentence with a period while texting is often perceived as less sincere than using no punctuation at all.The finality of using a period is considered overly formal, angry and unenthusiastic within the context of a text message, where casual writing is normally preferred.Along these lines, opt to use periods over other punctuation to make otherwise friendly phrases sound angry (e.g. “Have a good night!” vs. “Have a good night.”)

"
"
Use aggressive language.,
Be creative with your choice of vocabulary.,
Use a hyperbole.",How to Pretend You're Angry Over Text3," The most straightforward way to pretend that you're angry over text is to use mean or aggressive language to get the point across. Whether you insult the person, criticize them, or clearly state that you are angry, being hostile is the most unmistakable way to express anger. Use one of the following phrases to sound like you're mad:


""Shut up!""""You'll be sorry!""""Get lost!"", Emotions are shaped by culture and environment, and vocabulary can leave an impression by expressing very specific emotional experiences.Along these lines, you can express anger in an impactful way by choosing creative and unique phrasing to describe it. Instead of simply texting, ""I'm angry at you"", employ more intense language like:


""I am absolutely irate with you""
""I'm disgusted and dismayed by you""
""I am furiously disappointed in you""

, Hyperbole is a literary device wherein the words or phrasing exaggerate a point by conveying something that is too over the top to be plausible.This is an excellent way to make a strong point and a very easy way to pretend to be angry. Try phrases like:


""I'm so angry I could explode!""
""I have never felt this mad in my entire life!""

Write out numbers up to one-hundred.,
Write out numbers at the beginning of a sentence.,
Spell out units and percents.,
Try to either use numbers or numerals consistently in a sentence.",How to Include Numbers in a Text2," This includes the number one-hundred. For instance, you’d write, “seventy-eight” or “sixty-two.” The same rule applies for ordinal numbers.


Alternatively, write out numbers up to nine; after nine, use words. Chicago has this rule as an alternative—you can choose which rule you would like to follow.

, If you are starting your sentence with a number, write it out, regardless of whether or not it is more than one-hundred.


For example, you could write “One-hundred ninety-two people ate pie.”

, Use numbers for percent, but spell out “percent”. Spell out the unit of measurement; only use numerals with measurements when it is frequent in a paper. For example:


“25 percent.”
“34 feet (10.4 m)” or “seventy-five meters.”

, Make your sentences consistent when numbers are mixed. For example:


“The case held 25 pies, 36 cakes, 250 candy bars, and 300 sodas.”

"
"
Spell out numbers one through nine.,
Use numbers when writing out a unity of measure.,
Write out numerals at the beginning of a sentence.,
Keep in mind other considerations.",How to Include Numbers in a Text3," If you are writing an essay in APA style, you must remember to spell out all numbers under ten. When you reach ten, begin using numbers rather than numerals. For example, you would write:


“One” or “five”, but you would use numbers for 10 and above.

, You should also use numbers when you are writing down a percent, though you can use the ‘%’ sign, rather than writing out percent. For example:


”22 inches (55.9 cm)”.
”72%”.

, If you must begin a sentence with a number, write the number out. However, if possible, try to avoid beginning a sentence with a number. For example:


“Twenty-two tomatoes need to be purchased” could be written as “We need to purchase 22 tomatoes”.

, If you are writing a date, address, or a sentence about money, use numbers rather than numerals. If you are writing out common fractions, use words to write out the fraction. For example:


September 20, 2014.
2489 29th Avenue.
“I paid $4.07.”
Two-thirds, or three-fourths.

Don't annoy her.,
Make it quick.,
Respond at your own leisure.,
End the conversation yourself.,
Stay in control.,
Give yourself some tough love.",How to Get a Girl to Text You Back," If you're interested in hanging out with her as a friend, there is less pressure to say just the right thing than if you want her to become romantically interested in you. Once you figure out what you want, you can proceed to text her accordingly.


Note: Most of these steps assume that you are looking for a romantic connection with a girl.;
, After you get a girl’s number it is best not to contact them right away in order to not appear needy or annoying. After you’ve waited however long you think is necessary (2 or 3 days tops), send a quick text message that let's her know you're thinking of her. It’s best to keep the first text short and sweet, flirty, funny, mysterious, or any combination of those.


A common text most guys send would be “Hey. It’s John from the coffee shop, remember me?” This is a mistake. Just assume they remember you and they are anxiously awaiting your text. Asking if they remember you should only be in a flirty manner (i.e. you’re teasing her because she'd had a couple of drinks when you met her at a party).

, Try to stick with the vibe you created when you first got her number. If you flirted with her by giving her a silly nickname like “shorty” or “dork,” include the nickname to subtly remind her about your chemistry in person.

, See if she responds. Most likely she will say ""Who's this?"" Tell her. If she doesn't respond, then just leave her alone for a few days, and try again. If she doesn't text you back, she's not interested. If she does respond, ask her about her friends, family, and interests. Then you can see where it goes from there., A better approach is the simplest message ever: “Hey you.” Most likely the girl will not have gotten your number so she will wonder who’s talking to her; this means she'll be likely to respond.


Likely response #1. If she responds “Hey, who’s this?” you can have fun with her by making her guess or tease her for giving her number out to so many guys that she doesn’t know who’s talking to her.
Likely response #2. If she responds: “Oh hey, is this John from the coffee shop?” Just respond “Hope you weren’t just waiting around with your phone in your hand all week to hear from me ;)” This is a bit cocky, pretty funny, and starts the flirting right away. Now it may not be manly to add smiley faces in messages, but it’s hard to tell if someone’s joking in text, especially if they don’t know you.

Optional response. Another response you might want to throw in is: “So is this the cute blonde girl (or the brunette) I met on Wednesday?” or some variation. They will probably be a little shocked by your fortitude, but they will laugh.



, It’s a good idea to have three to four text conversations over the period of a few days to a week before you call her or make a plan for a date. By this time, you will have flirted with her, made her laugh, and there is already enough attraction built up in her mind that screwing up a phone call or a first date will actually be hard for you to do., If she doesn't respond to your texts, it is important to handle the situation appropriately. There are different levels of texting and it's important to remember the proper etiquette for various situations. Remember that if this is the first time you're texting her, you are still basically a stranger to her. So, if she doesn't respond to you, you need to remember that she doesn't owe you anything and avoid sending her aggressive messages that indicate she owes you a response.

, If this is the first text you've ever sent, wait a couple of days to give her time to respond. If she doesn't respond after two days, she might be having trouble remembering who you are or how she felt about you. Try texting again after two days with something more specific like, ""Hey, Tonya. This is Rob - the charming guy from the coffee shop. Still waiting for that first date :)"" A message like this lets the girl know that this is your second attempt to contact her, but is still cute and playful.


You could also try calling her if she hasn't responded after two days. If she doesn't answer, leave a voice mail message saying something like this, ""Hey, Tonya. It's Rob. I sent you a text, but I wasn't sure if it went through or not. I was just trying to touch base with you and see how you're doing.""If she doesn't call you back or respond in a day or so, you should just leave her alone and move on.

, Remember that sometimes things come up that are more important than texting. Her mom might be in the hospital or her tire might've blown on her car. There are thousands of things that can happen at any given moment that require you to put off texting, no matter how much you might like the person you're talking to.


Text her something concerned like, ""Everything alright?"" That way she knows that you noticed her lack of response, but you also care about her.
If she still doesn't respond, wait a week or so and send a casual text that sends the message that you are a cool guy with a busy schedule too. Say something like, ""Hey, Tonya. I just got back from a weekend in the mountains. Just wanted to check in and see how things are with you. Talk soon.""If she still doesn't respond after a few days, then it's time to move on.

, If this is when it is important to hear back from her, like before you two are supposed to meet for a date, try texting the concerned, ""Everything okay?"" and see if she responds. Wait twenty minutes and text, ""Are we still on for tonight?"" If she doesn't respond, she is probably blowing you off and you should leave her alone. If something happened that made her unable to respond to you, she will send you an explanation.

, How often you text is very important. Getting into a full conversation is very easy, but is something you should avoid during the first few days you’re texting her. You do not want to end up annoying her by making her phone ring/buzz all day from some guy she just met.

, The best way to go about it would be to just have a quick conversation (four to six messages each) and then tell her you’re busy and will talk to her later. Try to actually be busy/doing something interesting. You don’t want to begin the relationship with a lie you'll always have to remember.

, It’s easy to get excited about a message from a hot girl that you’re interested in, but she will catch on to you responding immediately after you get her message. She will assume you like her and are anxiously awaiting all her messages. This ends the chase immediately. So give it some time between messages and don’t annoy her, but be careful not to play mind games. Text communication is beautiful because you have time to carefully craft what you’re going to say, so when it’s your turn to write back, take that time to fully think about it.

, When it’s time to end the conversation, it’s best to just say “I gotta run (or have to go do something interesting if you really are). Talk to you later.” It shows that you’re not clingy if you end the conversation yourself.

, When she responds back and says ""bye,"" just leave it at that (unless she asks a question). If she’s the one that sent the last message, it puts you in control and makes her wonder if you’re going to send another one.

, There are few things less attractive than a guy who is clearly desperate. If the girl you like isn't responding to you after several attempts, then it might be time to cut your losses and move on. Set your sights on someone new and try your luck with this new girl.

Send a greeting text.,

Ask him out to do something specific.,
Use proper grammar and full sentences.,

Occupy yourself while you wait to hear from him.,
Check in with him if you don’t hear from him.",How to Ask a Guy Out over Text," Try breaking the ice before you ask him out. Send him a simple greeting to get the conversation started. If you haven’t talked to him before, remind him who you are and how you met. Say you’ve been excited to talk to him again. If you have talked before, just greet him the same way you would any other time.People can’t always respond to texts right away, so if your first text is you asking him out, you’ll start to freak out if he doesn’t respond quickly. Talking for a while first helps ensure that he is paying attention to his phone.
If you have him talking already, there’s a better chance that he’ll respond positively to you asking him out. If you ask him out without any warning, he might be caught off guard and say no.
For example, text him, “Hey Josh, this is Pete. That party was crazy last weekend. I’m glad we got to meet.” It’s simple, but way more effective than texting, “Hey, what’s up?”;
, Text back and forth with him for a while to see how the conversation goes. If he constantly gives short answers or takes a long time in between, he may not be interested in you. You don’t want to go straight to asking him out without having an idea whether or not he will say yes.Find the balance between asking him out immediately and waiting so long that the conversation dwindles. If he responds well to four or five texts back and forth, take it as a good sign to go ahead and ask him.
Even if he doesn’t seem that interested, it’s okay to be bold and ask him out anyway. Just be prepared for a possible rejection.

, As you are texting, begin to send messages that are a bit flirtier than standard conversation. If he responds by flirting back, it’s a good sign that he may be interested in going out. If he seems to ignore your flirting or responds negatively, avoid asking him out.For example, text him, “It’s a bummer that I’m sitting at home alone. I’d much rather be snuggled up next to you.” If he says, “We could make that happen,” he probably likes you.

, If your conversation is going well and he responds to your flirting, it’s time to move forward with your mission. Don’t get too worried about what he will say. Type out the text, check it over, and send it without hesitating.


Say, “Dylan, I like you. Would you be interested in going on a date with me this weekend?”

, When you like someone, it’s easy to overthink what you are going to say to him. If you type out a long message and ask him out in the middle of it, he may miss your question. Keep the message short and to the point. Send a text that only includes you asking him out.


Don’t ramble by saying, “I’ve been thinking about what I could do this weekend because I’m getting bored being home all the time. Would you want to go out? I know there isn’t that much to do but I thought that we could have fun together. Anyway, I’m not even sure….”
You might want to ask out a guy from school. A teenage guy is more likely to respond to a simple text than to one where you ramble a lot. Text him something like, “Would you want to go out this weekend?”
If you want to ask out a coworker, say, “We never get much time to talk one-on-one at work. Would you want to grab a drink when we clock out tomorrow?”

, You may be tempted to beat around the bush, or mention going out in a vague way that he could miss. When you text him, say that you want to go out with him and ask him if he would be interested in doing that. It’s important that he knows you are asking him out.For example, don’t say, “I haven’t dated much recently and you seem like you haven’t either. Maybe we would be able to do something together. That might be pretty cool.” Say, “Are you interested in going out with me?”
This is especially important when you are asking a guy out who you are already friends with. It’s important to make sure they know you want to go out romantically. Say, “I know we hang out a lot, but would you want to go to Orion’s party with me as my date?”

, When you ask someone out, it’s not all that effective to say, “Do you want to go out sometime?” There is no specific timeline or activity involved. Think of something cool you could do together and ask him to do that. Also offer a couple of times that would work well for you.For example, tell him about a party you are going to over the weekend and ask if he wants to go with you. Ask him if he wants to try the new Italian restaurant near your house on Wednesday.
The possibilities are endless, and he may say no to the thing you suggest. Asking him to do something specific is still better than asking him “out” in general.
This is important when you are asking a guy you just met. Asking to make specific plans will help you find out what they like to do on a date. Say, “I’m a pretty big hockey fan, and I have tickets to the game this weekend. Do you want to be my date?”

, Even with smartphones, it’s common for people to abbreviate words and use hard to understand slang. When you ask a guy out, make sure to write complete sentences that make sense. It’s a turnoff to see something that looks like confusing gibberish.For example, don’t text, “Ay, thot we could hang tmrw. Watcha gonna b doin?” Write, “I was thinking we could go out tomorrow. Would you be available?”
Double check your text before you hit send to make sure you didn’t accidentally misspell something. Auto-correct can make a message confusing if you don’t check over it before you send it.

, Texting is not always on a strict time table, which can be good and bad. After you ask him out, wait for him to text you back. If you start to send another text apologizing or asking him if he is thinking, don’t send that text. Be patient and give him time to think and send you a response.


If you’ve been talking for a while and he doesn’t respond right away, it may be his way of saying no, but don’t assume this immediately.

, If he doesn’t respond right away to you asking him out, don’t start panicking. Go find something to do while you wait. Staring at your phone or checking it every two minutes will drive you crazy. Set the ringer and find something to occupy your mind.


Go for a run, take a shower, turn on Netflix, pull out a book, or work on a hobby. As long as you find something to keep your mind busy, you’ll be better off.

, Sometimes people don’t respond to texts, or phones mess up and texts don’t get to their destination. If you have waited a while, it’s okay to check to make sure he received your message.


There’s not an exact time when you should text him again. Most of the time if you haven’t heard from him within one day, it’s okay to text him to check in.

Use ""haha's"" generously.,
Make an effort to continue the conversation.,
If the conversation isn't flowing, let it die.",How to Be Polite when Texting," When texting, the other person cannot see or hear your reaction, so things that sound nice when you say them may not read that way. Answering a casual, light-hearted question with ""Yes, haha"" or ""Yeah"" rather than just ""Yes"" will show your text-ee that you are in a good mood. The same goes for smilies. But don't go overboard; one smiley per text is plenty.;
, If a friend texts you something amusing, don't just respond with ""lol."" This leaves your friend with nothing to build the conversation on. Instead, try to follow up the ""lol"" with a question or an observation to keep the conversation flowing.

, In the event of a ""text trap,"" which is where someone keeps texting you and won't stop, do not try to get out of it simply by saying ""haha,"" ""lol,"" or ""yeah."" The person may either not get the hint and continue texting you, or they may feel that you are a rude texter and not wish to associate with you. The best thing to do is to simply stop responding. They will understand. This also works when a friend says something you appreciate, but have no response for. Just let the conversation go.

Take a break from your cellphone and take away its power.Take a day and travel somewhere where a cell phone connection isn’t readily available so texting might be a little hard.,
Get physical.,
Jumpstart a creative project.,
Meet with your friends.,
Put the phone down.,
Do not text while you drive.",How to Avoid Being an Annoying Texter1," It’s a great way to detox from your obsessive texting habits and to begin anew cold turkey.


Go on a local hike on the outskirts of your city, either alone or with a friend. A signal will be spotty so you’ll have time to connect with yourself and prevent yourself from being so attached to your phone and checking who’s contacting you or who hasn’t every five minutes.
For a less dramatic route to a text detoxing, take the power from your cell by turning it off or placing it on airplane mode for 24 hours. This will take you off the map without traveling off the map.;
, There might be times where you find yourself looking at your phone or wanting to send another text to a person who hasn’t sent one back to you yet. Take your mind off it completely by releasing your emotions through exercise that will release the endorphins feeding your text stress.Engage in one of your favorite sports, but take things a step further by playing an active role in the game versus watching it on TV. Play a round of tennis or a game of basketball. Even if you’re a lousy player, you will feel so much better with this distraction.
Take up a kickboxing class, a spin class, or a barre class. Not only will the benefit of endorphins being released still be there, but it will be joined by a sense of confidence for taking up a new skill.

, Take your hands off of your phone and get busy using them to create something. Switch your focus from who is or isn’t texting you and become mentally preoccupied with a Pinterest project that hadn’t seen the light of day.Work on DIY projects around the house to add one of a kind decor pieces to your space.
Take the time to pick up new skills on an instrument you've always been interested in playing.

, Sure, texting is a way to instantly reconnect with others, but it will never replace interacting in real time. Step away from technology and spend a day out with friends.Strengthen relationships with in-person communication while shopping, going out for sushi, going to the movies, or going dancing at a club.
Make it a rule that no one is allowed to use their phones while you’re hanging out. There’s strength in numbers and you’ll find it easier to get your mind off texting if everyone is too busy having a good time.

, Using your phone at all times is not a necessity to life and treating your phone like it is one is the quickest way to annoy the people you’re around. Practice self restraint with when and how you use your phone to text.Texting people while you’re in a social setting like class, a meeting, work, at lunch, or at dinner, is impolite to the company you’re with at the time. Limit reading or responding to text messages to emergency situations or a family member calling.
Texting should be limited in environments where it’d be a nuisance to you or people around you too, i.e. do not text while at the movies.

, Composing, reading, and/or sending a message while you drive should not be an aspect of driving. An alarming number of accidents happen every day because people think they can balance using their cell phones while they drive. It’s a danger to you and anyone on the road.The great thing about a text is that its very nature means that it isn’t an urgent form of communication, so it can wait.
Do not use your cell phone while you’re at a red light or traffic stop either. It takes your focus off of the road and can be annoying to other drivers who have places they want to go.
Utilize blue tooth and hands-off options if interacting with your cell phone is a must while you drive. If you don’t have those things, cut it off completely or put it in a compartment in your car to avoid messing with it while you drive.

Turn your phone off.,
Put your phone on silent.,
Place the phone in a location you cannot reach.,
Send texts before you drive.,
Get someone to text for you.",How to Prevent Texting and Driving1," A good way to prevent texting and driving is to turn your phone off. This helps you not hear any text or social media notifications, or see the screen light up when you get a text. If you don’t see any new messages, you won’t be tempted to look at them or respond.As soon as you stop, you can turn the phone back on. If you are on a long car ride, you can pull off the road every hour or so to check your messages if you need to check them.;
, If you don’t want to turn your phone off completely, turn it to silent. Even on silent you can see when you have a message. Just make sure you put the phone face down so you can’t see it light up with a new message and be tempted.If you want to leave your phone ringer on, you can silence your text message notifications.

, If you want to keep your phone on, you can try to place it in a spot where you cannot reach it while driving. This helps keep your phone unavailable so you cannot be tempted to sneak a peak. Try placing it in the trunk, glove box, behind your seat, or in your console.If you do this, make sure you will not want to reach to these inconvenient places while driving. Trying to grab something out of reach can cause an accident.

, To avoid a situation where you realize you need to send a very important text, take a moment before you start the car to send any texts you need to. If you will not be able to wait to read the reply, send the text after your trip.You should also plug your destination in your GPS and pull up any playlists you want to listen to before you start the car. This is also very distracting while you drive.

, If you are in the car with someone, ask them to read you any texts you receive. You can also ask them to respond to the texts. This allows you to respond while driving without texting yourself.You should only let the person on your phone if you trust them and don’t mind them reading your text conversation.

Keep your abbreviations to a minimum.,
Proofread your text before you hit “send”.,
Have something to say if you start a conversation.,
Use punctuation, but do not over-use punctuation.,
Ration how often you use emojis.",How to Avoid Being an Annoying Texter2," Abbreviations are a great way to shorthand words to type your texts out faster. However, too many abbreviations can make messages borderline unreadable and the person receiving the text message may not understand you.Some abbreviations (btw, fb, u, ur) are acceptable. Try to text longhand with only a couple of abbreviations in the mix. An example of this is: “Btw, what u r up to today?” The ratio of longhand words to abbreviations should always be much greater.
Refrain from using too many abbreviations in your text messages or a text could look like this: ""nm jc @ ma hous what u wan do 2dai."" If a person has to concentrate to decipher a message, consider making revisions to your abbreviation usage.
Do not abbreviate text messages sent to people you know in a professional sense. It’s the quickest way to look unprofessional and immature., Texting is about quickness and efficiency, but not to the point of error. Even a small error can be a jarring read to the person receiving the text. Use autocorrect to help you finish sentences faster with proper spelling. Be sure to always proofread everything you text.

, If you ask ""what's up"" and they say ""not much, you?,"" tell them something funny that happened that day. Do not follow things up with “nothing” as an answer or a one-word response. The recipient will wonder why you texted them.


Don’t text someone for the sake of texting them. People can tell when you’re using them to bide your time over versus being genuinely interested in them and what they have going on. Be detailed and invested in your messages. Text with sincerity or not at all.
If you notice that the person you’re texting is giving you one-word responses back, take it as a sign that they either don’t have anything to talk about or they don’t feel like talking. Text them another time.

, A question mark after a question or occasional exclamation mark is good. Many question marks are not. Do not use five question marks at the end of every (or any) sentence.

, Sometimes people think it’s cute to add ten winky faces or ten kissing faces after a brief text or in exchange for actual words; other people find it annoying. If you must, use an emoji for emphasis and use just one or two at any given time."
"
Maintain an even text ratio.,
Steer clear of overtexting.There’s nothing worse than opening your phone to see a plethora of text messages and all of them are longer than a paragraph.,
Avoid texting emotionally charged interactions.,
Be mindful of the time.,
Respond to texts you receive.,
Have respect for others’ texting boundaries.",How to Avoid Being an Annoying Texter3," A text ratio should always be even, meaning for every one text you receive, send one text back. If two were sent to you, you can send two back. However, never send more texts than you received and vice versa. It’s the quickest way to seem desperate or needy., Practice self awareness if you notice your texts are a little long, edit them, and stop yourself from annoying people with this texting tendency.


Do not text someone you know multiple times everyday to ask about their life, unless you are really good friends. If you ask them ""what's up?"" or ""what are you up to?"" three times or more in a day, you're doing something wrong.
Texting is not a replacement for in person or phone conversations, so if there are a lot of details, save it for one of those two outlets versus a text. Important details can be lost that way., Never text someone while they are angry or upset or while you are angry or upset. Tone can be misunderstood which can prolong confrontation and negative emotions. Diffuse situations quicker by saving the conversation for later or picking up the phone to continue it.

, Receiving a text from someone before noon is a little annoying, especially on a weekend when you’re trying to get some extra sleep in. It can be disruptive.Treat texting as you would a phone call to a house phone. You wouldn’t call someone’s house before noon or after 10:30 pm, so use that as a rule of thumb of when to send text messages. If you are friends who have known each other for a while, there might be some leeway with these guidelines. Use discretion.
On the flipside, texting someone after midnight can be an alert that you are needy, wasted, or trying to hook up – signs you might not want to put out there.

, It’s the right thing to do and the polite thing to do. Sometimes not receiving a text response can be just as annoying as receiving far too many. Do your best to respond appropriately and timely to messages sent to you., If somebody does not respond, they are either busy or don't want to talk to you. Whichever the case may be, respect their decision of not wanting to talk to you.


As you would in every day face to face interactions, allow the person you’re texting to show you what your next move is. Once you’ve sent a message, don’t text that person again until they text you back.
Also avoid any annoying behaviors that undermine the other person’s attempt to distance themselves from your texts. Don’t text them again with a different comment or question, don’t text them a question mark a minute later, and don’t resend the exact same message an hour later (they definitely received your message).
If your friend tells you that she/he will ""text u later"" and after the whole day there is no reply from your friend, avoid texting a ""good night"" in effort to remind them that you were waiting for their text. It’s a passive aggressive behavior.

Turn your phone to the Do Not Disturb mode.,
Download a prevention app.,
Use voice commands.",How to Prevent Texting and Driving2," Each smartphone comes with a Do Not Disturb mode that can be very helpful for trying to prevent texting and driving. The mode makes it so no calls, texts, or alerts can get through while the phone is in it. This can eliminate distractions and reduce the risk your will read or respond to a text.In Do Not Disturb mode, you will be able to allow exceptions. This can allow family members to call you in case of emergency.

, There are apps you can use on your smartphone to help prevent texting while driving. Some apps will block all texts or calls while you are driving. Some apps will reward you for not using your phone while driving over 6 mph, and others will provide audio files for you to listen to when you receive a message.Apps to help you stop texting include Live2Txt, SafeDrive, Drivemode, and DriveSafe.ly.

, Most smartphones have technology that will turn your voice to a text message. If you can figure out how to work your voice function, you can text using only your voice, even if you are driving.Before you try this, determine how the voice text function on your phone works. Having to look at the phone and figure out how to get to the text defeats the purpose of handsfree voice-text.

Ask yourself if it is worth the risk.,
Take the pledge.,
Let your friends and family know you are driving.",How to Prevent Texting and Driving3," Every time you get the urge to text while driving, ask yourself, “Is reading that text right this moment worth crashing my car?” or something similar. By thinking about the risk each time you want to text, it may help you get out of the habit completely.This can also help you learn patience. Having the patience not to text because of the risks can be a good thing.

, Many websites and cell phone companies have pledges that you can take against texting and driving. The pledge is your promise that you will never text and drive. By pledging, you acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving and that it can injure or kill other drivers.By taking the pledge, you are honoring your word every time you refuse to text and drive.
You can take the pledge at Texting and Driving Safety or It Can Wait.

, Before you get behind the wheel, send a text telling someone the conversation will be on hold for now because you are driving. You may also use a code at the end of a text, like #D that lets the person you are texting know you are about to start driving.When you let someone know you are driving, you can tell them, “I am driving. I will not respond for the next 45 minutes. You can wait that long to respond so I’m not distracted.”

Place an app on your teen's phone.,
Talk to the person.,
Offer to text for the person.,
Set rules.",How to Prevent Texting and Driving4," Parents can install apps that help prevent teens from texting and driving. These apps can alert you to when your teen uses their phones while driving, and also when the teen turns off the app. Talk to your teen about using these apps on their phone and their purpose. You want to help them learn safe driving habits, not make them think you are spying on them.Cellcontrol is a paid subscription service that provides a device that goes in the car which hooks to the app. The app blocks the phone from receiving or sending texts while the car is moving. It also blocks other features, like the camera.
Drive Safe Mode is another app for parents that helps prevent the driver from sending and receiving texts.

, If you see someone who constantly texts and drives, consider having a conversation with them. You may want to ask them if they are aware of the dangers of texting and driving, or just tell them you feel uncomfortable when they do that while you ride in the car with them.For example, if you have a teen driver, have a family discussion about the dangers of texting and driving. Discuss possible alternatives to help keep your teen off their phone.
If you are in the car with someone who is driving, ask them not to text while you are a passenger. Say, ""I am very uncomfortable with texting and driving because it is so dangerous. Will you please not text while you are driving me around?""

, If someone is trying to check their phone while driving, offer to read the text and respond for them. This keeps their eyes on the road, and they still get to send a text they feel is really important.Try saying, ""I am happy to text them back so you can concentrate on driving. Just tell me what to say.""

, Setting texting and driving rules in your family can help everyone, teen and adult drivers alike. Make it a rule that no one can text while driving, even the adults. This sets a good example for teen drivers and keeps everyone safe.Set consequences for texting and driving. For example, your teen may lose driving privileges if they text and drive.
Don't text and call each other while you know the other person is driving. This reduces the risk that your family will text back.

Spend time trying the different texting interfaces for your phone.,
Study texting shorthand.,
Persevere while learning.,
Train your dictionary.,
Use templates for common phrases.,
Investigate special features of your text interface.,
Learn your keypad.,
Experiment with different styles of texting for touchscreen phones.,
Use predictive or manual texting for non-touchscreen phones.",How to Text Faster," There is a learning curve with any new text input interface. To learn how to type quickly on a computer keyboard, most people need time to become accustomed to it, and the same is true for your phone's texting software. You might find that the swiping style is quickest and most reliable, or you may find that you touch type your messages quickest.If there are a few different styles for texting on your phone, you'll likely want to give each a try for at least a couple of days. This way you'll have time to learn the pros and cons for each while getting the hang of the style of input.;
, To quickly express ideas and thoughts through text, many people use shortened forms of words. Some of these will be evident right off the bat, like the use of the letter ""u"" to represent the word ""you."" Others may be less obvious, like the use of ""pbb"" to indicate ""probably."" Some common texting shorthand includes...


to/too = 2
for = 4
your/you're = ur
are = r
be = b
be right back = brb
talk to you later = ttyl
by the way = btw
see you later = c u l8r
heart/love = <3
oh my god = omg
never mind = nvm / nm
I don't know = idk
ta ta for now = ttfn
just kidding = jk
best friend forever= bff
no problem = np
thank you = ty, While learning anything new, it can be easy to get discouraged. This can lead you to giving up or trying with halfhearted effort. It may be daunting at first, but texting with your friends and family members regularly will only improve your speed.When you come across a text expression you are unsure of, don't be afraid to ask! Some communities use less common texting expressions that may be confusing. For example, gamers will often use the expression ""FTW"" (for the win) to express appreciation or admiration., Most cell phone texting software allows you to customize your dictionary so it doesn't auto-correct certain words or so that it learns new words it wasn't initially programmed with. This feature can usually be accessed in the system/settings app of your phone, which is often represented by a gear icon. Select this, and find your language/keyboard options.Phones notoriously have difficulty telling names and other proper nouns apart from ordinary words. For example, you may have to put the name ""Tere"" in your phone to prevent it from auto-correcting the name to the word ""there.""

, If you find that you frequently use certain expressions, you can save yourself from typing out the whole phrase by teaching your texting software the expression. Much like training your dictionary, you'll have to go to the system/settings of your phone (often represented by a gear), and set this up in the language/keyboard options. Some phrases to consider include...


What are you up to?
Sorry, I'm busy right now.
Where are you?
I'll be right there.
I'm running late.
Let's catch up soon., Some texting software comes with a tutorial that teaches you the basic workings of your phone's texting app. However, these often leave out unique or advanced features, some of which might help you text even faster! To learn the ins and outs of your phone's texting software, you should read a detailed description of its features online.


A common feature that you might find helpful, especially for larger phones, is a split keyboard layout. This aligns half of your keyboard to either side of your screen. This may make it easier, and quicker, for your thumbs to reach keys that would have otherwise been hard to reach in the middle of your screen., Knowing where all the letters and symbols are on your keypad will significantly speed up your ability to text. Different phones, regions, and languages sometimes make use of different keypad layouts.Depending on these factors, you may have to relearn your cell phone keypad layout.


If your goal is to text super quick, you may want to take some time to firmly ingrain the keypad in your mind. Take a few days and doodle out the keypad on scrap paper as a way of memorizing your cell phone keypad.
Some texting apps allow you to customize your keypad. This can help you organize your keypad so its set up naturally for you.If this option is available to you with your texting app, you may want to customize your keypad.

, The two main styles of texting for touchscreen phones are generally called ""swiping"" and ""touch type."" These two techniques are a matter of preference, and you may find that one works best for you over another. You may also find that your phone only supports one and not the other. You'll have to experiment to see which works best for you and check the user manual of your phone to see what style of texting is supported.


Swiping involves touching the first letter of the word you want to type on the touchscreen of your phone and pathing your finger through the rest of the letters of the word without taking your finger off the screen. Once you have finished your word, you should remove your finger from the screen.
Touch type is much like the typing you would do on a keyboard. For each letter of the word you are trying to type, you should tap your screen where the letter appears on your on-screen keyboard.

, Non-touchscreen phones rely on a button based keypad, where each number of your pad generally corresponds to a set of letters of the alphabet. Some phones may also have small keyboards, which you can use as you would a normal computer keyboard, pressing each letter on the keyboard to type words. Phones that use a number pad with corresponding letters often have predictive texting software, like...


T9 predictive text. T9 stands for ""text on 9 keys,"" with the 9 keys being the numerals 1 through 9 on your keyboard. Zero is often used for punctuation. By pressing the numbers that correspond to the letters you need for the word you are trying to text, T9 software should suggest likely options. For example, on many T9 keypads, ""43556"" will suggest the word ""hello.""
Once you have pressed the keys that contain the letters you need to spell your word, you may have many suggested words to choose from. Generally, you'll have to select from among these options by using a directional pad on your phone.
Manual texting involves pushing the numbers on your number pad to cycle through the letters associated with that particular number. To manually type the ""h"" in ""hello,"" you'd have first to press the number 4 two times in rapid succession. The first press would suggest ""g"" and the second ""h."" In this fashion, you'll have to type your words to text.
With manual texting, you may have to press a select key, like a button in the center of your directional pad, to select the letter after rapidly pushing the number key. In some cases, your phone will interpret a long pause after pressing the key as the selection of the letter.
Some predictive software will offer suggestions for likely words before you finish typing. This can speed up your text time, removing unnecessary keystrokes. To make the most of this feature, you may have to practice using your texting software to develop an intuition for it."

Be a good listener.,
Make them laugh.,
Challenge them to an exclusive emoji convo.,
Send encouragement.,
Schedule a date for company.,
End with a cute send-off.",How to Make Someone Feel Better Via Text Message1," Even with phone screens separating you, there are still ways to show that you're actively listening and receptive to your friend's troubles. While your friend tells the story, you can text little comments that make them feel validated like, ""That's awful"", or, ""I'm so sorry about that.""


Make sure your words are truly genuine. Let the person lead the conversation. Don't rush in to offer help or fix things. Simply be present for your friend.;
, If someone you care about is having a bad day, lift their spirits with laughter. Even if you aren’t close by, you can send your friend or family member something funny. Tell a joke. Take a silly photo of yourself and attach it to the message. Or, send a link to a hilarious YouTube video.Before using humor, think about your relationship with the person and what they have responded to in the past. Some people are more receptive to humor than others.

, It is often said that when you know someone well enough, you can communicate with a look. Show your best friend or significant other how well you know them by sending emoji-only messages. Not using any real words will make it more fun!


Tell them they can only respond with emojis, too. You might start the conversation with a smiley face or show two friends together. Then, let your imagination run wild.

, Sometimes, it can be hard to know just the right thing to say to someone who’s feeling down. In these instances, an inspirational quote can lift someone’s mood. Try to send something relating to what your friend is going through.


For example, if a friend bombed a job interview, you might send this Victor Kiam quote, “Even if you fall on your face, you’re still moving forward.”Brainyquote.com is a great source for inspirational quotes to send friends., If you are able to see your loved one, you might send a quick text to schedule a get-together. If your friend is feeling lonely, just knowing that you’ll be there to keep them company can go a long way towards making them feel better.


You might send, “Hey, I know you had a rough day. How about pizza and a movie later?”

, Instead of just saying ""bye"" at the end of the conversation, you can say something a little cuter. Try ""I hope your dreams are sweeter than your day was!"" or ""Have an awesome afternoon. I can't wait to talk to you again later,"" or something along those lines, for a more creative sign-off that might make the other person smile a bit.

If you pick something that interests both of you, such as sports, TV, or the upcoming elections, then you’ll be off to a great start.


Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to pick the best conversational topic ever, at first. If the one you start with is a no go, then you can always find a way to change the topic. Remember that there’s a bit less pressure to maintain a seamless conversation than you’d feel over the phone or in person.
If the person doesn’t bite or sounds busy, just switch to another topic that you’re sure will generate some more enthusiasm.;
, People love it when you ask for their opinion and they are always happy to give it, whether you’re in person or texting. If you show that you really care about what the person thinks, then he or she will be happy to keep talking to you. Focus more on listening to what the other person has to say than giving an opinion of your own.


Try to keep your questions open-ended. Instead of asking, “Did you like the new movie?” ask, “What did you think of the new movie?” or “Why didn’t you like the concert?” This gives the person more to work with.

, Even if you're bored, it doesn't mean that you have to let the other person know. If you constantly complain of boredom, then the other person may lose interest and stop texting, thinking they're boring you. Instead, focus on the positive things in your life and show some enthusiasm about whatever topic you’re discussing.


Avoid using words repetitively. It's hard to have an interesting conversation when you get the same old, monotone replies every time: ""Lol"", ""Ah"", ""Wow"", ""Oh"", etc. Try to mix it up a little bit to let the other person know you take an interest in what they have to say. This will keep the conversation more fun than if you say the same old thing all the time.
You can use some emoticons or exclamation marks to generate some enthusiasm, though you don’t have to overdo it, either.
If you’re just having a bad day and aren’t up for being overly enthusiastic, let your friend know.

, Remind the other person that there's an actual human being behind the words on that little phone screen. Add smileys and emoticons, or use text laughs, such as ""lol"", ""rofl"", ""cqts"", etc, if that suits your texting style. You want your friend to see your unique texting patterns, just as no one else could sound like you if you were to have a conversation in person.


Don’t worry so much about telling your friend what he or she wants to hear; it’s much more important that you let the real you shine through than putting on some kind of a front.
If you’re normally a bit goofy or silly, let this come through! Don’t be afraid to be a little bit ridiculous; no one is judging you.

, Another way to get an interesting conversation going is to talk about what’s going on with you. Even if you’re just watching television or getting ready to help your mom bake a pie, bring it up to see if it can spark an interesting conversation. This can also transition into having your friend talk about what he or she is doing. This is a way to feel closer to your friend and to feel more engaged in his or her life.


Make sure you’re more interested in what your friend is doing than whatever is going on with you. Make your friend see that you really care about what’s going on with him or her.

, It may be much easier on your thumbs than taking the time to type out a real message, but one word can seldom start a conversation. Whether you’re asking a one-word question or giving a one-word response, this can’t lead to a very stimulating conversation. The more words you use, the more you’ll have to work with in terms of having a fun and interesting conversation.


If you do send a one word text, follow it up with a longer explanation or more information. It’s okay if you like to talk in shorter sentences as long as you can keep the conversation going.
If there’s really nothing more to say on the topic, you can follow up with a more open-ended question of your own or a comment about a new topic.
Even if the person asked you a “yes” or “no” question, this doesn’t mean you should end it there; say “Yes and…” or “No, but…” and elaborate on your opinion or rationale. This will keep the conversation feeling more flexible and dynamic.

, There's something fun and playful about never knowing what a person will say next. Surprise him or her with a totally unexpected response, or a question that seems to come out of nowhere. Spontaneity is key, and it will make for another great string of conversation!


Just like in a real conversation, you don’t want to overthink every word you have to say, or things will drag. Instead, if you suddenly want to bring up something funny that happened in class that day, or the topic of the weirdest documentary ever that you saw last night, go for it.
Look around yourself for inspiration. The simplest, most common household item can spark a great conversation. It could be anything from a used napkin to a DVD.

, While the occasional misspelling or abbreviation is cute and acceptable, it's not fun when a person strains their eyes trying to decipher your texts. Try to keep chatspeak to a minimum, especially if you’re talking to a person you haven’t texted too often before; give people a little while to get used to your texting style before you use anything too colloquial.


Plus, nothing will slow down a conversation faster than having the person you’re texting ask you for clarification or having to repeat yourself.

, The usual small talk is helpful when you're absolutely desperate, but it seldom makes for memorable conversations. Instead of ""Fine weather we're having"", try to think of something more original. This is especially important if you’re trying to win over a new friend or a potential significant other; you don’t want to to say what everyone else is saying.


Avoid saying things that are too simple or basic, such as, “What’s up?” “I’ve had such a long day,” or “I’m tired today.” You’ve got to give the other person a bit more to work with if you want to stand out.

, If you're texting an old friend, you could always bring up the past to have a few laughs or to have a nostalgic moment. It's hard to go wrong with ""Remember the time..."" or ""I miss when..."". Just make sure your sentiment doesn't turn too nostalgic, or the both of you may end up with that empty longing feeling and won’t be able to continue the conversation.


Reminiscing like this may come off as random in the middle of a conversation, but if you want to kick off a conversation with an old friend you haven’t spoken to in a while, then sometimes the perfect thing to say can be, “Remember that time when…”

, These are extra fun! Send along a funny picture of yourself, or a cool graphic. Add audio of your favorite song, or weird sound effects, for added fun. Audio or picture messages are bound to get you both talking and laughing. This is a great way to wrap up a fun conversation, too. Leaving your friend with a lasting image will make that friend eager to pick up your next texting conversation.


Just make sure you’re texting someone with a phone that is able to accept photos, sound effects, or other fancy additions. You don’t want to confuse your friend or make your friend feel left out by sending along a video or an image your friend can’t see.

, You may be too worried about what you’re going to say next or may be really excited to share your opinion about something to notice what the person you’re talking to is telling you. Maybe that person has a secret he’d really like to share, or maybe something is off and he’s clearly upset though he hasn’t said this explicitly. Pay attention to what the person is saying so you can respond appropriately.


You don’t want to seem self-absorbed by ignoring signs that the person wants to talk or has something to share. If the person seems like he’s not telling you the full story, or if something really exciting happened to him, then give him his turn to speak.
Carefully read over what the person wrote, especially if the message is really long, before responding. You don’t want to look like you’re only half listening when you ask a question about something the person just told you one minute ago.
If the person is talking about something important and serious, then make sure you’re free to really engage with him. If your friend is telling you about her grandmother’s death, then you should call her and talk about it instead of half-answering her because you’re in your math class.

, One thing to keep in mind when you pick up your phone to start a texting exchange is that you shouldn’t put too much pressure on yourself. Don’t worry about saying the most perfect first line or telling the most hilarious story. If you obsess over this too much, then it will take way too long for you to actually contact the person you want to talk to, or to continue the conversation; the person may think you’re busy or losing interest when in fact, you’re obsessing over what you’re going to say next.


It’s much better to keep the flow of an imperfect, natural conversation than to spend ten minutes crafting the most amazing story ever. Plus, you don’t always know what the person you’re texting is up to, and you may have missed your chance to talk to that person for hours.

, If you just started a texting conversation, or even if you’re in the middle of a slow-moving conversation, you should consider that the person you’re talking to may be in the middle of something, or may be having a texting conversation with someone else, too. You don’t want to rush things or seem impatient by repeating your question, sending a ton of question marks after your initial comment, or being rude or snippy until the person gets back to you.


Remember that the benefit of a texting convo is that you have a bit more time to craft a response. The downside is that the person you’re talking to may not be as engaged as he or she would be if you were talking in person; it’s best to accept that instead of putting the person off by acting impatient.

, One thing you should keep in mind is that there should be a balance to the conversation. You don’t want the person to feel like you’re doing all the talking, or that you’re asking so many questions that he or she can hardly keep his or her answers straight. Just as in a real conversation, you should aim to do about half of the texting, and make sure to let the person share his or her ideas instead of being overwhelmed by yours.


Remember that it’s more important to be interested than interesting. Instead of telling the person a million fascinating facts you learned that day, you’re much better off asking the person about his day, his ideas, or his experiences. People like talking about themselves more than you think.

, Though texting can be perfect for having a lighthearted conversation with one of your friends when you have nothing better going on, you want to avoid dropping a bomb on the person in the middle of what the person thought was a fun and interesting conversation. If you have some big news, or even some bad news, to share with the person, then you may be better off calling the person up or sharing your news in person.


You want the person to be emotionally prepared for the gravity of the situation, not caught off guard.
For example, you're causally chatting with your girlfriend about last night's television when she suddenly announces she's pregnant. Put yourself in their shoes: how would you feel if your friend dropped a bombshell on you through text?

, Remember that your texting relationship with a person can help you get closer, but it can never define your entire relationship. You should use texting to make conversation with the people you like and to get to know them again, but you shouldn’t let it replace human contact or real conversation. As much as you may like texting your new friend or love interest, you have to make an effort to call that person and to spend time with him or her in person if you really want your relationship to flourish.


You can use texting as a jumping off point into having a real life connection with the person. For example, if you’re both talking about how your favorite movie is playing, you can ask a simple question like, “Want to go together?” Or if you’re both talking about how bored you are, you can say something like, “Want to go out for ice cream?” Don’t be shy about it; know that your friend probably wants to spend more in-person time with you, too.

, People love it when you ask them for advice, because it makes people feel good to think that they are knowledgeable about something and that they have wisdom to share. It doesn't have to be something really serious; just something you know the person would have an opinion about. Here are some questions you can ask:


""I'm going to Santa Cruz for the first time this weekend. Any suggestions for places to eat?""
""What do you think I should get my boyfriend for his birthday? I'm completely stumped.""
""Which dress do you think I should wear to the school dance? I can't decide.""

, One way to show the person that you really do care is to ask about something you talked about earlier that day, or even earlier that week. This shows the person that you really do pay attention and care about what happens when you're not just texting each other. Here are some ways you can follow up:


""Hey, how is your grandmother doing? Is she still in the hospital?""
""Did you get that waitressing job you applied for last week?""
""How was your trip to Big Sur? I've always wanted to go.""

, Another way to start a lively conversation is to suggest an activity that you and the person you're texting can do together. It can be something far in the future or later in the week; if the activity sounds fun, then you'll have plenty to talk about via text as you figure out the details. Here are some suggestions you can make:


""What do you say to going to an 80s cover band concert with me next month? We can dress up in neon...""
""Want to check out the new Wolverine movie this weekend? I heard popcorn is free this Sunday!""
""Have you ever had Cambodian food? There's a new restaurant in town and I heard it's cheap and delicious.""

, Compliments are never overrated, and you don't have to see the person face to face in order to give a meaningful compliment. A small compliment can be a great way to start a conversation and to make the person feel like you really care. As long as you're being genuine and not making the person feel uncomfortable, this is a great way to chat over the phone. Here are some great things you can say to compliment a person over text:


""You were amazing in your basketball game yesterday. I was so impressed.""
""I loved the denim jacket you wore today. You're so awesome at wearing retro clothes.""
""Thanks for helping me study for the math test last night. You're such a good friend and I couldn't have aced it without you.""

, Another way to have a lively conversation is to mention something fun that you're doing over the weekend or later in the week. This can be a great way to talk about something you're interested in, to share some funny information about yourself, or even to encourage the person to join in and spend some quality time with you. Here are some things you can say:


""I'm going to a water park with my cousin this weekend. I always thought they were kind of corny, but I'm really excited.""
""I'm taking a ceramics class this weekend. Should be pretty cool.""
""I'm actually going to Tahoe with my family this weekend. I've never gone skiing before.""

, If the person you're talking to has a big test, an interview, or just another important event going on, then you can send the person a text to show that you're thinking of him or her and that you wish him or her the best. A bit of encouragement can be just the thing the person needs to succeed and to feel like you really care. Here are some ways to wish the person some good luck:


""Good luck on your test tomorrow. I know you'll rock it!""
""Get some rest before your interview. You're going to wow them.""
""Kick some butt in the soccer game this afternoon! I'll be cheering in the stands.""

Remind them of how great they are.,
Dare them to look their best.,
Search for GIFs that relate to their situation.,
Make them smile with a funny ecard.",How to Make Someone Feel Better Via Text Message2," One way to lift your friend’s spirits after a breakup is by complimenting them. Do this by telling your friend three things you love about them. Send it in a text message, write it down and photograph it, or make a video and attach it to the message.For instance, you might text, “You are an awesome friend. I love that you have a great sense of humor, you’re always there when I need you, and you make a mean ice cream sundae, too. Hope you feel better (-: ”

, Going through a breakup can be devastating. Many people often react by living in sweats, eating lots of junk food, and hiding out in their rooms. Help your friend get out of the post-breakup funk by challenging them to get dressed up.


You might say, “No more sweats! I need you to look in your closet and put on your favorite outfit. Do your makeup and style your hair. Then, send me a pic of the transformation.”
Even better, tell your friend to get dressed so the two of you can go out for lunch or see a movie together. Getting out of the house might make them feel better, too.

, GIFs are like animated memes. They are a perfect way to express your feelings through text. If your close friend, sibling, or other family member is down on themselves after a breakup, look through a GIF library and find the right animation to cheer them up. Find a GIF from a favorite movie or TV show relating to a breakup. It’s a great way to make them smile.


A great library for GIFs is GIPHY. You can find the application in your phone’s app store, download it, and then attach the GIFs directly to text messages., Different online websites offer cards that you can send through text message. Browse the website and find a funny ecard about breakups. Someecards.com, for example, lets you search for ecards about breakups.


For example, one funny card says, “It’s better to have loved and lost than to live with a psycho for the rest of your life.” Such a card is sure to remind your friend that they are probably better off without their ex."
"
Acknowledge their grief.,
Be there.,
Offer your help.,
Link to an uplifting verse or song.,
Know when to get additional help.",How to Make Someone Feel Better Via Text Message3," When a friend is grieving a personal loss, it can be hard to know what to say. Lots of times, people are quick to cheer someone up without acknowledging their pain first. The best thing to say could simply be letting them know that you see they’re hurting.Send a text that says, “I know you and Teddy were really close. You must be shocked and upset. I’m so sorry for your loss.”

, It can be painful to watch someone you care about grieve. However, another great way to respond when a friend is grieving is by letting them know you are there for them. It may be uncomfortable, but make sure they know they can count on you, if they want your company.


You might say, “I can’t take your pain away, but I will sit by you and hold your hand. I am here for you.”, A grieving person may be so lost in their pain that they are unable to take care of everyday life things. Anticipate your friend’s needs and try to offer your time or services. This may mean helping with chores, running errands, or making phone calls.Send a text that asks, “How can I support you through this time? Please give me a job to do.”

, People often say empty, meaningless platitudes to others who are experiencing a loss. This may make matters worse. Resist saying things like, “They are in a better place.” Instead, think about your friend’s spiritual or religious beliefs.Find an appropriate quote, verse, or song that offers them comfort.

, If your grieving or upset friend doesn't seem to come around after several weeks, you may need to take a closer look at their behavior. Some people have a harder time getting over a loss. They may stop completing everyday activities and withdraw from loved ones. They may also stop eating, sleeping, or caring for themselves.If your friend seems to have a hard time getting over their grief, they may need to see a professional.
You might say, ""I'm a bit worried about you, Sarah. You haven't been eating or doing your homework. I think it may help if you talk to a counselor.""

On smart phones, calling this number can even bring up an easy-to use graphical interface. To begin, call this number. Your carrier's tech support will probably provide options for blocking text messages. Here are the tech support or customer service numbers for four major U.S. cell phone carriers:AT&T: 1-800-331-0500
Sprint: 1-888-211-4727
T-Mobile: 1-877-453-1304
Verizon: 1-800-922-0204
In addition, many carriers offer online chat services for technical support issues.;
, Some cell phone carriers, like Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, allow subscribers to block texts (and calls) from a certain number of phone numbers free of charge. To use this service, you'll need to be a paid subscriber with a registered online account. Log into your profile, then access your ""My Verizon,"" ""My T-Mobile,"" or ""My Sprint"" menu. The option to block numbers is under a submenu called ""Manage Family Safeguards and Controls"" for Verizon, ""Plans and Services"" for T-Mobile,and ""Limits and Permissions"" for Sprint.Take note: Online blocks can eventually expire. For instance, blocks applied using Verizon's online service expire after 90 days. Be sure to re-enter problem numbers for continued text blocking. Paid premium options can offer the option to permanently block numbers.

, Other cell phone companies, such as AT&T,won't block text messages unless you subscribe to certain child control services. These services aren't free - usually, they're several dollars per month, per line. However, they offer a variety of privacy options - the ability to block texts from specified numbers, for instance. If the price of receiving unwanted texts exceeds the price of your carrier's child controls, consider enrolling in the service.

, ""STOP"" is the most common opt-out reply for text marketing. If you're receiving unwanted texts from a service that you've subscribed to, try this method. It isn't necessarily guaranteed to work, but it's quick and easy to try. It won't hurt! If it does work, it will save you spending time on hold with your cell phone carrier to block numbers.


If you have a text message ""signature"" that auto-fills into the body of the text, remember to delete it or disable it before sending.

, Some text message ads are sent by automated programs designed to send ads to random phone numbers. In this case, replying to the ad (even just with the word ""STOP"") can potentially make the problem worse. A reply signifies to the program that there's an actual human at your number, so it will continue to send ads. If you get text spam from a source you don't recognize, ignore it. If it persists, try one of the other methods.

, Most US carriers allow you to report spam messages free-of-charge. To report a spam message, copy the message text and send it to 7726 (""SPAM."") This spam reporting service is operated by the GSM Association, a trade association for major mobile operators. By reporting the spam, you're helping to eliminate an annoyance for yourself and other cell phone users.


Other countries use different spam reporting numbers. In France, the number is 33700. In India, the number is 1909. , If you've received an unwanted text recently enough that it's still in your text history, you can easily block the sender. In the Messages app, select the text from the number you'd like to block. Select ""Contact,"" then ""Info."" Scroll to the bottom and select ""Block this Caller.""


When your harasser sends you a text, it will display on their phone as having been delivered, but you won't receive it.

, This method allows you to block texts from a sender who's in your contacts, but not in your text history. In the Settings app, scroll down and select ""Phone,"" then ""Blocked."" Select ""Add New."" Now, find the person you'd like to block in your contacts list. Select this person and they'll be blocked!

, Another way to block texts on iPhones is to download an app from the App Store. A variety of paid and free apps are available, each with its own selection of features - some, for instance, offer the ability to browse blocked messages. Here are a few apps that can block text messages on Apple products:


MCleanerGot to settings and find...block messagesiBlacklist (requires jailbroken device.)

, Select the unwanted text. Highlight it for three seconds. A popup menu should appear. Select ""Register as spam number."" Future texts from this number will be redirected to your spam folder and you won't receive notifications when they arrive.


The precise steps for this method will vary based on your version of the Android operating system. Your phone may not have this option - if not, look for an SMS-blocking app (see below).

, Select ""Menu,"" then ""Call settings,"" then ""Call rejection,"" then ""Auto reject list."" Here, you can select ""Create"" to add blocked numbers. You also have the option to block calls and texts from all unknown numbers by ticking the ""Unknown"" box.


As above, this method differs depending on your Android phone. If this method doesn't work for you, try a free app (see below).

End on a good note.",How to Have a Meaningful Text Message Conversation," Breaking the endless cycle of meaningless text message conversations starts with only talking to someone who offers interesting topics opinions. Don't text someone just because you know that they'll be at home bored with nothing better to do than text you. If that means not text messaging who you usually do and having to wait longer for a response from someone worth your time, so be it. And if there is nothing in mind that you need to tell the person, just don't text them at all. It's a waste. It's best to have no conversation then to have a ""dead"" one.Text messaging shouldn't be any different from having a conversation in-person: If it isn't going anywhere, don't let it continue.;
, If someone constantly text messages you for the only purpose of having someone to text message, shake them off. Take longer to reply, give shorter answers, and stay ambiguous and passive in your answers. Eventually people will start to take the hint that you aren't going to put any effort into the conversation, so they will cease text messaging you as much as they can., If you're having a conversation with a person you enjoy talking to, do as much as you can to keep the conversation going. Ask questions that require more than a yes or no answer, leaving room for your opinion and the opportunity to discuss related topics.

Instead of asking ""Do you like pop music?” Ask ""What are your favorite genres of music?"" Questions like that not only spark interest conversations but show that you also have a genuine interest in the person and want them to elaborate on the topic.

, Don't ask questions or bring up topics just so you can give your opinion on them. It makes you look self-centered, and unless you show just as much enthusiasm in what the other person has to say, it will come off as annoying and rude. Avoid this by not only giving your opinion but by also discussing or questioning the other person's opinion. If you're more shy or were raised to be ultra-polite, you might have the opposite imbalance where you try to keep the other person talking without offering anything of your own. Do about 1/3 to 1/2 of the talking, as long as you finish your texts with a sentence or question that invites an open-ended response. , Unless you are a person of very few words or can properly describe everything you need to say in one sentence, make a point of replying to a person's text message in at least two sentences. Worst of all is the ""K"" reply, which is now (sometimes) associated the sender being angry at the receiver, but not necessarily. It is often used in response to simple questions. Once you get to know a person's text message flow better, you'll be able to tell if you've said something to bore or anger them, but it is usually a one or two word answer.If you are angry with a person, it’s a good idea to not text them until you have had time to cool off and think about the situation. One word and one sentence replies will only make you more angry with the person you are text messaging as you continue your infuriating conversation.

, In the same sense that writers have different writing styles, consider creating your own standard of text messaging. A general sense of the English language should be upheld, because text message shorthand has become outdated and almost childish. Unlimited text messaging plans are now more affordable, so there's hardly any excuse to have sentences with a garble of letters, numbers and symbols that take the place of a five-letter word. As such, you do not always need a smiley face or heart after every sentence unless typing it makes you genuinely happy. Nobody will take you seriously if you have :) :] :D :P :/ :( >:( after everything you say. , If your conversation has taken an unexpected turn and either gotten deeper or more heated, ask to call the person and talk to them directly. Sometimes a person can better communicate their ideas out loud rather than picking the correct words to type and hesitating to see if they express their ideas clearly.Meet in person for a real connection. Don't let your thoughts and ideas be held back by text messaging, and stand firm on your opinions in whatever way you must. Not everything can be conveyed through a text, and it's hard to beat actually being face-to-face with a person., Do not randomly drop a conversation if it has been a good one. Doing so is the equivalent of hanging up on a person in the middle of a sentence. If the conversation has run its course, tell the person you have to go for the moment, or say good night if you need to get to sleep. Stay courteous and polite, so that the person can come to expect it and not be dismayed by randomly dropped conversations."

Access your Voicemail settings.,
Deactivate your Voicemail via settings.,
Input a phone code.,
Test to ensure your voicemail is deactivated.",How to Turn Off Voicemail1," Some phones offer an option to turn off your voicemail via the settings. The particular type of voicemail settings you'll have to access will depend on the type of phone and service you're using. Access your options list, and select the tab that relates to Voicemail. Virtually all phones will have some options tab relating to the voicemail utility; it's just a matter of finding out whether the phone offers an ability to deactivate the voicemail.


If you're unsure whether your phone has this capability, you can usually find answers by searching 'voicemail' in the index of the product manual, or looking up the specific product info online.
T-Mobile phones often have this capability, listed as Visual Voicemail.Many Verizon phones have it listed under ""Account Services - Phone Extras"".;
, If you're lucky, your phone will come with an option to deactivate your voicemail service. Checking the voicemail settings and looking for a 'Turn Off' or 'Deactivate' option is a good first step regardless of the type of phone you're using. If you find the right option, select it and the phone will turn off its voicemail function for you.You can always reactivate your voicemail through the same means if there comes a time you'd prefer to have it back.

, If your phone doesn't offer a voicemail settings tab, other options are available. Some providers, like Rogers, allow you to deactivate your phone via a number you can call through the phone in question. In the case of Rogers for instance, dial *93 and call it. Wait for two beeps; this will confirm that your request has been acknowledged and accepted. From there, hang up. Your voicemail should now be deactivated.If you want to reactivate your voicemail after having turned it off in this fashion, follow the same steps, this time dialing *92 instead.iPhone voicemail may be disabled in similar fashion. Input #404# into your call box and press ""Call"". This should deactivate your phone service for the meantime.

, Once you've gone through the motions of turning off voicemail one way or another, it is good form to check for yourself that it's done. Call the number in question from another phone, or get a friend to call you. Don't answer the phone, and see if the calling line is prompted to leave a message. If no voicemail option is offered, you'll know you have succeeded.

You want your voicemail to contain some basic information in a polite manner that will help the caller know that it’s you, and information to leave so you can call back as soon as possible.
Include your name (and the company if this is a business voicemail), a statement that lets the caller know you apologize for missing the call, and information you would like from the caller such as name, number, and a brief message concerning the purpose of the call.;
, You want to create a script that you can read from while recording your voicemail. By having something to read, you can relax and sound polite and confident.


Start with a polite “Hello”. Inform the caller of who you are, and apologize for missing the call.End your script by asking the caller to leave a name and contact number with a brief message. Inform the caller that you will get back to them as soon as possible. You can also sign off with a friendly “Have a nice day,” if you wish.

, You want to make sure that it sounds professional and friendly while getting a clear message across. Think about the kind of people who might be leaving you voicemails and make sure that your’s is personable and informative.


Make sure your script includes the information from your list. Avoid common, flat greetings like “Your call is very important to me.” If the call is important, you’ll make the effort to return it as soon as possible.If you are setting up a voicemail for work, even if it’s on your cell, consider giving callers alternate ways to reach to reach you. Give an email address, or the address to your website where more information may be found.
Once you’ve read your voicemail out loud and feel that it provides relevant information in a friendly, professional manner, you’re ready to record.

, You want your voice to come through crisp and clear, so make sure that there’s no noise in the background like a radio, tv, or people talking.


The best place to record your voicemail is in a quiet room that’s away from excessive noise.
Smaller rooms will also work better as there won’t be as much ambient sound as in a large, open space.

, Depending on your carrier and phone, there are several ways to record a new greeting.


If you’re on an iPhone and have iOS 8 or later, you can go into your “Phone” app and hit the “Voicemail” button. This will bring you to a screen that shows your voicemails, and in the upper lefthand corner will be an option for “Greeting”, click that and from there you can listen to or edit your greeting.
Android users can hold down the 1 key in the dialer until your phone connects to the voicemail service. Enter your PIN when prompted or setup your voicemail inbox for the first time and then follow the prompts to record a new greeting. Some Android devices may come with a Voicemail app, depending on your carrier.Try dialing your own phone number if you are having difficulty accessing your voicemail service.

, You’re ready to record, you’re in a comfortable quiet place, and you have your script in hand. Simply read your wonderful script when you are prompted to record.


Try not to use a completely monotone voice. You want to speak with a friendly conversational tone.
If you have trouble adding some expression to your voice or speaking clearly, then try practicing your greeting in front of a friend to get feedback and feel more comfortable.

, After you have recorded your voicemail greeting you have the option to preview it before saving. Listen to your voicemail to ensure that you have spoken in a clear and polite manner, and that you have included all the important information.Remember, you want to include your name or your family’s name.
Inform the caller that you apologize for missing the call and will return it as soon as possible.
Give a brief set of instructions on the information that you would like the caller to provide so you can be informed when you return the call.

, Have someone you trust listen to your voicemail greeting and give you feedback.


Having a friend call your phone and listen to your voicemail greeting is a great way to see if you have successfully recorded a friendly and proper greeting that actual callers can hear and understand.

, Restarting your phone is a quick fix for many common voicemail issues. If you cannot connect to your voicemail service or are experiencing other voicemail issues, try restarting your phone before moving on.

, If you're using a new phone or just switched SIM cards, you'll need to setup voicemail for your account before you can record your new greeting. There are several ways that you can access your voicemail features, depending on your service and device:


Press and hold 1 on the phone's dialer. This works on most devices and services.
Tap the Voicemail button on your iPhone's dialer.Dial *86 (Verizon)or 123 (T-Mobile).Dial your own number from your phone. For many services, this will call your voicemail.

, While most plans include basic voicemail services these days, it is still possible that you may have a plan that does not have a voicemail feature. Check your monthly statement or contact your carrier if you aren't sure.

, If you had previously setup your voicemail but can't remember your password, you'll need to contact your carrier's Customer Service line. A service rep will be able to reset your voicemail password for you. The Customer Service department should also be able to help you through any other issues you may be having with voicemail."

Test to make sure the voicemail is deactivated.",How to Turn Off Voicemail2," If you're ever in doubt, calling your service provider's hotline will put you in touch with a representative who will be able to help you out with your situation firsthand. The hotline information will be available on the website of your service provider. If you're not sure who your service provider is, check your phone's homepage or your billing information. Service hotlines are free of charge, and should be referred to whenever you're grappling with a phone hassle.


Some providers, like Three UK, have special hotlines reserved for people wanting to modify or remove their voicemail. In the case of Three UK, you can call 333 to get started with the process.Set some time aside for this if you decide to call. Depending on the time of day, traffic can be high and you may be waiting a while to get in touch with someone.

, Be clear and specific with your intentions. Once the representative comes on the line, let him know that you wish to have your voicemail disabled without any other changes to your plan. Specifying that you have no desire to change anything else will help streamline the process. On the other end, the representative will access your phone info and make the desired changes. He will let you know once the change has gone through.

, After you get off the phone and the service representative has informed you that the voicemail has been turned off, it's still a good idea to make sure yourself. Whether calling your phone from another number or getting someone else to call for you, give your phone a test run. Don't answer the incoming call with your phone. If the calling number is not prompted to leave a message, the process has worked. If not, you need to call the service provider again and tell them the problem hasn't been solved.

Keep your message brief.,
Open with the most important info.,
Be personal and organic.,
Pose a specific question or request.,
Restate your name and contact information.,
Avoid long-winded endings.",How to Leave the Perfect Voicemail Message," As soon as you begin recording your message, speak in a clear, audible voice. Don’t mutter or talk too fast. Try your best to sound interested and energetic to engage your listener’s attention. Even though the recipient can’t see you, your general tone will come across over the phone, so make sure you’re conveying the right one.Enunciate everything you say. Bad reception can distort your voice and cause you to cut out. Even an ordinary speaking voice can become muddled over the phone.
The quality of your voice should appropriately reflect the manner of the call. For example, it's alright to sound excited when you're leaving a voicemail to congratulate your nephew on his high school graduation. If you're offering condolences to a grieving friend, however, you should keep your tone solemn and respectful.;
, Give the recipient your name first thing. This way, the person you’re calling will know who you are right off the bat. A simple ""this is (your first name)"" will do in most situations, or a more introductory ""my name is (full name)"" if the person you're calling hasn't met you before. Friends and relatives will recognize you without the need for further identification. If it’s a professional call, they’ll have a name to associate with the voice and message, which will help open up a more personal line of communication.This step seems like a given, but it’s often forgotten by callers when they’re put on the spot.
If you have a job title or a description of yourself that might prove useful to the recipient in a follow-up call, list it after your name, i.e. ""My name is Dr. Holdsworth, senior radiologist at Sacred Heart Medical Center,"" or ""this is Gloria Carpenter, I'm Chloe from school's mother.""

, Recite your phone number immediately after your name. Most callers wait until the end of the voicemail to provide their contact info, but if the recipient doesn’t catch it the first time, they’ll be forced to listen to the entire message again. Remember to speak slowly and enunciate when leaving your phone number so that it’s comprehensible.A simple way to offer your phone number at the beginning of the message is to say something like “this is (your name), my number is (your phone number),” or “my name is (name) calling from (number).”
Despite the prevalence of Caller ID features, it’s always advisable to leave your phone number in case the person you’re calling doesn’t have your number saved, or you’re requesting that they return your call at a different extension.

, When listening to business-related voicemails or messages from unknown senders, people will begin to grow suspicious or disinterested if they don’t know who you are or why you’re calling. Put them at ease by mentioning a mutual friend or reference who’s provided you with their number. Again, this makes the call feel more personal. The voicemail will seem less invasive, and you’ll be more likely to receive a response.Try making a short introduction that will clue the listener in, such as ""I got your number from Pat, who says you're interested in selling your boat.""
Even if you’re not making a business call, establishing a connection can help make your recipient more comfortable. “This is Bob, your neighbor from across the street” is more personable than “This is Robert Henderson.”

, Have a clear idea of what you’re going to say before you start leaving a voicemail. This shouldn’t be much of an issue if you’re calling with a specific intention, but hearing the beep on the other end and knowing they’re being recorded can cause a lot of callers to draw a blank. Break the information down into bullet points and hit each one before hanging up.For voicemails that are especially pressing or important, consider writing out a rough script ahead of time.
If you catch yourself spacing out, just focus on getting out your name, callback number and reason for calling in a few words.
Image that you're sending a voicemail to follow up with a romantic interest about last night's date. Mentally outlining your message before you record it can mean the difference between coming off as cool, calm and collected and a stammering, nervous wreck.

, Restrict your voicemail message to 20-30 seconds. There will rarely be an occasion when a voicemail needs to be longer. You don’t want to bore the recipient with an overly long, meandering introduction or story. Stay terse and to the point. A short message can actually generate curiosity and persuade a person to call back when they might not have otherwise.On the flip side, if you leave a voicemail that’s too short, your recipient may think it’s unimportant and delete it without even listening to it. This is especially likely if you’re calling from an unlisted number.The point of leaving a voicemail is to compel someone to call you back, not to unload all the information you were going to share with them during the call.

, Cut to the chase and be explicit about your reason for calling. If you’re just touching base, say so; if you have a sales offer, or are following up with a transaction or confirming an appointment, let the recipient know. Your listener will quickly lose interest and may delete the message if you don’t inform them of your purpose up front.You only have a short time to get your point across. If you beat around the bush, your listener may give up on the message before they arrive at any crucial information.
It's much better to deliver difficult news like ""dad is in the hospital"" point blank, and use the remainder of the message to console and explain, than it is to dance around the subject and cause your listener to worry.

, Resist the urge to slip into a stilted, generic-sounding “phone voice.” Just be polite, be yourself and speak naturally. People can tell when someone is trying to sell them something or come off a certain way, and they’ll be much more likely to give you the time of day if they feel like you’re approaching them on equal footing.Sounding like you’re reading from a script will give your listener the impression that they’re just another call you have to make.

, As you conclude your message, be specific about why you want the recipient to call you back. Ask them a precise question or make a request that will motivate them to pick up the phone. If they’re left feeling confused or uncertain about your intent after listening to your voicemail, it hasn’t done its job.Try phrases like “let me know how you liked that recipe I sent you” or “I'm interested in hearing your ideas about this proposal.”
People are more motivated to get in touch when you’ve singled them out with a request than if you simply say “call me back.”

, Bring your message to a close by once again giving the listener your name and phone number. Repeat your phone number twice so that there’s no chance of them getting a digit wrong or failing to write it down. Be sure to also include any details that may be helpful when the recipient returns your call, such as when you will and won’t be available and the best time of day to call.Spelling out your phone number more than twice at the end of a call is excessive, and could even be interpreted as rude.
You won't need to worry about this step if your message is a casual one for a friend or relative.

, When it’s time to hang up, don’t dawdle or prolong the message needlessly. Unless it’s a personal call to a loved one, there’s no need to wish someone a wonderful day. The recipient’s attention will erode the longer the voicemail goes on, so try not to lose focus at the end. Thank them for their time and leave the next phase of communication up to them.Friendly closings like “I look forward to hearing from you” are warmer and therefore more effective than generic, commercial ones like “have a nice day.”
Don’t recapitulate or summarize your message at the end. If the recipient needs to hear a certain detail again, they can replay it later.

, Make sure you don't whisper, ramble, pause unnecessarily, or add words like uh, you know, um, like... you get it. Don't scream, but speak loudly and clearly, and enunciate. Remember the overall impression that you leave with your message. Your tone can be very important, the reaction of who you called may vary depending on your tone of voice. Such as: If you sound sad, the person may not call you back or will call back being sympathetic or even prying to find what was wrong. This can be annoying, especially if nothing was wrong. Try to sound as normal as possible.

, At the end of your message, consider adding something along the lines of ""Hope to see you soon,"" or ""Have a great day.""

Dial the full number. Make sure someone doesn't actually answer the phone you are calling when it rings, though.
Make sure you dial the area code with the number. ;
, Depending on your carrier, you will likely push one of these two keys next. It's more common to push the star key.


When you hear your voicemail start, that's when you should press either the star (*) or the pound (#) key. For AT&T, Sprint, U.S. Cellular, and T-Mobile, press the star (*) key. Verizon, Bell Mobility and Virgin Mobile users should press the pound (#) key. If you are using a different carrier, you can check its website or call customer service to be sure.

, You will need to know your pin or passcode in order to check your voicemail. If you don't have this code, you will have to retrieve it from your carrier.

Many experts suggest you fix this problem by calling your phone and leaving a voicemail yourself. Then delete the voicemail. , Sometimes you might want to access a person's voicemail without making the phone ring.

, If all calls to you are going directly to voicemail, you may need to change a setting in your phone.


On an iPhone, you need to make sure you do not have the ""do not disturb"" function enabled under settings. Just choose settings and then do not disturb. Check whether your phone is in airplane mode. If it is, turn off airplane mode.

Consider the appropriate situations for voicemails:


If you were calling to ask a specific question or find something out, you could ask it in the voicemail(VM), unless its something that entails a huge blown out conversation.,
Consider when it is not appropriate to leave a voicemail:


If you ""just want to talk."",
Be aware of the golden rule.",How to Decide Whether to Leave a Voicemail," Then just tell them the topic and to call you back.
If you were calling to tell them a quick, funny joke, go ahead and leave it for them in VM form. They may appreciate the entertainment. As long as it isn't a long involved story.
If you don't need them to call you back. What I mean by that is, if the only reason you needed to call was to give them some specific information, then give it to their VM. That way you don't have to worry about still trying to get in touch, and its out of your hands.;
, This is no time for VMs because you are more likely to leave a long, annoying VM. If you were calling to chat, the only thing they need to know is that you called. They'll see a missed call from you and call you back if they want to talk.
If you are drunk. Yes we've all seen it before, Drunk Dialing(DD). When you are Drunk dialing someone, you are more likely than not going to make an ass of yourself. Drunk VMs are even worse!!! Avoid them at all costs!
If you know they are with phone. If they didn't pick up, its possible that they don't want to talk to you right then. It might be best if you didn't hound them with a demanding VM. They will know you called, give them a chance to call you back when they want to.
If you are in a loud place. There's nothing more annoying than a voicemail that's just a bunch of noise. Especially if its long too.

, Don't leave a voicemail unless you think they want to hear one! If you think they will enjoy it, or benefit from hearing it in some way, then leave one. Otherwise, don't.

Set up call forwarding on a landline or conventional cell phone.,
Set up call forwarding on a 2G or 3G (GSM/UMTS) cell phone.,
Set up call forwarding on a 4G phone.",How to Activate Call Forwarding1," Call forwarding isn't usually included as a standard feature in most phone service plans. Call your provider and ask to sign up for call forwarding if you'd like to use it.


There are two types of call forwarding: conditional and unconditional.

Conditional call forwarding will only forward a call from the activated phone to the target phone if the activated phone is busy or nobody picks up after a certain number of rings.
Unconditional call forwarding means that once activated, all calls sent to the activated phone will be rerouted to the target phone no matter what (until the call forwarding service is canceled).


Phones that use the 4G LTE communications standard have call forwarding options built in, and do not require that you sign up, in most cases.;
, The way to activate call forwarding for all landline phones and cell phones on a 1G network in the United States is the same.


Pick up the receiver or turn your cell phone on.
Dial the following code based on the type of forwarding you want:

Dial *72 to set up unconditional call forwarding.
Dial *68 to set up conditional (busy signal/no pickup) call forwarding.
Dial *63 to forward calls from specific phone numbers only.
Dial *90 to only forward calls on a busy signal, but not on no pickup. This option is not available from every carrier.
Dial *92 to only forward calls on no pickup, but not in case of a busy signal. This option is not available from every carrier.
If you use Sprint Nextel phone service, the codes are slightly different: *72 for unconditional forwarding, *73 for forwarding on no answer, *74 for forwarding on a busy signal, and *28 for both.


After entering the code, dial the 10-digit phone number you want to forward calls to. Once that line is answered, call forwarding will be set.

If your target line is busy or nobody picks up when you try to set up forwarding, hang up and dial the code plus number a second time. This will usually set up unconditional call forwarding even without an answer from the other line.

The redialing technique may or may not work for other types of call forwarding.





, If you have an early smartphone or conventional cell phone made within the last several years, chances are it uses one of these protocols.


Turn your cell phone on.
Dial the following code based on the type of forwarding you want:

Dial *21* for unconditional call forwarding.
Dial *004* for conditional forwarding when the line is busy, doesn't pick up, or is out of service range.
Dial *67* to forward calls on a busy signal.
Dial *61* to forward calls on no pickup.
Dial *62* to forward calls when the phone is out of service range.


After entering the code, dial the 10-digit phone number you want to forward calls to, and then press # to finalize forwarding.

On 2G and 3G phones, it is possible to overwrite call forwarding to another number by re-entering the appropriate code and supplying a new number. To revert to the original forwarding number, enter the code without a phone number, followed by a # instead of a *.



, The most modern protocol for cell phone communications is 4G. If you have a new smartphone, chances are it operates on a 4G network.


Turn your cell phone on.
Navigate to the appropriate app for setting up call forwarding on your phone.

The location of this feature varies from model to model, but nearly all 4G phones have it. Consult your user manual if you can't find it.

Location and palm orientation matter! When learning signs, pay careful attention to where the hands are located, and which direction the palms face. This affects the meaning of the sign produced.
Comfort is important. Arthritis and tendonitis will prevent some from being able to form signs perfectly. If it hurts, adjust your position slightly.
Be aware that ASL is not a language only of the hands and fingers. It involves the whole body, including the upper torso, arms, and head. The face is extremely important! Facial expressions can communicate a variety of things. For example, elevated eyebrows when signing means one is asking a question.;
, As you are learning, move in a slow, deliberate fashion. This will help you master the motions as well as make it easier for others to understand you.

, Fingerspelling is used often in American Sign Language, especially for proper nouns. It is also essential for spelling out words you don't know the sign for. Check out this guide for details on how to fingerspell each letter of the alphabet.








, This sign is universally used to greet someone. It is very similar to a wave.









Bring your right hand up to your forehead, with your palm facing out.
Move your palm away from your body in a wave motion.

, The way you say goodbye in ASL is dependent on the situation and formality required.









More casual ways to say goodbye include a simple wave of the hand, a nod, or a thumb-up.
You can also sign ""see you later"" by pointing to your eye with your middle and index fingers in the shape of a ""V"", and then to the other person with your index finger.

, This very important sign will be especially useful for thanking your ASL practice partners.









Open your right hand into a flat palm, holding your fingers together with your thumb sticking out.
With your palm facing towards you and your hand facing straight up, start the motion with the tips of your fingers touching your chin.
Move your hand from your chin straight forward and down in an arc.
Nod as you move your hand.

, This is a good casual conversation starter that is easy to learn. It is broken down into two signs: ""how"" and ""you"" with the question implied.









Hold both hands at about chest level in a loose thumbs-up position with both thumbs pointed in towards your chest.
Rotate both hands outwards while keeping them in the same space in front of your chest and maintaining your hand shape.
Point towards to the other person with your right hand held at your upper chest.
Furrow your eyebrows as you finish the phrase, which indicates a question to which you expect a response other than ""yes"" or ""no.""

, Knowing the alphabet is a good first step, but most signing is done with phrases, as is any other language. Slowly build your vocabulary, taking the time to master each phrase and word as you go. Consistently adding and practicing new vocabulary with others fluent in the language is the only way to become fluent, just as it is with learning any new language.









Learn how to sign numbers. Knowing how to count and number things is a very useful skill to have in any language.
Study how to refer to locations. This will be useful as you go to new places and sign with new people.
Being able to express time, and the days of the week, will be very helpful when making plans with someone you sign with.

, Dictionaries are critical tools for learning any language, and ASL is no exception. A good dictionary will allow you to look up signs you don't understand, as well as give you something to study.


Look for a dictionary with easy-to-understand illustrations and descriptions.
Try using an online dictionary, where you can see videos of the signs being produced.

, A classroom setting will give you multiple people to practice signing with, as well as feedback on your performance.


Many colleges will allow you to take a class without enrolling. Check with your local school to see what programs they might offer.
Community programs such as local libraries and recreational centers will often offer ASL classes for those that are interested.

, While a dictionary will show you how to sign every word or phrase, a study guide will get you signing in a more practical fashion. A study guide will provide more instruction than a dictionary, and will help you learn basic conversations as well as sentence structure.

, The internet can provide a wealth of information about signing, how to sign, Deaf culture, and more.


There are many sites that contain video tutorials posted by professional ASL instructors. The ASLU is a great resource for new learners. Each entry has a video by professional instructors. Handspeak is another good video resource and online dictionary.
YouTube is host to a variety of self-published videos on signing. Just remember that with anything online, anyone can make something regardless of whether or not they actually know what they are doing. Be wary of misinformation and improper techniques.

, With the advent of smartphones, carrying a dictionary and study guide around with you has never been easier. Both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store have multiple options to choose from, ranging from free to a few dollars.


Apps can be great for quick references, and some include video along with instructions.
There are study guides and dictionaries, so try out a couple until you find ones that work for you.
Look for apps that have a high number of 4 & 5 star reviews. Browse through some user reviews to see how helpful the app has been for other people.

, In order to become fluent in ASL, you will have to be invested in Deaf culture. Since deafness is rarely passed from parent to child, Deaf culture is one of the few cultures where a child does not learn the cultural traits from their parents. Instead, the culture evolves from deaf schools and community gatherings. Sign language is but one small aspect of Deaf culture.


In Deaf culture, deafness is not viewed as a disability that needs fixing. The terms ""mute"" and ""dumb"" are culturally insensitive, and should never be used.
In general, individual Deaf communities are tight-knit and initially hard to break into. But persistence and a humble attitude will help you succeed in making deaf friends. Once they know you are sincere and eager to learn about them and their language, many deaf people will begin to accept you and ""show you the ropes"" of their unique culture.
The Deaf culture is built on strong literary traditions, especially in poetry.

, You cannot learn ASL simply from reading a dictionary or watching some videos. Finding a partner to practice ASL with on a regular basis will be crucial for improving your readability, speed, and comprehension.


Post a bulletin at your school asking for an ASL partner.
Get a friend or family member to learn ASL with you so you both have someone to practice with in everyday situations.

, The goal of learning ASL is being able to communicate fluently with someone who is deaf. Once you start feeling comfortable with basic sayings, go out of your way to interact with someone from the Deaf community.









Find out what Deaf community events are happening in your area, such as art shows, movie screenings, or gatherings.
Go to a Deaf Coffee Chat. They are typically (though, not always) oriented towards beginners and you are likely to find Deaf people who are happy to chat with you.
Be polite and ask if someone would like to engage in a basic conversation with you.

",How to Do Vowels in Sign Language1," It is the same as learning another language, you find the easiest things to remember and build up from that. In British Sign Language, it is the vowels.;
, This should be your dominant hand, which is your writing hand. If you are right handed, use your dominant right hand to sign onto your non-dominant (also called ""weak"") left hand. If you are left handed, do the opposite. However, with vowels, no shapes will be made. It is predominantly pointing with your index finger onto the fingers on your other hand.

, Hold out your left hand (for right handed people) or right hand (for left handed people) and point with your index finger on your writing hand to your thumb, touching it. Make sure they touch otherwise it could mean something completely different than what you want. Remember, when you sign the letter silently mouth the letter A as sign language is also helped by lip reading.

,, Again, pointing with the index finger of your writing hand, lightly touch the second finger of your weak hand and mouth I.

,, And remember, always mouth the letter or word.

Practice signing 30-99.,
Learn how to sign the number 100.",How to Count to 100 in American Sign Language," The trick is to remember the order. It goes index finger (1), index and middle (2), index, middle, and thumb (3), all but thumb (4), and all five fingers (5). Normally, you should orient your hand palm back (palm facing you) for these numbers. Avoid the temptation to sign two with thumb and index finger, or four with all but pinkie, which may feel more natural when counting.;
, The numbers 6-9 are counted off by touching a finger to your thumb. Your palm is oriented out (towards the person to whom you are signing). The order is pinkie to thumb (6), then ring finger (7), middle finger (8), index (9). If you forget which way this goes, it might be helpful to remember that for the smallest number (6) you touch your thumb to the smallest finger (pinkie).

, The number 10 is signed by shaking an ""A"" hand thumb up (fingers bent in, thumb against the side of the index finger).

, The numbers 11-12 require ""flicking"" your fingers up two times, palm back. So for 11, flick your index finger up, for 12 your index and middle pressed together. For 13, it's more of a ""come here"" gesture with the thumb out and two fingers pressed together again, bending in twice rather than flicking out. Same for 14 (all fingers bend in twice with thumb tucked in), and 15 (all fingers bend in twice with thumb out).

, For 16-19, you twist the base number twice, starting palm back. You twist the wrist as if you were going to turn the sign all the way to face palm out, but it doesn't go all the way, only about 1/2 (so if you're right handed it goes from palm back to palm left twice). 16 is the 6 sign twisted twice, 17 the 7 sign, etc.

, For 20, tap your thumb and index finger together twice, fingertips facing forward, other fingers bent at the knuckle with their tips touching the base of your palm (like pinching something). This looks like the sign for ""G"" opening and closing.

, The sign for 21 almost looks like a gun--palm back, index finger pointing to the side, thumb pinches down twice against the index finger.

, The sign for 22 is a ""2"" with the palm facing down, followed by another two signed a few inches away (towards the right if you're right-handed). The same idea is used for 33, 44, etc.

, The signs for 23 and 25 are similar--palm oriented forward, start from a ""3"" handshape and flick the middle finger down twice (23) or start from a ""5"" shape and flick middle finger down twice (25).

, The signs for 24 and 26-29 are all palm forward, sign that ""gun"" shape with the index finger pointing forward and thumb up, then sign the 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 after it.

, The signs for 30, 40, 50 etc are simply 3-0 (hand in an ""o"" shape), 4-0, etc.

All the numbers in between are formed the same way, palm forward, as digits (4-7, 8-2, etc.) with the exception of double numbers like 33 (see above).






There is one other exception--35 can be signed like 25 except you flick your ring finger down instead of the middle. This is optional, though. 3-5 is also perfectly acceptable.







, Remember that your palm faces out except for the double numbers (33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99) which are signed with the palm down. 30-99 are signed as single digits, so 32 will be signed 3-2, 41 will be 4-1, etc., The sign for 100 is 1-C (think Roman numerals).

Understand that the ""r"" is not a simple sound to learn.,
Know the parts of the mouth involved in producing the ""r"" sound.,
See a speech language pathologist.,
Purse your lips.,
Constrict the pharynx.,
Practice ""car"" daily.,
Strengthen your pharynx.,
Differentiate sounds by watching your face.,
Consider a speech positioning device.",How to Pronounce R's," It is considered one of the hardest English language sounds to articulate, and it is typically the last sound that native English speakers master as children.


Most toddlers begin saying the sound as a ""w"" instead of an ""r,"" as in ""wabbit."" This can continue for several years and usually self-corrects without intervention.
The proper pronunciation of the ""r"" sound before the age of 6 or 7 is typically not a concern. If its not accompanied by other speech problems or by social anxiety, its often best to let it resolve on its own.Age and intelligibility can be a clue as to whether or not a child needs intervention for language skills. If a 3 year old is not intelligible to strangers at all, that can signal a problem; however, a kindergartner who is intelligible but still struggles with the ""r"" is probably in the range of normal. By second grade, a child should be able to pronounce the ""r"" sound.;
, There are three major parts of the mouth that have to constrict and work together to properly produce an ""r"" sound, and these include:


The lips: To understand how the lips function when saying the ""r"" sound, ask someone who can pronounce it properly to say the word ""rabbit."" What does their mouth do when they say the ""r"" part of the word? If they're forming it correctly, their mouth makes a small circle. The rounded lips are the first component of a proper ""r"" pronunciation.The tongue: If you are unable to make the ""r"" sound, you may have no idea what a tongue should be doing while properly pronouncing the ""r."" In fact, the tongue makes a small mound or hump in the mouth, and sound waves travel over that mound to properly execute the sound.The pharynx: The pharynx is another word for the throat, and the part of the pharynx that is associated with the ""r"" sound is at the very top of the throat. In order to make the ""r"" sound, the pharynx has to constrict or tighten.

, If you or your child struggles to produce the ""r"" and the issue does not seem to be resolving itself, intervention from a SLP can help to avoid further speech problems as well as issues with bullying, self-confidence, and even spelling problems that can result from not being able to say the ""r"" sound properly.An SLP will conduct a thorough evaluation of all elements of you or your child's speech, including your muscle control, articulation, eating habits, and receptive skills (that is, how well you or your child understands spoken language).

, Because the lips have to make a rounded, small ""o"" shape to properly execute the ""r,""


This is a very important step in reciting the ""r"" sound, which cannot be executed unless the mouth is in an oval shape.
To assist another person in learning the ""r"" sound, encourage them to look at you as you form it correctly by forming a small ""o"" with your lips., This is a motion that most people do without realizing it, so it can be a bit of a learning curve to recognize where these muscles are and how to move them.


To practice constricting the pharynx, gargle water while saying ""ah."" Your pharynx will constrict in the same place that it must constrict to say the ""r"" sound.
Another way to learn how to constrict the pharynx involves gently biting both edges of the tongue with the molars, and pressing up with the tongue onto the top molars. Say ""eee"" while doing this motion with the tongue; this is what it feels like when the pharynx constricts., Words that end in ""r"" are easier to produce than words that begin with it or contain it in the middle, so start with a word like ""car.""


Practice it every day, even if you are not getting the sound correctly. If you have a friend or partner who can help you daily, ask them to say the word to you and you say it back to them as you watch in a mirror, so you can watch their sound production and compare it to your own.

, If you are struggling to constrict your pharynx to properly say the ""r"" sound, you may have a weak pharynx that needs exercise!


One way to strengthen it is to gargle water every day. Try to articulate the sound ""ah"" while you gargle the water in the back of your throat; this is a similar motion to what you need to do when you are saying the ""r"" sound., If you are struggling to differentiate between the ""r"" and similar sounds (""l"" is a frequent culprit), you need to enlist a buddy who can model the sounds while you watch in a mirror.


Watch your friend's face as he properly executes the different sounds, then watch your own face as you attempt to execute the sounds. Look to see how your lips' position moves with each sound.

, Since the tongue is behind the barrier of the teeth and can't be seen while trying to properly position it, some severe cases that involve incorrect positioning of the tongue may require the use of a tactile cue to help a person learn how the tongue must move to produce the correct sound.


A speech language pathologist can help you to determine if a positioning device is right for you. Examples of these positioning devices are available from the Speech Buddy manufacturer at www.speechbuddy.com.

Each letter has its own unique sign. You can sign using your dominant hand. Learning the alphabet will allow you to introduce yourself to a deaf person when you first meet them.Study the sign for each letter online at StartAmericanSignLanguage.com.
Some letters are trickier to learn than others. It helps if you run through the alphabet several times to the song of “A,B,C” to remember each sign. To sign the letter “J”, for example, you would make the handshape for the letter “I” with your pinky finger and then trace a “J” in the air using your pinky finger.
To make the letter “Z”, you would form the number 1 handshape, using your pointer finger. Then, you would trace the letter “Z” into the air.
Make sure you also note the different placements for your fingers for certain letters, as one letter may be different based on the placement of one finger. For example, the letter “M” is signed by placing your thumb under your first three fingers. The letter “N” is signed by placing your thumb under your first two fingers. The letter “T” is signed by placing your thumb under one finger.;
, You should also study the numbers from 1-10 in sign language so you can learn how to use them in casual conversation. You may decide to expand your knowledge to the numbers from 1-100, though it may be easier to start with memorizing the signs for 1-10 first. You can find the sign for the numbers at Lifeprint.com., Once you learn the alphabet in sign language, you can practice signing basic words by spelling them out. You may choose familiar words like your name or the name of your family members. Practice signing these words in a mirror so you can ensure you are forming each letter correctly with your hands.You may also try to spell out basic words like “dog”, “cat”, “man” and “woman.” Break down each word by letter, such as D-O-G for “dog” and sign out each letter. You should practice each word several times until you feel confident signing word using the sign language alphabet.
You may also try to sign out a short phrase that contains each letter in the English alphabet, such as the phrase “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” This way, you can get used to signing out each letter of the alphabet in a sentence.

, You can also learn how to sign for members of a family, such as “mom”, “dad”, “brother”, and “sister”. You can then use these signs to describe someone in your family.The sign for “mom” is placing the thumb of your dominant hand against your chin with your hand open in a “5” shape.
The sign for “dad” is placing the thumb of your dominant hand against your forehead with your hand open in a “5” shape.
The sign for “brother” is making an L-shape with your thumb and forefinger. Move the L-shape hand from your forehead and turn the L-shape into a “1-hand” with your forefinger pointing vertical. Let the “1-hand” make contact with your other hand, which should also be in a 1-handshape, with your forefinger pointing vertical.
The sign for “sister” is making an L-shape with your thumb and forefinger. Move the L-shape hand from your jaw and turn the L-shape into a “1-hand” with your forefinger pointing vertical. Let the “1-hand” make contact with your other hand, which should also be in a 1-handshape, with your forefinger pointing vertical.

,
The sign for “hello” is placing your hand to your forehead with your palm facing downward and then raising it away from your forehead. This sign is similar to making a “salute” gesture.The sign for “please” is placing your hand flat against the center of your chest and moving it clockwise in a circular motion three times.The sign for “thank you” is made by placing the fingers of your hand to your lips, keeping your hand flat. Then, move your hand forward and down in the direction of the person you are thanking with a smile on your face."

Some tips for good form.",How to Fingerspell the Alphabet in American Sign Language2,"


Keep your hand in one place.
Pause noticeably between individual words.
Avoid long nails or excessive jewelry, as it can be distracting to someone reading your hands.
When finger-spelling an acronym, move each letter in a small circle to let the reader know that they should not be read together as one word.
Don't bounce your hand between letters, unless there are two letters, in which case the bounce indicates the repetition of the signed letter (dragging the letter slightly to the side can also indicate repetition). Bouncing between every individual letter can make your finger-spelling difficult to understand. To prevent this from happening, hold your wrist with your free hand to prevent it from moving up and down when you practice. After a while, you'll get used to keeping your hand still without thinking about it.
Face your palm forward, except when you're signing the letters ""G"", ""H"" ""C"" and ""O""(in which case the palm should face sideways).
Keep your finger-spelling hand at shoulder height.
Keep a consistent pace. Don't try to rush through finger-spelling. The more important thing is to sign each letter at a consistent rhythm (but without bouncing!) so that the reader can easily distinguish a pause. It's better to go slow and steady than to rush and suddenly pause when you can't remember a sign--the reader may misinterpret this as the beginning of a new word.

Understand how phrases are composed.,
Practice greeting someone.,
Learn how to praise someone.",How to Use Sign Language2," In sign language, the ordering of words is different than in written or spoken English. To form phrases in sign language, you will need to get used to the different ordering of words in sign language and remember to use this order when you are signing.For example, the question “What is your name?” would be ordered “Your name what?” in sign language. “Are you deaf?” would be signed as “Deaf you?” and “Who is she?” would be signed “She who?” or “Who she?”
This different ordering is often done to reduce the number of signs that must be performed in a conversation and to make it easier to move the conversation along using a minimal amount of signs.

, You can start to learn how to put short sentences together in sign language so you can have a casual conversation with a deaf or hard of hearing person. Begin with a simple conversation, such as greeting someone and asking them their name.For example, you may say, “Hello” by placing your hand to your forehead with your palm facing downward and then raising it away from your forehead.
Then, you may ask, “Your name what?” by pointing at the person with your forefinger and middle finger stacked on top of each other, followed by the sign for “name”, which is crossing your forefinger and middle finger over your other forefinger and middle finger to form a flat “X” shape, tapping them twice over each other.
You can then say “Nice to meet you” by placing your palms flat over each other and sweeping your top palm over your bottom palm once to sign “nice”. Then, hold both pointer fingers on each hand so they are horizontal and move them together until there is an inch of space between them for “meet you”.

, You can also learn how to tell someone you think they are great or that you love them. Learning how to praise someone can allow you to get better at casual conversations in sign language and communicate your feelings in sign language.


For example, you can say “I love you” by using your dominant hand to form the letter “I” with your pinky finger horizontal. Then, form the letter “L” by holding your forefinger and thumb up. Finally, form the letter “U” by holding your pinky finger and thumb up.You can also learn how to say “You are great” by first using your forefinger on your dominant hand to point to the person. Then, you can say “great or awesome” by holding both hands up at the height of your head with your palms facing away from you. Push your hands out towards the person two times and then close your hands and lower them."

Confirm the deaf person uses sign language.,
Position your body and hands to face the person.,
Sign at a normal speed.,
Do not mouth the words as you sign.",How to Use Sign Language3," It is important to keep in mind not all deaf people use sign language. Some deaf people or individuals who are hard of hearing may use lip reading and visual cues to get by in a conversation. Before you start launching into a conversation in sign language, you may start with a simple ""Hello"" in American Sign Language. If the person responds in kind, you have the all clear to continue the conversation in sign language.Keep in mind some deaf people also will use a different form of sign language depending on their native tongue, such as British Sign Language (BSL). Some deaf people may also use Pidgin Signed English (PSE), which is a hybrid version of sign language. You should allow the person to signal to you which type of sign language they use so you do not make any assumptions when you try to communicate with them., When you use sign language, you should make sure you position your body facing the person, with your head up. Keep your hands at your sides until you are ready to sign.You should also make sure the person can see your hands and your face as you sign. This will ensure they are able to understand you and you are able to understand them.

, Try to sign at a speed that feels normal and comfortable for you. Do not try to exaggerate your handshapes or move them too quickly, especially if you want to have a relaxed, casual conversation with the person.You should try to always sign from the point of view of your viewer. For example, when you are saying ""please"", you should move your hand in a clockwise motion over your chest from the observer's point of view. This means you actually move your hand in a counter-clockwise motion, moving from the left, down and then to the right. This will ensure the movement appears clockwise to the person you are signing with.

, Some people in the deaf community are comfortable with reading lips and will be okay with you mouthing the words you are signing. But you should try to avoid speaking at all to a deaf person, as it can be considered rude. Instead, opt for only using signing and do not speak or mouth your words as you sign.If the person is comfortable with lip reading, they may indicate they are okay with you mouthing the words. You may then start to mouth your words as you sign.

"
"
Take a sign language class.,
Join a local signing club.,
Practice with a friend who is deaf.",How to Use Sign Language4," You can improve your sign language abilities by taking a sign language class taught by a professional sign language interpreter. You may look for sign language classes at your school or university. You may also take a sign language class at your local community center.You should opt for the beginner's sign language class, as this will allow you to expand your existing sign language skills and learn more of the basics. You could then pursue a more advanced class once you become proficient in the basics of signing.

, You may check your local community board or the community newsletter for information on a local signing club in your area. Often, local colleges or communities will have deaf clubs where people gather to practice signing. You could join the club and meet other signers who you can practice your sign language with.The members of the signing club may use songs and visual aids to practice their signing. Signing along to a song can help you remember certain terms and phrases.

, If you know of someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, you may try practicing your sign language with them. Ask them to be patient with you and work with them to get better at your sign language.You may opt to work with the person on a specific aspect of signing your struggle with, such as how to string phrases together or how to sign certain terms. You may also try to improve your conversational skills by trying to have a longer conversation about your day or your favorite subject with the person using sign language.

The first word in the name of the city that is the financial capital of Brazil is ""São"" and means ""Saint"".,
The second word is ""Paulo"", which in combination with the word ""São"" refers to Saint Paul, after whom the city is named.,
The Brazilians pronounce the name of this city as if it were one word, all together.

",How to Pronounce Sao Paulo," The -ão is pronounced almost like the -ow in ""sow"" (as in an adult female pig, especially one that has farrowed), but notice that because of the tilde over the ""ã"" the sound is nasal. This means that while you pronounce the vowels, the air should come out partly from your nose.;
, It is pronounced ""POW-lo"".

Pronounce ""Uranus"" the way that physicists and astronomers do.,
Listen to documentaries and lectures about the planet Uranus.,
Understand why the ""Yurr-AY-nus"" pronunciation of ""Uranus"" is sometimes considered vulgar.,
Understand the etymology of the name.",How to Pronounce Uranus," If you'd like to be taken seriously, this is the way to go. There are several acceptable pronunciations.


Say ""Yurr-en-us"", ""Yurr-ann-us"", ""You-ren-us"", or ""You-ran-us"".Say ""Yurr-in-us"", but be aware that some people may hear this as ""Urine us""--less overtly vulgar than ""Your anus"", to be sure, but still perhaps not the best choice if you want to be taken seriously.
Say each of these pronunciations aloud and decide which you like best. Practice pronouncing the name in your head when you read it, and practice pronouncing the name in conversation. Over time, your chosen pronunciation will become second-nature to you.;
, Take your cues from famous physicists and lecturers, and you will be sure to get the pronunciation right:


Bill Nye the Science Guy
Carl Sagan
Richard Feynman
Neil DeGrasse Tyson
Patrick Stewart

,


Break the word into three syllables: ""Ur"", ""An"", and ""Us"". Many people pronounce the ""A"" as ""ay"" or ""ey (a long ""A"") and re-distribute the syllables as ""Ur"", ""A"", and ""Nus"". This makes the word sound uncannily like ""Your anus""--which may be humorous to some people, and offensive to others.The ""Yurr-AY-nus"" pronunciation may seem especially apt because Uranus is a gas giant, swirling with high concentrations of toxic methane.

, ""Uranus"" or ""Ouranos"" is the ancient Greek name for the primal sky god, the personification of the sky itself, who was said to be the ancestor of the Greek gods.


Most of the planets in our solar system are named after ancient gods, but most of these names are Roman names: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto. Uranus is the only Greek name.
Uranus was named thus by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode. He argued that the Roman god Saturn (equivalent to the Greek titan Cronos) was said to be the father of Jupiter (equivalent to the Greek god Zeus), and the planet Saturn was further from the sun than the planet Jupiter, so the next-furthest planet from the sun should be named for the father of Saturn: Uranus.It is also acceptable to use the Greek name when referring to the planet. Say ""Or-ann-os"" or ""Or-ah-nos"".

Break the word “nuclear” into three syllables.",How to Pronounce Nuclear1," That will help you master the pronunciation. It’s the pronunciation of the second syllable that is in dispute.


The most widely accepted correct pronunciation of the word is “NEW-clee-er.” In this case (somewhat unusually), the word is spelled exactly how you are supposed to say it. Put the pronunciation on the first syllable. The ""er"" is pronounced like the ""u"" in the word ""fur.""
The pronunciation “NEW-clee-er” is widely regarded by experts as the “correct” pronunciation, even though another variant has been used so much by prominent people that, to some, it’s become another acceptable usage.;

Look at the letters to determine the origin of the place name.,
Realize that Welsh is a phonetic language.,
Consider the vowels.,
Get your consonant pronunciation right.,
Think phonetically.,
Remember that there are no silent letters.,
Stress the correct syllables.",How to Pronounce Welsh Place Names," Many places in Wales have an English and a Welsh name. First of all you must establish whether you're looking at English or Welsh.


There is no J, K, Q, V, X or Z in the Welsh language; therefore, if the place-name contains any of these letters then it's pronounced as an English word. For example Wrexham has an X, therefore you're looking at the English name. Abergavenny has a V in it, so again it's the English name.
The only double letters in the Welsh language are DD, FF, LL, NN and RR, so if you see any double letters other than these, for example Welshpool has a double OO in it, therefore it's the English name.;
, Each letter has only one pronunciation apart from the letter Y which has two pronunciations. Even then the rule is very strict.


There are no silent letters in Welsh. Each letter must be pronounced.

, W and Y are vowels. So there are seven vowels:- A, E, I, O, U, W and Y.



W is not called ""double-you"". It's ALWAYS pronounced oo. For example, Llanrwst is pronounced tlan-ROOST


Y is not called ""Wye"". It's called UH. Y is pronounced uh as if someone has punched you in the abdomen, except in the last syllable of a word, where it's pronounced ee.

U is not called ""you"". It's like the French U. Purse your lips, then say ee.

, Keep the following rules in mind:



F is always pronounced as v. It's a common mistake to pronounce it like an English F - avoid that!
However; double FF is pronounced as in English.

DD is pronounced as th in ""the"", ""this"" or that"".

CH is pronounced as in the Scottish ""Loch"" or the composer ""Bach"".

LL is a sound which does not exist in English. It's an L that isn't voiced. Just blow instead. The nearest sound in English is TL. If you want to pronounce it correctly, put your tongue behind your teeth as if you're going to say L and just blow. (If you think this is difficult, consider that some Welsh people can't pronounce Z.)

C is always pronounced as k, never as an s. There is no K or Q in Welsh. These sounds are represented by the letter C and there is no X. It's represented by CS.

G is always pronounced as G in golf, never as in George.
And don't forget to roll your Rs.

, Imagine if they spoke Welsh in England instead of English; Leicester would be spelled LESTER; Brighton would be BRAITON; Carlisle would be CARLAIL; Newcastle would be NIWCASL, and so on.


If your mother tongue is English or French you will have probably developed the habit, or even been taught to pronounce groups of letters together. This is not done in Welsh. If you see two vowels together, pronounce them separately but just run them together a little. Coed (meaning woods) is pronounced ko'ed, Caer (meaning fort) is pronounced ka'er. Heol, (meaning a road in south Wales) is pronounced he'ol.

, If you see an E, even at the end of a word, it must be pronounced. Pontardawe has three vowels together at the end (yes; W is a vowel in Welsh). Each vowel must be pronounced, so it's pon-tar-DAH-weh.

, In Welsh, the stress is normally on the penultimate syllable of a word, but there are exceptions.

Say ""Ne-VA-duh"".That is the correct way to pronounce the state name.,
Don't say “Ne-VAH-duh.” Some people pronounce the second syllable with an ""AH"" sound like the ""a"" sound in the colloquial words ma or pa.,
Learn to say the name right, especially if you go into politics.",How to Pronounce Nevada," Put emphasis on the second syllable. Pronounce it so that the middle part rhymes with the “AD” sound in the words sad or mad. Look to the word Nebraska as an ""all vowels sound similar to"" example.Break the state name into syllables. There are three distinct syllables in the word Nevada. Thinking of the word as having three parts will help you pronounce it correctly.
The “e” in the “ne” should be pronounced as you would the “e” in the words pet or met. The “a” at the end of the state’s name is pronounced the same as the “u” in the word up.;
, However, this is not the correct pronunciation and not how locals say it.


When one politician in Las Vegas wanted to use legislation to allow the name to be pronounced both ways, most locals didn’t like it and it was rejected. That ex-legislator argued that “Ne-VAH-da” is a Spanish pronunciation and should be allowed since so many non-locals use it. The Spanish word Nevada means “snowfall” or “covered in snow” and refers to the Sierra Madre mountains.
However, the fact remains that people who are actually from Nevada do not use the “AH” middle syllable pronunciation. For 150 years, the ""AD"" pronunciation has been widely regarded as the authentic one.The common, mostly Eastern and Southern, mispronunciation of Nevada in English also happens to be incorrect in Spanish.
Note that there are seven American states with names derived from Spanish and yet none of them are pronounced the same way in English.

, Politicians can run into trouble with locals if they don’t pronounce the name with the “AD” middle sound.


The state’s governor sent one politician a text advising him to say Ne-VADD-ah.Other politicians have been booed for saying the name incorrectly.
Everyone else can expect to be simply corrected if they use the wrong pronunciation in front of someone who actually lives in ""Ne-VA-da.""

"
Realize there is another variant of the word.,
Decide whether you want to say the word this way.",How to Pronounce Nuclear2," Some people, including some very prominent people, incorrectly say “nuke-you-lerr” or “Nu-cu-lar.”The mispronunciation of nuclear is so common that it’s found its way into popular culture. In the 1989 Woody Allen film “Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" Mia Farrow’s character says she would not fall in love with a man who pronounced the word “nucular."" Another version of this is “NOO-kyuh-lur.”President George W. Bush, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Bill Clinton have pronounced the word this way in the past. President Jimmy Carter said “newkeeuh.”Homer Simpson still says “nucular.”

, American dictionaries now recognize “NOO-kyuh-luhr” as an accepted variant of the word. That’s not the end of the story, though.


When a usage panel was convened by Harper Dictionary, members rejected this pronunciation 99 to 1. People might be confusing the word with words like “circular” and “secular.” At least one book attempted to argue the presidential versions were actually correct and that weapons labs since WW2 used the “nucular” pronunciation. It’s not a settled issue, though, so if you want to be safe, say, “NEW-clee-er.”"
"
Use the right regional pronunciation.",How to Pronounce Nuclear3," The word “nuclear” is pronounced differently in different English-speaking regions of the world.""


In the United States, the word is pronounced “NEW-klee-er” with the emphasis on the first syllable.
However, in the United Kingdom, the word is pronounced “New-KLEE-ah” with the emphasis on the second syllable. The “r” sound at the end of the word is not as pronounced as it is in American English."

Say ""meem,"" with a long e sound.,
Learn the mnemonic for remembering the correct pronunciation.,
Avoid the most common pronunciation mistakes.,
Learn the word's etymology to understand why it's pronounced this way.",How to Pronounce Meme," As noted above, the word ""meme"" is pronounced so that it rhymes with ""team"" or ""beam."" To pronounce the word, make an ""m"" sound, then make a long ""e"" sound, then finish with another ""m"" sound. That's all there is to it!


The two keys to pronouncing ""meme"" correctly are:
Use only one syllable.
Always use the long e sound, never the short e sound or an a sound.;
, Have you pronounced ""meme"" incorrectly for so long that it's become tricky for you to remember the right way to say it? Don't worry — with an easy mnemonic (a learning trick), it's simple to remember the correct pronunciation. See below:


Start with the spelling of the word: ""Meme.""
Re-arrange the last two letters to get ""Meem.""
Sound out ""meem"" as written to get the proper pronunciation.

, Now that you know how you should say ""meme,"" it's valuable to learn how not to say it so that you instruct others in the proper pronunciation. In general, you should not pronounce ""meme"" so that it has two syllables and you should not pronounce ""meme"" with any vowel sound other than the long ""e"" sound. This means:


Don't say ""maymay,"" ""meemee,"" or ""meemuh.""
Don't say ""maim"" or ""mehm.""

, If ""meme"" strikes you as a word that's somewhat unnatural, you're right. The word was actually created in the mid-1970s by famous author and researcher Richard Dawkins (who, additionally, verified that it should be pronounced to rhyme with ""cream."")In Dawkins' book The Selfish Gene, he introduces the idea of ""memes"" as essentially genes in information form. Just like a particular set of genes replicates itself through reproduction, a meme propagates itself whenever a new person encounters the idea, accepts it, and starts to share it with others.Since Dawkins based the idea of the ""meme"" off of biological genes, he deliberately chose a word that was pronounced similarly to ""gene.""


Think of your favorite online memes — probably mostly comics, funny pictures, and so on. Isn't the way that this content spreads from user to user ""virally"" via social media and sharing a little bit like the way biological genes are spread? Doesn't it make sense that they'd be compared in this way and that ""meme"" would have a similar-sounding name to ""gene?""

Break the word “Chicago” into syllables.,
Use the ""aw"" pronunciation.,
Use the ""ah"" pronunciation.,
Determine what's appropriate for the environment.,
Study the history of the word.,
Listen to pronunciation videos or audio online.",How to Pronounce Chicago," This becomes ""chi-ca-go” and will help you master the pronunciation. The first syllable is the least controversial. There is not much debate over how to pronounce it.


Pronounce the “Chi” as “Shi.” In other words, the “Ch” is not the “ch” sound in English words like “cheese” or “chips.” The ""i"" is pronounced as the ""i"" in ""it.""
Rather, the “Ch” in Chicago is pronounced like the “sh” in the words “shut” and “shirt.” The stronger emphasis should be on the middle syllable of the word though.;
, Some native Chicagoans insist the second syllable should be pronounced as an “aw.” As in “Shic-aw-go.”George Wendt, in the iconic Saturday Night Live skit on Chicago super fans, pronounced it “Shic-aw-go.” He is from Chicago.
Former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley is another notable local who pronounces it as “aw.” The ""go"" at the end of the word is always pronounced the same as the word ""go."", Other native Chicagoans insist that they say the middle syllable as “ah” and that this pronunciation is also correct.


Sometimes this becomes “Shic-aaaaahhhh-go” and sometimes it’s said as “Shic-ah-go.” You will often find the “ah” version on dictionary and pronunciation sites online..

, Although either pronunciation is technically authentic, if you want to sound more “modern” or “high-brow,” some people think you should go with the “ah.”


For example, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel uses the “ah” pronunciation.There is some evidence that the most distinct Chicago accents come from older generations and that the accent is disappearing in the young. African-American and Latino Chicagoans may also add their own pronunciation to words.If, however, you are an actor who is trying to play a Chicago character from the past or trying to capture a distinctly local neighborhood feel, the “aw” might be the better way to go. Traditional Chicagoans elongate the “a” vowel in all of their words, not just “Chicago.” For example, they may say basketball as “beasketball.”So, to summarize, both ""Shic-aw-go"" and ""Shic-ah-go"" are considered authentic pronunciations.

, The word “Chicago’s” pronunciation (especially its first syllable) makes more sense when you realize its etymology (history).


The word derives from the Native American Algonquian language. It was first seen, though, on a map created by French explorers in the 17th century. The soft “ch” sound is likely also attributed to the French language influence on the word.The Indian word “Checagow” meant “place of the smelly onions” and was a reference to an onion field. French explorers wrote it down as they heard it, changing the spelling. Others think it was a reference to the Chacaqua River.

, Sometimes the best way to learn how to pronounce any word is to watch a video of it online. However, be aware when it comes to this word that the sites tend to favor the “ah” pronunciation.


You Tube is filled with such videos, where you can hear native speakers pronounce the word “Chicago.”Record yourself saying the word for comparative purposes, and listen to the audio side-by-side. This should help you improve the pronunciation.

The ""ges"" in Limoges is not pronounced like the words ""guess"" or ""gaze."" In fact, it is not even pronounced as a syllable.






The ""s"" at the end of Limoges is silent.






The remaining ""ge"" is pronounced as a consonant that sounds like saying the letters ""z"" and ""h"" together. This makes it sound very similar to an ""sh"" like in the word ""shush"" and ""shoe"" except you start with a ""z"" and then change it into an ""h"" as you say it. Hence, ""ges"" turns into the phonetic consonant ""zh.""

Learn the 44 sounds of the English language.,
Recognize how your native language differs from RP English.,
Identify key characteristics.",How to Learn Received Pronunciation1," While there are 26 letters in written English, spoken English incorporates 44 distinct sounds. Learn the characters that represent each of these sounds. Then you will be able to write words phonetically, and study dictionaries that use these characters to “write out” the pronunciation of each word.RP English is the accent upon which phonemic transcriptions (the characters representing sounds) are based, so you’ll be at an advantage learning RP English over another form of spoken English – the characters will “spell out” the pronunciation of words in the way you’re trying to learn them.;
, Identify sounds or stress and intonation patterns that differ between your native language and RP English. Understanding these differences will show you which elements of RP you most need to work on. Learning some words will be a simple matter of adding vocabulary, while in other cases you’ll have to re-learn how to pronounce a specific sound, letter, or syllable., While much can be said about RP English, its most distinctive characteristics are clipped consonants and elongated vowels. The clipped consonants, in particular, are what give it the nickname “cut-glass.” Recognizing these basic traits will help you quickly distinguish RP English from regional accents or the increasingly prominent “Estuary English” once associated with southeastern Britain’s working class."

Listen to RP English.,
Use long vowels.,
Purse your lips, open your throat, and drop your jaw.,
Enunciate clearly.,
Pay careful attention to intonation.,
Heed stress marks.,
Record yourself speaking RP English.,
Practice often.",How to Learn Received Pronunciation2," The more you hear English spoken in this accent, the more natural it will feel to reproduce it.The BBC World Service has useful resources for RP English learners.While RP English is no longer the “standard” it once was, listening to recent speeches by the Queen or to BBC news broadcasts may offer useful examples. Try looking for RP English in:


British society dramas such as “Downton Abbey” (the “upstairs” characters).
Speeches by members of the royal family; the Duchess of Cambridge is especially noted for her “cut-glass” accent.
Historical broadcasts (recognize, however, that these may use archaic terms).

, Words such as “bath,” “grass,” and “dance” that are pronounced using a short “a” sound in American English and many other English accents are pronounced using long “ahhs” in RP. “Bath,” then, will rhyme with “father,” and “dance” with “palm” – “a” in each case is pronounced “ahh.”, You’ll produce those long “ahhs” and many other sounds common to RP English by moving your jaw down rather than opening your mouth sideways. Generally speaking, the less lip movement, the better., Enunciation is just as important to accent as pronunciation, and RP English speakers are sticklers for enunciating consonants. Most English speakers omit one or more consonants in many words – “February,” for example, becomes “Feb-u-ar-y.” For an RP English speaker, it’s “Feb-ru-ar-y.” When in doubt, precisely articulate each consonant.Make space around your “r”s. Most English speakers roll words ending in “r” into the next word” – i.e. “Mother and daughter.” RP English speakers fully articulate the “r” so the sound at the beginning of the next word stands alone – “Mother and daughter.”Words ending in “y” are pronounced with an “eh” instead of an “ee.” Many English speakers would pronounce “finally” as “final-ee.” An RP English speaker would say “final-eh,” closing his or her mouth at the end of the word., Watch where RP English speakers’ voices rise and fall. One of the most common signs of a non-native language speaker is a failure to intone words correctly. Learning this skill will significantly improve the quality of your accent., Review phonetic spellings in the dictionary and note where accent marks are placed. Stress these syllables when speaking the word. Much like intonation, this will significantly improve the authenticity of your accent., Hearing yourself speaking will help you determine where your accent needs work – and where you’re doing really well!

, If you want RP English to become natural, expect to spend many hours perfecting your accent. Take advantage of brief openings in your day to get in a few minutes of practice.Consider downloading an app for your phone that will provide you with games, quizzes, and brief practice sessions to utilize on your daily commute or while waiting in line.

In addition to engaging in conversation, you and your partner can spend time critiquing each other’s accents. An extra pair of ears will help you recognize where your accent needs work and provide encouragement as your RP English improves., Your local community organization or university may offer conversation groups for English language learners. There are few substitutes for actually using language skills. Regular conversation with a variety of speakers will accustom you to hearing RP English spoken in different voices. Interacting with others keeps you on your toes and helps you apply your new accent in real-world situations.

, Many online English language-learning resources offer opportunities to interact with RP English speakers. Some of these resources are free, while others require a subscription.

Break down the name into syllables.,

Shift to the third syllable of the name, which is “-o-.” This next syllable is not pronounced quite the way it is written.,

The first three syllables (i.e.,
Put all four syllables together and practice saying the name in its entirety: “Her-my-uh-nee.” This pronunciation has been verified as the traditional Greek way of pronouncing the name.",How to Pronounce Hermione," The correct pronunciation of “Hermione” has four syllables, so in order to pronounce it correctly, you need to break the whole name down into those syllables.


Write or type the name on a piece of paper; then use your index fingers or additional small pieces of paper to cover up parts of the name.;
, The first syllable is “Her-,” which is at the beginning of the name “Hermione.”


This first syllable is simply pronounced “her,” as in “him or her.”
Cover up the rest of her name (i.e. “-mione”) with your index finger or a small piece of paper so that you focus only on this first syllable.

, After you practice pronouncing “Her-,” cover up that syllable with an index fingers or piece of paper and move onto the next syllable, which is “-mi-.”


Pronounce the second syllable in the same way that you say “my,” as in “my book.” This is one of the two syllables that confuse people the most in pronouncing her name, because some people want to pronounce it as “me.”
The emphasis of the name should fall on this syllable (i.e. “Her-MY-”).

,


The third syllable is pronounced “uh,” as if you paused in the middle of a sentence.
At this point, you should cover up the first two syllables (i.e. “Her-mi-”) and the last syllable (i.e. “-ne”).

, “Her-mi-o-”) of the name should be covered up at this point.

Examine the name.,
Consider the origin.,
Take into account accent marks and other diacritics.,
Look for diacritics indicating tone.",How to Pronounce Names1," If you've seen it but not heard it, oftentimes just sounding it out in your head first can help a lot with your pronunciation. Work with each syllable in turn. Unless it's Welsh.


Think about other words you already know that look similar to the name. For example, the letters q-u-i in French sound like the word key in English. So just as the word ""quiche"" is pronounced keysh, the name ""Quitterie"" would be pronounced key-tree.
Sometimes city names can get your mind going. Think of ones like San Jose, Guadalajara, Lille, Versailles, and Guangzhou.;
, Does it look French? Spanish? Chinese? Know that every language has a unique alphabet and set of sounds associated with it, so any prior knowledge of languages will assist you in your pronunciation.


Spanish has a very consistent alphabet, unlike English. The vowels are always pronounced ""ah,"" ""eh,"" ""ee,"" ""oh,"" and ""oo.""
French has a fairly consistent alphabet as well, but it's a bit more tricky. If the name ends in a consonant, don't pronounce it. ""Robert"" becomes row-bear. And a name like Michelle? It's mee-shell, not meh-shell.
Mandarin Chinese is trickier still. The ""Q"" is pronounced ch, ""X"" is pronounced sh, and ""Z"" is pronounced dr. ""Xiaojin Zhu"" is shiao-jin drew.
If you're a bit confused about ""ei"" and ""ie"" in German, opt for the second letter's name. ""Steinbeck"" has a vowel like ""I""--the second letter. ""Auf Wiedersehen"" has a vowel like ""E""--the second letter.

, They can significantly change the way a name is pronounced.


In Spanish, you want to put the most emphasis on the syllable that has the accent; e.g., María should be pronounced ma-REE-uh.
Unfortunately, French doesn't follow the same rules. The sounds ""è"" and ""é"" are two different sounds. Though they are very similar, they are similar to eh (the sound in red) and ay, respectively. Examples of this include Renée (ruh-nay), André (on-dray), Honoré (ah-nor-ay), and Helène (heh-lehne).
The most frequent character used with a cedilla is the ""ç""; the cedilla makes it soft (ss, not kuh).

, Though this requires a familiarity with the language, some tones are quite logical.


A mark going down (`) generally indicates a falling tone; a mark going up, rising.
A mark going up and down (or down and up) is just that--your tone should follow.

Learn about the identity matrix, I.,
Finally, learn how to take the inverse of a matrix.",How to Understand the Basics of Matrices," A matrix is a collection of numbers, called elements, arranged in a rectangle or a square. The numbers do not have to be positive, and they can be decimals or even complex numbers. A square matrix is, as the name suggests, a matrix that is square in shape, with the same number of columns and rows. In algebra, a matrix is usually represented by a capital letter in bold or underlined. The numbers in a matrix are surrounded by square (or curved, sometimes, but not curly) brackets.
, The dimension of matrix A, dim(A), is how many rows and columns it has. dim(A) = m x n represents a matrix with m rows and n columns., To multiply a matrix by a scalar, multiply all of the elements by the scalar., Simply add or subtract the relevant elements. The matrices must have the same dimensions if you are to add or subtract them. In other words, A+B and A-B exist if and only if dim(A) = dim(B).,
The resultant matrix has dimensions dim(C) = m x p, so it isn't the same size as the starting matrices (unless you are multiplying square matrices).
If AxB is possible, BxA is only possible if m = p
However, in common with scalar multiplication, Ax(BxC) = (AxB)xC, and Ax(B+C) = AxB + AxC


, This can be a bit tricky until you get the hang of it. For AxB:

Draw the matrices into a grid, like the one on the left of the photo. A goes on the left and B goes on top.
For each element in the resultant matrix, consider the column and row that it is in.
Multiply the first element in the row by the first element in the column. Do this for the second elements, and the third, and so on.
Add up the products of the elements. This is the value of the element in the resultant matrix.
Do this for each element in the resultant matrix.

, The minor of an element of a matrix is the determinant of the matrix that is left when you erase the row and column containing that element., This is a value that is used in calculating the inverse of a matrix. It is usually written as det(A) or |A|. If you see a matrix with lines instead of square brackets, it means the determinant of that matrix. The determinant only exists for square matrices. For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is simply ad-bc. For a 3x3 matrix, it's a bit trickier: a x minor(a) - b x minor(b) + c x minor(c), A cofactor of an element is related to the minor of that element. You need to know the position of the element in the matrix. Say the element is in the first row and second column. It's position is 1,2. For an element at position i,j, calculate (-1)(i+j). The cofactor is the minor multiplied by this value., The transpose of a matrix, AT, is the matrix that you get when you flip A around it's diagonal axis. Rows become columns and columns become rows., This is a matrix with 1's along the diagonal axis, and zeroes elsewhere. It results in a couple of places:


AxI = IxA = A


AxA-1 = I


, The inverse of a matrix, A-1, reverses the effect of the matrix A. Multiplying the two together cancels them out, leaving the identity matrix. To take the inverse:

Calculate |A|
Calculate the cofactor of every element in the matrix.
Replace every element in the matrix with it's cofactor. This is matrix C.

A-1 = CT/|A|

Define slope.,
Visualize a line’s “rise over run.” The term “rise” refers to the vertical distance between two points, or the change in y{\displaystyle y}.,
Locate the slope of a line in an equation.,
Assess the steepness of the line.,
Identify a positive slope.,
Identify a negative slope.,
Understand the slope of a horizontal line.,
Understand the slope of a vertical line.",How to Understand Slope (in Algebra)1," The slope is a measure of how steep a straight line is.A variety of branches of mathematics use slope. In geometry, you can use the slope to plot points on a line, including lines that define the shape of a polygon. Statisticians use slope to describe the correlation between two variables.Economists use slope to show and predict rates of change.People also use slope in real, concrete ways. For example, slope is used when constructing roads, stairs, ramps, and roofs.;
, The term “run” refers to the horizontal distance between two points, or the change in x{\displaystyle x}. When learning about the slope of a line, you will often see the formula slope=riserun{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {\text{rise}}{\text{run}}}}For example a slope of a line might be 21{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{1}}}. This means that to go from one point to the next, you need to go up 2 along the y-axis, and over 1 along the x-axis.


, You can do this using the slope-intercept form of a line’s equation. The slope-intercept form says that y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}. In this formula, m{\displaystyle m} equals the slope of the line. You can rearrange the equation of a line into this formula to find the slope.For example, in the equation y=3x+1{\displaystyle y=3x+1}, the slope would be 3{\displaystyle 3}. You can still think of this slope in terms of rise over run if you turn it into a fraction. Any whole number can be turned into a fraction by placing it over 1. So, 3=31{\displaystyle 3={\frac {3}{1}}}. This means that the line represented by this equation rises 3 units vertically for every 1 unit it runs horizontally.  


, The larger the slope, the steeper the line. A line is steeper the more vertical it rests on a coordinate plane.For example, a slope of 2 (that is, 21{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{1}}}) is steeper than a slope of 0.5 (12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}).


, A positive slope is one that moves up and to the right. In other words, in a positive slope, as x{\displaystyle x} increases, y{\displaystyle y} also increases. 

A positive slope is denoted by a positive number. 


, A negative slope is one that moves down and to the right. In other words, in a negative slope, as x{\displaystyle x} increases, y{\displaystyle y} decreases.

A negative slope is denoted by a negative number, or a fraction with a negative numerator.

To help remember the difference between a positive and negative slope, you can think of yourself as standing on the left endpoint of the line. If you need to walk up the line, it’s positive. If you need to walk down the line, it’s negative.Knowing the difference between negative and positive slopes can help you check that your calculations are reasonable.


, A horizontal line is a line that runs straight across a coordinate plane. The slope of a horizontal line is 0. This makes sense if you think of lines in terms of slope=riserun{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {\text{rise}}{\text{run}}}}. For a horizontal line, the rise is 0, since the y{\displaystyle y} value never increases or decreases. So, the slope of a horizontal line would be 0x{\displaystyle {\frac {0}{x}}}. 
, The slope of a vertical line is undefined. In terms of riserun{\displaystyle {\frac {\text{rise}}{\text{run}}}}, the slope of a negative line would be y0{\displaystyle {\frac {y}{0}}}. The run is 0, since the x{\displaystyle x} value never increases or decreases. So, the slope of a vertical line will bey0{\displaystyle {\frac {y}{0}}}, and since you can't divide by 0, any number over 0 will always be undefined."
"
Set up the formula for the slope of a line.,
Locate two points on the line.,
Calculate the vertical distance between the points.,
Calculate the horizontal distance between the points.,
Simplify if necessary.",How to Understand Slope (in Algebra)2," The formula is slope=riserun{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {\text{rise}}{\text{run}}}}. The rise is the vertical distance between two points on a line. The run is the horizontal distance between two points on a line.
, You can use two given points, or you can select any two points. It doesn’t matter how far apart or close together the two points are, but keep in mind that if the points are closer together, there will be less need to simplify the slope later.

For example, you might choose the points (4, 4) and (12, 8).


, Start at one point, and count up in a straight line, until you reach the height of the second point. This is the rise of your slope.

Your rise will be negative if you start with the higher point and move down to the lower point.

For example, beginning at the point (4, 4), you would count up 4 positions to point (12, 8). So, the rise of your slope is 4: slope=4run{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {4}{\text{run}}}}.


, Start at the same point you started at when calculating the run. Count across in a straight line, until you reach the length of the second point. This is the run of your slope.

Your run will be negative if you start with the point on the right and move over to the left.

For example, beginning at the point (4, 4), you would count over 8 positions to point (12, 8). So, the run of your slope is 8: slope=48{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {4}{8}}}.


, You would simplify the slope just as you would  simplify any fraction. For example, 4 and 8 are both divisible by 4, so the slope 48{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{8}}} simplifies to 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}. Note that it is a positive slope, so the line moves up to the right.


"
"
Set up the formula for the slope of a line.,
Plug the x and y coordinates into the formula.,
Simplify the expression.",How to Understand Slope (in Algebra)3," This formula is for finding the slope given two points on a line: m=y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle m={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}, where m{\displaystyle m} equals the slope of the line, (x1,y1){\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})} equal the coordinates of the starting point on the line, and (x2,y2){\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})} equal the coordinates of the ending point on the line.
, To use this method, you need to be given the coordinates, as you will likely not see them plotted on a graph. Don’t forget to keep your coordinates in the correct positions. You should be subtracting the coordinates of the starting point from the coordinates of the ending point.

For example, if your points are (-4, 7) and (-1, 3), your formula will look like this: m=3−7−1−(−4){\displaystyle m={\frac {3-7}{-1-(-4)}}}.


, Subtract the values in the numerator and denominator. Then, simplify the slope, if necessary. You would simplify the slope just as you would  simplify any fraction. For example:m=3−7−1−(−4){\displaystyle m={\frac {3-7}{-1-(-4)}}}m=−43{\displaystyle m={\frac {-4}{3}}}So, the slope of the line is −43{\displaystyle {\frac {-4}{3}}}. Note that since the slope is negative, the line is moving down to the right.

Look for key words in the instructions like “solve,” “simplify,” “factor,” or “reduce.” These are some of the most common instructions (although there are others that you will learn). Many people have problems because they try to “solve” a problem when they really only need to “simplify” it., When you read the problem instructions, you should identify the key words and then perform those operations. Many people feel frustration with algebra when they try doing something that is not really part of the intended problem. The basic operations you will be asked for are:Solve. You will need to reduce the problem to an actual numerical solution, such as “x=4.” You need to find a value for the variable that can make the problem come true.

Simplify. You need to manipulate the problem into some simpler form than before, but you will not wind up with what you might consider “an answer.” You will probably not have a single numerical value for the variable.

Factor. This is similar to “simplify,” and is usually used with complex polynomials or fractions. You need to find a way to turn the problem into smaller terms. Just as the number 12 can be broken into factors of 3x4, for example, you can factor an algebraic polynomial.

For example, a simple expression like 5x{\displaystyle 5x} can be broken into factors of 5{\displaystyle 5} and x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, the expression x2+3x+2{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x+2} can be factored into the terms (x+2){\displaystyle (x+2)} and (x+1){\displaystyle (x+1)}.



Reduce. To “reduce” a problem generally involves a combination of factoring and then simplifying. You would break the terms of a numerator and denominator into their factors. Then look for common factors on top and bottom, and cancel them out. Whatever remains is the “reduced” form of the original problem. For example, reduce the expression 6x22x{\displaystyle {\frac {6x^{2}}{2x}}} as follows:

1. Factor the numerator and denominator: (3)(2)(x)(x)(2)(x){\displaystyle {\frac {(3)(2)(x)(x)}{(2)(x)}}}

2. Look for common terms. Both the numerator and denominator have factors of 2 and x.

3. Eliminate the common terms: (3)(2)(x)(x)(2)(x){\displaystyle {\frac {(3)(2)(x)(x)}{(2)(x)}}}

4. Copy down what remains: 3x{\displaystyle 3x}




, An expression is any group of numbers and variables, collected together. Some examples of expressions are x{\displaystyle x}, 14xyz{\displaystyle 14xyz} and 2x+15{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2x+15}}}. All you can do to an expression is simplify or factor it. An equation, on the other hand, contains an = sign. You can simplify or factor equations, but you can also solve them to get a final answer. It is important to look for the difference.If you have an expression, like 4x2{\displaystyle 4x^{2}}, you can never find a single “answer” or “solution.” You could find out that if x=1{\displaystyle x=1}, then the expression would have a value of 4, and if x=2{\displaystyle x=2}, then the expression would have a value of (4)(2)2{\displaystyle (4)(2)^{2}}, which is 16. But you cannot get a single “answer.”


, In algebra, the steps you take must occur in a logical order, which is called the “order of operations.” This is often simplified by the mnemonic device “PEMDAS.” The letters of PEMDAS will help you know which operations to perform in order. The letters of PEMDAS stand for:Parentheses.

Exponents.

Multiplication.

Division.

Addition.

Subtraction.


, When you have an expression or equation that includes terms inside parentheses, you need to do whatever is inside the parentheses first. Consider the difference between 5∗3+2{\displaystyle 5*3+2} and 5∗(3+2){\displaystyle 5*(3+2)}.Without the parentheses, the first expression , 5∗3+2{\displaystyle 5*3+2}, would become 15+2=17{\displaystyle 15+2=17}.

With the parentheses, 5∗(3+2){\displaystyle 5*(3+2)}, you perform the (3+2) first, so the simplified expression becomes 5∗5=25{\displaystyle 5*5=25}.


, Exponents need to be performed as the next part of simplifying or solving a problem. Consider the expression 3∗22{\displaystyle 3*2^{2}}. Without the order of operations, you wouldn’t know if you should first multiply 3∗2{\displaystyle 3*2} and then square the result, so your value is 36, or if you square the 2 first, then multiply by 3. Using PEMDAS, the correct operation is:3∗22{\displaystyle 3*2^{2}}


3∗4{\displaystyle 3*4}…..Square the 2 first.


12{\displaystyle 12}…..This is the expected result.


, M and D are the next two parts of PEMDAS, and they go together. After performing any exponents, you then perform multiplication or division from left to right.3+4∗2−6/3{\displaystyle 3+4*2-6/3}


3+8−2{\displaystyle 3+8-2}…..4*2=8, and 6/3=2. These can be done in the same step.


, A and S are the final steps of PEMDAS. These mean that you add or subtract whatever terms remain in the expression. You can perform addition and subtraction in the same step, moving from right to left through the problem. Consider the expression 4+2−3−1−5+2{\displaystyle 4+2-3-1-5+2}:4+2−3−1−5+2{\displaystyle 4+2-3-1-5+2}


6−3−1−5+2{\displaystyle 6-3-1-5+2}…..(Add 4+2)


3−1−5+2{\displaystyle 3-1-5+2}…..(Subtract 6-3)


2−5+2{\displaystyle 2-5+2}…..(Subtract 3-1)


−3+2{\displaystyle -3+2}…..(Subtract 2-5)


−1{\displaystyle -1}…..(Add -3+1)

If you perform the steps in any other order, you may come up with a different, incorrect result. For example, suppose you chose to do all the additions first, and then the subtractions:


4+2−3−1−5+2{\displaystyle 4+2-3-1-5+2}


6−3−1−7{\displaystyle 6-3-1-7}…..(Add 4+2 and add 5+2)


3−1−7{\displaystyle 3-1-7}…..(Subtract 6-3)


2−7{\displaystyle 2-7}…..(Subtract 3-1)


−5{\displaystyle -5}…..(Subtract 2-7. This gives a result of -5, which is incorrect.)


, In early math, you worked only with numbers. Learning algebra is about being able to solve problems with unknown terms. These unknown terms are represented in the problems with letters. You need to get used to treating these letters like numbers, although you may not know their actual value yet. Some common examples of variables include:Letters, such as x{\displaystyle x}, y{\displaystyle y} or z{\displaystyle z}

Greek symbols, such as θ{\displaystyle \theta }, α{\displaystyle \alpha } or σ{\displaystyle \sigma }.

Be aware that some symbols might look like variables but are actually known numbers. For example, the Greek symbol pi, π{\displaystyle \pi }, stands for the number 3.1415.


, If you think of the phrase, “Two times some number,” you can express that with a variable as 2∗x{\displaystyle 2*x}. The variable x{\displaystyle x} takes the place of the unknown “some number.” Usually, your job in an algebra problem is to find the value of the variable.For example, when you start with the equation 4+x=9{\displaystyle 4+x=9}, you need to think, “What number added to 4 will make 9?” The solution is 5, which you can write algebraically as x=5{\displaystyle x=5}.


, When you learn to treat the variables as numbers, you can combine or simplify them as you do with numbers. This is usually referred to as “combining like terms.”For example, 2x+3x=10{\displaystyle 2x+3x=10} just means that 2 of some variable added to 3 of the same variable will equal 10. If you have 2 of something and 3 of the same thing, you can add them together. Then, 2x+3x{\displaystyle 2x+3x} will become 5x, so your problem is 5x=10{\displaystyle 5x=10}, and the solution is x=2{\displaystyle x=2}.

You can only add or subtract the same variable. Some algebra problems may contain two or more variables. In the problem 2x+3y=10{\displaystyle 2x+3y=10}, you cannot combine the x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} terms together because the different variables represent different unknown numbers.


, One key to being successful in algebra is performing inverse functions. The word “inverse” means opposite. Inverse functions are a way of undoing or untangling a problem. If a chosen problem, for example, contains multiplication, you will use division, which is the inverse of multiplication, to solve the problem.The inverse of addition is subtraction.

The inverse of subtraction is addition.

The inverse of multiplication is division.

The inverse of division is multiplication.

The inverse of an exponent is a root (square root, cube root, etc.).


, If you are asked to “solve” an equation, this means that you want to end up with x={\displaystyle x=}__, with some number in the blank space. You need to use algebra to move everything else away from the x{\displaystyle x} term so it is alone on one side of the equals sign. You will do this with a series of inverse operations.The key rule to remember is that any operation you make to one side of the equation, you must also do the same to the opposite side of the equation. This will keep the equation balanced and still equal.


, Individual terms in an equation are linked by a combination of plus and minus signs. You can “cancel” these to get the variable alone by doing the opposite function.For example, if you start with x+3=7{\displaystyle x+3=7}, you want the x{\displaystyle x} alone. The inverse of +3{\displaystyle +3} is −3{\displaystyle -3}. Remember that you must do everything equally to both sides of the equation. So you will get:


x+3=7{\displaystyle x+3=7}


x+3−3=7−3{\displaystyle x+3-3=7-3}…..(subtract 3 equally on both sides)


x=4{\displaystyle x=4}…..(the +3 and -3 cancel each other out to leave the solution)



If you start with a subtraction problem, you will cancel it the same way with addition:


x−8=12{\displaystyle x-8=12}


x−8+8=12+8{\displaystyle x-8+8=12+8}…..(add 8 to both sides)


x=20{\displaystyle x=20}…..(the +8 and -8 cancel each other out to leave the solution)




, In the same way, you can perform inverse operations on multiplication and division. A term like 3x{\displaystyle 3x} means 3∗x{\displaystyle 3*x}. To get the variable alone, you will divide. Remember that for an equation, you must divide both sides of the equation equally.Consider the problem 3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24}. Since this is a multiplication problem, you will solve it with division:


3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24}


3x3=243{\displaystyle {\frac {3x}{3}}={\frac {24}{3}}}…..(Divide both sides equally by 3. Note that the ÷{\displaystyle \div }symbol is not usually used in algebra. Instead, show division by writing the terms as a fraction.)


x=8{\displaystyle x=8}…..(the 3s on the left cancel each other out to leave the solution)



Do the same to cancel a division problem with multiplication. Consider the problem x4=9{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{4}}=9}:


x4=9{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{4}}=9}


x4∗4=9∗4{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{4}}*4=9*4}…..(multiply both sides by 4)


x=36{\displaystyle x=36}…..(the 4s on the left cancel each other out to leave the solution)




, As problems become more complicated, you may have to perform multiple operations to get to a solution. You will usually use addition and subtraction first, to isolate the variable with its coefficient. Then you will use multiplication or division to find the solution.3x+5=23{\displaystyle 3x+5=23}


3x+5−5=23−5{\displaystyle 3x+5-5=23-5}…..(first, subtract 5 from both sides to leave the x term alone)


3x=18{\displaystyle 3x=18}…..(the +5 and -5 cancel out on the left)


3x3=183{\displaystyle {\frac {3x}{3}}={\frac {18}{3}}}…..(divide both sides by 3)


x=6{\displaystyle x=6}…..(the 3s on the left cancel each other out, leaving the solution)


, In algebra, you can almost always find out if you have done the problem correctly by checking your answer. Take the solution that you found, and insert it back in the original problem in place of the variable. Then simplify the problem, and if you reach a true statement, you solution was correct.

Try the example you just solved, 3x+5=23{\displaystyle 3x+5=23}. Put the solution of x=6{\displaystyle x=6} in place of the variable:


3x+5=23{\displaystyle 3x+5=23}


3(6)+5=23{\displaystyle 3(6)+5=23}…..(Insert the value x=6{\displaystyle x=6}.)


18+5=23{\displaystyle 18+5=23}…..(Simplify the equation.)


23=23{\displaystyle 23=23}….. (This is true, so your solution of x=6{\displaystyle x=6} is correct.)




, Algebra is a system of manipulating numbers and operations to try to solve problems. When you learn algebra, you will learn the rules to follow for solving problems. But to help make that easier, you need to have a strong understanding of basic math facts. You should know basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division facts and be able to work with them easily. In particular, you should be able to do the following:Add and subtract single digit numbers in your head quickly. Being able to work with two-digit numbers is even more helpful.

Know your multiplication tables from 1 through 12.

Know division and factors for numbers up through 144 (12x12). 


, Algebra uses the rules of fractions as much as any other numbering system. You need to be comfortable with finding common denominators, adding and subtracting fractions, multiplying and dividing fractions. When you learn algebra, you will expand this knowledge into working with unknown variables, but you need a strong understanding of the basics first.Know the importance of reciprocals. You need to know the concept of reciprocal numbers. The short definition of a reciprocal is that it is a fraction turned upside down. Thus, the reciprocal of 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}} is 32{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}}, and the reciprocal of 45{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}} is 54{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{4}}}. You use reciprocals as an alternative to division, when the problem is complicated. Instead of dividing by one fraction, you can multiply by its reciprocal.


, You will often be using negative numbers or variables. You should review how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide negatives before starting to learn algebra. Here are some basic rules for working with negatives.You can also see our articles on adding and subtracting negative numbers and dividing and multiplying negative numbers.

 On a number line, a negative number is the same distance from zero as the positive, but in the opposite direction.

 A negative plus a negative will also be negative. Adding two negative numbers together makes the number more negative.

 Two negative signs together cancel each other out. Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number.

4-(-3) is the same as 4+3 = 7.



 Multiplying or dividing two negative numbers gives a positive answer.

 Multiplying or dividing one positive number and one negative number gives a negative answer.

In order to be successful in solving a word problem, you need to read the whole problem in order to assess what information is provided, and what information is missing., In many problems, what you are asked to find is presented in the last sentence. This is not always true, however, so you need to read the entire problem carefully.Write down what you need to find, or else underline it in the problem, so that you do not forget what your final answer means.In an algebra word problem, you will likely be asked to find a certain value, or you may be asked to find an equation that represents a value.

For example, you might have the following problem: Jane went to a book shop and bought a book. While at the store Jane found a second interesting book and bought it for $80. The price of the second book was $10 less than three times the price of he first book. What was the price of the first book?

In this problem, you are asked to find the price of the first book Jane purchased. 


, Likely, the information you need to know is the same as what information you are asked to find. You also need to assess what information you already know. Again, underline or write out this information, so you can keep track of all the parts of the problem. For problems involving geometry, it is often helpful to draw a sketch at this point.For example, you know that Jane bought two books. You know that the second book was $80. You also know that the second book cost $10 less than 3 times the price of the first book. You don’t know the price of the first book.


, If you are being asked to find a certain value, you will likely only have one variable. If, however, you are asked to find an equation, you will likely have multiple variables. No matter how many variables you have, you should list each one, and indicate what they are equal to.For example, assign the variable x{\displaystyle x} to the unknown in the problem, which is the price of the first book. Write x=the price of the first book{\displaystyle x={\text{the price of the first book}}}.


, Word problems are full of keywords that give you clues about what operations to use. Locating and interpreting these keywords can help you translate the words into algebra.

Multiplication keywords include times, of, and factor.Division keywords include per, out of, and percent.Addition keywords include some, more, and together.Subtraction keywords include difference, fewer, and decreased., Use the information you learn from the problem, including keywords, to write an algebraic description of the story.For example, you know that the second book is $80, and you know what $80 equals in terms of the price of the first book (x{\displaystyle x}). So set 80 equal to $10 less (−10{\displaystyle -10} ) than 3 times the price of the first book (3x{\displaystyle 3x}). Putting everything together, you have 80=3x−10{\displaystyle 80=3x-10}.


, If you have only one unknown in your word problem, isolate the variable in your equation and find which number it is equal to. Use the normal rules of  algebra to isolate the variable. Remember that you need to keep the equation balanced. This means that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side.

Use inverse operations to isolate a variable. For example, to isolate the variable in the equation 80=3x−10{\displaystyle 80=3x-10}, you need to add 10 to both sides, then divide by 3:80=3x−10{\displaystyle 80=3x-10}80+10=3x−10+10{\displaystyle 80+10=3x-10+10}90=3x{\displaystyle 90=3x}903=3x3{\displaystyle {\frac {90}{3}}={\frac {3x}{3}}}30=x{\displaystyle 30=x}


, If you have more than one unknown in your word problem, you need to make sure you  combine like terms to simplify your equation.

When combining like terms, remember that only terms with the same exponent and variable can be combined. For example, 4x{\displaystyle 4x} and 2x{\displaystyle 2x} can be combined, 3x2{\displaystyle 3x^{2}} and 5x2{\displaystyle 5x^{2}} can be combined, and 8xy{\displaystyle 8xy} and 4xy{\displaystyle 4xy} can be combined.


, Look back to your list of variables and unknown information. This will remind you what you were trying to solve. Write a statement indicating what your answer means.

For example, since x=the price of the first book{\displaystyle x={\text{the price of the first book}}}, and 30=x{\displaystyle 30=x}, you know that the price of the first book Jane bought was $30.


, This problem has more than one unknown value, so its equation will have multiple variables. This means you cannot solve for a specific numerical value of a variable. Instead, you will solve to find an equation that describes a variable.

Robyn and Billy run a lemonade stand. They are giving all the money that they make to a cat shelter. They will combine their profits from selling lemonade with their tips. They sell cups of lemonade for 75 cents. Their mom and dad have agreed to double whatever amount they receive in tips. Write an equation that describes the amount of money Robyn and Billy will give to the shelter.


, You are asked to find how much money Robyn and Billy will give to the cat shelter.
, You know that Robyn and Billy will make money from selling cups of lemonade and from getting tips. You know that they will sell each cup for 75 cents. You also know that their mom and dad will double the amount they make in tips. You don’t know how many cups of lemonade they sell, or how much tip money they get.
, Since you have three unknowns, you will have three variables. Let x{\displaystyle x} equal the amount of money they will give to the shelter. Let c{\displaystyle c} equal the number of cups they sell. Let t{\displaystyle t} equal the number of dollars they make in tips.
, Since they will “combine” their profits and tips, you know addition will be involved. Since their mom and dad will “double” their tips, you know you need to multiply their tips by a factor of 2.
, Since you are writing an equation that describes the amount of money they will give to the shelter, the variable x{\displaystyle x} will be alone on one side of the equation.

Since you are combining their profits and tips, you will be adding two terms. So, x = __ + __. 

The first term will be equal to their profits. Since they make $0.75 for every cup of lemonade they sell, their profits are equal to .75c{\displaystyle .75c}. So, x=.75c+??{\displaystyle x=.75c\;+\;??}.

The second term will be equal to their tips. Since their parents are doubling their tips, their tips will be equal to 2t{\displaystyle 2t}. So, x=.75c+2t{\displaystyle x=.75c+2t}. Since the variable you are describing is already isolated, and all like terms are combined, you have arrived at your final answer.


, The variable x{\displaystyle x} equals the amount of money Robyn and Billy will donate to the cat shelter. So, the amount they donate can be found by multiplying the number of cups of lemonade they sell by .75, and adding this product to the product of their tip money and 2.

Write the problem.,
Decide whether to use addition or subtraction to isolate the variable term.,
Add or subtract the constant on both sides of the equation.,
Eliminate the coefficient of the variable through division or multiplication.,
Solve for the variable.",How to Solve Two Step Algebraic Equations1," The first step to solving a two step algebraic equation is just to write the problem so you can start to visualize the solution. Let's say we're working with the following problem: -4x + 7 = 15.;
, The next step is to find a way to keep ""-4x"" on one side and to keep the constants (whole numbers) on the other side. To do this, you'll have to do the ""Additive Inverse,"" finding the opposite of +7, which is -7. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation so that the ""+7"" on the same side as the variable term is canceled out. Just write ""-7"" below the 7 on one side and below the 15 on the other so the equation remains balanced.


Remember the Golden Rule of Algebra. Whatever you do to one side of an equation must be done to the other side to maintain the balance. That is why 7 is subtracted from the 15 as well. We only need to subtract 7 once per side, which is why the 7 is not subtracted from the -4x as well.

, This will complete the process of isolating the variable term. Subtracting 7 from +7 on the left side of the equation will leave no constant term (or 0) on the left side of the equation. Subtracting 7 from +15, on the right side of the equation, will leave you with 8. Therefore, the new equation is -4x = 8.


-4x + 7 = 15 =
-4x = 8

, The coefficient is the number attached to the variable. In this example, the coefficient is -4. To remove the -4 in -4x, you'll have to divide both sides of the equation by -4. Right now, the x is being multiplied by the -4, so the opposite of this operation is division and you'll have to do it on both sides.


Again, whatever you do to the equation must be done to both sides. That is why you see ÷ -4 twice.

, To do this, divide the left side of the equation, -4x, by -4, to get x. Divide the right side of the equation, 8, by -4, to get -2. Therefore, x = -2. You've taken two steps -- subtraction and division -- to solve this equation.

Recognize the standard format.,
Rearrange your equations to put them into standard format.,
Write your equations so the variables line up.",How to Solve Systems Using Linear Combinations1," In algebra, the “standard format” for an equation is one that is written as Ax+By=C{\displaystyle Ax+By=C}. When written in this format, the letters A, B and C are commonly chosen to represent numerical values, while x and y are the variables that you need to solve.

You could easily work with different variables, but the structure of the standard format will be the same. For example, if you are solving a business-related problem about selling hats and scarves to calculate the total number of items sold, you might choose the variable h{\displaystyle h} to represent the number of hats and s{\displaystyle s} to represent the number of scarves. Your standard format in this case would look like Ah+Bs=T{\displaystyle Ah+Bs=T}. The steps for solving the problem will still be the same.
;
, This may require you to combine similar terms, if each variable appears in the equation more than once, for example. You will also need to move the terms so they appear in the proper order.

For example, given the equation 2x+y+2y+3x+1=4{\displaystyle 2x+y+2y+3x+1=4}, you need to perform the following steps to get to standard format:


2x+y+2y+3x+1=4{\displaystyle 2x+y+2y+3x+1=4}     (given equation)


5x+3y+1=4{\displaystyle 5x+3y+1=4}      (combine like terms)


5x+3y=3{\displaystyle 5x+3y=3}        (subtract 1 from both sides)



You may be familiar with seeing linear equations in the form y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}. This is called the “slope-intercept” form of a line. It is useful for different purposes. It could be used to solve the system by linear combinations, but the standard format Ax+By=C is preferred. If you have your data in the slope-intercept form, you will need to rewrite it algebraically into standard format as follows:


y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}     (given slope-intercept form)


y−mx=b{\displaystyle y-mx=b}     (subtract mx from both sides)

-mx+y=b{\displaystyle mx+y=b}    (rearrange terms to get x first)

A=-m, B=1, C=b           (redefine terms for standard format)




, It is helpful to write your equations with one directly over the other, so the similar terms line up.

For example, if you have the two equations, in standard format, of 2x−2y=5{\displaystyle 2x-2y=5} and 3x+2y=8{\displaystyle 3x+2y=8}, write them in two rows as:


2x−2y=5{\displaystyle 2x-2y=5}


3x+2y=8{\displaystyle 3x+2y=8}

Write one equation above the other.,
Subtract like terms.,
Solve for the remaining term.,
Plug the term back into one of the equations to find the value of the first term.,
Check your answer.",How to Solve Systems of Equations1," Solving a system of equations by subtraction is ideal when you see that both equations have one variable with the same coefficient with the same charge.

For example, if both equations have the variable positive 2x, you should use the subtraction method to find the value of both variables.



 


Write one equation above the other by matching up the x and y variables and the whole numbers. Write the subtraction sign outside the quantity of the second system of equations.
Ex: If your two equations are 2x + 4y = 8 and 2x + 2y = 2, then you should write the first equation over the second, with the subtraction sign outside the quantity of the second system, showing that you'll be subtracting each of the terms in that equation.

2x + 4y = 8
-(2x + 2y = 2)

;
, Now that you've lined up the two equations, all you have to do is subtract the like terms. You can take it one term at a time:


2x - 2x = 0
4y - 2y = 2y
8 - 2 = 6

2x + 4y = 8 -(2x + 2y = 2) = 0 + 2y = 6



, Once you've eliminated one of the variables by getting a term of 0 when you subtract variables with the same coefficient, you should just solve for the remaining variable by solving a regular equation. You can remove the 0 from the equation since it won't change its value.


2y = 6
Divide 2y and 6 by 2 to get y = 3

, Now that you know that y = 3, you just have to plug it in to one of the original equations to solve for x. It doesn't matter which one you choose because the answer will be the same. If one of the equations looks more complicated than the other, just plug it into the easier equation.


Plug y = 3 into the equation 2x + 2y = 2 and solve for x.
2x + 2(3) = 2
2x + 6 = 2
2x = -4
x = - 2

You have solved the system of equations by subtraction. (x, y) = (-2, 3)



, To make sure that you solved the system of equations correctly, you can just plug in your two answers to both equations to make sure that they work both times. Here's how to do it:


Plug (-2, 3) in for (x, y) in the equation 2x + 4y = 8.

2(-2) + 4(3) = 8
-4 + 12 = 8
8 = 8


Plug (-2, 3) in for (x, y) in the equation 2x + 2y = 2.

2(-2) + 2(3) = 2
-4 + 6 = 2
2 = 2

Study the Real numbers also called the set of ""R = Reals"".

,
Build understanding of the system of Reals by knowing the following subsets of the set of rational numbers, including:


Naturals, N = {1, 2, 3,...}, (the counting numbers)






Wholes, W = {0, 1, 2, 3,...}, (Naturals and zero)






Integers, P = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...}






Common Fractions, p/q which means the quotient of p divided by q, where q is not zero, p and q are natural numbers (quotient - the solution of a division).,

Rational numbers = all the naturals, wholes, common fractions, integers, and some other non-common fractional expressions, or decimals and roots that all have a terminating decimal or repeating decimal equivalent form.






Fractions, equivalent decimals and percentages are three examples of rational numbers:






Fractions = p/q (p and q are integers, but q is not zero). Also, terminating decimals and repeating decimals are other examples of rationals, like:

Terminating decimals are such as: 1/4 = .25 = 25/100 = 25%, and 3/4 = .75 = 75/100 = 75%, and 5/8 = .625 = 625/1000 = 62.5/100 = 62.5% .
Repeating decimal like 1/3 = .333... = 33 1/3% or ~ 33.333%, and also 2/3 = .666... = 66 2/3% or ~ 66.66% (often rounded to 66.7% = .667 for convenience).
and in 3/13 = 0.230769230769230769... notice that ""230769"" repeats, which indicates that 3/13 is rational (and, of course, any rational divided by a rational could be shown to have a rational quotient).





,, Irrationals, stated as decimals neither terminate nor repeat. They can not be stated as a ratio such as a fraction (p/q) that would terminate or repeat in its decimal equivalent. The number π, e and sqrt(2), of 3, or of 5,..., and the 3rd root(4) are some examples of irrationals.

,, Imaginary numbers are based on i = (sq root of -1) = i1 or 1i. The i is the symbol for imaginary numbers, such that:


(a.) 1i X 1i = -1, but since (b.) -1 X -1 = +1, just as (c.) 1 X 1 = +1






Example: the sqrt(-9) = 3i is called ""imaginary 3"", or ""3 imaginary"" and is not Real. Check: i3 X i3, or 3i X 3i = -9.

;
,


Example: The sqrt(-8) is imaginary = "" i(2nd root(8)) ""

,


Example: 3rd root of (-8) = -2 is Real. Check: -2 X -2 X -2 = -8.

, bi is the imaginary part of that value. ax is Real as seen here.

, Here is how Reals are easily defined as y = ax based on y = ax + bi. Show that subset y = ax + 0 is where the (optional) imaginary part bi is not present (not relevant). Why not -- because we have b = 0 and bi = 0i = 0, so then we call that the values of a subset R, such that y = ax makes up all of the Real numbers.

Continue estimating as needed.",How to Solve Square Root Problems," To understand square roots, it's best to start with squares. Squares are easy — taking the square of a number is just multiplying it by itself. For instance, 3 squared is the same as 3 × 3 = 9 and 9 squared is the same as 9 × 9 = 81. Squares are written by marking a small ""2"" above and to the right of the number being squared — like this: 32, 92, 1002, and so on.


Try squaring a few more numbers on your own to test this concept out. Remember, squaring a number is just multiplying it by itself. You can even do this for negative numbers. If you do, the answer will always be positive. For example, -82 = -8 × -8 = 64.;
, The square root symbol (√, also called a ""radical"" symbol) means basically the ""opposite"" of the 2 symbol. When you see a radical, you want to ask yourself, ""what number can multiply by itself to give the number under the radical?"" For instance, if you see √(9), you want to find the number that can be squared to make nine. In this case, the answer is three, because 32 = 9.


As another example, let's find the square root of 25 (√(25)). This means we want to find the number that squares to make 25. Since 52 = 5 × 5 = 25, we can say that √(25) = 5.
You can also think of this as ""undoing"" a square. For example, if we want to find √(64), the square root of 64, let's start by thinking of 64 as 82. Since a square root symbol basically ""cancels out"" a square, we can say that √(64) = √(82) = 8.

, Up until now, the answers to our square root problems have been nice, round numbers. This isn't always the case — in fact, square root problems can sometimes have answers that are very long, inconvenient decimals. Numbers that have square roots that are whole numbers (in other words, numbers that aren't fractions or decimals) are called perfect squares. All of the examples listed above (9, 25, and 64) are perfect squares because when we take their square roots, we get whole numbers (3, 5, and 8).


On the other hand, numbers that don't give whole numbers when you take their square roots are called imperfect squares. When you take one of these numbers' square roots, you usually get a decimal or fraction. Sometimes, the decimals involved can be quite messy. For instance, √(13) = 3.605551275464...


, As you've probably noticed, taking the square root of perfect squares can be quite easy! Because these problems are so simple, it's worth your time to memorize the square roots of the first dozen or so perfect squares. You'll come across these numbers a lot, so taking the time to learn them early can save you lots of time in the long run. The first 12 perfect squares are:


12 = 1 × 1 = 1

22 = 2 × 2 = 4

32 = 3 × 3 = 9

42 = 4 × 4 = 16

52 = 5 × 5 = 25

62 = 6 × 6 = 36

72 = 7 × 7 = 49

82 = 8 × 8 = 64

92 = 9 × 9 = 81

102 = 10 × 10 = 100

112 = 11 × 11 = 121

122 = 12 × 12 = 144


, Finding the square roots of imperfect squares can sometimes be a bit of a pain — especially if you're not using a calculator (in the sections below, you'll find tricks for making this process easier). However, it's often possible to simplify the numbers in square roots to make them easier to work with. To do this, you simply need to separate the number under the radical into its factors, then take the square root of any factors that are perfect squares and write the answer outside the radical. This is easier than it sounds — read on for more information!Let's say that we want to find the square root of 900. At first glance, this looks very difficult! However, it's not hard if we separate 900 into its factors. Factors are the numbers that can multiply together to make another number. For instance, since you can make 6 by multiplying 1 × 6 and 2 × 3, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Instead of working with the number 900, which is somewhat awkward, let's instead write 900 as 9 × 100. Now, since 9, which is a perfect square, is separated from 100, we can take its square root on its own. √(9 × 100) = √(9) × √(100) = 3 × √(100). In other words, √(900) = 3√(100).
We can even simplify this two steps further by dividing 100 into the factors 25 and 4. √(100) = √(25 × 4) = √(25) × √(4) = 5 × 2 = 10. So, we can say that √(900) = 3(10) = 30.

, Think — what number times itself equals -16? It's not 4 or -4 — squaring either of these gives positive 16. Give up? In fact, there isn't a way to write the square root of -16 or any other negative number with ordinary numbers. In these cases, we have to substitute imaginary numbers (usually in the form of letters or symbols) to take the place of the negative number's square root. For example, the variable ""i"" is usually used for the square root of -1. As a general rule, the square root of a negative number will always be an imaginary number (or include one).


Note that although imaginary numbers can't be represented with ordinary digits, they can still be treated like ordinary numbers in many ways. For instance, the square roots of negative numbers can be squared to give those negative numbers, just like any other square root. For example, i2 = -1


, Though it can be a little time-consuming, it's possible to solve for the square roots of difficult imperfect squares without a calculator. To do this, we'll use a solving method (or algorithm) that's similar — but not exactly the same — as basic long division.Start by writing out your square root problem in the same from as a long division problem. For example, let's say that we want to find the square root of 6.45, which is definitely not a convenient perfect square. First, we'd write an ordinary radical symbol (√), then we'd write our number underneath it. Next, we'd make a line above our number so that it's in a little ""box"" — just like in long division. When we're done, we should have a long-tailed ""√"" symbol with 6.45 written under it.
We'll be writing numbers above our problem, so be sure to leave space.

, To start solving your problem, group the digits of the number under the radical sign into pairs, starting at the decimal point. You may want to make small marks (like dots, slashes, commas, etc.) between your pairs to keep track of them.


In our example, we would divide 6.45 into pairs like this: 6-.45-00. Note that there is a ""leftover"" digit on the left — this is OK.

, Start with the first number or pair on the left. Pick the biggest number with a square that is less than or equal to the ""group"". For instance, if the group was 37, you would pick 6, because 62 = 36 < 37 but 72 = 49 > 37. Write this number above the first group. This is the first digit of your answer.


In our example, the first group in 6-.45-00 is 6. The biggest number that is less than or equal to 6 when squared is 2 — 22 = 4. Write a ""2"" above the 6 under the radical.

, Take the first digit of your answer (the number you just found) and double it. Write this underneath your first group and subtract to find the difference. Drop the next pair of numbers down beside the answer. Finally, write the last digit of the double of the first digit of your answer to the left and leave a space next to it.


In our example, we would start by taking the double of 2, the first digit of our answer. 2 × 2 = 4. Next, we would subtract 4 from 6 (our first ""group""), getting 2 as our answer. Next, we would drop down the next group (45) to get 245. Finally, we would write 4 once more to the left, leaving a small space to add onto the end, like this: 4_.

, Next, you want to add a digit to the right side of the number you've written off to the left. Pick the digit that multiplies with your new number to be as large as possible, yet still less than or equal to the ""dropped down"" number. For example, if your ""dropped down"" number is 1700 and your number to the left is 40_, you would fill in the blank with ""4"" because 404 × 4 = 1616 < 1700, while 405 × 5 = 2025. The number you find in this step is the second digit of your answer, so you can add it above the radical sign.


In our example, we want to find the number to fill in the blank in 4_ × _ that makes the answer as large as possible but still less than or equal to 245. In this case, the answer is 5. 45 × 5 = 225, while 46 × 6 = 276.

, Continue performing this modified long division pattern until you start getting zeroes when you subtract from your ""dropped-down"" number or you reach your desired level of accuracy. When you're done, the numbers you used to fill the blanks at each step (plus the very first number you used) make up the digits in your answer.


Continuing from our example, we would subtract 225 from 245 to get 20. Next, we would drop down the next pair of digits, 00, to make 2000. Doubling the numbers above the radical sign, we get 25 × 2 = 50. Solving for the blank in 50_ × _ =/< 2,000, we get 3. At this point, we have ""253"" above the radical sign — repeating this process once again, we get a 9 as our next digit.

, To finalize your answer, you need to put its decimal point in the right place. Luckily, this is easy — all you need to do is line it up with the decimal point in your original number. For example, if the number under the radical sign is 49.8, you would simply move the point up between the two numbers above the 9 and the 8.


In our example, the number under the radical sign is 6.45, so we would simply slide the point up and place it between the 2 and 5 digits of our answer, giving us 2.539.

, Once you've memorized your perfect squares, finding the square roots of imperfect squares becomes much easier. Since you already know a dozen or so perfect squares, any number that falls between two of these perfect squares can be found by ""whittling away"" at an estimate between these values. To start, find the two perfect squares your number is between. Next, determine which of these two numbers it is the closest to.


For example, let's say we need to find the square root of 40. Since we've memorized our perfect squares, we can say that 40 is in between 62 and 72, or 36 and 49. Since 40 is greater than 62, its square root will be greater than 6, and since it is less than 72, its square root will be less than 7. 40 is a little closer to 36 than it is to 49, so the answer will probably be a little closer to 6. In the next few steps, we'll narrow our answer down.

, Once you've picked out two perfect squares that your number is between, it's simply a matter of whittling away at your estimate until you reach an answer you're satisfied with — the farther you go, the more accurate your answer is. To start, pick a ""tenth place"" decimal point for your answer — it doesn't have to be correct, but you'll save time if you use common sense to pick one that's close to the right answer.


In our example problem, a reasonable estimate for the square root of 40 might be 6.4, since we know from above that the answer is probably a little closer to 6 than it is to 7.

, Next, square your estimate. Unless you're lucky, you probably won't get your original number — you'll either be a little higher than it or a little lower. If your answer is too high, try again with a slightly smaller estimate (and vice versa if it is too low).


Multiply 6.4 by itself to get 6.4 × 6.4 = 40.96, which is slightly higher than original number.
Next, since we over-shot our answer, we'll multiply the number one tenth less than our estimate above by itself and to get 6.3 × 6.3 = 39.69. This is slightly lower than our original number. This means that the square root of 40 is somewhere between 6.3 and 6.4. Additionally, since 39.69 is closer to 40 than 40.96, you know the square root will be closer to 6.3 than 6.4.

, At this point, if you're happy with your answers, you may want to simply use one of your first guesses as an estimate. However, if you'd like a more accurate answer, all you need to do is pick an estimate for your ""hundredths place"" that puts this estimate between your first two. Continuing with this pattern, you can get three decimal places for your answer, four, and so on — it just depends how far you want to go.


In our example, let's pick 6.33 for our two-decimal point estimate. Multiply 6.33 by itself to get 6.33 × 6.33 = 40.0689. Since this is slightly above our original number, we'll try a slightly lower number, like 6.32. 6.32 × 6.32 = 39.9424. This is slightly below our original number, so we know that the exact square root is between 6.33 and 6.32. If we wanted to continue, we would keep using this same approach to get an answer that's continually more and more accurate.

Solve for the variable.",How to Solve Two Step Algebraic Equations2," The problem you will be working with is the following: -2x - 3 = 4x - 15. Before you proceed, make sure that both of the variables are the same. In this case, ""-2x"" and ""4x"" both have the same variable, ""x,"" so you can move forward.

, To do this, you'll need to use addition or subtraction to eliminate the constant from the left side of the equation. The constant is -3, so you'll have to take its opposite, +3, and add this constant to both sides of the equation.


Adding +3 to the left side of the equation, -2x -3, will give you (-2x -3) + 3, or -2x on the left side.
Adding +3 to the right side of the equation, 4x -15, will give you (4x - 15) +3, or 4x -12.
Therefore, (-2x - 3) +3 = (4x - 15) +3 = -2x = 4x - 12
The new equation should read -2x = 4x -12

, To do this, you'll simply have to take ""the opposite"" of ""4x"", which is ""-4x,"" and subtract -4x from both sides of the equation. On the left side, -2x - 4x = -6x, and on the right side, (4x -12) -4x = -12, so the new equation should read -6x = -12


-2x - 4x = (4x - 12) - 4x = -6x = -12

, Now that you've simplified the equation to -6x = -12, all you have to do is to divide both sides of the equation by -6 to isolate the variable x, which is currently being multiplied by -6. On the left side of the equation, -6x ÷ -6 = x, and on the right side of the equation, -12 ÷ -6 = 2. Therefore, x = 2.


-6x ÷ -6 = -12 ÷ -6
x = 2

Solve two-step equations while keeping the variable on the right side.,
Solve a two step equation by multiplying at the end instead of dividing.",How to Solve Two Step Algebraic Equations3," You can solve a two step equation while keeping the variable on the right side. As long as you isolate it, you'll still get the same answer. Let's take the problem, 11 = 3 - 7x. To solve it, your first step will be to combine the constants by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation. Then, you'll have to divide both sides of the equation by -7 to solve for x. Here's how you do it:


11 = 3 - 7x =
11 - 3 = 3 - 3 - 7x =
8 = - 7x =
8/-7 = -7/7x
-8/7 = x or -1.14 = x

, The principle for solving this type of equation is the same: use arithmetic to combine the constants, isolate the variable term, and then isolate the variable without the term. Let's say you're working with the equation x/5 + 7 = -3. The first thing you should do is subtract 7, the inverse of -3, from both sides, and then multiply both sides by 5 to solve for x. Here's how you do it:


x/5 + 7 = -3 =
(x/5 + 7) - 7 = -3 - 7 =
x/5 = -10
x/5 * 5 = -10 * 5
x = -50

For example, consider these two equations:


2x+y=5{\displaystyle 2x+y=5}


2x−3y=1{\displaystyle 2x-3y=1}



You should see very quickly that the term 2x{\displaystyle 2x} appears identically in each equation.

Be very careful when matching the terms. Look for the signs (plus or minus) to match as well. For this method of solving, the terms 2x{\displaystyle 2x} and −2x{\displaystyle -2x} are NOT considered to be the same.

If your system does not have a matching pair of coefficients, you cannot use this method for solving. You will need to go on to the next method.


, Working across the system from left to right, subtract each term of the second equation from the corresponding term of the first equation.

It may be helpful simply to draw a long horizontal line across the bottom of the two equations and subtract downward, as you would with any ordinary subtraction problem.


2x+y=5{\displaystyle 2x+y=5}


2x−3y=1{\displaystyle 2x-3y=1}

------------------------


0x+4y=4{\displaystyle 0x+4y=4} 




, If one of your terms matched exactly, as it should, and you subtracted correctly, then one of the variables should be eliminated from the problem. Rewrite what you have left as a single equation.

In the example above, you should be left with 4y=4{\displaystyle 4y=4}.

Because one of the variables gets eliminated in this method, some textbooks will refer to this as the “elimination” method of solving a system of equations.


, What you have left should be a fairly simple, one-variable equation. Solve it by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient.

In the example above, divide both sides of 4y=4{\displaystyle 4y=4} by 4. You will be left with the solution y=1{\displaystyle y=1}.


, Take that solution, in our example y=1, and substitute it in place of y{\displaystyle y} in either one of the original equations.

In this case, we can choose the first example, 2x+y=5{\displaystyle 2x+y=5}. When you replace the variable with its solution, you will have 2x+1=5{\displaystyle 2x+1=5}.


, Use basic algebraic steps to solve for the remaining variable. Remember that whatever action you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side. For example:


2x+1=5{\displaystyle 2x+1=5}      (original equation)


2x=4{\displaystyle 2x=4}        (subtract 1 from both sides)


x=2{\displaystyle x=2}         (divide both sides by 2 to get solution)


, Verify that you have done the work correctly by checking your solutions. You should be able to place your two solutions, in this example x=2{\displaystyle x=2} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1}, into each of the original equations. When you then simplify the equations, you will get true statements.

For example, check the first equation as follows:


2x+y=5{\displaystyle 2x+y=5}       (original equation)


2∗2+1=5{\displaystyle 2*2+1=5}      (insert values for x and y)


4+1=5{\displaystyle 4+1=5}        (simplify multiplication)


5=5{\displaystyle 5=5}          (simplify addition, to get solution)

The true statement 5=5 shows the solution is correct.



Check the second equation as follows:

1=1{\displaystyle 1=1}          (simplify subtraction, to get solution)

The true statement 1=1 shows the solution is correct.




, The final solution, which you have proven to work in both equations, is x=2{\displaystyle x=2} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1}.

If you are working on graphing linear functions, you may also write your solution as an ordered pair. Thus, for this example, you would write x=2{\displaystyle x=2} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1} in the form (2,1){\displaystyle (2,1)}.

By examination, you should see that the first equation contains the term −3y{\displaystyle -3y}, while the second equation contains the term 3y{\displaystyle 3y}. These two terms are opposites of each other.


, Working across the system from left to right, add each term of the first equation to the corresponding term of the second equation. It may be helpful simply to draw a long horizontal line across the bottom of the two equations and add downward, as you would with any ordinary addition problem.

The above example works out as follows:


x−3y=5{\displaystyle x-3y=5}


2x+3y=19{\displaystyle 2x+3y=19}

-------------------------


3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24}




, Because you were adding, and one of your terms contained opposites, then one of the variables should be eliminated from the problem. Rewrite what you have left as a single equation.

In the example above, the y{\displaystyle y} variable was eliminated. The remaining equation is 3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24}.

Because one of the variables gets eliminated in this method, as with the prior subtraction method, some textbooks will refer to this as the “elimination” method of solving a system of equations.

, Take that solution, in our example x=8, and substitute it in place of x{\displaystyle x} in either one of the original equations.

Choose the first equation:


x−3y=5{\displaystyle x-3y=5}          (original equation)


8−3y=5{\displaystyle 8-3y=5}          (insert value of x)

y=1{\displaystyle y=1}            (divide both sides by -3, to get solution)




, Verify that you have done the work correctly by checking your solutions. You should be able to place your two solutions, in this example x=8{\displaystyle x=8} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1}, into each of the original equations. When you then simplify the equations, you will get true statements.

For example, start with the first equation:


x−3y=5{\displaystyle x-3y=5}         (original equation)


8−3∗1=5{\displaystyle 8-3*1=5}        (insert values of x and y)


8−3=5{\displaystyle 8-3=5}         (simplify multiplication)


5=5{\displaystyle 5=5}           (simplify subtraction to get solution)

The true statement 5=5 shows that the solution is correct.



Now try the second equation:

19=19{\displaystyle 19=19}            (simplify addition to get solution)

The true statement 19=19 shows that the solution is correct.




, The final solution, which you have proven to work in both equations, is x=8{\displaystyle x=8} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1}.

If you are working on graphing linear functions, you may also write your solution as an ordered pair. This for this example, you would write x=8{\displaystyle x=8} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1} in the form (8,1){\displaystyle (8,1)}.

Create a pair of matching or opposite coefficients.,
Either add or subtract the two new equations.,
Replace that solution into one of your original equations.,
Check your two solutions.,
Write out your solution.",How to Solve Systems Using Linear Combinations4," It is more likely that your system of equations will not have a pair of matching or opposite coefficients. When you line up the two equations and compare coefficients, unless two coefficients (the A and B of the standard format) match exactly, you need to take a couple extra steps.

For example, consider these two initial equations:


3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6}


8x−4y=2{\displaystyle 8x-4y=2}



When you examine them, there are no matching coefficients for similar terms. That is, the 3x does not match the 8x, and the 2y does not match the -4y. There is also no pair of opposites.


, Examine the two equations and decide what number you could use to multiply one of the equations, to create a pair of matching or opposite coefficients. For example, given the system 3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6} and 8x−4y=2{\displaystyle 8x-4y=2}, you should be able to see that the first equation contains a term 2y{\displaystyle 2y} and the second equation contains a term -4y{\displaystyle 4y}. If you double the first term, you will have a pair of opposite coefficients.

Multiply each term of the equation to create a new equation for solving. In this example, multiply each term of the first equation by {\displaystyle }. This will turn the original equation 3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6} into 6x+4y=12{\displaystyle 6x+4y=12}. Notice that you now have a pair of opposite coefficients in the y{\displaystyle y} terms of 4y{\displaystyle 4y} and -4y{\displaystyle 4y}.

In some cases, you may need to do a double multiplication, or use a fraction. For example, in the system 2x−3y=2{\displaystyle 2x-3y=2} and 5x+2y=1{\displaystyle 5x+2y=1}, there are no coefficients that are simple integer multiples of each other. You could multiply the first equation by 5/2{\displaystyle 5/2} to create 5x−152y=5{\displaystyle 5x-{\frac {15}{2}}y=5}, and now the x{\displaystyle x} coefficients are ready to be canceled. Alternatively, if you prefer not to work with fractions, you could multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2. This would create two completely new equations, as follows:


2x−3y=2{\displaystyle 2x-3y=2}     (first original equation)


5x+2y=1{\displaystyle 5x+2y=1}     (second original equation)

Now multiply the first equation by 5, and the second equation by 2


5∗(2x−3y=2){\displaystyle 5*(2x-3y=2)}→→10x−15y=10{\displaystyle 10x-15y=10}


2∗(5x+2y=1){\displaystyle 2*(5x+2y=1)}→→10x+4y=2{\displaystyle 10x+4y=2}




, If you have created a matching pair of coefficients, you will subtract terms to eliminate one variable. If you have created a pair of opposite coefficients, you will add terms to eliminate one variable. Consider the following example:



6x+4y=12{\displaystyle 6x+4y=12}      (first equation)


8x−4y=2{\displaystyle 8x-4y=2}       (second equation)

----------------------


14x=14{\displaystyle 14x=14}      (add two equations together to cancel y terms)


x=1{\displaystyle x=1}          (divide by 14 to get solution)



, Take that solution, in our example x=1, and substitute it in place of x{\displaystyle x} in either one of the original equations. This works as follows:


3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6}      (original equation)


3∗1+2y=6{\displaystyle 3*1+2y=6}      (insert x value)


3+2y=6{\displaystyle 3+2y=6}       (simplify multiplication)


2y=3{\displaystyle 2y=3}         (subtract 3 from both sides)


y=32{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{2}}}     (divide both sides by 2)


, Verify that you have done the work correctly by checking your solutions. You should be able to place your two solutions, in this example x=1{\displaystyle x=1} and y=32{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{2}}}, into each of the original equations. When you then simplify the equations, you should get true statements.

For example, check the first equation:


3x+2y=6{\displaystyle 3x+2y=6}      (original equation)


3∗1+2∗32=6{\displaystyle 3*1+2*{\frac {3}{2}}=6}      (insert x and y values)


3+3=6{\displaystyle 3+3=6}      (simplify multiplication)


6=6{\displaystyle 6=6}       (simplify addition to get solution)

The true statement 6=6{\displaystyle 6=6} shows that the solution is correct.



Now check the second equation, as follows:


8x−4y=2{\displaystyle 8x-4y=2}      (original equation)


8∗1−4∗32=2{\displaystyle 8*1-4*{\frac {3}{2}}=2}       (insert x and y values)

The true statement 2=2{\displaystyle 2=2} shows that the solution is correct.




, The final solution, which you have proven to work in both equations, is x=1{\displaystyle x=1} and y=32{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{2}}}.

If you are working on graphing linear functions, you may also write your solution as an ordered pair. This for this example, you would write x=1{\displaystyle x=1} and y=32{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{2}}} in the form (1,32){\displaystyle (1,{\frac {3}{2}})}.

For example, if one equation has the variable 3x and the other has the variable -3x, then the addition method is ideal.Write one equation above the other by matching up the x and y variables and the whole numbers. Write the addition sign outside the quantity of the second system of equations.
Ex: If your two equations are 3x + 6y = 8 and x - 6y = 4, then you should write the first equation over the second, with the addition sign outside the quantity of the second system, showing that you'll be subtracting each of the terms in that equation.

3x + 6y = 8
+(x - 6y = 4)



, Now that you've lined up the two equations, all you have to do is add the like terms. You can take it one term at a time:


3x + x = 4x
6y + -6y = 0
8 + 4 = 12
When you combine it all together, you get your new product:

3x + 6y = 8
+(x - 6y = 4)
= 4x + 0 = 12



, Once you've eliminated one of the variables by getting a term of 0 when you subtract variables with the same coefficient, you should just solve for the remaining variable by solving a regular equation. You can remove the 0 from the equation since it won't change its value.


4x + 0 = 12
4x = 12
Divide 4x and 12 by 3 to get x = 3

, Now that you know that x = 3, you just have to plug it into one of the original equations to solve for y. It doesn't matter which one you choose because the answer will be the same. If one of the equations looks more complicated than the other, just plug it into the easier equation.


Plug x = 3 into the equation x - 6y = 4 to solve for y.
3 - 6y = 4
-6y = 1
Divide -6y and 1 by -6 to get y = -1/6

You have solved the system of equations by addition. (x, y) = (3, -1/6)



, To make sure that you solved the system of equations correctly, you can just plug in your two answers to both equations to make sure that they work both times. Here's how to do it:


Plug (3, -1/6) in for (x, y) in the equation 3x + 6y = 8.

3(3) + 6(-1/6) = 8
9 - 1 = 8
8 = 8


Plug (3, -1/6) in for (x, y) in the equation x - 6y = 4.

2 (2x - y = 2)
4x - 2y = 4

, Now, just use the addition or subtraction method on the two equations based on which method would eliminate the variable with the same coefficient. Since you're working with 2y and -2y, you should use the addition method because 2y + -2y is equal to 0. If you were working with 2y and positive 2y, then you would use the subtraction method. Here's how to use the addition method to eliminate one of the variables:


3x + 2y = 10

x + 4y = 2
x = 2 - 4y

, Take the value you found when you isolated the variable and replace that value instead of the variable in the equation that you did not manipulate. You won't be able to solve anything if you plug it back into the equation you just manipulated. Here's what to do:


x = 2 - 4y --> 2x + 3y = 9
2(2 - 4y) + 3y = 9
4 - 8y + 3y = 9
4 - 5y = 9
-5y = 9 - 4

y = -1 --> x = 2 - 4y
x = 2 - 4(-1)
x = 2 - -4
x = 2 + 4

If necessary, rearrange your equation to get one fraction on each side of the equals sign.,
Cross-multiply.,
Set the two products as equal to each other.,
Solve for your variable.",How to Solve Rational Equations1," Cross-multiplication is a quick, easy way of solving rational equations. Unfortunately, this method only works for rational equations that contain exactly one rational expression or fraction on each side of the equals sign. If your equation isn't in proper cross-multiplication form, you may need to use algebraic operations to move its terms into their proper places.


For instance, the equation (x + 3)/4 - x/(-2) = 0 can easily be rearranged into cross-multiplication form by adding x/(-2) to both sides of the equation, leaving you with (x + 3)/4 = x/(-2).

Keep in mind that decimals and whole numbers can be made into fractions by giving them a denominator of 1. (x + 3)/4 - 2.5 = 5, for instance, can be rewritten as (x + 3)/4 = 7.5/1, making it a valid candidate for cross-multiplication.


Some rational equations can't easily be reduced into a form with one fraction or rational equation on each side of the equals sign. In such cases, use a lowest common denominator approach.;
, Cross-multiplication simply means multiplying one fraction's numerator by the other's denominator and vice versa. Multiply the numerator of the fraction on the left of the equal sign by the denominator of the fraction on the right. Repeat with the numerator of the right-hand fraction and the denominator of the fraction on the left.


Cross-multiplication works according to basic algebraic principals. Rational expressions and other fractions can be made into non-fractions by multiplying them by their denominators. Cross-multiplication is basically a handy shortcut for multiplying both sides of the equation by both fraction's denominators. Don't believe it? Try it - you'll get the same results after simplifying.

, After cross-multiplying, you'll have two products. Set these two terms equal to each other and simplify to get each side of the equation in its simplest terms.


For example, if your original rational expression was (x+3)/4 = x/(-2), after cross multiplying, your new equation is -2(x+3) = 4x. If we wish, this can also be written as -2x - 6 = 4x.

, Use algebraic operations to solve for the variable in your equation. Remember that, if x appears on both sides of the equals sign, you'll need to add or subtract x terms to both sides to get x terms on only one side of the equals sign


In our example, we can divide both sides of the equation by -2, giving us x+3 = -2x. Subtracting x from both sides gives us 3 = -3x. Finally, dividing both sides by -3 gives us -1 = x, which we can re-write as x = -1. We have found x, solving our rational equation.

Recognize identical equations as having infinite solutions.,
Find systems with no solution.,
Use a matrix for systems with more than two variables.",How to Solve Systems Using Linear Combinations5," In some circumstances, your system of linear equations may have infinite solutions. This means that any pair of values that you insert into the two variables will make the two equations correct. This happens when the two equations are really just algebraic variations of the same, single equation.

For example, consider these two equations:


2x+8y=18{\displaystyle 2x+8y=18}


x+4y=9{\displaystyle x+4y=9}



If you begin working on this system and try creating a pair of matching coefficients, you will find that by multiplying the second equation by 2 you will create the equation 2x+8y=18{\displaystyle 2x+8y=18}. This is an exact match of the first equation. If you proceed through the steps, you will eventually get the result 0=0{\displaystyle 0=0}. 

A solution of 0=0 means that you have “infinite” solutions or you can simply say that the two equations are identical.

If you consider this system graphically and plot the lines that are represented by the two equations, the “infinite” solution means that the two lines lie exactly one on top of the other. It is really only one line.


, Occasionally you may have a system in which the two equations, when written in standard form, are nearly identical except that the constant term C is different. Such a system has no solution.

Consider these equations:


4x+2y=6{\displaystyle 4x+2y=6}


2x+y=4{\displaystyle 2x+y=4}



At first glance, these look like very different equations. However, when you begin solving and multiply each term of the second equation by 2 to try to create matching coefficients, you will wind up with the two equations:


4x+2y=6{\displaystyle 4x+2y=6}


4x+2y=8{\displaystyle 4x+2y=8}



This is an impossible situation, since the expression 4x+2y{\displaystyle 4x+2y} cannot equal both 6 and 8 at the same time. If you were to try solving this by subtracting the terms, you would reach the result 0=−2{\displaystyle 0=-2}, which is an incorrect statement. In such a circumstance, your response is that there is no solution to this system.

If you consider what this system means graphically, these are two parallel lines. They will never intersect, so there is no single solution to the system.


, It is possible for a system of linear equations to have more than two variables. You may have 3, 4, or as many variables as the problem dictates. Finding a solution to the system means finding a single value for each variable that makes each equation in the system correct. To find a single, unique solution, you must have as many equations as you have variables. Thus, if you have the variables x,y{\displaystyle x,y} and z{\displaystyle z}, you need three equations.

Solving a system of three or more variables can be done using the linear combinations explained here, but that gets very complicated. The preferred method is using matrices, which is too advanced for this article. You may wish to read Use a Graphing Calculator to Solve a Systems of Equations.

Dress sharply.,
Maintain hygiene.,
Take care of your hair.,
Maintain your possessions.,
Control your body language.,
Stay active.",How to Win Friends and Influence People1," Think about costumes. People wear costumes to project an image others will understand immediately, whether it's zombie, firefighter, or bride. The fact is, every outfit you wear is a costume – even your day-to-day clothes. They say a lot about you to the people who see them. Use your clothes to project an image of yourself that shows people the traits they look for in a friend: confidence, happiness, stability.


Generally speaking, this means wearing clean, crisp, well-fit items of clothing that are coordinated so that colors and patterns complement each other. This shows that you like yourself well enough to mind your appearance, are responsible enough to maintain it, and are confident enough not to hide it.;
, At handshake distance and closer, the difference between poor hygiene and proper hygiene becomes readily apparent. If you want to connect with people, you're going to need to get that close, so it pays to keep your body as clean and well-maintained as you keep your clothes. Shower daily, washing your hair no less than 3 and no more than 5 times a week; brush your teeth at least twice daily, and floss at least once daily; wash your face, comb or brush your hair, and apply deodorant every morning. Be mindful of longer-term considerations such as keeping your nails clipped and, for men, keeping your facial hair properly trimmed or shaved.


Women can choose to shave their underarm and leg hair based on their personal preference, but be aware that some people still consider not shaving those areas a sign of poor self-image or self-discipline. To reach the widest potential audience, it's still safest to keep them shaved smooth.

, No matter the length of your hair, you should maintain it with regular cuts, thins, or trims at a salon or barber shop you trust. Be sure you can always make it look neat and sharp, even if you don't always wear it that way at home.

, More specifically speaking, your home and your vehicle (if you have one) are the two most important things you should be keeping up. You never know when you'll have unexpected guests, or who'll see your bike or car as you're getting into or out of it. Besides, keeping your surroundings neat helps you to feel good about your life.


Cars should be washed every month or so, kept clean of detritus on the seats and floor, and be serviced according to a regular schedule for things like oil changes and tire rotation. Bicycles should be hand washed every month or so (more if your bike tends to get muddy or dusty), and tuned up twice a year at a bike shop.
Your home should stay as neat as you can reasonably keep it. Clear dishes and clean the kitchen after dinner every day to avoid buildup. Wash laundry as often as you can afford to, and be sure to fold it and put it away once it's clean. If you have a yard, keep it free of debris by raking it periodically. Keep your walkway and driveway swept and neat.

, It's been said time and again, because it's true: body language is a powerful means of communication between people. This is because it's hard to fake, and says a lot about our emotional states from moment to moment. In many ways, observing a person's body language as they speak can tell you more about that person than the words he or she is speaking. That's why it's so important to do what you can to use your own body language to tell people what they'd like to hear about you.


Body language is complex and very context sensitive: the same motion or posture can have different meanings based on who exhibits it, where, and when. Rather than trying to read everyone else's body language, try to make yours easy for them to read instead. Control what you can control and disregard everything else.
Move boldly and without hesitation. This doesn't mean you should move quickly or sharply; rather it means your movements should broadcast an aura of confidence. When you shake someone's hand, give it a good firm squeeze – you'll be surprised how many people notice. Walk smoothly at your own pace, without stepping gingerly or hunching your shoulders. Let your arms swing as you step.
Mind your posture. It's been said time and again by every third-grade teacher across the globe, but proper posture is important. Your shoulders should rest slightly back from your chest, keeping your back from hunching forward. Your neck should continue the line of your spine, and not allow your chin to jut forward. Proper posture not only demonstrates confidence and self-esteem, it also allows you to breathe more easily, and reduces the risk of chronic back pain as you get older.
Use your face to your advantage. If the eyes are the windows to the soul, the face is a floodgate waiting to be opened. Always do your best to smile genuinely, make generous eye contact (especially when others are talking to you), and let your face be animated, which shows sincerity and empathy. People would rather be around someone who smiles and laughs all the time than someone who always looks distant or serious.

, Even an unhealthy body gets an aura of health around it when the owner of that body makes a sustained effort to reinvigorate it. Exercise as regularly as you can, and eat modestly. If you have trouble setting any kind of a schedule, remember that any effort is still better than no effort at all. Even just a few minutes of exercise after you wake up or come home from work will help you maintain your posture, control your body language, and have more energy.

Now check sqrt(2), sqrt(3), e and create your own patterns, which is probably pretty exciting for some of you!,Save the worksheet as Approach 1, or similar fitting name, and save the file as Continued Fractions, or similar filename.,
Final image:





",How to Start Working with Continued Fractions2," In Preferences, General, make sure the ""Use R1C1 reference style"" box is unchecked, so that the columns are represented alphabetically.;
, Here is what you need to know:

It is known that 40/31 is larger than 1, so 31/31 + 9/31 will be the last step for 40/31;
Each step is inverted, so 31/9 will be the next to last step, i.e. 27/9 =3, so 3+4/9, for 40/31 only;
The 4/9 will need to be inverted so the first step will be 9/4, which is 2+1/4, for 40/31.
Enter into cells A1 to A4 the number sequence 4, 2, 3, 1.
Enter into cell C2, 2+1/4
Enter into cell C3, 3+1/(2+1/4) and notice how the info in cell C2 was repeated in the denominator.

Copy cell C4 to cell C6 and paste it, then insert an = sign at the beginning and hit return. The same result, 1.29032258064516, will appear due to the correctness of the continued fraction just constructed.

, The framework of a continued fraction is derived from it.

Dividing by x we can rewrite it as Equation : x= b +1/x
Substitute the expression for x given by the right-hand side of this equation for x in the denominator on the right-hand side to get Equation : x = b + 1/(b+ 1/x)
Continue this incestuous procedure indefinitely, to produce a never-ending staircase of fractions that is a type-setter’s nightmare, Equation (usually descending vertically with each denomination line and growing smaller and smaller in font size):

x = b + 1/(b+ 1/(b+ 1/(b + ...)))
This staircase is an example of a continued fraction. If we return to Equation 1 then we can simply solve the quadratic equation to find the positive solution for that is given by the continued fraction expansion of Equation 4; it is Equation : x = (b + sqrt(b^2 +4))/2


Picking b=1, generate the continued fraction expansion of the golden mean, phi, as Equation :

Phi = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 = 1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+...)))))))))))








Define a general continued fraction of a number as Equation :

a0+1/(a1+1/(a2+1/(a3+1/(1+...+1/(an+...)))))
Where the an = are n+1 positive integers, called the partial quotients of the continued fraction expansion (cfe).



,, Continued fractions can be finite in length or infinite, as in our example above. Finite CFE's are unique so long as we do not allow a quotient of in the final entry in the bracket (equation 8), so for example, we should write 1/2 as rather than as . We can always eliminate a 1 from the last entry by adding to the previous entry.

If cfe's are finite in length then they must be evaluated level by level (starting at the bottom) and will reduce always to a rational fraction; for example, the cfe 40/31 done above. However, cfes can be infinite in length, as in Equation 6 above. Infinite cfes produce representations of irrational numbers.
If we make some different choices for the constant in Equations 4 and 5 then we can generate some other interesting expansions for numbers which are solutions of the quadratic equation. In fact, all roots of quadratic equations with integer coefficients, like Equation 5, have cfes which are eventually periodic, like or .
Here are the leading terms from a few notable examples of infinite cfes:

e         = sqrt(2) = sqrt(3) = π         = , Now that you see how it's done, you can continue the process! Have fun!!

In cell A8, use Option+p to make the pi symbol, π. Make it bold and aligned center.
Into cell B8, enter the formula, without quotes, ""=PI()"". Do Format Cells Fill Canary Yellow and Font Firetruck Red.
From cell A9 to cell A31, input the numbers in the pi series above, from .
Since the first number in the series, 3, is followed by a semi-colon, it will always lead the progression of the continued fraction, unlike for the example of 40/31.
Enter to cell C10, 3+1/7.
Enter to cell C11, 3+1/(7+(1/15)).
Enter to cell C12, 3+1/(7+(1/(15+1/(1)))).
Enter to cell C13, 3+1/(7+(1/(15+1/(1+1/(292)))))
Enter to cell D10, 22/7.
Enter to cell D11, 333/106
Enter to cell D12, 355/113.

Enter to cell E13, 99306/33102 + 4687/33102
Enter to cell F13, or make a Comment to cell E13 that  99306/33102 + 4687/33102 =     (3*((7*4687)+293))/((7*((15*293)+292))+293)+(((15*293)+292))/((7*((15*293)+292))+293)    where 4687 = ((15*293)+292).
The result of that = 3.1415926530119, vs. π = 3.14159265358979, so that's a fairly good approximation.
Now, let's see if there's an easier way. You should still have the series of pi CFEs in the range from in cells A9 to A31. If not, input them and check them now.

, The result should equal 84.5, The result should equal 1.01183431952663, The result in cell B10 should be 3.14159265358979 which is pi, accurate to 14 decimal places (which is as good as it gets in Microsoft Excel)., It will take some time and concentration but you will come to appreciate the work of the man who figured it out in 1685, John Wallis (the teacher and contemporary of Isaac Newton).

For irrational numbers, we are looking at a fractal expression. Note that there are 23 rows from A9 to B31 required to get the accuracy of 14 decimals. I do not know the relation of one to the other, but it seems that this is a fairly formidable means of calculating pi fairly precisely. n.b. If all the numerators in the continued fraction expansion = 1, then it is called ""canonical"", else it is termed ""generalized"". The following convergent cfe's for π are generalized:

Know when finding a Lowest Common Denominator is appropriate.,
Examine the denominator of each fraction.,
Multiply each fraction, in the rational equation by 1.,
Simplify and solve for x.",How to Solve Rational Equations2," Lowest Common Denominators (LCD's) can be used to simplify rational equations, making it possible to solve for their variables. Finding an LCD is a good idea when your rational equation can't easily be written in a form that has one (and only one) fraction or rational expression on each side of the equals sign. For solving rational equations with three terms or more, LCD's are a helpful tool. However, for solving rational equations with only two terms, cross-multiplication can be faster.

, Identify the lowest number that each denominator divides into evenly. This is the LCD for your equation.


Sometimes the lowest common denominator - that is, the lowest number that has each of the existing denominators as a factor - is obvious. For example, if your expression is x/3 + 1/2 = (3x+1)/6, it's not hard to see that the smallest number with 3, 2 and 6 as a factor, is, in fact, 6.
Often, however, a rational equation's LCD isn't immediately obvious. In these cases, try examining multiples of the larger denominator until you find one that contains all of the smaller denominators as a factor. Often, the LCD is a multiple of two of the denominators. For example, in the equation x/8 + 2/6 = (x - 3)/9, the LCD is 8*9 = 72.
If one or more of your fractions' denominators contains a variable, this process is more involved, but not impossible. In these cases, the LCD will be an expression (containing variables) that all the denominators divide into, not a single number. For example, in the equation 5/(x-1) = 1/x + 2/(3x), the LCD is 3x(x-1), because each denominator divides into it evenly - dividing it by (x-1) gives 3x, dividing it by 3x gives (x-1), and dividing it by x gives 3(x-1).

, Multiplying each term by 1 may seem pointless. However, there's a trick. 1 can be defined as any number over itself - 2/2 and 3/3, for example, are also valid ways of writing ""1."" This method takes advantage of this alternate definition. Multiply each fraction in your rational equation by 1, writing 1 each time as the number or term which multiplies with each denominator to give the LCD over itself.


In our basic example, we would multiply x/3 by 2/2 to get 2x/6 and multiply 1/2 by 3/3 to get 3/6. 3x +1/6 already has 6, the LCD, as its denominator, so we can either multiply it by 1/1 or leave it alone.
In our example with variables in the denominators of our fractions, the process is slightly trickier. Since our LCD is 3x(x-1), we multiply each rational expression by the term which it multiplies with to give 3x(x-1) over itself. We would multiply 5/(x-1) by (3x)/(3x) giving 5(3x)/(3x)(x-1), multiply 1/x by 3(x-1)/3(x-1) to give 3(x-1)/3x(x-1), and multiply 2/(3x) by (x-1)/(x-1) to give 2(x-1)/3x(x-1).

, Now that every term in your rational equation has the same denominator, you can eliminate the denominators from the equation and solve the numerators. Simply multiply both sides of the equation to get your numerators by themselves. Then, use algebraic operations to get x (or whatever other variable you are solving for) alone by itself on one side of the equals sign.


In our basic example, after multiplying every term by alternate forms of 1, we get 2x/6 + 3/6 = (3x+1)/6. Two fractions can be added together if they have the same denominator, so we can simplify this equation as (2x+3)/6 = (3x+1)/6 without changing its value. Multiply both sides by 6 to cancel the denominators, which leaves us with 2x+3 = 3x+1. Subtract 1 from both sides to get 2x+2 = 3x, and subtract 2x from both sides to get 2 = x, which can be written as x = 2.
In our example with variables in the denominators, our equation after multiplying each term by ""1"" is 5(3x)/(3x)(x-1) = 3(x-1)/3x(x-1) + 2(x-1)/3x(x-1). Multiplying each term by our LCD allows us to cancel the denominators, giving us 5(3x) = 3(x-1) + 2(x-1). This works to 15x = 3x - 3 + 2x -2, which simplifies to 15x = x - 5. Subtracting x from both sides gives 14x = -5, which, finally, simplifies to x = -5/14.

Brush up on classical rhetoric.,
Practice active listening.,
Speak well.,
Use agreeable language.,
Match rhythms with those around you.,
Demonstrate your good character.",How to Win Friends and Influence People2," Great public speakers come and go, but few have left such a lasting impression on the Western world as Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher. His approach to rhetoric, recorded over 2000 years ago, is still one of the most useful frameworks available for figuring out how to maximize the persuasiveness of anything you want to say. Aristotle divides the elements of any persuasive argument into three vital parts. By combining all of them harmoniously, you can craft an appeal or argument that is very difficult to resist.


Create a strong backbone with logos. Logos is the clarity, organization, and internal consistency of what it is you want to say. Speech that's imbued with logos can't be twisted around to mean anything other than what you want it to mean. Any attempts to do so by a naysayer will only result in him or her seeming foolish.
Add credibility and believability by employing ethos. Ethos is the ethical foundation of your argument, which usually is reflected in your tone and style of delivery, as well as your personal presence of character (and reputation, if you're lucky enough to have a good one). Speech that employs ethos never leaves your personal convictions in doubt, and supports the notion that you know what you're talking about and can be trusted.
Appeal to your listeners with pathos. Pathos is the part of your argument that helps it connect to the listener's personal life, experience, feelings, and imagination. By sparking sympathetic emotions in your listener, speech with a lot of pathos makes your topic as much about them as it is about you, encouraging them to feel personally invested in whatever you say.

, Nothing makes people like you faster than being a good listener, but there's more to it than just sitting quietly and watching the other person's lips move. Being an active listener means utilizing certain techniques that demonstrate your attention to the speaker. With practice, all of these techniques will become a natural part of your communication repertoire.


When there's an appropriate pause, even mid-sentence, prompt the speaker with a small noise, such as “yeah” or “mm hmm.” Don't overdo it or you'll seem impatient. Once every few sentences is enough.
Whenever you think of a question to ask that will prompt the speaker to go into greater detail, ask it. Don't interrupt the speaker in mid-sentence, but otherwise, the sooner the better. This shows that you're so interested in the speaker's words, you want even more details.
Use neutral affirmation. If you're not quite sure what to think of a story, or whether you agree with it, riff on the speaker's emotional state to craft a response instead. If the speaker is looking at you as though he or she can't believe the story, agree with them by saying “wow, that's crazy” or something else that allows you to bond with the speaker without having to pick a specific side just yet.
When the story is finished, ask the speaker what they thought of it or how they felt about it. People love to summarize their thoughts after a longer anecdote.
After the story has been summarized, re-summarize it and throw it back at the speaker. This shows the speaker that you listened and understood what they were saying, and he or she will love you for it. You can follow through with your opinion afterward to drive the conversation. For instance, suppose someone tells you a story about their cat having to go to the vet for a sudden emergency. When the story is done, say “so your cat really did have (medical issue)? But at least you got him to the vet in time. Man, that's just (your opinion here).”
Use personal anecdotes, but don't overuse them. You're probably trying to show sympathy and understanding, but the listener will eventually begin to suspect you'd rather talk about yourself than listen to anyone else. Be moderate in your use of personal stories and anecdotes.

, Most people tend to think their voices are more or less set in stone, but this isn't the case. Although it's not possible to go from a soprano to a baritone, it is possible to exert a surprising amount of control over the overall tone of your voice, and over the clarity of the words that you speak.


Sing to learn voice control. One of the best ways to train your voice is simply to sing out loud. You don't have to have an ear for singing, or sing to anyone else. Try singing in your car or at home when you're doing chores. Over time, you'll gain greater control over the sounds your throat makes through sheer repetition.
Speak in smooth, round, low-register tones. This doesn't mean you should try to deepen your voice; it just means you should imagine a larger space at the back of your mouth and throat when you speak, and speak to fill it. Don't drive your words through your nose or a small, tightly-clenched throat passage. Speaking in full, clear tones makes you sound more knowledgeable, and makes your voice much more pleasant to listen to.
Give yourself plenty of volume. There's no need to yell when you speak, but don't speak meekly, either. Don't muffle your voice. It only makes you harder to understand, and it can also make you seem less sure of yourself.

, Just because people understand your words doesn't mean they'll grasp your intent properly. As anyone who has argued with a relative or lover over a miscommunication knows, there are good ways and bad ways to say what you have to say. By learning a few psycholinguistic tricks, you can learn to speak your mind in a way that not only keeps the listener from feeling upset or intimidated, but actually endears him or her to you.


Using “I” language is all about putting the burden of responsibility on yourself. During an argument, instead of accusing the other person of “making” you feel or act a certain way, phrase it like this: “When you (said/did/ whatever), I felt...” It seems silly in writing, but it works very well in a real argument because it keeps extra blame from being heaped onto the other person.

For example, instead of saying “When you said that, it made me mad,” say “when you said that, I felt mad.” You can use this phrasing for just about any kind of disagreement: “I felt like you were...,” “I feel (emotion) when you...,” and so on.


Using “we” language is all about making the other person feel included and relevant. When discussing opportunities, events, or group work, rely on “we” and “us” phrasing to cement the loyalty of your peers and suggest loyalty to those above you on the social or career ladder. For example, instead of asking someone “do you want to hang out with me this weekend?” say, “we should get together this weekend!” This puts the other person on equal footing with you and grants them power over the chance that's being offered.

Giving people power is a surefire way to gain power in return, because people will be much more inclined to bend and flex for you when the time comes to return the favor if they remember their past interactions with you in a positive and empowering light.



, Stage and street hypnotists alike use this powerful technique to dramatic effect every time they seem to “charm” someone into changing their mind or bending the rules a little bit. In principle, there isn't much to this technique, but it takes practice to become adept at using it.


Start with a short “in” to the conversation and use simple questions to get the other person talking. As you use your active listening skills, pay special attention to accents, verbal tics (such as “like” and “uh”), and general phrasing.
As you respond and continue to ask for what you want, speak more, but match the other person's verbal tics and patterns. Feel free to lean towards their accent a little too, but don't make a caricature of it. Speaking the way others speak puts them at ease and subtly suggests to them that they can trust you because you're like them in some indefinable way.
Whenever you notice something about the other person's body language, match it. Does he shift his weight from foot to foot? Is she tapping one finger as she waits for the computer to load, or all of them? You can match these little things to create an even more powerful sympathetic bond.

, Supportiveness, kindness, enthusiasm, boldness, and reliability are the key traits you should try to exhibit. These are the traits everyone looks for in others, the traits that make you a person people want to trust in and listen to. They start with personal sincerity and dedication, and are hard to fake. However, if you focus on them, you can train yourself to exhibit them more often and more freely than you did before.


Affirm yourself every day. It sounds silly, but self-affirmation works. Just think about the positive traits you want to embody, and say them aloud to yourself a few times. Tell yourself you are a person who has them: “I am a kind person;” “I am an enthusiastic person;” and so on.
Look for opportunities to demonstrate your better qualities. Many times, due to personal discomfort with a situation, we pass up the bolder choice in favor of the one that will attract less attention. Fight against that by reminding yourself to keep your eyes open for times when you're about to act dismissively or rudely. When you realize you're about to be that unhappy, jaded person, force yourself to be the person people want to be around instead. Even if it doesn't make any difference to the situation, it's excellent training for your mind. Eventually, you'll internalize it.

Stay cool-headed.,
Use his arguments against him, rationally.,
Recognize when you've won.,
Learn his habits.,
If he is making a rule, consider the fairness of it.,
If he is making a demand, decide whether you should grant it.,
Remember that, generally, the way to win against someone like this can be summarized with the 5 Ws:


Who: Can the person that you are arguing against eventually be persuaded to accept defeat, or is he completely unwilling to lose?,
Recognize the Reverse.",How to Win an Argument Against Someone Who Won't Lose," When these people are losing an argument, they tend to do little more than cut you off and then insult you. If you become irritated or enraged, they can continue to insult you as they know you are weak at that point. Your anger can fuel their anger as well. However, when you stay rational and calm, you can continue to prove their points wrong without getting into physical violence.;
, Often when he insults you, he may not realize that he is calling you what he truly is. Let's say he calls you a hypocrite, for some reason. If you've known him for a while, you can bring him back to a certain point in time that he was being a massive hypocrite and tell him that he himself was once a hypocrite, and indeed, is still a hypocrite for calling you a hypocrite when he once was one. If he commands you to do something absolutely impossible, like videotape someone's mind, then you can ask him, ""If I asked you to do that, would you?"" If he says yes, prompt him to. If he reluctantly says no, you could actually get him to accept that you won, for you can see that he conceded defeat on one point. Try to get him to accept defeat by convincing him that his other points are also wrong. If he does not answer your question at all and instead insults you, see the next step.

, Usually, these people will never see that you've truly won the argument. However, you can. At a certain point when you've backed him into a corner with no arguments left to say against you, the only thing he's got left is his insults. At this point, you know that you've won the argument, even if he does not accept this point. You can choose to walk away here, if circumstances allow.

, People have certain movements, facial expressions or gestures when they reach the point where they have lost. Some hide it well, some burst into tears, and, in the case of these people, some assume an apathetic face that ignores your rational argument. When you see that on the person's face instead of anger, contempt or sarcasm, you may have won. However, some people plaster an ignorant mask onto their face when the argument has just begun. They will have something to mark their loss, though. Look for it.

, The person may be trying to secure a rule that is completely unfair to one group of people while placing the other group in a superior position. Tell him that it's unfair, and explain why. He might dismiss your explanation with a wave and use some tiny justification by giving the lesser group a minuscule bonus to their pitiful status. In this case, you can inform him that it is still unfair. This can keep going on for very long, so you can tell him what you have in mind. Note that what you have in mind must be truly fair, or he can jump on the chance to insult you and your hypocrisy. Perhaps he will deny the unfairness of the rule, in which case you can prompt him to explain his position. After listening attentively to his explanation, you can decide whether it is correct in your mind or not.

, You can follow previous tips from this guide in this situation. If he is asking to obtain something impossible, ask him whether he could retrieve this item himself. If he says yes, ask him to, if he says no, try to get him to understand that you won, and if he insults you and tells you to ""just get it,"" you can tell him that it is impossible and ask him if he can get it himself again. ""Just get it"" is never a reasonable argument, and you have to make him understand that. If he asks you to respect him more, ask why. If he simply places himself as superior, ask why he deserves that. Until you receive proper reasons, you should not respect him more than anyone else at his rank. Any other demands can be seen in much the same way.

,
What: The topic that you are arguing about, the request that you are considering, whatever you might be arguing about it very important. You have to consider all the facts about your topic as you argue, so you don't miss something important that the person can jump on and use against you.
When: Choose an appropriate time to confront this person, or for him to meet you if his first confrontation is at a bad time. You are better arguing when you are clear-minded than when you are clouded with emotions or tiredness.
Where: Pick a place where any shouting won't disturb many people, like outdoors where many people are shouting with fun anyway. However, if you know that your opponent can manage to keep a cool head, the location does not particularly matter.
Why: Always know his reasons. If he does not share them with you first, demand them. If he has no reasons, his argument has no base and will soon crumble.

, In the guide above, it has been stated what to do if a person came to you, led the argument until you took control of it, made the request and made the demands. However, you may be the person to confront another. It is not much different if you are making a request, but the one that would grant it simply refuses to. You must be the opposite of the person depicted above, presenting a fair request, giving proper reasons, etc. It's really no different. All you need to do is argue in the same logical way while staying calm.

Write your 2 equations clearly.,
In the first equation, let x be 0.,
Let y be 0.,
Draw a graph with 4 quadrants.,
In the second equation, let x be 0.,
Let y be 0.,
Draw the line of the second equation on the same graph as before.,
Look at the point in which the 2 lines meet.",How to Solve Simultaneous Equations Graphically," Write your 2 equations in an organised, clear way. This will make it easier later.


In this guide, we are going to use equations 3x+4y=22 and x+2y=2 as an example.;
, Replace x with 0, and solve the equation. This should give you the value of y.


Using the example before: 3*0+4y=22, which becomes 4y=22, and then y=5½
You now have your first coordinate, (0 ; 5½)

, In the first equation, let y be 0 and solve the equation. This will give you the value of x.


Using the example: 3x+4*0=22 which becomes 3x=22 which gives us the answer of x=7⅓
You now have a set of coordinates for your first line, (0 ; 5½) and (7⅓ ; 0)

, Draw the line of your first equation on it.

, Then solve the equation, giving you the value of y.


Using the example, it's 0+2y=2, which becomes 2y=2 and y=1
First coordinate is now (0 ; 1)

, Solve the equation and get the value of x.


Example: x+2*0=2, which becomes x=2.
Second coordinate is now (2 ; 0)

, If needed, increase the length of the 2 lines until they meet.

, Get it's coordinates (x ; y). The x coordinate will be the value of x in the equation, and the y coordinate will be the value of y!


If you've been using the example, the lines should meet at point (18 ; -8). x will be 18, and y will be -8!

Isolate the radical term.,
Square both sides of the equation.,
Repeat the previous steps if necessary.,
Consolidate and combine like terms.,
Solve the equation.,
Determine your solutions.,
Recognize the potential for an extraneous solution.,
Test each of your solutions in the original problem.,
Discard the extraneous solution and report your result.",How to Solve Radical Equations with Extraneous Solutions," The first step to solving a radical equation is to move the radical term to stand alone on one side of the equation. Move all other terms to the opposite side. In this step, if possible, combine any other like terms that may exist.Consider the sample problem x−1+4=x−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-1}}+4=x-3}. Your first step is to isolate the radical on the left side of the equation, as follows:


x−1+4=x−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-1}}+4=x-3}


x−1+4−4=x−3−4{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-1}}+4-4=x-3-4} ………. (subtract 4 from both sides)


x−1=x−7{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-1}}=x-7} ………. (combine like terms)


;
, To remove the radical sign from the problem, you need to perform its opposite function. The opposite of the square root function is to square both sides of the equation. Be careful, when squaring both sides of the equation, to do so correctly. Recall, for example, that (x−7)2{\displaystyle (x-7)^{2}} is NOT x2−72{\displaystyle x^{2}-7^{2}}. You need to treat the (x−7){\displaystyle (x-7)} term as a binomial and square it accordingly.Continue working with the sample problem and square both sides of it as follows:


x−1=x−7{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-1}}=x-7}


(x−1)2=(x−7)2{\displaystyle ({\sqrt {x-1}})^{2}=(x-7)^{2}}


x−1=x2−14x+49{\displaystyle x-1=x^{2}-14x+49}



If you need help with this step, you may want to review Multiply Binomials.


, If your original problem contained two or more radical terms, then the first round of isolating and squaring may not have removed all the radicals. If that is the case, then you should, once again, manipulate your equation to isolate the radical that remains and square each side again.An example of such a problem would be something like 2x−5−x−1=1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2x-5}}-{\sqrt {x-1}}=1}. Because of the two radicals, you will need to do this procedure twice.


, After you have eliminated all the radicals from the problem, move all the terms to one side of the equation and combine like terms.Returning to the working sample problem, this looks as follows:


x−1=x2−14x+49{\displaystyle x-1=x^{2}-14x+49}


0=x2−15x+50{\displaystyle 0=x^{2}-15x+50}




, In most cases, this step will create a quadratic polynomial. This is an equation that contains an x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term as its highest variable. If the original radical was something other than a square root (such as a cube root or fourth root, for example), then you may have a more difficult problem. We will focus on the quadratic for this article. You may be able to solve the quadratic equation by factoring, or you can go directly to the quadratic formula.In this case, the sample problem, 0=x2−15x+50{\displaystyle 0=x^{2}-15x+50}, can be factored into the two binomial factors of (x−5){\displaystyle (x-5)} and (x−10){\displaystyle (x-10)}. 


, Factoring the quadratic equation in this case suggests two possible solutions. Because the quadratic equation is equal to 0, you find the solutions by setting each factor equal to 0 and then solve.In the working problem, the two factors are (x−5){\displaystyle (x-5)} and (x−10){\displaystyle (x-10)}.

Set each of these equal to 0 to get the solutions x=5{\displaystyle x=5} and x=10{\displaystyle x=10}.

With another problem, you may not be able to factor and would then have to use the quadratic formula to find the solution.


, Recall that after isolating the radical on one side of the equation, you then squared both sides to remove the radical sign. This is a necessary step to solving the problem. However, the squaring operation is what creates the extraneous solutions.Remember some basic mathematics, that both a negative and a positive number, when squared, will give the same result. For example, (−3)2{\displaystyle (-3)^{2}} and 32{\displaystyle 3^{2}} both give the answer of 9{\displaystyle 9}. However, both the negative and positive numbers might not be solutions to whatever problem you are solving. The one that does not work is called the extraneous solution.


, After you have found the solutions to your problem, you may have found one, two or more different possible values for the variable. You need to check each of these in the original problem to see which work. Remember that the original problem here was x−1+4=x−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-1}}+4=x-3}.First check the solution x=5{\displaystyle x=5}:


x−1+4=x−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-1}}+4=x-3}


5−1+4=5−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {5-1}}+4=5-3} ………. (substitute 5 for x)


4+4=5−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {4}}+4=5-3}


2+4=5−3{\displaystyle 2+4=5-3}


6=2{\displaystyle 6=2}.

Because your result is an incorrect statement, the original solution of x=5{\displaystyle x=5} must be an extraneous solution that was caused by the squaring process.



Check the second solution x=10{\displaystyle x=10}:


x−1+4=x−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-1}}+4=x-3}


10−1+4=10−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {10-1}}+4=10-3}


9+4=10−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9}}+4=10-3}


3+4=10−3{\displaystyle 3+4=10-3}


7=7{\displaystyle 7=7}

In this case, you get a true statement. This shows that the solution x=10{\displaystyle x=10} is a true solution to the original problem.




, The extraneous solution is incorrect and can be discarded. Whatever remains is the answer to your problem. In this case, you would report that x=10{\displaystyle x=10}."

Isolate the variable and radical on one side of the equation.,
Square both sides of the equation to remove the radical.,
Check your answers in the original problem.,
Use the same technique for more complicated roots, not just squares.,
Remember to square both sides of the equation, not just the terms.",How to Solve Radical Equations1," This is just like solving for any other algebraic equation. Combine like terms and add/subtract numbers so that your variable and radical stand alone. If it helps, treat the x{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}} like a normal ""x"" in any other problem, and solve for that. For example, with the problem x+3=10{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}+3=10}:


Isolate x{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}}: x+3=10{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}+3=10}


Subtract 3 from both sides: x+3−3=10−3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}+3-3=10-3}


Simplify both sides: x=7{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}=7};
, All you have to do to undo a radical is square it. Because you need the equation to stay balanced, you square both sides, just like you added or subtracted from both sides earlier. So, for the example:


Isolate x{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}}: x=7{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}=7}


Square both sides: (x)2=(7)2{\displaystyle ({\sqrt {x}})^{2}=(7)^{2}}


Final answer: x=49{\displaystyle x=49}, When solving radical equations, you can get answers that don't actually fit the problem. You must always check your solutions to make sure you have all real answers. To check an answer, simply plug in each answer for ""x"" in the original equation:


Original Equation: x+3=10{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}+3=10}


Substitute 49 for x: 49+3=10{\displaystyle {\sqrt {49}}+3=10}


Solve: 7+3=10{\displaystyle 7+3=10}


Our solution is valid: 10=10{\displaystyle 10=10}, This same strategy works no matter what the root, like x3−1=3{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}-1=3}. You just need to raise both sides to the same power as the root. So, for this example:


Isolate x3{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}}: x3−1=3{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}-1=3}


Add 1 to both sides: x3−1+1=3+1{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}-1+1=3+1}


Simplify both sides: x3=4{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}=4}


Cube both sides: (x3)3=(4)3{\displaystyle ({\sqrt{x}})^{3}=(4)^{3}}


Final Answer: 64


Check Solution: 643−1=4−1=3{\displaystyle {\sqrt{64}}-1=4-1=3}, When removing the radical, you square both sides of the equation. If you have multiple terms, such as the equation x=2x+3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}=2x+3}, you must square the entire side, not the individual terms (2x2{\displaystyle 2x^{2}} and 32{\displaystyle 3^{2}} are both incorrect). Before solving for x in the example, then:


Original Equation: x=2x+3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}=2x+3}


Square both sides: (x)2=(2x+3)2{\displaystyle ({\sqrt {x}})^{2}=(2x+3)^{2}}

For example, the inequality x(x+4)<21{\displaystyle x(x+4)<21} is not in standard form. First, you need to use the distributive property to multiply x{\displaystyle x} and x+4{\displaystyle x+4}. Then, you need to subtract 21 from both sides of the inequality:x(x+4)<21{\displaystyle x(x+4)<21}x2+4x<21{\displaystyle x^{2}+4x<21}x2+4x−21<21−21{\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<21-21}x2+4x−21<0{\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<0}
;
, To factor the inequality, you need to find two binomials whose product equals the standard form of the inequality. A binomial is a two-termed expression.To do this, you need to complete the  FOIL method in reverse. Begin by finding two factors for the first term of each binomial.

For example, x×x=x2{\displaystyle x\times x=x^{2}}, so you can begin setting up your factors like this: (x)(x)<0{\displaystyle (x)(x)<0}.


, These two factors must also have a sum equal to the second term in the inequality. You will likely need to do some guess-and-check work at this time, to see which two factors meet these two requirements. Make sure you pay close attention to the positive and negative signs as well.

For example:


7×−3=−21{\displaystyle 7\times -3=-21} 

-21 is the third term in the inequality, so these two factors (7 and -3) might work. Now you need to see whether the sum of these factors equals the second term (4{\displaystyle 4}) of the inequality. 

Since 7+−3=4{\displaystyle 7+-3=4}, these two factors meet both requirements. So, your factored inequality is (x+7)(x−3)<0{\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0}.




, If, according to the inequality, the product of the factors is greater than zero, then either both factors will be negative (less than 0), or both factors will be positive (greater than 0), since a negative times a negative equals a positive, and a positive times a positive equals a positive.If the inequality is greater than or equal to (≥{\displaystyle \geq }) or less than or equal to (≤{\displaystyle \leq }), one or both of the factors may be zero.

For example, for the inequality (x+7)(x−3)<0{\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0}, the product of the factors is less than 0, and so the two factors will not have the same sign.


, If, according to the inequality, the product of the factors is less than 0, then one factor will be less than 0, or negative, and the other factor will be greater than zero, or positive. This is because a negative times a positive equals a negative. 

Again, if the inequality is greater than or equal to (≥{\displaystyle \geq }) or less than or equal to (≤{\displaystyle \leq }), one or both of the factors may be zero.

For example, for the inequality (x+7)(x−3)<0{\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0}, the product of the factors is less than 0, and so the two factors will have different signs.


, Write these options by turning each factor into an inequality, based on whether they will have the same or opposite signs. You should have two options. For example, you found that the factors of the inequality (x+7)(x−3)<0{\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0} must have opposite signs, so your options would be stated thusly:x+7<0{\displaystyle x+7<0} AND x−3>0{\displaystyle x-3>0} (That is, the first factor will be negative, and the second factor will be positive.)ORx+7>0{\displaystyle x+7>0} AND x−3<0{\displaystyle x-3<0} (That is, the first factor will be positive, and the second factor will be negative.)


, To simplify, isolate the x{\displaystyle x} variable for each factor. Don’t forget that if you multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, you must flip the inequality sign.For example, the first option for (x+7)(x−3)<0{\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0} was that x+7<0{\displaystyle x+7<0} AND x−3>0{\displaystyle x-3>0}. 

First, solve x+7<0{\displaystyle x+7<0} for x{\displaystyle x}:x+7−7<0−7{\displaystyle x+7-7<0-7}x<−7{\displaystyle x<-7}

Then solve x−3>0{\displaystyle x-3>0} for x{\displaystyle x}:x−3+3>0+3{\displaystyle x-3+3>0+3}x<3{\displaystyle x<3}



So, your simplified roots for the first option are x<−7{\displaystyle x<-7} and x>3{\displaystyle x>3}.


, To do this, see whether you can combine the roots to make a correct inequality. If you can find values that are true for both roots, then the option is valid. If you can’t, the roots in this option are not valid.For example, for the first option, x<−7{\displaystyle x<-7} and x>3{\displaystyle x>3}, you need to determine whether there are values that satisfy both requirements. Ask yourself, is there a value that is both less than -7 and greater than 3? Since no number can be both less than -7 and greater than 3, you know that this option is not valid. 


, Isolate the x{\displaystyle x} variable for each factor, remembering to flip the inequality sign if you multiply or divide by a negative number.For example, the second option for (x+7)(x−3)<0{\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0} was that x+7>0{\displaystyle x+7>0} AND x−3<0{\displaystyle x-3<0}. 

First, solve x+7>0{\displaystyle x+7>0} for x{\displaystyle x}:x+7−7>0−7{\displaystyle x+7-7>0-7}x>−7{\displaystyle x>-7}

Then solve x−3<0{\displaystyle x-3<0} for x{\displaystyle x}:x−3+3<0+3{\displaystyle x-3+3<0+3}x<3{\displaystyle x<3}



So, your simplified roots for the second option are x>−7{\displaystyle x>-7} and x<3{\displaystyle x<3}.


, If you can find values that are true for both roots, then the option is valid. If you can’t, the roots in this option are not valid.For example, the second option is that x>−7{\displaystyle x>-7} and x<3{\displaystyle x<3}, so you need to find a value for x{\displaystyle x} that would satisfy both inequalities. Ask yourself, is there a value that is both greater than -7 and less than 3? Since there are many numbers that are both greater than -7 and less than 3 (0, for example), you know that this option is valid, and so these roots are the solution to the inequality. 


, Make sure you draw it according to any required specifications. If your number line has no specifications, just make sure to include positions for both x{\displaystyle x} values your found previously. Include a few values above and below these to make the number line easier to interpret.

For example, since the roots for the inequality x(x+4)<21{\displaystyle x(x+4)<21} are x>−7{\displaystyle x>-7} and x<3{\displaystyle x<3}, draw a number line that includes positions for -7 and 3.


, Plot the points by drawing a circle over their position on the number line. If the inequality is greater than (>{\displaystyle >}) or less than (<{\displaystyle <}), draw an open circle. If the inequality is greater than or equal to (≥{\displaystyle \geq }) or less than or equal to (≤{\displaystyle \leq }), fill in the circle on the number line, since the values are included in the set.For example, since the roots your are working with are x>−7{\displaystyle x>-7} and x<3{\displaystyle x<3}, you would draw open circles at the -7 and 3 positions on the number line.


, If x{\displaystyle x} is greater than the value, draw a line pointing to the right on the number line, since the included values will be larger than x{\displaystyle x}. If x{\displaystyle x} is less than the value, draw a line pointing to the left on the number line, since the included values will be less than x{\displaystyle x}. If the included values are between two numbers, you will draw a line between the two plotted points.

For example, since you want to show that x>−7{\displaystyle x>-7} but also x<3{\displaystyle x<3}, you need to draw a line between -7 and 3 on the number line.


, An x-intercept is a point where the parabola crosses the x-axis. The two roots you found are the x-intercepts.For example, if the inequality is x2+4x−21<0{\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<0}, then the x-intercepts are x>−7{\displaystyle x>-7} and x<3{\displaystyle x<3}, since these are the roots you found when using the quadratic formula or factoring.


, The axis of symmetry is the line that cuts the parabola in half. To find the axis of symmetry, use the formula x=−b2a{\displaystyle x={\frac {-b}{2a}}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} correspond to the terms in the original quadratic inequality.For example, for the inequality x2+4x−21<0{\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<0}, you will first calculate x=−42(1){\displaystyle x={\frac {-4}{2(1)}}}:x=−42{\displaystyle x={\frac {-4}{2}}}x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2}. So, the axis of symmetry is the line x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2}


, The vertex is the high or low point of the parabola. To find the vertex, first change the original inequality into an equation equal to y{\displaystyle y}. Then plug the x{\displaystyle x} value you found for the axis of symmetry into the equation.For example, if the axis of symmetry is x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2}, plug -2 into the equation and solve:y=(−2)2+4(−2)+−21{\displaystyle y=(-2)^{2}+4(-2)+-21}y=4−8−21{\displaystyle y=4-8-21}y=4−8−21{\displaystyle y=4-8-21}So, the vertex of the parabola is at the point (−2,−25){\displaystyle (-2,-25)}.


, To know the direction of the parabola, look at the a{\displaystyle a} term of the inequality in standard form. If the a{\displaystyle a} term is positive, the parabola will “right-side up,” meaning it opens towards the top. If the a{\displaystyle a} term is negative, the parabola will be “upside down,” meaning it opens towards the bottom.Since the a{\displaystyle a} term in the inequality x2+4x−21<0{\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<0} is positive, the parabola will be right-side up.  


, If the inequality is greater than or equal to (≥{\displaystyle \geq }) or less than or equal to (≤{\displaystyle \leq }), draw the parabola with a solid line, since the values on the line are included in the solution set. If the inequality is greater than (>{\displaystyle >}) or less than (<{\displaystyle <}), draw the parabola with a dotted line, since the values on the line are not included in the solution set.Since the line x2+4x−21<0{\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<0} is less than zero (not less or equal to), you should draw the parabola with a dotted line.


, To know whether to shade above or below the x-axis, you need to look at the original inequality. If the inequality is less than zero, you will shade below the x-axis. If the inequality is greater than zero, you will shade above the x-axis.To know whether to shade inside the parabola or outside of the parabola, look at your roots, or your number line. If the valid values of x{\displaystyle x} lie between the two roots, you will shade inside the parabola. If the valid values of x{\displaystyle x} lie outside the two roots, you will shade outside the parabola.For example, since the inequality is x2+4x−21<0{\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<0}, you will shade a region below the x-axis. Since the valid values lie between the roots -7 and 3, you will shade the region between these two points.

Example 1. Solve: x^2 - 11x - 102 = 0. Roots have different signs. Compose factor pairs of c = -102 with all first numbers being negative. Proceeding: (-1, 102)(-2, 51)(-3, 34)(--6, 17). This last sum is: 17 - 6 = 11 = -b. Then, the 2 real roots are: -6 and 17. No factoring and solving binomials.

Example 2. Solve: x^2 + 39x + 108 = 0. Both roots are negative. Compose factor pairs of c = 108 with all negative numbers. Proceeding: (-1, -108)(-2, -54)(-3, -36). This last sum is -39 = -b. Then, the 2 real roots are: -3, and -36.
"" Example 3"". Solve: x^2 - 23x + 102 = 0. Both roots are positive. Compose factor pairs of c = 102 with all positive numbers. Proceeding: (1, 102)(2, 51)(3, 34)(6, 17). This last sum is: 17 + 6 = 23 = -b. The 2 real roots are: 6 and 17.

Examples of solving by the new ""Transforming Method""


Example 3. Original equation to solve: 6x^2 - 19x - 11 = 0. (1).
First, solve the transformed equation: x^2 - 19x - 66 = 0.(2). Roots have different signs. Compose factor pairs of a*c = -66. Proceeding: (-1, 66)(-2, 33)(-3, 22). This last sum is 22 - 3 = 19 = -b. Then, the 2 real roots of (2) is: y1 = -3, and y2 = 22. Next, divide both y1, and y2 by a = 6. The 2 real roots of the original equation (1) are: x1 = y1/6 = -3/6 = -1/2, and x2 = y2/6 = 22/6 = 11/3.


Example 4. Original equation to solve: 6x^2 - 11x - 35 = 0 (1).





, Roots have different signs. To save time, compose factor pairs from the middle of the factor chain. Proceeding: .....(-5, 42)(-7, 30)(-10, 21). This last sum is: 21 - 10 = 11 = -b. Then, y1 = -10, and y2 = 21. Next, find the 2 real roots of the original equation (1): x1 = y1/6 = -10/6 = -5/3, and x2 = 21/6 = 7/2..



Example 5. Original equation: 12x^2 + 29x + 15 = 0. (1).

Solve transformed equation: x^2 + 29x + 180 = 0 (2). Both roots are negative. Start composing a*c = 180 from the middle of the factor chain. Proceeding:..... (-5, -36)(-6, -30)(-9, -20). This last sum is: -29 = -b. The 2 real roots of (2) are: y1 = -9, and y2 = -20. Next, find the 2 real roots of (1): x1 = -9/12 = -3/4, and x2 = -20/12 = -5/3.

Choose the equation you want to work with first.,

Plug in the y{\displaystyle y} value into either equation.,
Find the value of x{\displaystyle x}.,
Check your work.",How to Solve Simultaneous Equations Using Substitution Method," It doesn’t matter which equation you choose, but you might want to look for one that will give you numbers that are easier to work with.For example, if your simultaneous equations are 1) x+2y=−4{\displaystyle x+2y=-4} and 2) 2x+5y=1{\displaystyle 2x+5y=1}, you will probably want to begin with the first equation, because the x{\displaystyle x} is already by itself.
;
, You could also start by isolating the y variable (or whatever other variable the equation uses).

For example, if you are beginning with x+2y=−4{\displaystyle x+2y=-4}, you could solve for x{\displaystyle x} by subtracting 2y from each side.x+2y=−4{\displaystyle x+2y=-4}x=−4−2y{\displaystyle x=-4-2y}


, Place the value in parentheses for clarity.

For example, if you found x=−4−2y{\displaystyle x=-4-2y} in the first equation, plug in −4−2y{\displaystyle -4-2y} for x{\displaystyle x} in the second equation:2x+5y=1{\displaystyle 2x+5y=1}2(−4−2y)+5y=1{\displaystyle 2(-4-2y)+5y=1}


, Remember to follow the order of operations.

For example, to solve for y{\displaystyle y} in the equation 2(−4−2y)+5=1{\displaystyle 2(-4-2y)+5=1}, first use the distributive property to multiply.2(−4−2y)+5y=1{\displaystyle 2(-4-2y)+5y=1}−8−4y+5y=1{\displaystyle -8-4y+5y=1}−8+y=1{\displaystyle -8+y=1}y=9{\displaystyle y=9}


, It doesn’t matter which equation you use, as long as you use the original equation, or an equation where you’ve isolated the x{\displaystyle x} variable. This will allow you to find the value for x{\displaystyle x}.

If you plug the y{\displaystyle y} value back into the second equation with the x{\displaystyle x} substitution, you will not be able to find the value of x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, if you found y=9{\displaystyle y=9}, plug in 9{\displaystyle 9} for y{\displaystyle y} in the first equation:x+2y=−4{\displaystyle x+2y=-4}x+2(9)=−4{\displaystyle x+2(9)=-4}


, Remember to follow the order of operations.

For example, to solve for x{\displaystyle x} in the equation x+2(9)=−4{\displaystyle x+2(9)=-4}, first multiply, and then subtract 18 from each side to find the value of x{\displaystyle x}.x+2(9)=−4{\displaystyle x+2(9)=-4}x+18=−4{\displaystyle x+18=-4}x=−22{\displaystyle x=-22}.


, To do this, substitute the values you found for x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} into both equations, and verify that the resulting equation are true.For example, if you found y=9{\displaystyle y=9} and x=−22{\displaystyle x=-22}, substitute these values into both equations.

So, for the first equation:(−22)+2(9)=−4{\displaystyle (-22)+2(9)=-4}−22+18=−4{\displaystyle -22+18=-4}−4=−4{\displaystyle -4=-4}

For the second equation:2(−22)+5(9)=1{\displaystyle 2(-22)+5(9)=1}−44+45=1{\displaystyle -44+45=1}1=1{\displaystyle 1=1}

Use the isolation strategy, with just a few new tricks, to solve complicated radical equations.,
Isolate one of the variables under the radical.,
Square both sides of the equation.,
Isolate the other square root.,
Square both sides.,
Solve for ""x"" once all the radicals are gone.,
Check all possible solutions to get the right answer.",How to Solve Radical Equations2," If you've got two radicals in your equation, don't panic. The basics of solving radical equations are still the same. You want to get the variables by themselves, remove the radicals one at a time, solve the leftover equation, and check all known solutions.

For this example, solve the radical equation 2x−5−x−1=1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2x-5}}-{\sqrt {x-1}}=1}You frequently end up with quadratic equations when working with radicals. Review how to solve them if you are unsure.


, Get one of the variables alone, like you would normally. Ignore the other for now. For the example, simply add x−1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-1}}} to each side:


Original Problem:  2x−5−x−1=1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2x-5}}-{\sqrt {x-1}}=1}


Isolate one radical:  2x−5−x−1+x−1=1+x−1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2x-5}}-{\sqrt {x-1}}+{\sqrt {x-1}}=1+{\sqrt {x-1}}}


2x−5=1+x−1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2x-5}}=1+{\sqrt {x-1}}}, Again, there is nothing here that you haven't done with simpler equations. Square both sides to remove the radical on the left.


Isolated radical: 2x−5=1+x−1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2x-5}}=1+{\sqrt {x-1}}}


Square both sides: (2x−5)2=(1+x−1)2{\displaystyle ({\sqrt {2x-5}})^{2}=(1+{\sqrt {x-1}})^{2}}


Expand: 2x−5=1+2x−1+(x−1){\displaystyle 2x-5=1+2{\sqrt {x-1}}+(x-1)}


Simplify: 2x−5=2x−1+x{\displaystyle 2x-5=2{\sqrt {x-1}}+x}


, You've got one of your radical signs gone -- it is time to get rid of the second. Just go through the same motions as the first time, isolating the side with the radical.


Simplified equation: 2x−5=2x−1+x{\displaystyle 2x-5=2{\sqrt {x-1}}+x}


Isolate radical: 2x−5−x=2x−1+x−x{\displaystyle 2x-5-x=2{\sqrt {x-1}}+x-x}


x−52=2x−12{\displaystyle {\frac {x-5}{2}}={\frac {2{\sqrt {x-1}}}{2}}}


x−52=x−1{\displaystyle {\frac {x-5}{2}}={\sqrt {x-1}}}, Again, you can do this with any root -- if you have a cube root, you would cube both sides, if it is the 4th root, you'd raise both sides to the 4th power, etc. Your goal is simply to undo the radical.


Isolated Final Radical:x−52=x−1{\displaystyle {\frac {x-5}{2}}={\sqrt {x-1}}}


Square both sides: (x−52)2=(x−1)2{\displaystyle ({\frac {x-5}{2}})^{2}=({\sqrt {x-1}})^{2}}


Expand both sides: (x2−10x+25)4=x−1{\displaystyle {\frac {(x^{2}-10x+25)}{4}}=x-1}


Simplify: x2−10x+25=4x−1{\displaystyle x^{2}-10x+25=4x-1}, Theoretically, you could keep doing this no matter how many radicals you have, though you can see how complicated things would quickly get. Once you've got both radicals gone, it is time to use your algebra skills solve for x. In this example, x2−10x+25=4x−4{\displaystyle x^{2}-10x+25=4x-4}, you'll need to use the quadratic equation. You could also graph both sides of the equation and see where they meet.

Using the quadratic equation, you only get two possible answers: 2.53 and 11.47., Remember, not all answers you find are going to be correct. You need to plug them back in to check them. If an answer isn't part of the solution you can feel free to toss it out, though some teachers want you to show that you found and discarded the answer in your work.


Check 2.53: 2(2.53)−5−(2.53)−1=1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2(2.53)-5}}-{\sqrt {(2.53)-1}}=1}


Answer does not check out, x=2.53{\displaystyle x=2.53} is not a solution.




Check 11.74: 2x−5−x−1=1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2x-5}}-{\sqrt {x-1}}=1}


Answer checks out, x=11.74{\displaystyle x=11.74} is a solution.



The final answer to the problem 2x−5−x−1=1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2x-5}}-{\sqrt {x-1}}=1} is 11.74."

Work on your listening skills.,
Close your mouth when it opens.,
Put yourself in the other person’s shoes.,
Ask yourself if what you intend to say is true, necessary, and kind.,
Speak freely but not thoughtlessly with loved ones.,
Take ownership of your statements by prefacing them.,
Make an effort to become more articulate.",How to Watch What You Say1," On a basic level, spending more time listening leaves you less time to talk, which can be helpful if you tend to blather on. On a deeper level, though, being an engaged, active listener will also help change the other person’s perception of the things you do say, putting you in a more positive light. To become an active listener, try to, for example:


Make eye contact; face the other person; adapt to their body language; nod as a sign of engagement
Ask probing, leading, or reflective questions
Paraphrase what they’ve just said before beginning your response
Allow for pauses and periods of silence;
, If you tend to speak without thinking, your mouth probably opens up and words come pouring out before you even realize it. Practice focusing on recognizing when your mouth opens to speak, and literally close it. Reopen it on your time, on your terms, once you’ve thought about what you want to say.A thoughtful pause is a good thing in a conversation, especially if it keeps you from putting your foot in your mouth with a foolish comment.

, Sometimes the simplest advice is the hardest to follow, but this one is worth the effort. How would you feel if someone said to you what you are about to say? Would you understand that they “were only being honest” or “ were just trying to be helpful” or “didn’t mean it in that way?”If you wouldn’t want someone to say the same thing to you, or say it in the same way, then keep your comment to yourself.

, This rubric about when to speak or not speak builds in part on the old “If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all.” Unless what you are inclined to say is entirely accurate AND is important AND can be phrased politely, silence is usually the better option.For example, “Your underwear is showing because those pants are too tight for you” will always fail at least one of the three categories; “I think you may have a wardrobe issue that needs addressed” might be okay depending on the circumstances. But it’s probably most often best to say nothing at all in this situation.

, Especially when you’re speaking with your partner, close friends, or family, you probably make unconscious assumptions that they’ll “get your meaning” and forgive you for being coarse or blunt. While the people that know and care about you probably are more willing to tolerate your verbal gaffes and spears, that doesn’t mean they should have to.Stop and think — would you say the same thing, in the same way, to a new acquaintance or to your partner on your first date?
Instead of “Boy, you’re starting to get pudgy!”, stop, think, and try something like “I think we should work together on eating healthier.”

, Get into the habit of starting comments by saying things like “In my opinion...” or “The way I see it...”. As simple as it sounds, using a preface like this can act as a quick reality check — one that urges you to confirm to yourself that this is what you believe, what you want to express, and how you want to say it., Phrasing and delivery go a long way towards determining the listener’s reaction to what you say, and their overall perception of you. Put some effort into expanding your vocabulary through study; avoiding overuse of contractions and slang terms; speaking slowly and clearly; cutting out verbal pauses such as “like” and “um”; and exuding confidence (but not overconfidence) as you speak.


Watch videos of engaging, articulate public speakers and take note of their speech patterns, body language, and so on.
Evaluate your audience and tailor your phrasing and delivery to suit it.

"
"
Adopt a confident position.,
Breathe in a way that maximizes voice projection.,
Start out speaking at a comfortable volume.,
Slow down your speech.,
Listen to what others are saying.,
Include yourself in the conversation.,
Work on regulating the volume of your voice.,
Drink water before you plan on talking.,
Release some of your stress.,
Use deep-breathing exercises to manage your symptoms.,
Challenge your nervous thoughts.,
Try to think encouraging thoughts.,
Do something you enjoy before every social gathering.",How to Talk Louder if You're Shy," If you're shy, standing or sitting in a confident position may help boost your self-esteem. Some positions can help you project your voice better, but ultimately you should stand or sit in whatever position makes you most comfortable and confident.If you're standing, put one foot slightly in front of the other and rest your body's weight on the back foot. Keep your neck straight, your head high, pull your shoulders back, and angle your torso slightly forward.
If you're sitting, keep your back straight and lean forward slightly. Put your elbows and forearms on top of the table and look directly at the person you intend to speak to.;
, If you're not used to projecting your voice, focusing on your breathing may help. Regulating your breath and maintaining an erect posture will open up your chest and facilitate a louder, more commanding voice.

Inhale silently and quickly, then exhale slowly just before you begin to speak.
Try to relax your abdominal region as you inhale. Keep your shoulders and chest as still as possible.
Pause at the end of a sentence just before you're about to run out of breath. Then inhale so that your next phrasing feels natural.

, If you're nervous about speaking loudly, it may be easier if you start out at a more comfortable tone. Spend a little time conversing at whatever volume you're comfortable with and work your way up to a louder volume gradually.Remember that speaking softly and timidly is better than not talking at all.
You don't have to rush into speaking loudly. Stick with what you're comfortable with until you get warmed up, then begin pushing yourself.

, Many people speak rapidly when they're feeling nervous or anxious. However, speaking too fast can affect the clarity of your speech. Fast speech may also increase the chance of stumbling over your words or losing track of your thoughts.Try practicing with a recording device and listening back to the speed and clarity of your speech.
You can also ask a friend to help you practice projecting your voice. Your friend can tell you whether you need to change the volume, pitch, or speed of your speech.

, If you want to carry on a conversation with others, it's important to actually listen to what they're saying. Try not to spend too much time planning what you'd like to say, and focus on what others are saying while they speak.Make eye contact with whoever is speaking and pay attention to what's being said.
React appropriately to what's being said. Smile at something funny, frown at something sad, and nod politely to show that you're still listening.

, If you wait for someone else to ask you to participate in the conversation, you might be waiting a long time. It may be difficult, but by chiming in on what's being said you'll let others know that you're interested in participating.Don't cut anyone else off. Wait for a brief pause in which no one is speaking, then chime in.
Say something relevant to the conversation and build off of something that someone else said. For example, you might say something like, ""I agree with what Dave said, but I also think _______.""

, Controlling the volume of your voice can help you speak more clearly and audibly. Try to maintain some awareness of how you sound as well as what you're saying. This is another instance in which practicing with a friend or recording device may help.Instead of using a monotone voice, vary the pitch of your voice and the pace of your words.
Start out using a mid-range pitch, then inflect your voice up or down as needed.
Gauge your volume. You want to be loud enough to draw the attention of others, but not so loud that you make others uncomfortable.
Pause after you say something important, and enunciate your words slowly and clearly so that everyone can hear what you're saying.

, Many people experience a dry mouth or dry throat during moments of fear, which may make talking difficult. If you're shy or anxious, you might want to try keeping a glass or bottle of water on hand so you can have a drink before you speak.Avoid caffeine or alcohol if you're already nervous/anxious. Caffeine can make you more stressed, and alcohol can lead to dependence.

, Shyness and fear often result in feelings of stress and pent-up energy. If you're too nervous to speak loudly, you may find it helpful to release some of that built-up stress beforehand. Try excusing yourself to the washroom and using that moment alone to stretch and move your muscles before you return to your group and speak up.Stretch your neck forward, backwards, and side-to-side.
Stretch your mouth open as wide as it will go.
Lean against the wall and stretch your hamstrings, then stretch your adductor (groin) muscles by spreading your legs and leaning side to side.
Stand about two feet from a wall and do five quick wall push-ups.

, Many people experiencing extreme shyness, fear, or anxiety suffer from unpleasant physical symptoms. These may include rapid heartbeat, shallow breathing, light headedness, and feelings of dread. No matter what physical symptoms your shyness causes, deep breathing can help calm you down and reduce the symptoms of fear/anxiety.Inhale slowly while counting to four. Breathe deeply into your diaphragm (below your ribs), rather than shallow chest breaths.
Hold the breath in your diaphragm for four seconds.
Exhale slowly while counting to four.
Repeat several times until you feel your heart rate and respiration slow down.

, If you're shy or nervous, you might experience fearful thoughts during moments of panic. These thoughts can feel very real, but by stepping back and challenging those thoughts you can help break out of your cycle of self-doubt and shyness.Ask yourself the following questions:


What am I afraid of? Is this fear realistic?
Are my fears grounded in reality, or am I manufacturing/exaggerating this fear?
What is the worst possible outcome? Would it be so bad, or could I handle that outcome and bounce back from it?

, Once you've broken the chain of self-doubting thoughts, you'll want to replace those thoughts with something more positive and encouraging. Remember that you have the ability to change the way you think, which in turn can alter the way you feel.Try releasing your shy, nervous thoughts by telling yourself, ""Shyness and fear are just feelings. They may feel bad, but I can cope with these feelings until they pass.""
Tell yourself, ""I'm an intelligent, kind, interesting person. I may feel shy, but people will be interested in what I have to say.""
Remind yourself that you've felt shy or nervous before and things turned out okay. Try thinking about times you've succeeded or overcome your fears in the past to empower yourself.

, Doing things you enjoy can release endorphins, relieve stress, and soothe anxiety. If you know you'll be in a situation where you will have to interact with others and you'll be attempting to speak louder than you're comfortable with, take a little time beforehand to do something fun and relaxing.You don't need a lot of time or effort to squeeze in some down time. Even going for a short walk, listening to soothing music, or reading an engrossing book can all help you calm down and relax.

Determine the reason why you remain quiet.,
Encourage yourself.,
Read out loud.,
Invite your friends over.,
Get involved in debating or public speaking.,
Be informed of current events.,
Start small in a large group.,
Imagine yourself in a bubble of confidence.,
Stand tall and make eye contact.,
Be a good listener.,
Befriend a mix of loud and quiet people.,
Talk to one new person a day.,
Appear approachable.,
Don't always blame yourself.,
Perceive quietness as a positive attribute.",How to Talk More Often When You're Quiet," There are a number of different possibilities, such as being naturally shy or feeling uncomfortable around certain people or situations. Discovering the cause of your quietness can help you find the right ways to work around that. Although you may want to become louder, understand that it's important to accept yourself as you are rather than attempting to completely change yourself. There is nothing wrong with being quiet, unless if you feel that it's hindering you from making relationships or discovering new experiences.;
, If you're naturally quiet, speaking up may appear frightening or unusual. You may be used to remaining silent and listening to others. However, tell yourself that if you talk to others, you'll be opening yourself to different opportunities. By stepping out and contributing with your ideas and topics, you can enjoy new experiences and improve your confidence in speaking. Focus on the positives rather than blowing the situation out of proportion and fretting over the bad things that might happen if you talk.

, Practicing with your voice can boost your confidence in speaking, and it teaches you to enunciate your words correctly. It can also help you learn to speak louder and bolder. If you feel strange about reading out loud to yourself, you can take the time to read a story to your siblings or pets. Otherwise, find a private area where you can speak without others hearing you.

, If they rarely come to your house, change that and allow them to visit you. If you're comfortable around your friends, you'll be more likely to feel better about talking to them, especially since you're in the comforts of your home. Practice talking with them and think about how confident or free you feel when you speak. The next time you talk to someone outside of your home, try to remember that confidence and hold onto the feeling.

, Presenting in groups can help you feel more comfortable speaking authoritatively on a topic for a long period of time, even if you feel completely out of your depth. You will also develop the ability to respond to another person's opinion and disagree in a persuasive way. Because you're in a group, you won't have to be afraid of talking alone, as you'll have others to support your words and guide you. You will also be able to meet more people, develop your confidence, and improve your English vocabulary and style, as well as your grades if you attend school.

, Scan the headlines of a national newspaper every morning and evening, or listen to the radio on your way to work or school. Quiet people often find it hard to come up with an icebreaker or feel out of depth in a conversation. Being knowledgeable about the world around you can help boost your confidence, as well as give you the ability to cover a variety of different subjects in a conversation. You'll also feel more bold and motivated when it comes to prompting a new topic. Don't be afraid to give your opinion, as it matters just as much as everyone else's. Quiet people often are very wise, valuing quality over quantity.

, Although spending time with a group can be fun, it can also feel overwhelming, especially if there are many people chatting at the same time. If you find yourself being rendered mute, start small. As the chatty, self-assured folks vie for attention, talk to someone one-on-one rather than sitting off to the side. You will not only become more confident in approaching others but also learn to initiate interaction and include yourself. After a while, you can gradually branch out to other members of your group.

, This will give you the motivation and boldness to start a conversation. Understand that quiet people are too often perceived as being snobbish or boring, which means people feel that they cannot reach out through their bubble. However, turning that bubble into an air of confidence can encourage others to initiate contact. Give people a friendly smile and a quick ""hello"" to make you appear more approachable.

, When speaking to someone, it's best to adapt a confident posture and appear engaged in the conversation. This will encourage them to continue speaking to you and can help you feel bolder. It will also make you approachable, command respect from those that speak to you, and make others interested in talking to you. If you slouch and often look away from people, this makes you appear uninterested in the conversation or unconfident, which can chase people away from you.

, A balanced conversation between two people is a positive way to attract more people to you. Even if you're not the best talker, at least be a good listener and show the other person that you're interested in what they're saying. Learn good listening skills and show your compassionate side by being willing to listen to problems and offer solutions. However, you shouldn't be afraid to occasionally turn the focus on you or interject your opinion. If you feel that the other person is dominating the conversation, don't hesitate to speak up and politely tell them that you have something to say as well.

, Despite the belief that having loud friends can help draw quiet people out of their shells, the truth is that they only give you the excuse to become mute. If they're too loud and rarely prompt you to speak, they'll only overshadow you and perhaps even push you back into the corner of the group. It's recommended that you befriend a healthy mixture of loud and quiet people so that you have a good balance. Someone who is quieter than you will force you to compensate for their silence and develop your ability to maintain a conversation. While opposites may attract, practice moderation.

, Because you're surrounded by many people in your life, there are many different opportunities for a conversation with someone. Although you don't have to carry out a long talk, at least attempt to chat with someone for a short while, whether it's a stranger in a coffee shop or someone waiting in line with you. This will hone your conversation skills while decreasing the risk of embarrassment, as you'll never see the person again if you feel that you messed up the conversation. As you do this, understand that you'll be meeting a variety of different people. Some may be friendly and interested in talking with you while others may not be in the mood. Remember not to take their reactions personally, and realize that it's a learning experience for you.

, Being naturally quiet often means that many people perceive it as being snobbish or elitist, which can be very hard to take. Swallow your pride and take a hard look at yourself in a social situation. Do your best to modify your appearance so that you appear friendly and approachable to other people. Stand up straight, smile, and make eye contact. Acknowledge people, even if you don't know them well. By making yourself approachable, you will make people like you and pique their interest in talking to you.

, Understand that some conversations will be fantastic while others may fail. Remember that you're talking to different people with unique personalities. Some may be great conversationalists and perhaps cause you to feel inadequate and tongue tied. Others might refuse to hold their end of a conversation you're battling to get off the ground. No matter what the situation is, don't be afraid to take a step back. Avoid blaming yourself, as it's not always you that is the cause of the problem. You might not always get along well with some people, whether they're good or bad at talking. However, understand that you cannot use this as an excuse to be lazy. Work at initiating and carrying conversations, but if it turns out to be messy, accept your role as only part of it and move onto another. Take it as a learning experience rather than allowing it to discourage you.

, As long as you view it in a good light, it will be a good personality trait. A quiet person is often respected and admired by chatty peers, and many people think of it as a sign of intelligence and wisdom. Work on being approachable, confident, and able to hold a conversation when the need arises, honing what you might now think is a hindrance into an attribute.

Deflect or avoid sensitive subjects.,
Use a “feedback sandwich” to provide constructive criticism.,
Consult the “ring theory” in traumatic circumstances.",How to Watch What You Say2," Instead of getting dragged into a conversation you’d rather avoid or feeling goaded into saying something you’ll instantly regret, tactfully evade or change the topic of conversation.


Plead ignorance: “I’m sorry, I don’t know Joe well enough to say anything about how he spends his free time.”
Correct others gently: “As far as I know, that was just a rumor.”
Change the subject: “Speaking of (politician X), did you notice how many campaign ads there were during last week’s game? — but wow, what a game that was!”
Be direct but polite: “Sorry, but I’m not really comfortable talking about this. Do you mind if we change the subject?”

, It’s not inherently rude to tell someone they’ve done something wrong or need to change or improve upon something — in fact, it’s usually helpful and often necessary. But the manner in which you provide criticism will go a long way towards determining how it is received.


Start with a compliment: “Thanks so much for helping clean up after dinner, without my even asking!”
Follow with your critique: “However, you need to remember to ask before picking up knives and other sharp or dangerous things.”
End on a positive note: “It really is amazing how helpful and mature you’re becoming!”, Basically, if someone is facing a very difficult situation — like the end of a long-term relationship or a cancer diagnosis — you should make the conversation all about their needs and not at all about how you’re being affected.Imagine a series of circles (or “rings”) within circles, with the smallest circle representing the person most directly affected by the trauma in question.
If you want to complain or vent, you should only do so to someone who is situated on a bigger “ring” (and thus, less directly affected) than you. If you’re talking to someone on a smaller ring, offer only comfort and support.

"
Depersonalize the situation.,
Use “I” statements.,
Keep up-to-date on terminology and contexts.",How to Watch What You Say3," If you’re in the habit of giving overly critical and unwarranted comments, the problem may be that you personalize events that have little or nothing to do with you.For instance, don’t jump to the conclusion that your friend left the inside of their car a mess to annoy you, or that they canceled plans because they don’t value your time. Take a moment to consider the larger situation before deciding it’s justified for you to be critical.
Similarly, don’t conflate a person’s character with a single action. Your neighbor letting their grass grow too long doesn’t necessarily mean they’re rude or a slob — maybe their lawnmower is broken. And maybe you could offer to lend your mower instead of offering criticism.

, On the surface, there might not seem to be much difference between saying “You don’t listen to me anymore” and “I don’t feel like I’m being heard anymore.” However, using “you” language figuratively points a finger at the other person and puts them on the defensive against criticism. “I” language keeps the focus on your feelings and perceptions.


“Why won’t you ever help me around the house?” sounds and feels more like criticism than “I could really use some help with the housework today.”

, Even if you grew up in an era when different terms were used to refer to various individuals and groups, you shouldn’t expect a pass if you use terms now deemed insensitive, outdated, or offensive. Of course, there’s no single rulebook for “good” and “bad” terms and context plays an important role, so don’t be afraid to politely ask someone about proper terminology or word usage.Accept, though, that you'll still slip up sometimes. Say, for example, you offend someone you assumed was ""foreign"" by asking “So, where are you from?” or “Wow, you speak great English!” Instead of getting defensive, apologize and work on not repeating the mistake.

Look on the bright side.",How to Talk Your Way to Success," Before you can talk your way to success, you need to get involved in conversation. Showing up to the conversation demonstrates your interest in the topic at hand and the other people involved.


Show up to optional meetings and let your voice be heard. For example, many cities and school districts have community meetings that any involved citizen can attend. Showing up to these meetings and conversing with the people there will spread your influence throughout the community.
For mandatory events, like department meetings at work, show up early and try to be the last person to leave. Being involved in the full conversation makes it easier to get noticed by your superiors.
You should also make small talk with people, even when doing so isn't necessarily expected. Small talk allows you to establish trust and camaraderie with the other party, making personal and professional negotiations easier to settle.;
, When talking with someone, give that individual your undivided attention. Don't let yourself become distracted by your phone or other outside parties.


Being fully engaged in a conversation also requires you to be an active listener. Make eye contact with the other individual as he or she speaks. Don't interrupt, but acknowledge the other person's words with appropriate body language or vocalizations during pauses. Provide appropriate, related feedback when the other individual finishes speaking, too.

, You probably know well enough to pay attention to the “important” things, like crucial instructions and contact information. Additionally, though, you also need to pay attention to the seemingly insignificant personal details people weave into the conversation.


Once you know these small details, you can insert them back into later conversations. This sends a message to the other party that you care about them on an individual, human level. Showing someone you care generally encourages him or her to feel more favorably toward you.
You don't need to know the other person's life story, but some important details would help. For instance, try to remember the names of a person's spouse and kids (when applicable), birthday, and at least one major hobby. In a work environment, you should also remember current projects the other person is involved with., Often enough, you may learn a little about someone's life without being directly told about it. Make a note of these details, when appropriate, and bring them up in conversation when you have the opportunity to do so.


Use these details to give meaningful compliments or well-wishes. If you heard about the accomplishments of an acquaintance in another department from your supervisor, consider complimenting that acquaintance when you pass by him or her in the lunch room.
When mentioning these details, you may wish to mention how you heard about them, too. Knowing too much about someone can seem eerie unless you clarify that your knowledge was gained through respectable channels. For instance, learning about your co-worker's recent surgery from another co-worker may seem more acceptable than learning about it from a social media account you unknowingly have access to.

, Effective communication has verbal and nonverbal components. Improving your verbal communication skills is important, but you'll also need to pair those skills with nonverbal abilities if you really want to succeed.


Use open body language as much as possible to present yourself in a friendlier manner. Make eye contact and smile. Avoid sitting with your arms crossed, and direct your body toward someone when engaged in conversation.

, When you're tempted to say something negative, try to find a way to rephrase your sentiments in a more positive manner. The shift in perspective will improve your own mood while allowing others to perceive you as a more affable person.


You can usually do this by looking for an active way to remedy your current negative state. For example, instead of complaining to your boss about a coworker you don't get along with, consider going to your boss and asking for advice on how to improve your relationship with that coworker. You're still acknowledging the problem you have, but indicating a willingness to fix that problem is a more positive way to approach it.

, When you have a question, don't be afraid to ask the appropriate party for an answer. Guesses are a good way to create misunderstandings, and those misunderstandings will only worsen until someone speaks up and corrects the initial error.


Most people would prefer answering questions over correcting errors, so even if the other person seems annoyed when you make your inquiry, that annoyance would only be worse if he or she had to correct you later on.
To avoid irritating people with questions, pay close attention to any instructions given to you so that you only ask for information that hasn't already been disclosed.
Additionally, consider asking for clarification on both instructions and goals, especially when you're in a professional or academic environment. Understanding what should result from your efforts may make your task even clearer than the instructions alone would.

, Every time you make some sort of commitment, follow through with it. You should also follow up with the other party afterward to verify that things are still going well.


Being true to your word creates a sense of reliability, and reliable people are more likely to be trusted with important tasks than those who regularly prove themselves to be untrustworthy or unsteady.
When you follow up, ask for honest feedback and take both compliments and criticisms gracefully. This action suggests that you're genuinely interested in the outcome of each task you perform and in possible ways to improve yourself.

, Talking your way to success does not mean that you should blindly affirm and accept the things other people say. Doing so will cause others to lose respect for you. Instead, stand up for yourself and others whenever you sense some injustice brewing.


Talking your way to success often involves communication that centers around others, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be concerned about your own self-interests. When someone is taking advantage of you, you can—and should—say something or do something to put an end to it.
Standing up for others can be just as important as standing up for yourself. In fact, this can be more difficult to do since speaking up on someone else's behalf can make you into another target. Ultimately, though, you'll gain respect in the eyes of those who recognize your courage.

, Others may gradually see your good points as they get to know you, but in some circumstances, you'll need a stranger or acquaintance to see your good points before that happens. Don't be afraid to honestly pitch your strengths when the opportunity arises.


For example, when you're at a job interview or trying to earn business from a new client, you'll need to confidently explain why you're the right person for the job. Describe your strengths and skills. When you mention your weaknesses, also mention how you plan to use them as opportunities for growth.Similarly, don't be afraid to ask for the things you want, like a promotion or a raise at work. If you've genuinely earned it and your supervisor deserves your respect, he or she will respect you for making your request regardless of whether or not he or she can agree to it.

, Successful self-talk sets the stage for successful communication with others. Negative self-talk will reduce your self-confidence, but positive self-talk raises your confidence and makes it easier for you to speak effectively with other people.


You're constantly engaged in an inner dialogue, even when you aren't aware of it and don't use words to process the information you feed your brain. This inner dialogue can be influenced by external stimuli, but it can also change your perception of external conditions.
Negative self-talk forces you to doubt your own abilities and self-worth. When you engage in negative self-talk, you probably believe you'll fail, which makes you more likely to reduce your efforts and actually fail.
Positive self-talk forces you to look for opportunities to succeed even in the midst of challenging circumstances. This makes it easier to push through difficulties and avoid failure.

, Spend at least two or three days actively monitoring your inner voice. Pay close attention to the way you speak about yourself and speak about the external world during this period.


Keep a record of your self-talk during this period. You don't need to write a detailed thought-for-thought account, but you should summarize major thoughts you had throughout the day.
Look at your record after a few days. By reading through it, you can determine how much of your self-talk is positive and how much is negative.
Identify negative patterns in your record, too. It's possible that certain circumstances act as “triggers” for your negative self-talk. For instance, you might have consistently positive self-talk about your job but negative self-talk about your personal life. Once you identify this pattern, you can be more aware of which perceptions you need to change.

, When you notice a negative thought developing, stop yourself in the middle of it and change the negative to something more positive.


As soon as a negative thought starts developing, make it a point to internally tell yourself ""NO"" or ""STOP."" If possible, don't even allow yourself to finish the negative thought.Once you stop the negative from coming through, immediately balance it out with a positive statement that directly counteracts it. If you started to think, ""This task is too difficult,"" switch to thinking, ""I can and will complete this task.""

, Ridding yourself of all negative thoughts might seem impossible, but at the very least, you should actively work on removing negative absolutes from your self-speech. Negative absolutes set your mind up for a pattern of failure, making them more difficult to break than random, one-time negatives.For example, you might regularly tell yourself that you can't handle unfamiliar social events. Eventually, ""I can't socialize"" could turn into a mantra that you repeat to yourself every time an uncomfortable social situation turns up, and the phrase will be so familiar to you that you'll accept it as truth without even questioning it.

, Make a list of your strengths. Memorize as many as possible, and frequently remind yourself of your strengths throughout the day to boost your self-confidence.


If necessary, sit down and write out an actual list of your strengths and skills. Think about your past accomplishments, your positive attributes, and anything else you like about yourself. Add all of it to the list, no matter how small each point may seem.
When doubt makes it difficult to flip a negative thought around, remind yourself of these strong points. You can either recite them from memory or read them from your list.

, People have a tendency to turn negative absolutes into mantras that they repeat on a negative basis. While this is an unhealthy behavior, using the habit of repeating mantras can actually help you if those mantras have a self-affirmative quality.


Some examples of positive affirmations include:

I love myself. / I am loved. / I am worthy of being loved.
I am beautiful. / I am handsome.
I am unique. / I am creative. / I am courageous.
I forgive myself for my past faults.
I refuse to give up. / I can get through anything. / I have the strength to continue forward.



, It may seem trite to say “count your blessings,” but the practice really can help you. Verbally reminding yourself of your blessings on a regular basis can improve your outlook about life, and the improvement in your outlook will likely show in the conversations you have with other people.


Everyone faces difficulties and challenges, and it's natural to feel overwhelmed by these problems. Reminding yourself of your blessings can ease some of the pressure, though, which may make life seem a little less depressing. If you can help yourself appreciate the life you have, it should be easier to face challenges and find success where you previously expected to fail.

Make excuses.,
If nothing from the above works, firmly say ""Please be quiet for a moment!"",
Tell the person to stop chatting or making noise.,
Tell the chatty person that it is affecting your work and that you cannot concentrate.,
Ask another person to tell the chatty person to be quiet.,
Stay calm and courteous when you are asking people to be quiet.",How to Tell Someone to Be Quiet," Come up with something about how it has been lovely talking but you really need to either say your piece, or perhaps leave now.


For example: ""It has been so good to learn everything you've had to say Sally but I'm really pressed for time now, and I do have to let you know that X and then I have to go. Do you mind if I just quickly explain this, then bolt off? We can catch again another day."";
, In some cases, it's okay to just say ""see ya"" and take off or go into your own world. Are you out grocery shopping, getting your nails done, walking the dog down the street or sitting in your house when a neighbor comes over? If you were or are doing any of these things, it is alright to completely get up and walk away or just make a gesture that you've heard but you're now concentrating on something.

, If the person keeps talking without taking a break or letting you have say, stop caring whether or not they are in the middle of talking. All these things are “me time” situations. This gives you the right to not listen and continue your day.

, Show that it's time to wind up the discussion with some well known gestures aimed at identifying that enough is enough.


Start to tap your watch. Maybe the person will see that you are pressed for time.
In the middle of the conversation, just start yawning and looking away. Do this every five minutes. This clues the person that you are tired and need some rest.

, Make sure the person does not follow you. If this happens, you’re on your own. Now they have become stalkers!

, This is actually the fun part. You can be creative. You can say things like; “I’m late to salsa class”, “I forgot to make my bed”, “It’s time for me to juice my grapes”.

, to the person talking. You have had enough so they have earned such abruptness when they simply won't stop. Once they finished being shocked and realized what you've done, then either apologize for being a but too brusque or even stand up to make a move to go away. Either way, it will make them think twice next time about ear-bashing you, knowing how it affects you.


A less bossy way could be to infer that they are just talking too much by making a statement such as: ""The quieter you become, the more you can hear."" Or ""Shhh, can you hear that? It's the sound of just being.""
If the person has been gossiping, some curt lines include: ""If you can't be kind/positive, at least be quiet."" Or, ""So much to say about the same issue! It suggests to me you really aren't as blameless as you're insisting."" Or, ""If it's not your story, then don't tell it.""
If you're feeling totally fed up and mean, opine: ""The secret to being boring is to say everything."" Just be aware that it's likely to cause the other person to be shocked.

, Ask them if they would mind taking their conversation somewhere else in the room, where it's permitted, or to talk quietly.

, Only do this if they respect you; a bullying or bossy type will just think this is hilarious.

, If a person refuses to be quiet in a library or other quiet space, draw this to the attention of those in charge of the place. They'll enforce quiet rules for you.

, Most people don't mean to talk loudly, and some people don't realize how much the sound carries.

Don't worry too much about the small details at first, just get some time talking to the camera under your belt.;
, Record yourself practising so that you can play it back and see how you look and sound. Try to speak in your normal speaking voice.

, Look into the camera lens and pretend it is your best friend. Try to forget about who might watch the video and think about your best friend watching.Thinking about talking to a friend can make your video warmer and more relaxed.

, Put a few practice videos on YouTube or another online video site. Tell the audience that they are videos of you practising speaking to a camera and ask for advice from viewers.Some critiques may be tough but focus on constructive comments.
Over time you will get more comfortable with the process of speaking to the camera, posting videos, and getting feedback.

, Think about what you are going to say and make an outline of the main ideas. You don't need a complete script but it helps to have a plan to make sure you cover the main points.


Planning the order of ideas will make your speech clearer and help with nerves.

, Avoid words that most people don't know including long and unusual words and words that are specific to your area of work or expertise. If the subject you are talking about has a lot of jargon or insider language, try to use everyday language instead.
Avoid acronyms or nicknames.
Instead of ""website optimization,"" say ""making your website work well.""

, Mumbling people can't be well understood, and the video-watcher might even stop watching your video. Pronounce the words clearly and correctly. If you're not sure how to say a word, either look it up or don't say it at all.

, Many people talk too fast when they become nervous. Make sure to talk slowly enough that your audience can follow your ideas.

, Short sentences are both easier to say and easier to understand. If it takes a long time for you to complete a sentence, your viewer may lose track of your point.Use each sentence to convey one brief idea.
Longer sentences are hard to say because you may run out of breath. Shorter sentences will make your speech seem more natural.
People watching videos may be doing other things, like eating lunch. Keep your ideas short and clear to hold attention.

, Before you begin talking talk a few deep breaths. This will calm your nerves and help you breathe more naturally as you speak.

, Look into the camera lens so that you will make eye contact with your audience. This will help you connect with your viewers.Feel free to look away from the camera to direct attention and make your video feel natural.
Look at other people in the video, if there are any, to direct attention to them when they are speaking.
Look at objects you are discussing. If you are holding or showing off a product, look at the object while speaking about it.

, Make sure you are standing in front of a background that looks good. Pick a background that is clean and not distracting.


The background should be static. If things behind you are moving around it will be distracting.
The background can convey a setting. A bookshelf behind you will be more interesting and important looking than a blank wall without being too distracting.

, Wear clothes that match with the subject you are talking about and the purpose of your video.If your video is business related, wear the clothes you would wear when doing business.
For a friendly video about making new friends, wear the clothes you would wear when hanging out with friends.
Avoid any clothes that are distracting such as clashing colors or complicated patterns.

, How you hold your body and arms can make a big difference.Stand up straight and hold your shoulders back to look reliable and confident.
Stay balanced. Don't shift your weight from side to side or fidget.
Gesture with your hands to direct the viewer's attention, or to convey emotion and emphasis.
Keep your hands visible. Putting your hands in your pockets or behind your back might make you look nervous or untrustworthy.

Go over the syllabus or program before each lecture so you know what to expect and can prepare any material or assignments so you don’t get lost.Break down the assignments lecture by lecture. This will help you prioritize what you need to get through the next lecture.Ask friends or the professor if you have any questions about the upcoming lecture or reading.;
, Most lectures are accompanied by required readings or assignments. Make sure to finish any readings or assignments so that you can grasp the concepts of the lecture and not get bored. This will also let you participate in discussions, which can also help you get through lectures.Take notes on the reading as you read, which can help you in the discussions and may help you focus more effectively. You only need to write down the most important information.Remember that arriving prepared for your lecture can make it less painful and more manageable., Making sure that your body and brain are fueled properly can help you stay alert during a long lecture. Having a light meal or snack and drinking enough before your lecture may help you get through it more easily.Avoid heavy meals before the lecture because these can divert blood from your brain for digestion and make you sluggish.Soup or a salad with some protein, cereal and milk, or peanut butter toast are all good, light choices that will give you energy to get through the lecture without making your drowsy.Hydrate yourself properly before lecture. One of the symptoms of dehydration is fatigue and drinking enough water in the hours before your lecture can make it easier to get through it.Be aware that consuming alcohol the evening before a lecture can dehydrate you.Have a cup of coffee or tea before lecture if you like, but be aware that there is no evidence that it will increase mental alertness.Chew mints or mint gum. Studies have shown that mints or mint gum can increase alertness and how you process information.Avoid energy drinks and too much sugar. They may increase alertness for a short period, but often cause crashes in energy and increase sleepiness, which may make a long lecture seem endless., Any discomfort you have can make a long lecture seem like torture. Choosing comfortable clothing and shoes can help you settle into a lecture and pay close attention for the duration of it.Wear pants and tops that are not too tight. For example, skinny jeans might make your legs fall asleep.Put on comfortable shoes. For example, shoes that are too tight might distract you during the lecture. Or, you might get blisters from hiking across campus in high heels and that could also distract you during the lecture. Try a cute pair of ballet flats instead.Remember that you can look stylish and cute while being comfortable.

, Having a buddy who you can lean on during a lecture can make the time go by more quickly. Ask a friend or one of your classmates to meet you outside of the classroom or at a café before class so that you can go and sit together.Having a buddy can help momentarily distract you from the boredom of a class.Just remember that you don’t want to interrupt the professor or teacher while you’re momentarily distracting yourself., There is some evidence that sitting up straight with proper posture can increase alertness.Maintain good posture throughout class to keep yourself alert and engaged during the lecture.Pull in your abdominal muscles, straighten your back and push back your shoulders.Sit with your back against the chair and keep your feet on the floor.Maintain your head and neck in a neutral position.Avoid slouching, which can make you drowsy., Between breaks in the lecture, do small stretches or movements with your legs. This can help keep you alert and circulate blood so your legs and arms don’t fall asleep.Push your legs forward if you can and push and pull your toes back towards you.
Do ankle circles or even wrist circles.
Make sure your stretching doesn’t interrupt the lecturer or your fellow classmates., Chewing gum or sucking on a mint can increase your alertness and it may also improve your mood. Having some gum and/or mints can make a long lecture go by more quickly.Opt for peppermint if possible: the smell of peppermint oil or peppermint gum may stimulate your memory to retain information., Depending on the length of your lecture, chances are it coincides with a mealtime. Having a light snack during your long lecture can help increase your alertness and may make it go by more quickly.Have a piece of cheese, fruit, or some pretzels.
Make sure that your snack packaging or chewing doesn’t interrupt the lecture in any way.

, There is some evidence that doodling a bit or doing something creative like rolling a piece of clay can stimulate alertness.Try drawing small images or rolling something on your desk or between your fingers to make the lecture go by more quickly.Keep your doodling or other activities to a minimum and continue to pay attention to the lecture.
Avoid allowing your doodling to disrupt other members of the class or the lecturer.

, Most professors or teachers will allow students to take a break during long lectures. Take this opportunity to stretch your legs and get your blood circulating, which can not only make the time go by more quickly but also make you more alert.Enjoy a short walk, which gives you a chance to get away, circulate your blood and oxygenate your brain. It can also help you relax.Use the restroom if the professor doesn’t offer a break. This will give you a chance to stretch and refocus, even if only briefly., Taking notes can help you to stay alert and pay attention during the lecture. You will also be more likely to remember the lecture if you take notes.Write only the most important information and continue to actively listen while you write.
Take your notes by hand. Some people learn more effectively by taking hand-written notes than by typing their notes. In addition, this can also make a long lecture go by more quickly., Most professors or teachers will allow students to ask questions or stimulate discussions during longer lectures. Participate in the lecture by asking any questions you have or make points during a discussion to help keep yourself alert and active.Raise your hand to ask questions or make a point during a discussion. Remember to not interrupt the lecture at an inconvenient moment., Chances are that you will have to take a class as a requirement at some point and it may be of no interest to you or relate to your course of study. Find a way to engage in the lecture or discussion by relating it to your interest in some way, which may make the lecture—and course—more bearable.


Be aware that even the most divergent subjects can have topics that overlap. For example, perhaps you have to take a class on German history and you’re a pre-med major. Think about what you’ve learned in your classes about Germany and medicine and then use this information to make a contribution to the lecture.
Ask questions to the professor or your fellow students. Preface your inquiries with a sentence or two about your position. For example, you can say “I’m not a history major, but I took a class on medical ethics and I was wondering how this was applied to the victims of war.”

, You may be having a hard time understanding your lecture, which can make it a marathon to endure. Studies have shown that most students only capture about 20-40% of the material that they’re presented in part because they don’t understand the way it is presented.By following up in class on difficult information, you may not only be able to get through your lecture, but also clarify hard concepts for you and your classmates.


Ask questions during the lecture if possible. You can inquire about points the professor has made or something that you didn’t understand from the readings or assignments.
Keep a list of points you need clarified if the professor doesn’t accept questions during the lecture. This may help keep you engaged and awake during the lecture.
Try and stay away from asking your neighbor questions, as it can disrupt the professor and other students.

, While it may be tempting, do not do any activities such as answering emails, texting, or reading during a lecture. Not only is this disrespectful to the instructor and your fellow students, but can actually make the time go by less quickly."

Involve yourself in the decision-making process.,
Don’t let silence be mistaken for approval.,
Keep it civil.",How to Speak Your Mind," Before you begin talking, steady yourself and try to ease your nerves. Breathe slowly and deeply to the count of ten. Relax and let your thoughts settle; cast out doubts and other negative thoughts. It’s normal to become apprehensive when all the attention is on you. The more in control of your words and emotions you remain, the better you’ll be able to conduct yourself in conversation.Try not to let yourself get worked up when you’re frustrated or the topic is something you’re passionate about. Becoming overly emotional can make it harder to get out what you’re trying to say.;
, Condition yourself to speaking out around close friends and family. As you get better, take yourself out of your comfort zone little by little until you no longer fear making your voice heard. Most people find it much easier to express themselves to the people closest to them than to complete strangers, who they worry will judge them.


Start by offering your input into casual conversations where you won’t feel as bashful about professing your opinion. For instance, you might start by making offhand observations like ""Dinner was really great tonight, Mom"" or ""I don't really care for this show. Could we watch something else?"" Exchanges like these are unlikely to end in a challenge or argument.
Talking to people that you’re already familiar with allows you to shut off self-critical thoughts and concentrate on your message.

, Come through loud and clear with a firm, self-assured tone. Take your time getting your thoughts out—don’t mumble or try to talk too fast. Quiet people often go unheard not just become of the low volume of their voices, but because their general demeanor signals to others that they’re not worth listening to.If you develop a captivating speaking voice, it’s more likely that people will take what you have to say seriously.
Being assertive is good. Being loud or overbearing is not. Know the difference to keep from alienating your listener.

, Above all, believe in yourself. If you don’t, your words won’t have conviction. It’s worth reminding yourself that you’re a unique individual with your own thoughts, values and ideas. If you don’t have the confidence to put these things out there, no one will ever benefit from hearing them.If you have to, “fake it ‘til you make it.” Pretend you’re more comfortable sharing an opinion than you are. Eventually, it won’t seem like such a big deal.
Develop confident speaking skills. Look the person you’re talking to in the eye and use strong, active language. Avoid filler phrases like “um,” “like” and “you know?” These weaken your impact., Forget about trying to please. Fear of judgment shouldn’t keep you from letting the world know how you feel. Not everyone will always be interested or agree with what you’re saying. This shouldn’t discourage you from doing yourself justice.Ask yourself what’s the worst that could happen if you do speak up. Once you look closely at your reasons for keeping quiet, you’ll find that they begin to disappear., Stand by the validity of your views. In order for your words to have weight, you yourself have to acknowledge their worth. Even if you and the people around you don’t see eye-to-eye, the important thing is that you have the courage to make your position known. Anxiety about how you might be perceived shouldn’t keep you from standing behind what you think is right.Stick to your guns. It's not always easy to muster up the courage to tell someone ""you're being selfish,"" or ""I don't think what you're doing is right."" If you feel a pressing urge to speak up about a certain issue, however, that probably means it’s important.
Express your opinions without shame, but don’t shove them down anyone’s throat.

, When an opportunity to speak comes, seize it. Be conscious to the discussions going on around you and wait for the right time to put in your two cents. Your listeners may be impressed by what you have to say, leading them to seek your input more often. Too many people hold back because they’re afraid of drawing attention or saying something stupid, but you never know when you’ll get another opening.Making assertive statements and asking well thought out questions shows initiative. Even saying ""I'm not sure I understood that last point. Could you explain it again?"" shows that you're engaged and making an effort to promote equal discussion.
By the time you work up the nerve to speak, someone else might have already said what you were going to say.

, Stop telling yourself “No one wants to know my opinion.” Your thoughts are as legitimate as anyone else’s. In fact, they might actually be in line with a majority of people who are too timid to speak up themselves. When you expect to be laughed at or contradicted, you’re only undermining the way you feel.Witnessing your confidence and willingness to boldly state your claims can inspire others to champion their own beliefs more freely.

, If a conversation can benefit by your participation, jump in. Healthy exchange of ideas is essential to becoming a more understanding person. There’s usually an opportunity to learn from deep, emotionally-invested discourse, and an opportunity to impart some wisdom of your own.Preface opinionated comments with phrases like “I think...” or “it’s my belief that…”
Be aware of how you present yourself in discussions on politics, religion and ethical issues, as these can easily breed conflict., Get active in making plans or coming to decisions. Explain your line of thinking and make it clear what your preferences are. By holding your tongue, you forfeit your say-so in the decisions that get made, even when they affect you.An action as small as vetoing an option for where to eat lunch can make you feel more empowered to speak.
If you're unsure whether a particular idea will be accepted, make it sound like you're just brainstorming. Try something like ""Do you think it would work better if we..."" or ""What if instead of going to the theater, we curl up and watch a movie on the couch?""

, Failure to speak up can be misinterpreted as permissiveness or indifference. If you’re opposed to something, say so. Take an outspoken stance on objectionable issues, behaviors and beliefs in no uncertain terms. Otherwise, you’re as much to blame for circumstances as the person who has created them.A scornful glance will never have the same effect as forcefully asking ""What makes you think it's acceptable to behave that way?""
You can’t change the way things are until you first point out what’s wrong with them.

, Be polite, cool-headed and willing to listen even (maybe especially) when an ordinary discussion turns into an argument. Do your best to always encourage respectful and open-minded communication. The way you carry yourself in conversation should serve set a positive example. Knowing when it’s best to withhold your opinion or stifle the urge to voice your thoughts is just as important as knowing when to speak proudly.Resist the temptation to stoop to using insults in the midst of a heated argument. ""I'm sorry, but I disagree"" gets the same point across, but without the hostility. It's much more likely that the person you're talking to will listen and take you seriously if you're able to keep a cool head.
Think twice before saying anything that you know might offend or be taken the wrong way.

Join a support group.A support group is a safe place to gather with other caregivers or family members who have a loved one with dementia.",How to Talk to Family Members with Dementia," If you want to interact with your family member, create a safe environment that feels comforting and not threatening. Turn off any background noise such as television or radio. Move to a room that has limited noise and consider shutting the door or closing the curtains.A minimally distracting environment can help your loved one focus their attention and energy on the conversation.;
, Your family member may not remember who you are from visit to visit. Begin each time you see your family member by introducing yourself and your relationship.For example, say, “Hello, I’m Rebecca, your niece. I’m your son Alex’s daughter.”


Be friendly in your introduction. If they don’t recognize you, remember that it’s not personal, and recognition may change from day to day.

, Avoid speaking in “baby talk” and instead focus on making your voice clear, calm, and soothing.Focus on providing safety through your voice.


If you notice that you’re speaking tensely, sharply, or that you’re raising your voice, take a pause and do some deep breathing. Come back to speaking when you’re able to speak calmly and with reassurance.

, If your loved one is struggling to grasp a sense of reality or is behaving in an inappropriate way, your first reaction may be to calmly explain the situation and explain the inappropriateness of it. However, people with dementia may lose the ability to understand and may not respond to logical or rational arguments. Use straightforward simple sentences to talk about what is happening or about to happen.Instead of alluding to situations or using vague speech, be clear in your delivery. For example, instead of saying, “We’ll see your doctor after you eat,” say, “First we are eating breakfast, then we will take the car to see your doctor.”

, Use short, simple sentences if your loved one is struggling to understand you. Slow down your speech. If your loved one does not understand, find a simple and direct way to communicate.Pause so that your family member can understand you. While it may feel like an uncomfortable pause to you, it may be necessary for your loved one to understand you.
If your loved one appears confused, frustrated or withdrawn, try again in a gentle, simple way.
You also want to make sure you are speaking at a slow pace and speaking loud enough for them to hear you clearly. You may have to talk louder and slower than you are used to., Ask questions one at a time so that they do not feel overwhelming. After each question, pause and wait for a response. Give simple choices when possible. For example, instead of asking, “What would you like to drink?” say, “Would you like juice or water?” If your family member’s dementia is advanced, phrase questions so that they have a simple “yes” or “no” answer (""Would you like water?"").A person with dementia can feel overwhelmed when asked lots of questions. While choice is important, too many options can be confusing. If you notice this, tell instead of ask.For example, instead of saying, “What would you like for dinner?” say, “Today we are having lasagna for dinner.”

, Long conversations may be exhausting for someone with dementia. Keep your conversations short but regular. Take breaks but keep contact consistent. If you notice your loved one becoming fatigued, back off or take a break from talking.Offer to go on a walk or to have some quiet time if your family member appears exhausted or disengaged.

, Communicating with your loved one with dementia may be frustrating — you may have to repeat yourself multiple times, rephrase sentences, speak slowly and loudly, and allow the person extra time to think over and respond to what you have said. While this may cause you to become impatient, try to keep this in check. Your loved one is doing the best they can, and it is not their fault they are struggling. Remember that they will sense your tension if you become impatient or angry, which will only make the situation worse.


If you find yourself becoming impatient, this is another opportunity to take a few deep breaths and calm yourself. Breathe into your belly for five seconds, hold for a moment, then exhale slowly. This simple trick will trigger your parasympathetic nervous system, which will calm you down.

, If your family member is struggling to communicate, let them know that it’s okay. Don’t appear impatient or frustrated and instead, let them finish. Encourage your loved one to continue explaining their thoughts or feelings.Avoid interrupting your family member or completing their sentences. This may break their concentration or pattern of communication. Be patient and wait for them to finish speaking.

, Sometimes as communication ability decreases, you may find yourself talking as if your family member is not there. Include your family member in conversations, even if it means changing the language you use.This can help your loved one feel included.


Feeling excluded from conversations can increase feelings of isolation and exclusion. Make a point to include your family member in conversations.
For example, if you’re discussing the day’s plans, say, “I’m looking forward to spending time with you over lunch when we join Jacob and Leslie.”

, When engaging with someone with dementia, think about what they may be feeling. They may be acting or speaking in an agitated way or may appear confused. If you notice your loved one is confused or anxious, adjust how you speak and what needs to be said.For example, it may not be the time to ask them about their day or what they want to eat. Respond to their feelings and empathize with them.


Say, “I’m sorry you’re having a rough time. I know this isn’t easy for you. Let’s go over this later.”
Smile when you speak with the person. This can help relieve tension and remind them that you care, and that they are safe with you., If your family member is talking, listen intently and follow their verbal and nonverbal cues. If you don’t understand something, ask them to say it in a different way. If you’re unclear what your family member is saying, pay attention to their body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions.Even if your family member is struggling to express themselves verbally, respond to their nonverbal communication. For example, if your loved one drops their sweater and appears unhappy, say, “It looks like you’ve dropped your sweater and you’d like it put back. Let me help you with that.”

, If you're updating your family member about others, say their names. Avoid saying “he” or “she” or “they” and instead, spell it out for your loved one.Say, “You grandchildren Courtney, Heather, and Rachel all went boating together last weekend. Courtney, Heather and Rachel had a really nice time and enjoyed being in the water.”


You can also state relationships if that’s helpful. For example, say, “This is your grandchild, Sophia, your son Paul’s child.”

, While it may be tempting to correct your family member’s incorrect statements, let them go.If you find yourself correcting many statements, prioritize the time you spend with your loved one, not the correctness of what they say.


It can be draining to know that your family member is having a hard time grasping reality. If you need a moment to cope with the difficulty, step out of the room briefly or take a deep breath before responding.

, If your loved one begins to become upset, find an alternative activity. Connect emotionally to your family member and validate their feelings and experience. Then, suggest an alternate experience. For example, say, “It seems like this makes you feel upset. I’m sorry you feel upset. Would you like to go for a walk together?”Connect your family member emotionally. This can help them feel safe and understood.
You can also suggest getting food, seeing another family member, or doing a comforting activity.

, Keeping up with your loved one’s care can be exhausting and lead to burnout. You may be burned out or overstressed if you are easily angered by the person, resent the dementia, withdraw from friends or family, feel constantly exhausted, or begin to experience health problems of your own.Take some time for yourself.


Go for a walk, write in a journal, or read. Talking with someone about the difficulties can help.

, Especially if you’re dealing with a role change, it can be helpful to discuss these changes with a therapist.It can be especially hard if the family member is your spouse as the role change can be dramatic in addition to changes in sexual feelings and the ways you connect. If the family member is your parent, you may struggle with the role change and knowing that you now care for them and not them for you. Loving someone with dementia can be a difficult challenge, and it can be helpful to talk to someone about the thoughts and feeling you experience.


Find a therapist by calling your insurance company, local mental health clinic, or physician. You can also do an online search or ask for a recommendation from a friend.

, It’s a safe place to talk about fears, frustrations, and irritations while also being supported by a group of people who have “been there.”


If you are a caregiver, it can be difficult to see your loved one deteriorate while playing an extensive role in their care. It’s common for caregivers to experience burnout, or a point where they begin to resent the person and the role as caregiver. This is why joining a support group can be so crucial.
Do an online search for online support groups or call your local hospital or mental health clinic to see if there’s a support group in your community.

You don't have to sound arrogant to get your point across and to sound like you really believe in what you're saying instead of turning to other people for validation or approval.


It's all in how you say it. If you start a sentence by saying, ""I think that…"" Or, ""But maybe…"" then nothing you say afterwards will sound as forceful as it would have if you just made the statement.;
, For one thing, it is polite for others. Also, eye contact will help others to listen to your thinking carefully. Find a few friendly faces to focus on so your confidence goes up while you're speaking and that you're communicating your message even more clearly. If you look down at the floor, you won't look confident, and if you're looking around while you talk, people may think that you're distracted or looking for something better to do.


Look people in the eyes when you talk to them - you can look away for a moment or two to get your footing, but in general, stay focused on the eyes of the people you're talking to.
If you see someone looking confused or concerned when you're speaking, you may even think about whether or not you're being clear enough. However, you shouldn't let one confused person get you off track.
If you're talking to a larger group where it's difficult to really make eye contact, focus on looking at just a few people in the audience.

, This will promote your own confidence, which is important when you speak. With more confidence, people will take your thinking more seriously. You don't have to think you're perfect to truly praise yourself and let yourself feel like the amazing person that you are. Remind yourself of all of the great things you've accomplished and worked so hard for. Look in the mirror and say at least three things about yourself, or make a list of all of the great things that make you who you are.


If you can't think of anything you'd want to praise yourself for, then you'll need to work on boosting your confidence. Build your self-esteem by focusing on something you're good at, addressing your flaws, and spending time with the people who really care about you and make you feel good about yourself.

, Chances are that you'll sometimes have to speak in public as part of your role. While this can seem intimidating, the benefits of being able to speak well outweigh any perceived fears. To become a better speaker, remember the following strategies (deliberately kept short for ease of memory):


Plan appropriately.
Practice.
Engage with your audience.
Pay attention to body language.
Think and speak positively.
Cope with your nerves.
Watch recordings of your speeches. This will help you to improve each time.

, Arrive early, walk around the speaking area and practice using the microphone and any visual aids. Knowing what you're up against and having a sense of where you'll stand, how the crowd will look, and what it will feel like to move around as you speak can definitely ease your nerves. It's far better to know what you're facing than to have a big surprise -- and a blow to your confidence -- on the day of the big event.


If you really want to know the room, you can also show up on a day before your actual speaking engagement to get a sense of what it's like.

, Visualize yourself giving your speech. Imagine yourself speaking, your voice loud, clear and confident. Visualize the audience clapping – it will boost your confidence. Close your eyes and imagine the most confident and well-spoken version of yourself up in the audience, dazzling them with his words. Or if you're nervous about speaking in a smaller social setting, picture yourself wowing a small group of friends with your words. Picturing the scenario you want to enact can go a long way in making you succeed.


This way, when it's time for your big moment, remember what you visualized -- how can you get there?

, Knowing who you're talking to can go a long way in helping you speak with confidence. If you're addressing a large audience, it's important to know where they come from, how old they are, and what their general knowledge is about your subject. This can help you prepare your words accordingly. If you're talking to a handful of people, knowing as much about them as you can -- their political beliefs, their senses of humor -- can help you say the right thing (and to avoid saying the wrong one).


One of the reasons people get nervous when speaking is because they don't like the unknown; that's why you have to gather as much information as possible.

, Body language can go a long way in making you appear and feel confident. If you want to have confident body language, here's what you should do:


Have great posture
Avoid slouching
Don't fidget with your hands
Avoid pacing around too much
Look ahead of you instead of down at the floor
Keep your face and body relaxed

, Pick a topic you are interested in. Know more about it than you include in your speech or conversation. If you know a lot about your subject, you will feel a lot more confident when you have to speak about it. If you only prepared what you were going to say the night before and are terrified of getting questions you won't know how to answer, then yeah, your confidence will not be at an all-time high. Knowing 5 times more about your subject than you're going to say will make you feel prepared for the big day.


If you will leave some time for questions after your speech, you can practice giving it to a friend in advance; have the friend ask some tough questions to help yourself prepare for what may come.

, While you don't want to shout, you should speak loudly enough so that people don't have to ask you to repeat yourself. Speaking quietly or softly will make people think you are shy and that you don't have confidence in what you're saying -- that you don't really want to be heard anyway.


If you speak in a low voice, not only will others not be able to hear what you say, but you will also portray a submissive demeanor, which suggests the opposite of a confident one.
On the other hand, you don't want to speak so loudly that you're talking over people just to be heard. Your words alone should get people's attention.

, Read as much as you can, from online journals such as Slate or Salon.com to serious literature like Anna Karenina. The more you read, the more you'll know and the more expansive your vocabulary will be. You'll be learning new words and understanding new phrases without even knowing it, and soon, you'll be using the words you read while you're speaking. Having a wide vocabulary is a must if you really want to speak well.


This doesn't mean that you have to throw fifty $100 words into your speeches or everyday conversations every time. Just a few key ""fancy"" words can make you sound more intelligent, but not like you're trying too hard.
Keep a vocabulary journal. Write down all of the new words you've encountered while reading and define them.

, If you want to be well-spoken, then you can't go around using slang or too much casual phrasing. Of course, if your audience is young and hip, you don't want to sound too formal or stilted, but you should avoid saying things like, ""You guys,"" or ""Hella"" or ""Nailed it!"" or whatever phrases are going around in your culture these days.


Of course, if you're just speaking with friends, then slang is fine, but if you're addressing a more mature audience and want to speak well, then you should avoid it.

, Some people view pausing as a sign of weakness, but this is absolutely not the case. It's okay to pause to gather your thoughts and to think about what you're going to say next. What's far worse is speaking too fast and sounding like you're rambling, being frantic, or even saying something that you will immediately regret. Part of slowing down and speaking thoughtfully means that pauses in your speech will sound more natural.


If you use verbal pauses (such as ""um"" or ""uh"") while you speak, don't be too worried about it. It's just a natural way of getting our minds into gear and even President Obama uses them quite frequently. If you think you use them too much, you can try to tone it down, but don't think that you have to avoid them completely.

, Gesturing while you speak is a great way to get your points across and to emphasize your words. But don't use your hands or gestures too much when you speak or you will come off as a bit frantic, like you're using your gestures to compensate because your words aren't enough. Instead, keeping your hands at your sides and using them in just a few key moments when you're talking will help you get your point across.

, Another part of speaking well means knowing what not to say. You may think that you have to give ten examples to prove some point, but in reality, you may only need just one or two, and your ideas will come off more strongly because you chose the best points instead of throwing the entire kitchen sink at the audience you're addressing. If you're giving a speech, then every word has to count; if you're just talking to some friends, it's still best to avoid rambling.


If you're giving a speech, then write it down and say it aloud. Reading your own words can help you see where you're being repetitive, and which things you'd like to cut.

, You may think that stating your main points once is enough and that your audience will get what's most important about what you have to say. Well, that's where you're wrong. If you have a few main points that you really want to get across, whether you're addressing a crowd or trying to make a point during an argument with a friend, stating your main points again, perhaps at the end of your conversation or speech, will help you define your message and make your point even more clearly.


Think about writing an essay. You have to repeat your main points at the end of every paragraph and in your conclusion, don't you? Well, speaking is not so different.

, Concrete examples are the bread and butter of any speech or conversation. Whether you want to convince your audience to use renewable energy or convince your best friend to dump her loser boyfriend, you'll need to present a few cold, hard facts to get people's attention. Pick the statistics, anecdotes, or stories that will most effectively get your point across. Remember, it's not about throwing a million statistics at your audience -- it's about using a few key points that they will actually remember.


Tell a story or two. If you're giving a speech, a story at the beginning or the end can help introduce your points in a more human way.

, Begin by addressing the audience. It buys you time and calms your nerves. Pause, smile and count to three before saying anything. (""One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand. Pause. Begin.) Transform nervous energy into enthusiasm. It's all about finding whatever works for you. Maybe drinking a cup of peppermint tea before you speak does the trick. Maybe drinking water every five minutes will do it for you. Once you find what works for you, stick to it.


You can also develop a routine for talking to friends. Find something that calms you down when you're nervous about speaking, whether it's grabbing a Koosh ball in your coat pocket or smiling a bit more.

, Rehearse out loud with all equipment you plan on using. Revise as necessary. Work to control filler words; practice, pause and breathe. Practice with a timer and allow time for the unexpected. The more you practice, the more natural and well-spoken you will sound when it's time to speak. And the better you feel like you know what to say, the more confidence you'll have when it counts.

, If you're nervous or have accidentally misspoken, don't draw people's attention to it by apologizing for it. Just get on with what you have to say and people will forget all about what you said. Saying, ""Sorry guys, I'm just so nervous,"" or ""Oops, that was awkward,"" will only make things more awkward and uncomfortable. Everyone makes mistakes and there's no need to acknowledge yours unless you're really, really good at poking fun at yourself.

, Focus your attention away from your own anxieties and concentrate on your message and your audience. The most important thing is to get your point across, not to look like Steve Jobs when you do it. If you focus less on yourself, you will feel less self-conscious and more like a messenger, and that will take off a lot of the pressure. Before you speak, remind yourself about how important the message that you have to convey is, and why conveying it matters to you. This will make you stop worrying about whether you're talking too fast or sweating too much.

, Mainly, your speech should represent you — as an authority and as a person. Experience builds confidence, which is the key to effective speaking. A Toastmasters club can provide the experience you need in a safe and friendly environment. Just getting into the habit of giving speeches or speaking publicly will also help you succeed. Even if you just want to speak confidently in front of friends or strangers, the more you do it, the better you'll be at it. It's like any other skill.

, Audiences want you to be interesting, stimulating, informative and entertaining. They’re rooting for you. Think positively about what you have to do before you begin and know that no one wants you to trip, stumble over your words, or forget what you were going to say. Everyone wants the best for you, and you should want that too. Speaking can be a scary thing, whether you're talking to a football stadium of people or just your class, and everyone wants you to do your best.

Recognize the difference between an action being called racist and a person being called racist.If the person pointed out one particular action, that doesn't mean that they hate you or think you're horrible.They're just explaining that you did something hurtful, the same way they'd point out ""I tripped over the mess you left in the hall"" or ""I don't like it when you tease about my nose."",

If someone says you are a racist person, this suggests a bigger problem. Maybe you've done multiple things that came off as racist. Or maybe they're just having a really awful day.;
, When someone says they think you're a racist, take them seriously. Make time to listen to their concerns.


Let the other party talk first before you respond; do not interrupt the other speaker. Then, in a calm and measured way, say, “Wow, I am very concerned that you consider me a racist. I’m interested in discussing this matter further. Let’s do so in the privacy of (my office, a cafe, a quiet room, etc.).”
If there is a power imbalance, they may be afraid to speak to you in a completely private place. If so, try a semi-public place, like a restaurant, a park bench, etc.

, Especially if they are a minority, they may be afraid of you, so do your best to put them at ease. This shows them that you are an understanding person who is willing to listen.


For example, “I'm sorry if I've said or done anything hurtful. I'm really concerned about this. I want people of all races to feel safe and relaxed around me, so if I'm making people uncomfortable, I want to hear about it so I can learn from it.”

, Listen closely to what they have to say.It may be that you've made some mistakes, or that you said things that were interpreted differently than you intended.


Tell them, “I want to know why you think this. What have I done that's racist?” Listen attentively to their response.

, Show sympathy for any racism they've faced, whether it was a misunderstanding or not. Make it clear that you care about their pain. (Some of it might be from other experiences that were not your fault.) This will help them feel calmer, and feel like they can trust you.


For example, “That must be difficult,” “I'm sorry to hear that you had to deal with that,” and “that's too bad” are examples of validating statements.

, If you are white and the other person is a person of color, they probably know more about racism than you do. Listen carefully to their explanations; you may be surprised.


They might think you’re racist because you support racist policies such as criminalization of certain drugs or exclusionary zoning policies. While such policies in theory are not aimed specifically at minorities, their implementation and impact are decidedly biased for or against a given race and therefore racist.Expressing support for politicians who pursue strengthening these policies might be perceived as racist.
Finally, the most obvious and common definition of racism is one in which a person believes one race is superior or inferior to another. Using explicit racial slurs, supporting slavery/segregation/deportation, believing race drives behavior (e.g. ""Mexicans are rapists""), are all examples of serious racism. If you said “I believe it was a mistake to free the slaves,” for instance, you are a racist.
If you don't understand, ask. “I don't understand why that's racist. Would you please explain for me?”

, Mentions of your black friend, your Asian boyfriend, your time volunteering with Latinx children, etc. aren't going to fix things.Mentioning your ancestry doesn't help, either; just because you are of a minority race, doesn't mean you can't be racist to those of other minority races. Not all racists are hateful people who burn crosses, and you can be accidentally racist even while disliking racism in general.

, Remind yourself that in the West, where governments and societies have long been controlled and guided by white men, everyone is racist to some degree or another. Recount to your accuser that many examples of unconscious racial bias exist in you, and that you will try to do better.Use the specific circumstances of the conversation or situation which led to you being accused of racism in order to clarify your position on the issue at hand.

, It may have been that you said something that sounded racist, even if that's not how you meant it. If so, apologize for the misunderstanding and any discomfort on their part, and clarify what you truly meant.


For example, “What I meant to say is that I disagree with Obama's policies, and dislike what he's done with the country. I am glad that America has had its first black president, and hope there will be many more. I'm sorry if I gave you the impression otherwise. That is definitely not what I meant.”
Acknowledge any surprise you feel. For example, “Oh, no, I'm so sorry! I'm surprised and horrified if my words came out that way! I think your fiancee is charming, including her dark skin! And I'm happy to have her joining the family, I promise, and I will call her and tell her that today.”

,


Think about your culture’s history in a framework which acknowledges the structural challenges to a fully egalitarian society. You have most likely absorbed some cultural biases without knowing.
List some examples to demonstrate you understand the issue. Listening less intently to minorities; showing more caution around people of color; and being less likely to hire someone whose name is not traditional or sounds ethnic are just some of the many unconscious but racially biased behaviors everyone in a white society will likely exhibit., If you unintentionally hurt someone, own up to it and apologize. If they aren't ready to forgive you, ask if and how you can make it up to them. You want the person to walk away feeling satisfied and safe around you.


If someone was insulted, tell them a few things that you admire about them. Explain that you value them as a friend/colleague/mother-in-law/etc., and assure them that the racist remark doesn't reflect your feelings about them.
For a friend or loved one, spend some extra time on the relationship. Take them somewhere fun, do something nice for them, or take extra quality time together.
If someone doesn't want to see you, give them space for as long as they need. This shows that you respect their wishes.

, If they publicly called you names, ask them if they would rescind it.If you've been empathetic and willing to make amends, they will most likely agree. If they refuse, you can do little about it, but continue to explain yourself and let people know, if necessary, that you and the accuser have buried the hatchet, and you've made amends for any racist actions.


At the end of the conversation with the person who called you a racist, ask gently, “Are you satisfied with how this turned out? Do you still consider me a racist or bad person? If not, would you please let others know? I want to move on from this, and would like to keep my reputation intact if possible.”

"
"
Reflect on what you said or did which caused offense.Reflective thinking requires you to slow down and process the information you’ve received in new ways.,
Don't respond to online accusations immediately.,
Acknowledge and apologize for the offense you caused.,
Don’t try excuse your behavior.","How to Respond when Someone Calls You a ""Racist""2"," Take a mental step back and examine your biases. Are there certain beliefs you grew up with that led you to make a careless generalization about a group of people? Are there gut-instinct bad feelings about a certain race that you can't explain? Did you make a joke in bad taste that hedges on toxic stereotypes? By thinking reflectively, you’ll be able to obtain a more three-dimensional view of the charge against you.


Relate the accusation against you to other accusations of racism you’ve heard before. How is it similar or different?
Think about what might prevent you from coming to a new understanding of your relationship to race. Stay aware of your own ideas and thoughts as you reflect on your racist act.
Try to think in more abstract terms. Put yourself in the accuser’s position. How would you see yourself? How would what you said or did make others of another race feel?
To better understand the lived experiences of those with marginal racial identities, you should make an effort to read about issues relating to their lives and talk to them with an empathetic ear.You'll be surprised to hear the range of opinions relating to how they're perceived in the world.

, One of the blessings of online communication is that there is less pressure to think quickly. You're allowed to take some time to process your feelings and assemble your response., Maybe you were aiming to make people laugh by wearing a lion costume in blackface to a Halloween party, but it really annoyed a bunch of your friends. Ask yourself if your joke is really worth upsetting a whole group of people and potentially tainting your reputation forever. After someone tells you what you did or said was racist, swallow your pride and apologize.


Say, “I’m really sorry. What I said was pretty awful. Thank you for talking to me and helping me realize why. Can you forgive me for my insensitivity?”

, Don't blame it on the way you were raised,claim that it isn't a big deal, say racism isn't real because a black person was mean to you once, or say it's their fault for bringing it up. It's important to take responsibility for your actions, even when it's hard. Remember the difference between an explanation and an excuse.


The first step in doing so is admitting “I am not a bad person, but I do have negative racial biases which have a hurtful impact on those of another race.”
Don’t attempt to justify your racism as acceptable given some special context. For instance, if you were robbed and you describe the criminal who robbed you to the police using racist terminology, you’re still being racist. Just because you were robbed by someone of a certain ethnic or racial background, you do not have carte blanche to discard basic decency and respect."
"
Don’t panic.,
Don’t act in anger.,
Vent about your own problems somewhere else, to get it out of your system.,
Avoid negative responses to the accusation.Do not flee from, freeze up when confronted by, or concede sarcastically to the individual who called you a racist.,
Recognize that it probably isn't about you.,
Let false accusations go.,
Forgive yourself for racist actions.","How to Respond when Someone Calls You a ""Racist""3"," You might feel insulted, or start worrying about what others will think of you. Instead, focus on the immediate situation, your feelings about it, and potential solutions. If you begin worrying about all the potential ramifications of an accusation of racism, you’ll only drive yourself up a wall.If you need to, take a breather to calm down and free yourself of the anxiety you feel over being accused of racism. Step out to lunch or take a quick nap.

, It’s okay to be angry that you’re being labeled a racist. But do not speak or act in a way motivated by your frustration. This will only compound the problem. If you’re facing the accusation in a face-to-face encounter, take a deep breath before responding. Don’t shout or call names of the person who considers you a racist. If need be, excuse yourself to gather your thoughts and calm down before you say or do something that you’ll later regret.


Say ""I need some air"" or ""This is really important, and I'd like to take some time to think about it"" if you need to leave.

, If you've been having a rough time, don't take it out on the person who called you out. Instead, vent via a social media account, or to a trusted friend.Don't vent online about being called racist, as people may see this and feel that you're insensitive. However, feel free to have a rant about your own problems, from your broken car, an ableist remark directed at your wife, or how demanding your boss is.
Your personal struggles don't present a ""get out of jail free"" card. It is possible to be having an awful day (or week, or month) and still do racist or hurtful things. You are still accountable for your actions.

, For instance, if someone calls you a racist, do not say sardonically, “Yes, I am such a racist!” when in fact, you do not consider yourself one. Alternately, though you may be totally blindsided by the charge that you’re a racist, do not stand there, stuttering and dumbstruck, or run out of the room, embarrassed. Gather your thoughts and think of what to say to the accuser.


Never attack back or cry ""reverse racism.""This will make the situation worse, not better.
Running away from the person who thinks you’re racist will not make the problem go away.

, Taking it personally can make things worse.It's possible to do a racist thing, or hurt someone, while still being a kind and wonderful person. It just means you made a mistake.


Don’t make it about you. You might be upset, but you should not cry, yell, or counter-accuse anyone of racism, or anything else. These responses are immature and counterproductive.

, If they misunderstood what you were saying or received bad information, people make mistakes. If the accuser apologizes, let their accusation go.Recognize that the person made an honest mistake and let it go at that. Put yourself in their shoes and think about how you’d feel if the situation they thought had occurred actually had. What would you feel or say?


For instance, if you thought, as your accuser may have, that someone had said that Asians are the only intelligent race, you may well have accused the person who uttered this racist statement to be a racist. If the person who accused you thought you’d said something similar, you can understand why they did what they did. Use this empathy to respond with forgiveness and move beyond the issue.
Even if the other person doesn’t apologize, forgive them in your heart. You don’t need to let them know in person that you have forgiven them for what they said. Holding onto the frustration and embarrassment they caused you will only hurt you in the long run.

, Everyone hurts other people sometimes, and feeling remorse is a sign that you are still a good person at heart. You can accidentally do a racist thing without being a terrible racist. Your mistake is less important than how you made up for it. Don't hold on to regret forever, and allow yourself to move on.

Read up on racism.,
Surround yourself with diversity.,
Err on the side of caution during discussions about race.,
Listen to people of races not your own.","How to Respond when Someone Calls You a ""Racist""4"," Hearing perspectives from people of color can give you a sense of what it looks like, how it feels, and how to avoid it. You may learn a lot, and become a significantly more educated and egalitarian person as a result.


Consider the book “Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria: And Other Conversations About Race.”Some books on racism can be quite academic. For a more accessible writing style, try bell hooks.

, Don't just look for the people who look like you; reach out to others with different races, backgrounds, religions, abilities, et cetera.

, It's better to have people laughing about how overcautious you are than feeling stung by your comments. If your not sure, stay quiet or noncommittal. Here are some examples of how to speak considerably:


""I have something to say, but I'm hesitant, because I don't want to misspeak and sound racist when that's not my intent. I'll try to word this right, so stop me if comes out weird.""
""Don't ask a pasty guy like me about what racism feels like! Try asking someone who has actually experienced it. Maya studies racism and is a great source.""
""I don't have anything to add. I'm happy to listen.""

, If your positions and attitudes are consistently evaluated as being racist by those who endure racism, you could be a racist. Many people are racist without knowing it. Structural racism—the legitimization of one race domineering all others in business, politics, art, and other social arenas—is often invisible but no less harmful than more overt racism such as racial slurs and disparaging racial comments.Hearing what people who have experienced racism of both kinds have to say on the matter can leave you better equipped to respond to charges that you yourself are a racist.


To listen to what someone has to say, stop speaking. Take a seat, if possible, and place both feet on the ground in a comfortable manner. Place your hands on your thighs.
Maintain eye contact with the speaker.Clear your mind of distracting thoughts and prepare to hear what the other person has to say. Be present in the moment. Think about what you expect to hear, but keep an open mind. Check after the conversation to see if your expectation matched the reality.
Bring a notebook to the conversation so you can take notes on what is said.
If you’re able, bring a recording device like a portable tape recorder so you can play back the conversation and listen again later.

Don't be nervous- There is nothing to be nervous about when speaking up.,
Have a good posture- Having a nice and straight posture will let people know that you won't let anyone walk all over you.,
Listen- If you listen to what other people are saying around you, you might think of more things to saythings to talk about.,
If you are having trouble starting a conversation, ask the other person ""How are you?"",
Class time- If you are in class, actually think about what the teacher is saying.,
Friends- If you are chatting with friends, follow in with the conversation.,
Clubs- If you're in Scouts, 4-H, or any club, you probably do lots of activities.,
Self Esteem- When taking part in a club for kids, you got to speak up.,
Confidence is Key-Always act confident.Not too confident though!",How to Speak Up," It's a good thing to get your thoughts out in the open so that everyone can hear. This may broaden your courage and overcome your shyness. Other people will see you in a whole new and different light. If you are still nervous, think of the 3 C's: ""Calm, Cool, and Collected."" Don't just say them, but actually think about each one. Close your eyes and say each word clearly and slowly. When saying each word, picture yourself being Calm, Cool, or Collected.;
, If you sulk over, then people may think that you are easy to poke at. To emphasis your interest about the subject, try to use body language and build up more confidence.

, You would be surprised how easy it is to add something to a conversation- if you think of it, don't hesitate to make your point. Just don't eavesdrop to other people's conversations, unless you are invited or if it's the right time.

, or another conversation starter. You could also comment on something unusual or exciting that is happening lately. If the other person seems like they want to go on with the conversation, go on too! There is nothing more uncomfortable than being stuck in an awkward silence.

, Not only will you save time on your homework, you will be able to ask questions when needed.

, If you listen, you will know what they are talking about, and then you will know what to talk about too! Try to get involved with the conversation. If people see that you are interested, they will want to talk to you!

, It's important to let the adult know your opinion if your group is taking part in a decision. Everyone should be included; just speak up! This is hard to do if you're not the sort of person to speak out. But if you let your leader know your opinion, everyone should respect and value that, and if they don't (which is quite unlikely to happen), you may want to join another troop, pack, or group. You are a part of the group you're in. Everyone should agree fully on what the group should do. Voting isn't always fair if you're going to spend a lot of money on it. If you feel like this isn't happening, tell your group (if you're the leader), or tell the leader (if you're a kid), that you want to make it fair for everyone. Just remember that your opinion IS important and shouldn't be ignored.

, Don't be shy. This is will only make you nervous. Believe in yourself that you can do it. If you feel self-conscious, pretend it's only you and the club leader. This may sound dumb, but try it and don't think about the others. You just have to be strong. Being frightened that an incident that has happened in the past like being booed off a stage, or kicked out of a group, will only weaken you. Keep in mind: you are amazing, and if other people don't see that they are the ones with a problem here. If you show them who you are, someone will notice your excellent ideas and free will and acknowledge it

, Some may think you're trying to take over or be cocky. GOOD LUCK!

Practice a creative art form.,
Use social media constructively.,
Focus on others.",How to Stop Being an Attention Seeker1," People who are considered attention seekers tend to behave in ways that are inauthentic. They do things for attention, rather than simply being or expressing who they really are. Doing something creative is a great way to express yourself authentically, and practice being yourself. You can choose any form that you want, including painting, writing, making music, singing, or practicing a craft.If you’ve never done something creative before, don’t be afraid. Try something that interests you, even if you don’t know if you’ll be any good at it.
Remember that you’re doing this for you. Practice expressing yourself creatively without worrying what others will think, or planning to show off what you make.;
, Social media can often be misused by people who are seeking attention. It’s okay to use social media to make plans with friends and stay on top of current events. However, if you notice that you’re using it just to get attention, you should reconsider before you post.Notice if most of your posts seem like bragging, or like showing off.
Notice if your posts often express feeling sorry for yourself, or seem like you’re fishing for compliments or support.
An attention-seeking post could be, ""Always having the most fun with the coolest friends in the world!!"", whereas you could instead post a picture of your friends and write, ""So grateful to have such great friends in my life.""
If you need support, instead of writing something like, ""Worst day of anyone's life, ever. I totally want to crawl into a hole and die right now,"" you could write, ""I had a really terrible day today. Is anyone available to talk? I could use some company."" It’s okay to ask directly for support with social media. However, be clear that you’re asking for support, and keep the conversation private once someone offers.

, When you’re always seeking attention, most of your focus is on yourself. In order to shift this, try focusing on others. There are many ways to do this. You can spend time with people you care about, volunteer, or even spend time learning about others.Are there people in your community who are in need? You could volunteer your time at a soup kitchen or retirement home. You could also volunteer at your local library, reading to kids or helping students with homework after school.
Spend time with friends and family, and ask them about their own lives. Remember how much you care about them, and spend time investing in what they have to say.
You can invent a way of focusing on others that’s fun for you. For example, you could organize a coat drive in the winter, or organize a neighborhood cleanup.

Speak only when it's important.,
Avoid speaking to fill empty space.,
Think about your words carefully.,
Be aware of time when you speak.,
Think about whether you speak out of anxiety.,
Avoid speaking to impress others.",How to Speak Less1," Before you speak, ask yourself if what you're saying is truly important. You should avoid talking when you're not really contributing to the conversation.People tend to listen to those who choose their words carefully. Someone who's always sharing their opinion or telling stories may lose people's interest with time. If you have a tendency to talk too much, you may find yourself constantly sharing information unnecessarily.;
, Oftentimes, people speak to fill empty space. You may find yourself speaking in professional situations, such as work or school, to ease your anxiety about silence. Sometimes, silence is okay and you do not need to talk just to fill space.For example, if you and co-worker are in the break room at the same time, you do not have to make small talk. If your co-worker does not seem interested in talking, they may not be in the mood for social interaction.
In this case, it's okay to offer a polite smile and let the silence happen.

, If you talk too frequently, you may say the first thing that comes to mind without filtering yourself. Learning to speak less means learning to think about your words. Before saying something, try to think about the words you're going to say ahead of time. This may help you learn to keep certain things to yourself, leading you to speak less overall.People often reveal information they'd rather keep private through speaking too much. When you think of something you want to add, especially if it's something very personal, pause. Remember you can always share new information later, but you can never make information private again once you've shared it.

, Having a rough sense of how long you've been talking can help you speak less. In general, after about 20 seconds of speaking you're at risk for losing the listener's attention. After this point, tune in to the listener. Look for any cues they're losing interest.Watch body language. The listener may fidget or check their phone if they're getting bored. Their eyes may also begin to wander. Try to wrap it up within the next 20 seconds and give the speaker a chance to share.
In general, try not to talk for more than 40 seconds at a time. Any longer than this may make the listener feel irritated or talked over.

, People often talk too much due to underlying social anxiety. Pay attention to when you're talking a lot. Do you feel anxious? If so, work on coping in other ways.When you find yourself speaking too much, pause and evaluate your mood. How are you feeling? Are you feeling anxious?
You can do things like count to 10 in your head or take deep breaths if you're anxious. You can also try giving yourself a pep talk before social events. Remind yourself that it's okay to be nervous, but you should relax and try to have fun.
If social anxiety is a major problem for you, see a therapist to address it.

, In work situations especially, people tend to talk too much to impress others. If you notice you talk a lot, think about whether you're trying to show off.If you tend to talk too much to impress others, try to remind yourself others will be more impressed by what you say than how much you say.
Instead of going overboard talking about yourself, reserve your input for moments when you can contribute something valuable to the conversation.

Spell out cents when you are writing them independently of a larger sum.,
Don’t spell out numbers that are larger than 99, unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.,
Spell out large numbers at the beginning of sentence.,
Include commas as well as numerals if you are writing numbers in the thousands that are not at the beginning of a sentence.,
Spell out numbers in the millions or higher.,
Use numerals with dates, rather than spelling them out.,
Use numerals with times as well.,
Spell out noon or midnight, when using these times in a sentence.

,
Spell out decades.,
Use numerals with four-digit dates.",How to Spell Numbers," Unless you are short on space, this is the most widely accepted way to write a single-digit number.;
, You may also spell it as “zed” if using the UK English accepted spelling. Since it can be easily mistaken for the letter “O,” it is best to treat it as if it were a single-digit number.

, In almost all cases, single, double-digit and compound numbers should be spelled out for clarity if they start a sentence.


Exceptions may be used for incomplete sentences, like bullet points, or four-numeral dates (i.e. 1845).

, The majority of styles suggest using the numerals, such as 67; however, Chicago Manual of Style suggests spelling these out until you get to number 99.


Check with your professor or editor if you are unsure.
Whatever you choose, make sure you are consistent.

, This mostly applies to writing them at the beginning of a sentence. It can also apply to all double-digit numbers if you are using the Chicago Manual of Style.

, It is better to write “fifty cents” than “$0.50.” If you are writing cents as part of an amount greater than $1, write “$1.50.

, These numbers can get fairly long, and they are clearer if written as numerals. For instance, 487 is clearer and more succinct than four hundred eighty-three.

, Despite the long numbers, this is still the accepted grammatical style in most cases. Note, that it is better to use the most succinct version of the word when you start getting into thousands.


For example, forty-five hundred is a better spelling than four thousand five hundred.
You don’t need to use the word “and” for larger numbers, as it is implied.

, For example, “She made $6,987 during the month of June.”

, After you get to seven-digit figures, the zeros are generally too long to prove clear if you write numerals. For example, use one million, rather than 1,000,000.


Add the word “dollars” after the spelling if you are referring to currency. Replace dollars with another currency if it applies.

, For example, 1900 or 764. This is true whether at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence.


It is a good idea to include AD or BC for double or triple-digit dates to improve clarity.

, For inexact times, you can write 8 AM, rather than 8:00. For specific times, include a colon and the exact time to the minute.


You can write AM and PM, am and pm, A.M. and P.M., or a.m. and p.m. All of these are correct. Just make sure you stick with one system.

,, Generally, it is better spell out seventies than write “70s.” Some styles prefer that you use numerals, in which case you should leave out the apostrophe before the “s.”

, Also, avoid the apostrophe. For example, “1600s.”"

Introduce and initiate.,
Use an icebreaker.,
Express interest and make an effort.,
Find common ground.,
Overcome pregnant pauses.,
Establish personal boundaries.,
Exit thoughtfully.",How to Small Talk for Successful Business Networking," Go ahead and initiate with a hello! Even if you recognize, or slightly know someone, re-introduce yourself. Be aware of how he introduces himself (you may know him as Charles, but maybe he goes by Chuck) and use his name throughout your interaction. This will help you remember it in the long run and also establish a personal connection. By taking ownership and initiating a conversation, you will feel more in control to drive the direction of the exchange.;
, An icebreaker not only provides a way to meet new people, but also helps jump start conversations. For example, using an icebreaker such as “Tell me about your conference last week...” instead of simply saying hello can lead to a fruitful conversation, rather than an uncomfortable silence. Some other valuable icebreakers you might use are:


“Bring me up to date on your latest project.”
“What do you find to be the most enjoyable aspect of your job?”
“Tell me about your history with ________.”
“How did you come to find yourself in the health care field?”

, You have to be interested if you want to be interesting. Part of your job as a conversation starter is to get the other person to talk. Listen to what your conversational partner is saying and ask relevant follow-up questions. Take cues from them and make a mental list of questions you can ask to get them to elaborate. If you’re talking to Mary in the marketing department, ask what she’s working on, what the new marketing strategies are, how she is impacted by the new branding campaign. This is a great way to brainstorm about future projects, find out about potential clients or build a lasting business relationship. That being said, be sure not to ask so many questions that you come off as an interrogator. There should be a flow and balance when interacting.

, Whether you’re chatting with a new co-worker or a business function speaker, it’s important to stay on a related topic. As long as you stay on a subject you are both familiar with – like your specific field or the day’s event – you’ll be able to communicate easily. Why were you in the setting you’re in? Did you find today’s seminar helpful? Wasn’t the memo this week interesting? Avoid controversial topics like politics, religion, personal relationships and family issues and stick to what you both know is applicable.

, It’s up to you to keep the conversation going if there are some uncomfortable pauses. Use your setting for ideas to reinvigorate the discussion. Say, “It’s great having our sales conference in a warm, tropical place. Have you been to Mexico before?” Use pauses as an opportunity to compliment your international counterpart. Try, “I’m impressed with what you’re doing for our Asian business. You’ve made some huge improvements in our technology department over there.” This is also a great time to interject with any material you’ve previously prepared.

, It’s fine if you want to let someone know where you went to college or how many children you have, but be mindful of how much personal information you provide. Sure, your relationship could benefit if you find out both your wives are attorneys, but evaluate the value of the subject matter and its impact on the rapport. If the dialogue gets too sidetracked into personal details, the business-networking angle can become lost. Revealing too many personal details in a business setting can be inappropriate. Use your best judgment to maximize the content of the conversation.

, In many business situations, it’s important to make contact with several people and move around a room. If you are in management it is always good to make contact and interact with as many on the team as possible. And sometimes, there is just a good time to move on. Find an appropriate point in the conversation to make an exit. Say, “I really enjoyed talking to you about today’s meeting. I have your card and I’ll be in touch with you this week so we can discuss it further.” Make a plan that is actionable and give a specific time when you’ll follow up. Most importantly, if you say you’re going to do something, do it!

Forgive yourself for your mistakes.,
Create a daily practice of authenticity.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Commit to making the change.,
Spend quality time alone.,
Monitor your progress.",How to Stop Being an Attention Seeker2," Even though it feels bad to dwell on mistakes we’ve made, many people replay those things over and over again in their heads. Allow yourself forgiveness, and see what you can learn from your mistakes.You can’t change the past, but you can learn valuable lessons from it. Tell yourself how great it is that you’ve learned something new and can change the way you do things in the future.
If you remember certain times that you acted in an attention-seeking way in the past, forgive yourself for those things, too. The fact that you can acknowledge those behaviors means you can work to prevent them in the future.
Talk to yourself kindly, the way that you would to a friend having a difficult time. Say to yourself, ""I know I messed up that time, but I was doing my best in the moment. Everyone messes up sometimes. It's okay, and I'll try to do things differently next time.""

, Choose ways that you want to practice being authentic each day. This can mean doing something that you enjoy by yourself, or reciting an important affirmation to yourself.Practice being yourself and acting in a way that feels genuine, without worrying what people will think. You can make a practice of doing one thing each day, when you feel that you’re being true to how you feel in the moment. This could mean saying something honest that you haven't before, such as, ""Actually, I don't like going to that cafe very much."" It can also mean doing something differently, such as wearing an outfit that's comfortable, even if it's not stylish.
You can develop personal affirmations to help you accept yourself. You can say something like, “I am a valuable, lovable person the way that I am,” or, “I accept and love all aspects of myself even as I work to grow and change.”

, Mindfulness refers to trying to stay present wherever you are, without getting lost in thoughts or feelings that take you out of the moment. Mindfulness is most often practiced through meditation techniques. However, there are many ways to practice mindfulness.You can find books or websites that offer meditation techniques, or visit a meditation center to find guidance on how to begin meditating.
If meditating isn’t right for you, practice mindfulness by noticing the physical sensations you’re experiencing. If you start to get distracted by guilt, shame, or unpleasant memories, just notice the feeling of your clothes on your skin, or your feet on the ground.

, It is almost impossible to make a change in ourselves if we don’t consciously commit to doing so. If you want to change or eliminate your attention-seeking behavior, make a commitment to do so, and to take specific steps toward that goal.Write down your commitment. You can put it on a calendar, marking the day you commit to start working on it.
Write down daily or weekly goals, such as, “I will meditate for five minutes each day,” or, “Each week, I will volunteer 5 hours of my time to a charitable cause.”
Tell someone else about your commitment. Tell a trusted friend or family member. They can check in on you to see if you’ve followed through on your commitments.

, If you're an attention seeker, you probably try to spend lots of time with other people. Practice spending time by yourself, too. Set a goal for how much time you'll spend alone each day or week.


When you're alone, do things that you enjoy. This will help being alone feel more fun and enticing. You can read your favorite books and magazines, walk around your favorite park or neighborhood, or dedicate time to a favorite hobby.
It may be uncomfortable to spend time alone at first. However, push through that discomfort and you'll begin to cherish the time you get by yourself.

, Once you have a practice for making positive changes, take time to reflect and see how you're progressing. You can do this by writing in a journal, asking for feedback from someone you trust, or simply taking some time to think back on the past day or week.


Be gentle with yourself as you progress. Making big changes in yourself doesn't happen overnight.
Praise yourself for any positive changes. Give yourself credit for the work you've done. Say to yourself, ""Great job. You've really been doing your best at this, and it's working.""

Rely on friends and family.,
Ask for an honest evaluation.,
Join a support group.,
Go to therapy.",How to Stop Being an Attention Seeker3," This should be someone you who you know will be honest with you. They should also be someone who you know has your best interests at heart. You’ll need to trust their opinion, and to be willing to hear them, even if it’s hard. they could be a sibling, aunt, close friend, or coworker.Choose someone whom you see or interact with regularly. That way, they’ll be able to notice your behaviors on a more regular basis.
Make sure the person will be willing to tell you things that you might not want to hear.
Make sure the person is able to be kind and compassionate, even when sharing things that may sound critical.

, Let them know the kinds of behaviors that you’re concerned about. Ask them to keep an eye out for those. They can also tell you if they think your emotional reactions to situations are dramatic or overblown.If you don’t know which behaviors to look for, you can simply tell the person that you’re worried that you’re an attention seeker. Ask them to point out any behaviors that reflect that.
You can also ask the person if they’ve already noticed anything you do that seems like attention seeking.
Say something like, ""I'm trying to work on my attention-seeking behaviors. Have you noticed any of them? Would you be willing to keep an eye out and let me know if you notice me doing things for attention?""

, Attention seeking behavior is often associated with addictive behavior and personality types. If you don’t struggle with any kind of addiction, it may not make sense to join a group. However, if you are aware of other addictions or compulsive behaviors in yourself, consider joining a support group.Common addictions that are often paired with attention seeking are alcoholism, drug abuse, and compulsive eating.
Being an attention seeker does not necessarily mean you’re at higher risk for addiction.
Seeking help from a group can be useful whether or not you have one other person whom you’ve asked for help.
You can find listings for local support groups online. If there is not a group in your area, there may be online groups that can provide support.

, If you don’t have an individual person or a group to help you, you may want to find a therapist. Therapists can help you work through your attention seeking behaviors, as well as the underlying issues that have led to them.You can seek out a therapist for individual sessions, or see if they have a therapy group that would make sense for you.
You can find listings for local therapists online. Many sites will have profiles of each therapist. You can see if they have a specific focus, or have experience dealing with your particular problems.
Some therapists may accept health insurance or offer sliding scale payment plans.

Focus only on the speaker.,
Maintain eye contact.,
Think about what the speaker is saying.,
Clarify what the speaker is saying.",How to Speak Less2," When in a conversation, do not look at your phone or glance around the room. Do not think about things like what you're going to do after work or eat for dinner that night. Direct your attention solely on the speaker. This will help you listen better, as you'll focus on what's being said.Keep your eyes on the speaker most of the time. If you find other thoughts creeping in, remind yourself to return to the present and listen.

, Eye contact shows you're paying attention. Meet the person's eyes as they talk. Eye contact conveys that you're paying attention and present. A lack of eye contact can come off as rude or disinterested.Electronic devices, like cell phones, can often demand our attention, especially if they make noise or give off notifications. Keep your phone in your purse or pocket when talking to someone so you're not tempted to look elsewhere.
Eye contact can also let you know if you're boring someone else. If someone breaks eye contact while you're speaking, you may be talking too much. Pause and give the speaker a turn.

, Listening is not a passive act. While the speaker talks, it's your job to listen to what they're saying. Try to withhold judgment while you do so. Even if you disagree with what's being said, wait your turn to speak. Do not think about how you'll respond while the speaker is talking.It can help to try to picture what's being communicated. Create images in your mind that represent what the speaker is saying.
You can also try to latch on to key words and phrases while the speaker talks.

, In any conversation, it will eventually be your turn to share. Before doing so, however, make it clear you were listening. Paraphrase in your own words what the speaker said and ask any questions you have.Do not repeat what the speaker said verbatim. Just rephrase your understanding of what they said. Also, keep in mind that active listening is meant to help you pay close attention to the speaker and let them know you are listening. Do not use active listening as a way to interject or make your opinions known.


For example, say something like, ""So, you're saying you are stressed about the upcoming office party.""
Then, follow up with a question. For example, say, ""Where do you think this stress is coming from? Do you want to talk about that?""
Make sure to be empathetic and non-judgmental as you listen to the speaker. You can express respect and validate their position without giving up your own position.

"
"
Express yourself when necessary.,
Do not overdo eye contact.,
Keep an open mind when listening.",How to Speak Less3," Do not take speaking less to mean not asserting and expressing yourself. If you have a serious concern, or an opinion you feel is important, do not hesitate to speak up. Part of speaking less is knowing when it is valuable to share.For example, if you're going through a serious problem in your personal life, it's okay to share with others if you need support.
It's also important to share if your opinion could be valuable. If you, say, have a strong opinion about something at work, it can be beneficial to share with your boss and co-workers.

, Eye contact is important. However, constant eye contact can come off as too intense. People do tend to associate eye contact with confidence and attentiveness, but overdoing it may make you appear distrustful. It's appropriate to hold someone's eye contact for about 7 to 10 seconds and then look away for a moment.Eye contact may also be less appropriate in certain cultures. Asian cultures may find eye contact disrespectful. If you're meeting someone from a different culture, make sure to read up on social etiquette surrounding eye contact.

, Everyone has opinions and their own sense of what's right and normal. When you're listening very attentively to another person, they may sometimes say things you take issue with. However, while you're listening, it's important to keep judgment behind. If you find yourself making judgments about someone, pause and remind yourself to focus on the words. You can analyze information later. When listening, just focus on the speaker and leave judgment behind."

In some cases the PIN may be printed on the receipt., When your call is connected, you will you start using the minutes on your pre-paid calling card. The card should give you an update on the number of minutes remaining before the call is connected., After your call has been connected, you can talk as long as you have minutes. When you're finished with your call, just hang up., When shopping for a calling card, it's easy to get overwhelmed. You can find cards intended for a particular region, or cards that are for general international calls. Some cards are only good for one phone call, while others will allow you to make several.Most calling cards have disclaimers on the back of the card.

However, it's worth it to read the disclaimer to find out exactly how the calling card will function., Some calling cards have a fee for everything. You may find that there is a weekly maintenance fee, a connection fee, a post-call fee, and in some cases, a dialing fee.If you end up using your card for a single phone call, fees may not be much of an issue for you. But, if you plan on using your card for multiple calls, be careful. You may end up losing your minutes to fees.Post-call fees can be up to $1 after the first call, or $1 for each week you have the card. Other cards charge a 35% surcharge for having the card.Most cards have a fee for calling from a pay phone. This fee can be anywhere between 59 cents and $1.35.

Call the company if you are not sure whether you will be charged a fee for adding money to your card."

Have a reason to call.,

Listen to her.,
Get to the point.,
Deepen your voice.,
Speak clearly and slowly.,
Offer compliments.,
Keep the topics light.,
Tell her you enjoyed talking to her.,

Offer a sincere goodbye.",How to Talk to a Girl over the Phone," Before you pick up the phone, make sure you know why you’re calling. If you’re phoning a girl you already know, it may be to ask her out. If it’s a girl who you’re hoping to get to know better, it may be to follow up on a conversation that you’ve already had. It’s important to have a concrete reason so you don’t just wind up rambling.If you’re not quite ready to ask her out on a date, you might call her up to ask her to hang out in a group with other friends.
If you aren’t ready to ask her out and just want to get to know her better, think back to your last in person conversation and find a topic you can revisit. For example, if she recommended a book, you might call to tell her how much you enjoyed it. If you’re in the same class at school, you might ask about a recent project.;
, When you speak to her, you want to be sure that she’s not in a hurry to get off the phone. Try to call her when she has free time, such as after school or work or during a lunch break.If you’ve just met the girl, don’t wait too long to call her. You want to make sure that you’re still fresh on her mind, so try calling within a day or two of getting her phone number.

, If you’re not sure when a good time to call her is, texting first can help. You might ask her if she’s free later that day or tell her that you’ll be calling in a few minutes so she has a heads up.If she texts you for any reason and you happen to be near your phone when the message comes through, take advantage of the opportunity. Send her a text back to tell her that you’re going to call her in a couple of minutes.

, If you really like the girl and want the conversation to go well, it’s completely normal to be nervous before you call. To keep yourself from rambling on the phone, try a deep breathing exercise. It can help calm you down so you can make the best impression., You want to make a good first impression when she answers the phone, so it’s important to have a solid greeting ready to go. If you know each other fairly well, saying hello and identifying yourself is usually sufficient. If you’ve just met, say hello, give your name, and remind her where she met you.For example, if you know the girl well, you might say, “Hey Kristy, it’s John. How are you?”
If you’ve just met her, you might say, “Hey Kristy, it’s John. We met yesterday at the library.”

, Talking to her about generic topics like the weather definitely isn’t going to impress her. Tailor the conversation to her interests or hobbies so you know that she’ll be engaged -- and she’ll know that you actually pay attention when she speaks.For example, you might say to her, “You mentioned you’re a baseball fan. What did you think about that game last night?”
You can also ask her about things that are going on in her life. For example, you might say, “You had a test yesterday, didn’t you? How did it go?”

, You want to keep your conversation going as smoothly as possible, so it’s best to avoid yes or no questions. They tend to stall conversations, while open-ended questions can help it keep going.For example, instead of asking “Did you like the movie?,” you might say, “What were your favorite things about the movie?”

, You may be tempted to impress her by doing most of the talking over the phone, but that can be a mistake. Give her a chance to speak and listen carefully to what she has to say. That will let her know that her thoughts and opinions genuinely matter to you.If she’s telling a story, make sure to let her know that you’re paying attention. When she pauses, you might say “Really?” so she knows you’re following along.
Don’t be afraid to ask her questions when she’s talking either. That’s another way to let her know that you’re paying attention.

, While it’s good to make small talk with her about her interests and what’s going on in her life, you don’t want to let the conversation ramble on aimlessly. After the initial pleasantries, explain why you called. In most cases, she’ll appreciate your being direct.For example, you might say, “I was calling to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow night.""
You can also say something like,“I was calling to see if I could get that pasta sauce recipe we talked about.”

, If you’re trying to flirt with her, you want to sound confident and sure of yourself. Lowering your voice a little so it doesn’t sound squeaky or timid can definitely help. Make sure that you speak loudly, though, so she can hear everything you say., When you're nervous, you may have a habit of talking quickly. If you want to sound flirty, though, try to slow down your speech and speak clearly. That will help you sound more confident, which is important when you're flirting., When you’re trying to win a girl over, making her feel good about herself can certainly do the trick. Compliment the things that you like about her, but be honest and try not to sound too cheesy.For example, you might say, “I meant to tell you the other day… you looked really pretty in that blue dress.”
Don’t just focus on her physical attributes when you’re complimenting her. If you’re impressed by her sense of humor, intelligence, kindness, or other qualities, make sure to tell her about those too.

, When you’re trying to be flirty, it’s best to avoid heavy topics, such as your sick friend or the layoffs happening at work. Instead, stick to fun, happy subjects, such as your new cat or the trip you recently took to an amusement park., When you’re getting ready to wind down the call, you want to make sure that she knows you appreciated the time she spent talking to you. Let her know that you enjoyed your conversation and you’d like to talk to her again in the future.


For example, you might say, “Talking to you was really fun. Let’s do it again.""
You can also say something like, “This was a really great conversation. Maybe we can continue it tomorrow at lunch?”

, If you called her for a specific reason, be sure to go over the details before ending the conversation. For example, if you asked her on a date and she agreed, make sure you know when you’re going and where you’re going to meet.Even if you haven’t made a date or plans, it’s a good idea to mention when you’ll see her again before you end the call. For example, you might say, “I’ll probably see you this weekend at Jake’s birthday party. Let’s talk more then.”

, When you’re finished with the conversation, you’ll want to say goodbye. Depending on the time of day, you might end the call by saying, “Have a good night” or “Have a good day.” You can also be more casual and say, “See you later” or “Take care.” Just be sincere so she knows that you mean what you’re saying."

There seems to be a lot of companies that offer tracking services. Companies include mSpy, TheOneSpy, FlexiSPY, and TeleNav Track.


Also consider whether you want to record or listen in to your employees’ conversations or monitor their text messages. If so, then find an app that allows you to do all this monitoring.;
, You might not know where to star. Ask other business owners if they use tracking software. Get their opinion of the product and customer service. You can research the products later.


Also ask if the business owner has found that tracking employees increase productivity. You might actually lose possible employees who don’t want to be tracked.You should know this information before going ahead and installing a tracking app on your employees’ phones.

, Once you find several app providers, you should compare them so that you find exactly what you need at the right price. Consider the following:


How many phones can you install the app on?
Can you transfer the app from one device to another without paying a new licensing fee?
In addition to GPS tracking, what other features are available on the app?

, Generally, you can't monitor your employees' private cell phones, so you should give them phones owned by the company.Install the app before giving the phone to your employees.


Alternately, you could have your employees sign an agreement to download the app on their personal phones and to allow you access to the tracking information. This agreement could be in an employee contract or in a manual or handbook.However, the law is a little unsettled regarding when you can access an employee’s personal device. The law is clearer when you own the device, so it will probably be easier to give your employees phones.

, Generally, you can track the location of cell phones by logging into a Web-based browser page.You should be able to access this information from work or from home. Typically, you can track each individual employee and generate reports.

, In the United States, federal law prohibits interception of electronic communications. However, the law makes an exception for employers to monitor an employee’s use of its own system if there is a legitimate business need. These business needs can include:improving customer service
making sure employees are working
preventing harassment

, You can monitor even if a business exception doesn’t exist if you get employee consent. This consent consists of giving the employee notice that you intend to track the cell phone. So long as the employee continues to work for you, they have consented.It’s best to get consent even if a business exception exists.


You should include your monitoring requirements in your employee contract and include a flyer that they can keep with them.

, To protect your employees, you should decide who can access the tracking information. If you are a small business and you are the only manager, then you might not need a policy. But larger companies should identify who can access the information and under what circumstances.Carefully explain that you will not access the information after work hours. You might be violating your employee’s privacy by, for example, tracking them as they go to the hospital on their off hours., Your lawyer can help you understand your legal responsibilities and any wrinkles in the law. Explain that you want to track your employees using smart phones and ask for the lawyer’s advice.


If your business doesn’t have a lawyer, then get a referral from your local or state bar association. You can find the nearest bar association by visiting here: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx.
Also involve your lawyer in drafting your consent document and privacy policy.

, As with tracking an employee’s physical location, you shouldn’t try to hack or access an employee’s cell phone to read their emails or listen into their phone conversations. Instead, you should limit your monitoring to cell phones you provide your employees.


Of course, if an employee is having loud conversations on their personal cell phone, then you can certainly punish them for not working on company time. You don’t have to go out of your way to avoid overhearing a conversation.

, States may offer employees more protection than the federal law. For this reason, you should research your state’s law on intercepting communications such as phone calls. Talk with your lawyer and look online. Each state’s law is different.


In California, for example, a monitored conversation must have a beep at regular intervals or a message stating the call is monitored., If your employee uses a private email account (such as Gmail) that is password protected, then they have a reasonable expectation of privacy.The law is in flux, but as an employer you should protect yourself by not reading those emails.


Computer hacking laws prohibit people from signing into someone’s personal account with their password.
Don’t access these accounts even when the employee is using your company phone. You are taking a risk if you do.

, When you start listening to a call, you probably don’t know the substance of the conversation. However, as soon as you realize that the call is personal, federal law requires that you stop monitoring it.Nevertheless, you should note that your employees received a personal phone call using the work cell phone. You might have told them to use the phones strictly for work purposes.

, You should clarify in your employee handbook/manual, employment contracts, and other documents that employees have no expectation of privacy when using your cell phones.Clarify that this includes emails and telephone calls.


For example, you could write, “When using Acme Consulting equipment or resources, our employees do not have any expectation of privacy in their use of such resources or equipment. Pursuant to our company policies, we may monitor our employees’ email and phone use. This policy does not suggest that all employees will be monitored. We have no duty to do so. Instead, it is meant to bring to your attention the fact that monitoring may occur.”If you do give assurances that you won’t monitor phone calls or email, then you are required to follow those promises."

Have some conversation topics in mind before picking up the phone to call someone.,
Determine how long this call might be.,
Do not talk too much.,
Know when and how to end the phone call.",How to Talk on the Phone1," You can even write them down if you want. Don't write a whole sentence; the last thing you want to do is read from a script! Write just a few words to remind you of what you wanted to talk about.If you don't have any thing in particular you want to talk to your friend or family member about, here are some ideas:


Read the newspaper or watch the news and see what's happening around the world. That way you can talk about some current events.
Talk about a movie or show you've both seen that you liked or disliked and what you both think about it.
Share a funny or interesting incident that happened to you, either recently or a long time ago.
Ask them about any noteworthy happenings going on in their life right now or recently.;
, Casual phone calls can vary greatly in length, and who you're talking to is a big factor in that. If it's someone you haven't talked to in a while, or who you don't get to see often, that probably necessitates a longer conversation. If it's a friend you see every week, you probably don't have much to catch up on, so the call won't need to be very long.


The benefit of knowing ahead of time roughly how long you want this call to be is that you can avoid ending the call too short or staying on too long, by preparing topics of conversation appropriately.

, If you don't have too much to say, let the other person talk most of the time, and simply keep the conversation going. Don't interrupt when the other person is talking, let him/her have his/her say. A big part of having a successful causal phone conversation is simply good listening skills.It can also help to have some questions ready to ask, especially when the conversation falls silent. Some possible questions include:

How was your day?
How's work been going?
How was your weekend?
Have you been working on any projects recently?
Seen any good movies recently?



, You don't want to wear out a pleasurable chat. The goal is to hang up the phone with the other person thinking, ""what a nice chat I should call him/her again sometime.""When to end the call can usually be felt by noticing more frequent pauses in the conversation and that you've run out of interesting topics. The personality of the person you're talking to, and how often you see and/or talk to them, are both going to be big factors in how long the conversation will go on.
Once you get the feeling that the conversation is coming to a natural ending point, end the call gracefully, similarly to if you were talking to someone in person and had to leave. The structure of the calls end should look like: a positive statement about the chat, optionally add what you're about to do next, next let them know you'd like to talk again, and finally say goodbye. For example: ""It was good to talk to you. I've got to go prepare dinner, but let's speak again soon. Goodbye."" Of course, in between each statement, let the other person respond first.

Remember that a successfully phone call is a dialogue, not just you getting across what you need to say. Allow time for the other person to respond to your statements and questions, and follow up on their responses rather than just jumping into the next topic., For formal phone calls, you're going to want to have a different tone to your speech than a casual call, just as you speak differently at your friends house than at a meeting.Here are some basic formal phone call tips:


Don't use slang or informal speech.
Use the other person's appropriate title when greeting them.
If you need to put a customer on hold, ask them permission first.
Speak clearly and slowly enough to be heard.
If you miss what the other person said, don't say ""what?"" Say ""I'm sorry, I didn't catch that,"" or ""pardon?""

"
"
Pay attention to your own body language.,
Relax.,
Practice.,
Use canned lines.",How to Talk on the Phone3," Just because you can't see the other person's body language doesn't mean your own isn't important. It may help you to pace around while you talk, or gesture with your free hand. Smiling while you talk will both help you come across as friendly and open, and make you feel more friendly and open.


Some people also find it helpful to look in the mirror while they speak on the phone.

, Before you make the call or answer the phone, take a few deep breaths with your eyes closed. If you have any little routine's that help you relax, put them to use before and/or during the call., As with all things, practice makes perfect. If you really want to get better at talking on the phone without getting nervous, get a job that heavily involves phone calls. Over time, it will go from something that induces apprehension and dread to something you can do without even thinking about it. You can also practice by calling your friends or family just to talk. Plan for the conversations to be short so you don't have to worry about carry it on too long., If you have to make calls for your job on a regular basis and you have trouble sometimes overcoming phone call anxiety, it can be helpful to prepare some lines. It's best not to rely on these as a crutch, but they can be useful when you're getting started. They can help you get the dialogue going and give you something to fall back on when you're unsure of what to say.For calling customers, these lines can be something like ""I hope you've enjoyed doing business with us,"" or ""thank you for calling *blank*, how can I help you?""

Show your child how to take a call when they are already on the line.",How to Teach Your Child to Answer the Phone1," All cellular and digital phones will show the number of the person who is calling. Some home phones can be equipped with a caller ID device, too. If the phone or phones your child is most likely to answer are equipped with this device, instruct your child to look at the caller ID and use the information to decide if they want to answer the phone.If you wish, you could teach your child to only answer the phone if the incoming call is from a certain number (yours, for instance).;
, When a call comes in on a landline phone, accessing the caller is as simple as lifting the phone from the receiver. After picking it up, they should place the earpiece near their ear and the mouthpiece near their mouth.

Tell them that if they imagine the phone as a “C,” the earpiece is the portion that is curving out and away from the top of the phone.

, When answering cellular phones, there is often a button you must press or a technique you must utilize in order to access the caller. For example, you might have to press a button labelled, “Accept,” or swipe your finger across the phone’s digital screen., Explain to your child that sometimes, in the middle of a phone conversation, someone else might call them. In this case, the phone will make a sound – sometimes, one beep, sometimes, two or even three. Tell your child that if this occurs, they should check the caller ID and let the person they’re speaking with know that they have an incoming call.Typically, it is possible to switch between calls simply by pressing the “Accept” button or performing the action that enabled them to answer the phone initially.

State your reasons.,
Plan ahead.,
Let anyone who you speak with on a daily basis (family, friends, coworkers, and so on) know about your plans.,
Do something to distract yourself from the difficulties of silence.,
Take a walk.,
If you are really having a hard time, think and/or write to yourself.,
Keep a pad of paper and a writing utensil with you at all times.,
Talk to yourself in your head.",How to Remain Silent for a Whole Day," Are you doing it for fun? For a sociology / psychology experiment? Going on a talking strike until you get what you want? Sick with laryngitis and want to recover as fast as possible? Trying to win a bet with your friends? Whatever your reason, you need to know why you are making this commitment.;
, Before you start your silent day, specifically plan activities which will avoid people who are likely to either keep trying to talk to you or to get upset when you don't chat with them.

Do not attempt this on a week (or work) day. At least not at first — whether you can or wish to keep this up for multiple days is up to you. However, if you're going to make this your new norm, starting on a busy day is probably not a good idea.
It is best to schedule your day of silence when you are off work and have nothing else planned for the day. While your friends and family will likely be supportive, or at least understanding, those you do not know as well will likely be less accepting.

If you are doing this for The Day of Silence, know that it is always on a Friday, so you will have to find a way of communicating with teachers that doesn't involve talking (and / or let them know ahead of time). Therefore you should do it on the weekend, so you won't have to worry about the teacher calling on you.
Silence doesn't necessarily mean isolation — choosing not to speak is your business, but try not to shut out the rest of humanity, as this could make people more likely to try to force you to speak.

, Now that you and they know why and when, they will usually be happy to oblige you, and will not attempt to engage you in conversation, making your job much easier.


Whether you tell them in speech or writing is up to you, but letting them know is just common courtesy.

, Watch a movie, read a book, or listen to music (but resist the urge to sing along).


Singing along with the music defeats the purpose of silence — if you're having trouble resisting the urge, try listening to classical or jazz music, which is typically instrumental.

, Go into the woods or along the beach or across the prairie. As you stride along, consider the joys and pleasures and blessings that are part of your life. Study your surroundings, the earth, the sky, the foliage, the wildlife. Be at peace, be silent, reflect...

, Another option could be to use sign language if you know it.

, These come in handy in case you truly need to communicate.


If you have to be silent, better express it in writing. Writing is a powerful way for people to communicate when silent.

, By talking to yourself in your head, you resist the urge to talk out loud. Talking to yourself in your head isn't considered talking. However, if you want to remain completely silent, then remember your reason of silence. If you remember your reason, you remember to not say a single word. This is not talking, not even in your head. You are just ""seeing"" or picturing your memories and the world before you.


To fulfill this step — cutting your mental chatter — it helps to clear your mind.

Demonstrate how to take a message.,
Explain how to deal with telemarketers or possible scams.",How to Teach Your Child to Answer the Phone2," After your child has gained access to the caller, they will need to learn how to address the person on the other end. Showing your child how to answer the phone is the best way to help them learn. You could show them directly by play-acting or actually answering the phone.You could, alternately, choose to show them an instructional video of people answering the phone.

, Instruct your child to say “Hello?” in a friendly manner. Use an upward inflection at the end of the word. Alternately, train them to say, “This is .” This method will let speakers know straight away exactly who they have on the line., If you are indisposed, instruct your child to communicate to callers that you are busy or cannot come to the phone. Tell your child to say, “I’m sorry. They are not available right now. Can I take a message?” Encourage your child to make a note of the caller’s phone number as well as a short message.Do not tell your child to lie, as they might be confused or bungle the lie.

, After answering the phone, your child might find that the caller wishes to speak with someone who is unavailable. Instruct your child that in these instances, they should offer to take a brief message. Explain – then demonstrate – how they can take a message by using their free hand to transcribe the information being relayed by the caller.Leave a pen and paper near your home phone to facilitate this process.
Teach your child that in the event they do not have pen and paper on hand, they should say to the caller, “Please wait a moment while I fetch pen and paper.” Tell them that they should then set the phone down (without hanging up) and obtain something to write with before returning to the phone.
Encourage your child to read the message back to the person who called so as to avoid any confusion later.

, Direct your child to always ask who they are calling for. Explain that if the person does not answer the question, they should say, “No thank you,” and hang up the phone.Additionally, command your child to be wary of anyone speaking quickly. Many phone scammers and telemarketers speak quickly to pressure the person on the other end of the line to give away information.
Remind your child to never share personal info over the phone with anyone who they do not know.
Urge your child to always turn the phone over to you if the caller confuses them.

Instruct your child to speak to the person who answers the phone.,
Suggest to your child that they leave a message.,
Teach them how to make an emergency call.",How to Teach Your Child to Answer the Phone3," Explain to your child that every phone has a unique number, and placing calls requires knowing this phone number. The way this phone number is entered will vary slightly depending on the phone.Allow your child an opportunity to enter phone numbers on their own. Remind them that when they’ve entered a phone number properly, they will hear a ringing sound when they place the phone’s earpiece against their ear.

, Once someone on the other end of the line picks up and acknowledges the call – usually by saying “Hello?” – your child should respond. How your child responds depends on who answers.Tell your child that if the person they wish to speak with answers, they should introduce themselves. If the person who answered is someone who would immediately recognize their voice, they might just say, “Hi, it’s me” in a casual way.
Teach your child that if the person who answers would not immediately recognize their voice, they should introduce themselves more fully. For instance, they might say, “Hello, my name is ,” then communicate their message.

, If the person your child wished to get ahold of is indisposed, they might be able to leave a message. This could occur through an automated feature or through an intermediary.Explain to your child that if nobody answers the phone when they call, or if someone answers who they do not wish to converse with, they can leave a message.
For instance, your child might leave a message along the lines of, “Hello. This is . Please return my call when you can. My number is . Thank you.”

, When your child is learning to place calls, they should also learn how to contact emergency services. This process varies by location. For instance, in the U.S., they should dial 911. In the U.K., they should dial 999. Identify the process for contacting emergency services in your area and teach your child to do likewise.Share with your child the situations under which it would be appropriate to place an emergency call – that is, if there is a fire, if their parents or someone else is unconscious, or if an intruder is in the house.
Additionally, to prevent confusion, provide them with a few examples of occasions when it would not be appropriate to contact emergency services – that is, when they’ve spilled their juice or when they’ve lost their favorite toy.

Know what you want out of the call.,
Research who you will be speaking to.,
Jot down a few talking points.,
Offer a greeting and introduce yourself.,
Ask if it’s a good time to talk.,
Break the ice with small talk.,
Get to the point of the call.,
Find a quiet spot.,
Check for a good signal.,
Make sure you’re comfortable.",How to Start a Phone Conversation," Before you even pick up the phone, it’s important to identify what you want your phone call to accomplish. For example, if you’re calling up someone who you’re interested in romantically, the goal may be to ask them to go out on a date. During a business call, the point may be to sell your merchandise or services. Ask yourself what you hope will come out of the conversation.When possible, it’s good to be as specific as possible when identifying your goal. That can help you better prepare for the conversation.
In some cases, your goal for the call may be more general. For example, you might call a business to ask about the services they offer without knowing exactly what you’re interested in. The information that you get may help you clarify exactly what it is that you need or want.;
, When you’re calling to speak to someone specific who you don’t know well, you may want to get some background info on them. That can help you get a better idea of what to expect out of the conversation. For example, if you’re talking to the CEO of a business, they’re probably very busy and won’t have much time to talk to you. If you’re calling someone who’s shy, you may need to do most of the talking.If you’re making a business call, visit the website of the company that the person you’re calling works for. You should be able to find their title and possibly a biography that can help you get an idea for who they are.
If you’re making a personal call, ask a friend who knows the person you’re calling what they’re like before the conversation.

, Once you know what you want and who you’re going to be speaking with, you may feel better if you jot down some notes for the phone call. They can be points that you want to make sure to bring up or questions that you want to ask. Having a list can keep you from forgetting something important when you actually make the call.It may help to create an outline in order of what you plan to say on the call. You’ll obviously have to adapt based on your partner’s responses, but that may help keep you on track if you’re nervous about talking on the phone.
Think about how much time you’ll probably have on the call. It’s best to assume that you won’t have a long time, so you should focus on the most important topics that you want to discuss.

, You should first offer a greeting to the person who answers, such as hello or hi. These days, most people have Caller ID, but you should still introduce yourself unless the person on the end of the line greets you by name. If you’re calling someone who you know fairly well, your name may be enough. In other situations, though, you may need to provide more information so the person can identify you.When it comes to greetings, you can also use one that's specific to the time of day, such as ""Good morning, ""Good afternoon, or ""Good evening.""
If you’re making a business call, you should also offer the name of the company that you work for. For example, you might say, “Good morning, this is Jessica Bryant from Grace Advertising.”
If you’re calling up someone that you’re romantically interested in, you might mention where you met. For example, you might say, “Hi, this is Mike Daniels. We met at the gym last week.”
If you’re calling someone who you share a mutual friend with, you should provide the name of your friend. For example, you might say, “Hello, this is Alice. I’m Eric’s friend… I think he told you I’d be calling.”
If you’re calling about a job opening, you should mention where you found out about the position. For example, you might say, “Hello, my name is Noah Reynolds. I’m calling about the job you advertised in the newspaper yesterday.”
If you’re calling a business to ask for generic information, you don’t necessarily have to offer your name. You might just say, “Hi, I’m interested in your self-storage services.”

, If you want to have a successful phone conversation, it’s important to make sure that the person who you’re calling is just as focused on it as you are. That’s why it’s a good idea to ask if they have time to talk before you try to start the conversation. If they say that they have time to speak, you can begin your chat. If they say that they’re busy or about to head out, you should find another time to talk.If the person you’re calling isn’t ready to talk when you call, set up another time before you hang up. You might say, “Would it be alright if I called back this afternoon? At 3 maybe?”
If the other person wants to call you back, offer up a day and time when you’ll be available. You might say, “I’ll be available tomorrow morning. Maybe around 10?”

, If you’re calling to ask or sell something, you don’t necessarily want to go straight to what you want. That can be off-putting to the person who you’re calling. Instead, try to establish a rapport by making some brief small talk about light-hearted topics, such as the weather.Don’t go on too long with small talk, though. The other person may start to get impatient.
If you know the person who’re calling, personalize the banter with interests that you know they have. For example, if you’re calling someone who you know is a sports fan, you might say, “That was some Cardinals’ game last night, wasn’t it?”
If you don’t know the person who you’re calling, keep the banter more generic. For example, you might say, “It’s been really hot lately, hasn’t it? I don’t remember it being this bad last summer.”

, Once you feel like you and the other person are feeling more comfortable and relaxed, it’s time to get to the heart of the matter. Tell the person why you’re calling. Be as clear and concise as possible because you’ll sound more confident if you’re rambling.While you want to project confidence, make sure that you’re polite if you’re asking for something from the person you’re calling.
If you talk too long without stopping, the other person may start to tune you out. It’s a good idea to stop and get feedback if you have quite a bit that you want to say.
Don’t eat food or chew gum while you’re talking on the phone. The noises can give the impression that you’re not really invested in the conversation.

, When it’s time to make the call, you want to be sure that it will be as successful as possible. That means you want to create an environment that’s conducive to conversation, so locate a quiet spot to use the phone. You want to keep background noise to a minimum to avoid having to ask the other person to repeat themselves or shout to have them hear you.The best place to make your call is an empty room with the door closed. That way, you’re guaranteed a quiet space.
If you have to make your call in an office with open cubicles where you can hear your co-workers, you may want to time your call so the office isn’t as full. For example, you might place your call during lunch time or at the end of the day when people are heading home.
When possible, avoid making important phones calls in public places, such as a restaurant or store. They’re usually full of distractions and too loud for a successful conversation. If you have to call someone when you’re out, try to find a quiet spot, such as the hallway outside the bathrooms at a restaurant or an empty aisle at the store.

, These days, many people use cell phones as their main phone. If that’s the case for you, make sure that you have a strong signal on your phone before you make your call so you know the quality will be good. Walk around until you have a signal that you’re comfortable with. If you can’t get one with your cell phone, you may want to use a landline.The sound quality of a call on a landline is usually going to be better than on a cell phone, so if your call is very important, you may want to use a landline if possible. That’s especially true if you’re calling someone who’s older and whose hearing may not be as good.
When you’re using a cell phone, make sure to hold it so the internal microphone will pick up your voice without any trouble. It’s best not to make important calls on speaker phone.

, Before you start dialing, you want to ensure that you’re ready to concentrate fully on your conversation. For example, you should check that you don’t have to go to the bathroom and that you have a beverage nearby in case you get thirsty. It’s also a good idea to have tissues on hand in case you have to sneeze during the call.


Decide if you’ll be more comfortable sitting or standing for the call. If you’re nervous, you may find that pacing slightly while you talk can help calm you down.

Recognize positive and negative human emotions.,
Focus on the eyes and mouth.,
Listen to the tone of voice.,
Observe and note the general behavior and demeanor.,
Assess the other person’s physical well-being.,
Develop and improve your emotional intelligence.",How to Read Emotion1," There are 6 universal human emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, fear, sadness, and disgust.These fall into two categories: positive (happiness, surprise) and negative (anger, fear, sadness, disgust) emotions.To identify these in others, you need to know what kinds of actions and behaviors they are associated with.These include:


Positive emotions reduce stress, improve mood, and increase our memory and awareness. For example: happiness, surprise, sympathy, kindness, love, courage, confidence, inspiration, relief, etc.Negative emotions increase stress, allow us to recognize threats, and deal with challenging situations. Examples are: sadness, fear, anger, contempt, disgust, etc.The two most important regions of the brain for expressing and understanding emotion are the amygdala complex and the prefrontal cortex. Damage to either of these areas can impair someone's ability to read emotion.;
, In general, people express emotion through the eyes and/or mouth. The region of the face in which a person displays emotion is influenced by culture. For example, people focus on the eyes in Japan, while people in the United States interpret emotion in the mouth.When reading emotion, look at her entire face and not just the eyes.


Stand far enough away so you can see her face, but have a normal conversation. About 1 1/2 to 4 feet is a good distance to keep between yourself and the other person., Next to facial expressions, tone of voice is the second most important way people express emotion.People use their voice to both show and control their emotions.However, some emotions are not conveyed through voice. For example, people can easily identify relaxed, stressed, boredom, contentment, and confidence from tone of voice. Emotions weakly expressed through tone of voice include fear, friendliness, happiness, and sadness.Similar tones of voice can express different emotions. For example, a tense/harsh voice is associated with anger and hostility as well as confidence and interest.
A whispery or soft tone of voice can be associated with a range of emotions. These include relaxation, contentment, intimacy, friendship, sadness, and boredom.
A soft, breathy voice (where the person takes loud breathes while they talk) is associated with fear, shyness, and nervousness.

, When you look her does she portray a friendly atmosphere, or is she more reserved? Emotion can be experienced unconsciously – without you being aware of it.Using your best judgment and going with your gut feeling can sometime be the best way to read emotion.


Recognize emotion in others by noting your reaction. Often, we mirror the emotions of others in our facial expression, tone of voice, and behavior.Emotions are contagious.We’re affected by emotion in other people. Our mood and behavior changes depending on how someone else is feeling. This is why if someone smiles at you, you are likely to smile back!, Emotions can influence health in both positive and negative ways.If a friend or family member is sick or feels tired all the time, she might be stressed-out or depressed.Physical symptoms of mental illness and depression include: headaches or migraines, low energy, stomach problems, back pain, changes in eating habits, and alcohol or drug use.Mental and emotional symptoms of mental illness and depression include: confusion, sudden and extreme mood changes, isolation from friends, unable to cope with everyday problems, and increased anger or violence., Teach yourself to recognize emotions in others by becoming more aware of them in yourself.The four branches of emotion intelligence are: (1) be able to perceive emotions in yourself and others; (2) use emotions to promote thinking; (3) understand the significance of emotions; and (4) manage emotions.Strategies to improve emotional intelligence include:Put down your phone and step away from your computer. Improve your social skills and ability to read nonverbal cues by engaging in face-to-face communication on a daily basis.Don’t back away from uncomfortable or negative feelings in yourself or others. These are important and necessary. If you feel sad or angry, step back and think about why you are feeling this way. Then, try to counteract the negative emotion with three positive ones.
Listen to your body – a knot in your stomach may be stress, or a fluttering heart may be attraction or excitement.
Keep a journal or record of your thoughts and feelings. Several times a week, stop and write down what you are doing and how you are feeling. You can include other information such as how much sleep you had the night before, or what you had for breakfast.
Ask a close friend or family member – someone you know and trust – to read your emotions. Sometimes other people know us better than ourselves. Their answers can be surprising and insightful.

If you know what you’re going to say, the person you’re speaking with will be put at ease and will sense that you are a true professional.


If you’re making a sales call, script out your sales pitch. If you’re in information technology, you can say something like: “I’m calling about the computer system you inquired about. This is a very popular system and will meet the needs of your business.”
Write some concluding statements and a salutation. For instance, “It was great speaking with you Andrew. I hope to speak to you about this in the future. Have a great day.”;
, Exploring some alternatives of where the conversation may go will help you be prepared for any eventuality. As a result, you should sketch out the most likely possibilities of how the conversation will progress.


Be prepared for any questions the person might have for you.
If you're making a sales call, sketch out the various possibilities of how a potential customer may respond in a negative way to you. For instance, include comments about how a product might make a customer's life easier.
If your calls frequently come down to the problem of cost, make sure to sketch out a few ways of explaining costs and how a customer might afford your product., Make sure any script you make is for the most part in a bulleted format. While you might want to type out the first couple of statements and your closing statements, the majority should be short and easy to read. Remind yourself of what comes throughout the script.


To remind yourself about a reading a disclaimer, write ""Read disclaimer.""
To remind yourself about talking about cost of a product, write ""Talk about costs."", Whenever you have the opportunity, verify what the person you’re talking to is saying by rephrasing those ideas in different words. By doing this, you’ll let the person know that you’re listening and that you understand what they’re saying. You’ll also reinforce what they’re saying in your own mind.


Never restate what the person has said in their exact words.
Right down the points and restate them later., You should use a relaxed and friendly tone when talking on the phone in a professional setting. This is important, as you want to put the person you’re talking to at ease. If you use a more stressed or agitated tone, they’ll sense your nervous and may question your professionalism.


Match your tone of voice with that of the client's or potential client's you are talking to. For example, if the client speaks slowly and methodically, a skilled phone technique would be doing the same., When speaking on the phone in a professional context, only use words you’re familiar with and understand. Making sure you have a hold of your vocabulary will help you maintain a professional demeanor.


Don't use words that you are not familiar with an attempt to sound more intelligent. This may backfire if you have a difficult time pronouncing the words.
Make sure that you enunciate your words.
If you want to enhance your vocabulary, then do it in a more casual situation when you can afford to make mistakes.

, You should always refrain from interrupting people whenever talking to a person in either a professional or social setting. Interrupting people signals disrespect and unprofessionalism.


Always wait until the person you’re speaking to is finished before responding.
If you’re afraid you’re going to forget a response, jot it down with a notepad and reference it when the person is finished speaking.
If you need to cut the call off or say something relevant, find a pause that you can jump into politely once you have given the person enough time to talk., An important element of talking in a professional manner on the phone is talking with surety and assertiveness. If you don't give the impress that you are confident in what you know, the person you're talking to won't have confidence that you're a professional.


Don't say anything or recommend anything unless you are sure that you're making the correct recommendation. If in doubt, tell them you'll get back to them.
Avoid comments like “I guess” or “maybe that’s true.”
Don't make comments that let the person know you're inadequately prepared for the conversation. For instance, don't say things like ""well, I have not been trained for this,"" ""that's over my pay grade,"" or anything similar."", While it may sound strange, standing up when talking on the phone plays an important mental component in conveying professionalism. By standing up, you’re sending the signal to yourself that you need to be ready and active to answer any question or concern of the person you’re speaking with.


Standing up may add energy to your voice.
By standing up, you’ll create a mental outlet for any nervous energy you might have., Try smiling while you talk to someone. This may help brighten the character of your voice and make you feel more cheerful. In the end, even if your smiling isn’t conveyed to the person over the phone, it will help ready you mentally for the conversation.


Try a relaxed smile.
Don’t let smiling distract you from listening to the conversation. Just try to slowly train yourself to smile. You’ll internalize it over time., Regardless of your workplace environment, you need to minimize the possibility of distractions when you are speaking on the phone. By limiting distractions, you’ll be able to concentrate and you’ll be demonstrate professionalism to the person you’re speaking with..


Close your office door, if you can.
Let others know that you’re taking a business call.
Turn off the radio, television, or any other source of noise.
Close down your email and turn off Facebook., Perhaps the most important mental aspect of sounding professional is having confidence in yourself. Without confidence, you’ll sound like a novice. If you sound like a novice, the person you’re speaking to wont’ want to do business with you.


Believe in yourself as an expert and as a professional.
Remember, while you want to sound confident, you don’t want to be overly confident or condescending. Know your limits. In addition, know what you know and what you don’t know., One of the best ways to prepare yourself for a professional call is to gather all of the supplies you’ll need while you are on the phone. By gathering your supplies ahead of time, you’ll be equipped for the wide variety of problems or possibilities you’ll face when on the phone.


Make sure you have notepaper and a working pen readily available, and use them. You don't want to have the person on the phone repeat information because you were not taking note of certain details.
Have your computer booted up and ready to access. Depending on your business, you may need to access certain information. There is nothing less professional than someone who does not have information at their fingertips.
Set out all files or other information related to the call. If you’re speaking with someone you’ve dealt with before, you’ll probably have information related to them. Set it by your phone. , To sound professional, you’ll also need to practice your greeting until it sounds completely natural. Having a natural and professional greeting will put the person you’re talking to at ease and will signal that you know what you’re doing.


Make sure it is not long-winded and insincere. Try something short and to the point like “Hello. My name is John, and I’m calling about the inquiry you made about our services.”
You may want to record yourself and play it back to make sure that you are happy with the way it sounds., In addition to having a script ready to guide your conversation, you also need to know your product or business well. By knowing your product or business, you’ll come off as an expert and a professional.


Be prepared to answer common problems.
If you’re in sales, make sure you know every important detail related to the goods or services you’re selling.
If you’re in customer service, make sure you’re familiar with your responsibilities, common problems, and the product you’ll be providing service for."

The Listener Will Parrot Back What You Are Saying When Appropriate:Every once in a while, a good listener will parrot back what you say to indicate they are paying attention and that they are right in your story with you.

,The Listener Will Only Finish Your Sentence When Appropriate:A good listener will only finish your sentence when the timing is right, not to try to rush you through your story or to help you out when you are at a loss of words, but to show that they are on the same wavelength as you.,
The Listener Goes By the 80% Listening, 20% Talking Rule:A good listener knows that the art of being a good listener (whether that is because they just intuitively know or because they are actually aware of the rule) will listen approximately 80% of the time during the course of the conversation and spend only 20% of the conversation talking.

Take note of her facial expressions.,
Recognize a genuine smile.,
Distinguish sadness from happiness.,
Recognize anger and disgust.,
Recognize fear and surprise.",How to Read Emotion2," How we feel inside is expressed in our eyes and on our faces.Learning to recognize the association between facial expressions and certain types of emotion goes a long way in being able to read emotion.


Don’t be fooled! People can manipulate their facial expressions to appear to look happy when they are angry or sad – actors do this convincingly all the time. Look for other cues as to how they really feel. Note her body language or tone of voice. Make eye contact – open, penetrating “cold” eyes suggests a different emotional state than a “warm” smile.

, A genuine smile uses more muscles than one that is faked or forced. The corners of her mouth and cheeks should be raised. If the muscles around her eyes also tighten and “crow’s feet” form (clusters of wrinkles around the outer corners of eyes), then it is a good indicator of a genuine smile.

, This might seem obvious, but people try to control or cover-up their true emotions by smiling when they are sad. Genuine and spontaneous emotions are hard to fake.Sadness is associated with frowning (lowering the corners of the mouth). It is also associated with raising the inner corners of the eyebrows (near the noise). Additional cues are loose, drooping eyelids that cover part of the eye.

, Anger and disgust are often associated with one another and create similar facial expressions.We wrinkle our noses when we are disgusted, angry, or annoyed.


Anger and resentment can be towards someone or about something.When we are angry, we pull our eyebrows down, purse our lips (tighten them and suck-in the margins), and bulge our eyes.
In contrast to anger, expressing dislike, disgust, or disdain for someone or something is associated with a raised upper lip and loose lower lip. We also pull our eyebrows down, but not as much as when we are angry.

, While fear is a negative and surprise is considered a positive emotion, both activate the sympathetic nervous system and trigger a “fight or flight” response.When something unexpected happens, whether it is good or bad, it stimulates a part of the brain that is outside of our direct control. When this happens, we pull up our eyebrows and eyelids so our eyes are wide open.When we are afraid, we also pull our eyebrows in (towards the nose), our pupils dilate (get bigger) to take in more light, and our mouth is open. We also tense up the muscles in our face, especially around our mouth and cheek.
When we are surprised, we tend to arch our eyebrows and drop our jaw. Our mouth is open, and the muscles around it are relaxed and loose."
"
Look for nonverbal cues.,
Notice her body movement and posture.,
Look for signs of “fight or flight”.,
Ask how she is feeling.",How to Read Emotion3," In addition to facial expression and tone of voice, humans express emotion in other ways.While nonverbal cues can be misleading, learning to pick up on them can help you read emotion. Important nonverbal cues that convey emotion are body movements, posture, and eye contact. Make an effort to notice whether she appears animated and moving around or is stiff and tense. Also, does she stand up straight and make eye contact, or hunch her shoulders, fidget with her hands or, cross her arms.


Moving around and standing up straight shows she feels open and comfortable. However, too much movement (e.g. energetic arm waving) combined with a loud voice could mean she is excited or angry.
Hunched shoulders, a quiet voice, and crossed arms are signs she feels uncomfortable or nervous. If she refuses to make eye contact with you, it could mean she is upset or feels guilty.Keep in mind that culture, social situations, and individual personalities influence how we express emotion through body language.In this sense, facial expressions are considered more universal and reliable. For example, Italians tend to move their arms when they speak, but this could be considered impolite in Japan. Or, making eye contact is a sign of respect in the United States and Europe, but is considered rude or aggressive in some Asian and African cultures.

, Focusing on the entire body in addition to the face is the best way to read and interpret emotions.Posture and body movements not only reflects emotion, but also the intensity of an emotion. There are degrees of positive and negative emotion. For example, positive emotions range from interested (low) to elated (high), and negative from sadness (low) to violent anger (high).


Shoulders and torso: hunching the shoulders and leaning forward is associated with intense anger. In contrast, leaning backwards can be a sign of panic or fear. If she stands up straight with her shoulders back and head held high, this is a sign she feel confident. However, if she hunches their shoulders or slumps forward, then she is looking for sympathy, is bored, or feels nervous.Arms and hands: If she is sad, she will likely place her arms next to her side and put her hands in her pocket. If she is annoyed or irritated, she might place one arm on her side or hips, and gesture with her opposite hand (pointing or flat palm). If she feels indifferent or doesn't care, then she will place her hands behind her back.






Legs and feet: If she shakes her legs or taps her toes, then she might be anxious, annoyed, or in a hurry.However, some people naturally shake their legs while sitting without it meaning anything.







, When something unexpected happens, whether it is good or bad, it stimulates a part of the brain that is outside of our direct control. This results in physical responses such as dilated pupils, rapid breathing, increased sweating, and increase heart rate.You can tell if she is nervous, stressed, or anxious by looking for signs such as a sweaty palms or armpits, red or flushed faced, or shaking hands.


When men are upset or stressed, they tend to show signs of aggression, frustration, and anger. In contrast, women might become more talkative or seek social support. Depending on their personality, some men and women become more withdrawn and quiet when experiencing negative emotions. , Sometimes the best way to read emotion is to be direct. While the other person might lie and say she is fine when she isn't, it never hurts to ask. You can also use her response to read between the lines by noting tone of voice combined with facial expression and body language. You can also look for specific verbal cues that suggest how she feels inside.For example, if she is bored or sad, she will speaker slower and at a lower frequency.If she is excited or upset, the speed and frequency of her voice will increase.


Try speaking to her alone rather than in a group. She may be more open and truthful about her emotions if she is with a trusted friend or family member."

The pupils dilate during moments of stimulation, or in low lighting. If you are in a location with constant light, notice shifts in pupil size. A large pupil suggests some sort of arousal or interest.
Our pupils shrink when we see something offensive or negative. This constriction blocks off any unwanted images.
A person may squint if they do not like you or what you're saying. They also may be suspicious of your words and actions. If you notice this occurring, address the issue and clarify what you're saying.
A darting eye suggests insecurity or discomfort. You can also detect these feelings through sideways glances. Any break in eye contact proves that a person isn't fully present.;
, Lip muscles are extremely delicate and shift to reflect various moods and reactions. When a person begins to speak, their lips will part slightly.Pay attention to this, as you always want to be open and available when someone wants to speak with you.


A lip that points inward is called a pursed lip. The pursed lip indicates tension, frustration, or disapproval. A person with a pursed lip is restraining whatever emotion they are experiencing, effectively holding the words back by tightening their lips.
Puckering the lips into a kiss shape indicates desire. A puckered lip may also suggest uncertainty, as can a sucked in lip. This is often referred to as ""swallowing the lips.""
Pay close attention to grimaces or twitching in the lips. While very slight, these tiny changes indicate cynicism or disbelief in circumstances. A liar will also give themselves away with a slightly twitching lip.

, While the nose changes less than the eyes or lips, its central location on the face makes it easy to read.The flared nostril is a common shift. When it widens, it allows more air to pass in and out, preparing a person for combat. Flared nostrils indicate that a person is experiencing anger or displeasure.
The nose may wrinkle as a result of a bad smell. Beyond the literal interpretation, a metaphorical ""bad smell,"" such as an unpleasant sight or thought, causes the nose to wrinkle. If a person is thinking, they may wrinkle their nose when they have a thought that they don't approve of.
Sometimes, blood vessels in the nose will dilate, making the nose appear red and swollen. This will occur when a person is lying. They may also scratch their nose, irritating it further.

, Often connected to the eyes, the eyebrows fit into a wide variety of body language communications.Despite the limited number of muscles attached to them, the eyebrows are highly visible and suggestive of different emotional states.


The wrinkling of the forehead works in tandem with the eyebrows. If the forehead wrinkles and the eyebrows raise, the other person is likely questioning your behavior or surprised by their surroundings.
When the eyebrows lower, the eyes will be slightly concealed. When paired with a lowered head, this suggests a desire to hide the motion of the eyes.
Eyebrows that slope inward while being pulled down suggest anger or frustration. They also may suggest intense concentration.
Look out for a horseshoe-shaped fold between the brow. Known as ""Darwin's grief muscle,"" this peculiar symbol displays grief or sadness.

, A large smile is the most obvious way to characterize happiness. Different from a grin, a smile will expose only the upper teeth. The lower lids of the eyes should form crescent shapes.There’s a large spectrum of happiness. Ranging from contentment to bliss, this wide variety of emotion can all be detected by similar facial expressions.

, Pay close attention to the eyebrows. They will be slanting upward.A sad person will also be frowning. You can generally assume sadness for any person that you notice frowning.


Look for loose eyelids that droop over the eyes slightly.The opposite of happiness, sadness is a dangerous and potent emotion. In addition to the facial changes, you may notice a drop in energy in a sad person.
Individuals experiencing sadness may also become more reserved and withdrawn.

, An often exciting emotion, surprise can be characterized by wide open eyes and an open gaping mouth.In more mild cases of surprise, there might be a slight smirk to the mouth.


The eyebrows will be pulled up very high.
A person may frown when experiencing surprise, but this frown might edge the emotion toward shock instead. A slightly more extreme emotion, shock can have a certain element of fear or disgust attached to it.
Any sudden blast of wonder of astonishment might lead someone to feel surprised.

, Look to the eyebrows and eyes first. The eyebrows will be slanted upward, and the eyes will be wide open.The mouth might also be stretched open widely.Fear is our natural response to danger. If you see someone experiencing fear, look for a source of this response. This emotion is often related to the behaviors of escape and avoidance.
Remember that fear is different than anxiety. Fear always comes from an external threat, while anxiety is generated from within.

, The wrinkled nose is one of the primary attributes of the expression of disgust. The eyebrows will also lower, and the mouth will hang open.Think of the mouth as silently mouthing a “blegh” sound, as if the person has just seen something revolting. The lips will hang loose, and the upper lip will pull up.
While disgust might come as a response to eating or smelling something disgusting, the emotion can also be vividly imagined. Both experiences will provoke the same facial expression.

, When looking for anger, notice the eyebrows. They will be lowered and slanted inward, creasing together into a wrinkle. The eyelids will be tight and straight, as the brow will be lowered.The mouth may be tight, or it may be open wide into a large scream.
Their head might be lowered a bit, and the jaw may be thrust forward.

, Used primarily to express disapproval, contempt will be marked by a raised chin. This makes it easier for a person to stare down their nose at whoever has insulted them.The lip corner will tighten up and raise on one side of the face. This is often referred to as a sneer.
There may be a slight smile attached to contempt, as if the person is enjoying their disapproval of your actions.

, When attempting to read a face, you'll want to start by looking for macroexpressions. A Macro expression typically lasts between 0.5 and 4 seconds.These expressions will take over the entire face, giving you the full experience of this emotion.


Even a basic understanding of the seven basic emotions will help you read macroexpressions. These universal expressions include joy, surprise, contempt, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear. You've no doubt experienced these seven expressions, so you'll have an easy time reading them in a macroexpression.
If a person is expressing these feelings through a macroexpression, they are most likely attempting to get you to respond to their emotion.
In the case of sadness, they may be asking you to comfort them. If you're faced with a macroexpression of contempt, however, they might be trying to intimidate you.
Know that it's easiest to manipulate a false emotion through macroexpression. Because it lasts longer, it's easier to settle into the performance of this emotion. Don't allow yourself to be deceived by false macroexpressions.

, Microexpressions typically last between 1/15 and 1/25 of a second, making them much harder to detect in another person. While a macroexpression may reveal how someone is feeling, it's more likely that truth will be revealed in the microexpression.


When someone attempts to conceal an emotion, there may be some ""leakage"" of their actual emotion. This slip typically occurs in the microexpression. If you aren't paying close attention to the face, you may miss the real emotion this person is feeling.
If you're hoping to get a deeper understanding of a person, you must be sensitive to microexpressions. An intimate knowledge of how someone is feeling is crucial to developing sensitive personal relationships.
While a macroexpression may tell the truth, there's a chance that a person may be trying to elicit a response by ""putting on"" this emotion. When paying close attention to microexpressions, you're less likely to miss the actual emotion.

, Subtle expressions are even smaller than microexpressions, so detecting them requires a great deal of attention. These expressions arise before an emotion is even completely felt, coming as natural responses to ones' surroundings.Subtle expressions also may not be a full expression of one emotion. In a microexpression, a full emotion flashes for a short period of time. A subtle expression, however, may only contain pieces of a full emotion.
These tiny expressions may be key to discovering deception, as the slightness of their occurrence can be concealed more easily than a microexpression.

, After mastering facial recognition, you can start to study body language. Body language, like facial expression, is a key part of nonverbal communication. Recognizing shifts in physicality will help you more easily understand others.When trying to analyze someone's confidence, you can look at their posture. If they're standing tall with their shoulders back, this person feels comfortable in their body. Any slouching suggests a lack of confidence.
If a person is being honest with their emotions, they'll be able to hold solid eye contact with you. Any shifting in their eyes may suggest that they are lying.
A person's manner of speaking can be wrapped up into body language. An even tone of voice will prove that the perceived facial emotion aligns with their internal emotion.
Remember that certain psychological or cultural differences may factor into both body language and facial expression. You want to confirm your initial opinions about this person by continuing to get to know them. Initial readings are very useful, but may not always be completely accurate.

Run a simple search through your search engine of choice to find your country’s exit code. You can find your country code by running an online search with the query “--Your Country’s Name-- Exit Code”.;
, The country code is typically 1-3 digits long and identifies the country to which you are placing a call. The Chinese country code is 86., This number can be 1-3 digits long and will narrow your call geographically in the country you are calling. China utilizes 2-4 digit area codes. For example, the area code for Shanghai is 21 while the area code for Zibo is 533. Some of the other major area codes for major cities are:


Baicheng Area Code: 436
Baoan Xian Area Code: 755

, Calling cards are great ways to make international calls for a reasonable price. They are often available at newsstands, drugstores, and stores that sell mobile phones. They can be purchased for any dollar amount, which will equal a certain number of minutes depending on the card.Make sure that the calling card you purchase can be used in the UK, and that it can call France. This information should be available on the card or on its packaging.
Keep your card safe. If it’s lost or stolen, there’s no way to recover the credit you had on it.
Some calling cards are refillable and you can add credit to them when you’ve used it up.

, Every country in the world has an exit code. This is the number you must dial to signal that you’re trying to call a number outside of the country. The UK exit code is 00.

03 denotes Northeast France
04 denotes Southeast France
05 denotes Southwest France
06 and 07 denotes mobile phone services

, The phone number you were given might include the area code, especially if the phone owner knows you are not local to his area. If the number contains eight digits or more, the area code is probably included. Dial 001164 followed by the full number.


The only exception is for some New Zealand cellular phone numbers, which can be up to nine digits long and thus ""trick"" you into thinking an area code is included. If your call does not go through, hang up and try again with 001164 2 followed by the number. 2 is the area code for all cellular phone in New Zealand.

New Zealand is two hours ahead of Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane (which are on AEST). It is two and a half hours ahead of Adelaide (ACST), and four hours ahead of Perth (AWST).New Zealand observes daylight savings time, but parts of Australia do not. If you are in Queensland, the Northern Territory, or the Australian Capital Territory, and you are calling between October and April, add one additional hour to find New Zealand time., Because callers are typically still charged when calling toll-free numbers from a different country, some businesses block international calls to avoid causing their customers unexpected fees.In New Zealand, toll-free numbers typically begin with 0508 or 0800.Try to find a regular, non-toll-free number for that organization by searching online, or contact it by email.

, Some phone plans block international calls. Try calling a different international number. If it does not go through, contact your phone service provider and ask to change your plan.

Pinless international calling cards are generally cheaper than using physical calling cards since there's no overhead for physical card production. These require you to dial a number before the number you are calling rather than insert your card in a payphone.
Try buying the smallest denomination available for a particular phone card to test the service. Buy bigger amounts of credit when you find a card you like.

, If you call particular countries often, your phone company can often tailor your plan to give you better rates.

Place a phone call from Chile.",How to Call England," An exit code allows you to signify to the telephone service provider that the phone number you enter following that code will be an international number, effectually allowing you to ""exit"" your country.


The exit code varies by country. While many countries share the same exit code, there is no single exit code that works for every country.
For example, the exit code for the United States is ""011."" As such, someone calling England from the United States would dial ""011"" before dialing anything else.
Example: 011-xx-xxxxxxxxxx;
, The country code for England and the entire United Kingdom is ""44."" This code should be dialed immediately after the exit code for your country.


When placing an international phone call, a country code indicates which country the phone call should be directed to. Each country has its own unique country code.
Example: 011-44-xxxxxxxxxx

, When calling from inside England, you will use a local code or trunk code. This code is simply a leading ""0.""


If you were given an English phone number with a leading ""0,"" this digit should be skipped when you place your international call. The phone number will not connect correctly if you keep it.The only exception to this rule is Russia and Italy. If calling England from either of these countries, keep the leading “0.”

, Every land line in England will have an area code that corresponds to the geographic location in which the structure you are calling is located. Area codes range in length from two to five digits.


Determine the correct area code by knowing the geographic area your phone call is heading to:Aberdeen: 1224

, Cell phones in England do not use standard geographic area codes. Instead, they have a mobile code that varies based on the mobile network the cell phone is covered by.


You will need to inquire about the exact mobile code when attempting to call an English cell phone. There is no way of knowing with exact certainty without directly finding it out.
All mobile area codes start with the number 7 and are usually followed by either a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
In total, the mobile code should be four digits long.

, The rest of the phone number is simply the subscriber's personal number. Dial it as you would dial any local phone number to complete the call.


For landlines, the subscriber's personal phone number will be a total of 10 digits long. This does NOT include the area code.
Example: 011-44-20-xxxx-xxxx (dials from the US to England, to a land line in London)
Example: 011-44-161 (dials from the US to England, to a land line in Manchester)
Example: 011-44-1865 (dials from the US to England, to a land line in Oxford)
For cell phones, the subscriber's personal phone number will be 10 digits long. This DOES include the mobile code.
Example: 011-44-74xx-xxx-xxx (dials from the US to a cell phone in England)

, Both the United States and Canada use ""011"" as an exit code, as do many US territories and other countries. When placing a phone call to England from one of these countries, the phone number should be something along the lines of: 011-44-xx-xxxxx-xxxxx


Other countries that share this exit code include:

American Samoa
Antigua and Barbuda
Bahamas
Barbados
Bermuda
British Virgin Islands
Cayman Islands
Dominica
Domincan Republic
Grenada
Guam
Jamaica
Marshall Islands
Montserrat
Puerto Rico

, Japan also has unique area code that no other country shares.


When placing a phone call to England from Japan, the format of that number should be 010-44-xx-xxxxxxxxxx.

, The correct structure of the phone number for a country that uses ""001"" would be 001-44-xx-xxxxxxxxxx. The correct structure of the phone number for a country that uses ""002"" as an exit code would be 002-44-xx-xxxxxxxxxx.


South Korea uses both ""001"" and ""002,"" depending on the service provider.
Taiwan uses ""002"" as their exit code.
Countries that use ""001"" include Cambodia, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand.

, Indonesia uses several exit codes, and the correct one depends on the telephone carrier used.


Bakrie Telecome users should use the exit code ""009,"" making the format for a phone call to England 009-44-xxxxxxxxxx.
Indosat users should use the exit code is ""001"" or ""008."" The correct format for dialing England would be 001-44-xx-xxxxxxxxxx or 008-44-xx-xxxxxxxxxx, respectively.

Dial the remaining 6- to 8- digits to complete the Egyptian phone number, which should total 9 digits in all.

",How to Call Egypt From the United States,"


The international exit code may change, depending on where you're calling from. Mexico and most European countries, for example, use 00 as an exit code instead of 011.;
,


The country code to access Egypt stays the same, no matter where you're calling from.

,


Area codes for international numbers are often written as part of the number itself or separated only by a hyphen, instead of separated by parentheses as is common with United States numbers.
Unlike United States mobile numbers, Egyptian mobile phones are all assigned the same prefix. If the leading digit for the ""area code"" you dial is 1, you're dialing an Egyptian mobile number.

Prepare a message.",How to Call USA," Your country’s exit code allows you to dial out of your country. If you’re dialing a U.S. number from your landline or cellular phone, you’ll need to enter your country’s exit code before doing anything else. To find your country’s exit code, do this online search: “<your country’s name> exit code.”


Some common exit codes: “00” covers many countries, including much of Europe, plus China, Mexico, and New Zealand; “010” is the exit code for Japan; many other Asian countries (including Cambodia and Taiwan) use “001” or “002.”Note that some countries have multiple exit codes that differ based on which service provider/carrier you’re using. As an example, Brazil has 5 different exit codes: 0014 (Brasil Telecom), 0015 (Telefonica), 0021 (Embratel), 0023 (Intelig), and 0031 (Telmar).If you’re calling from Canada or another country covered by the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), you do not need to use an exit code.You only need to dial the number “1” before the area code and 7-digit local U.S. number, as you would to place a regular long-distance call.;
,


Country codes comprise 1 to 2 digits; you dial them after you’ve dialed your country’s exit code — for example, “010” + “1” would be the first 4 numbers to dial when calling the USA from Japan.

, An area code narrows your call geographically, and refers to a specific city. U.S. phone numbers are preceded by 3-digit area codes. If you don't know which area code to dial, the North American Numbering Plan and Area Code Locations websites can help.Some popular U.S. area codes: 310 and 424 in Los Angeles; 718, 347, and 929 in New York City; 202 in Washington, D.C. You’ll notice that many cities will have more than one area code.
Mobile phone users may have area codes that don’t match the cities in which they live; for that reason, if you're unsure of the area code, it’s best to double-check with the person you’re intending to call.
If you're dialing from within the USA and your phone number has the same area code as the number you’re calling, you may only need to dial the 7-digit local number. If the area has multiple overlapping area codes, however, you may need to dial their area code plus the number “1.”, The local phone number will be 7 digits long. If you’re calling a business, you can likely double-check their phone number via an online search; if you’re calling a person, you can double-check with them or by looking at your phone book.

, Before dialing the number, you may want to write it down or otherwise record it — that way, if your call doesn’t go through the first time, you can easily redial it.


The order of the numbers will be <your country’s exit code> + 1 (U.S. country code) + <area code> + <7-digit local phone number>.
If you were in Japan and calling the local number 555-5555 with a 718 area code in New York City, you would dial 010-1-718-555-5555.

, Once you’ve written the number down, dial it into your phone and wait for the call to be connected. Unless you get a busy signal or the call doesn’t go through, you should hear ringing — just as you would with a regular, local call.

, VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) applications allow you to make international phone calls at cheaper rates than through your phone provider. To make a VoIP call, you need a computer, tablet, or smart phone, plus an Internet connection.Popular VoIP applications include Skype, Google+ Hangouts, Viber, and Jitsi.If you call the USA often, check to see if your VoIP application offers subscriptions or monthly flat rates for a predetermined number of minutes; these subscriptions can significantly lower your per-minute VoIP costs.
Many applications (eg., Whatsapp, Skype, and Facebook) allow users to place free calls within the applications — meaning that both you and the person you call would need to have the apps open on your respective devices.

, If your computer, tablet, or smart phone has a camera and an Internet connection, you may be able to video chat with your contact in the U.S. instead of calling them on the phone.


Many social media sites and applications offer video chat for free. Some popular video chat applications include Google+ Hangouts and Skype.

, If you have limited Internet access but you have a landline with free local minutes, a calling card may be your best option. Calling cards vary greatly in rates — sometimes they seem cheap but have hidden fees.


Look for a calling card that offers easy-to-understand pricing and no additional fees.
Popular calling cards include Pingo, EnjoyPrepaid, Comfi, Nobelcom, and CallingCards.Note that calling cards are best for landlines and mobile phones with unlimited local minutes. Unless your mobile phone has unlimited local minutes, a calling card will not be the best option for you, as you’ll end up paying for the calling card minutes plus your mobile minutes.

, If you consistently make calls to the USA, ask your phone provider if they have any international calling plans or can offer you a discount.

, Calling collect reverses the charges so that the person you call pays for the call instead of you. Unless the person or company you’re calling has expressly told you it’s okay to call them collect, this is not advisable.


To call someone collect internationally, have the U.S. area code and 7-digit phone number ready, dial your international phone operator, and ask them to place the call for you.
Phone numbers for international phone operators vary depending on which country you’re in; an online search of your country’s name plus the words “international phone operator” will reveal the number for yours.
In the UK, you can call your international inland operator on 155; in Japan, you can call the international telephone operator at 0051., There are 9 time zones in the USA; these range from -4 to +10 hours in relation to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).If you’re unsure of which time zone the recipient of your call is in, double-check with an online search of “current time in <city you’re calling>, USA” or by entering the city’s name into a world time zone website.From east to west, the 9 U.S. time zones are Atlantic Standard Time (UTC-4), Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5), Central Standard Time (UTC-6), Mountain Standard Time (UTC-7), Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8), Alaska Standard Time (UTC-9), Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (UTC-10), Samoa Standard Time (UTC-11), and Chamorro Standard Time (UTC+10).Most regions of the USA observe Daylight Saving Time (DST) starting on the second Sunday in March and continuing until the first Sunday in November. Areas within the United States that do not observe DST include most of Arizona, plus American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands.Note that when DST is in effect, the names of the time zones will change slightly — for example, Eastern Standard Time (EST) becomes Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)., Your family and close friends might forgive you for calling too early in the morning or too late at night, but business contacts might not be so forgiving. Be sure that you take their local time into consideration before calling!

, Phone conversations begin in different ways depending on cultural customs and the nature of the relationship between the caller and his/her recipient.


If you’re calling a friend or family member, you can get away with your usual greetings (“Hey!”), but if you’re calling a business contact, you will likely need to be more formal (“Hi there, this is John. May I please speak with Jane Smith?”).
If English isn’t your first language, you may want to practise what you want to say a few times before making the call.

, For example, in the UK, friendly banter and swearing are more accepted than in the USA. Calling a colleague “daft” in a loving way probably won’t translate too well to an American who isn’t familiar with British culture., If you get anxious about speaking to people on the phone, it will be tempting to speak quickly and/or quietly. Resist the urge to do so, and really force yourself to speak slowly and clearly.


The more you have to repeat yourself, the longer your call will take — potentially costing you more money, if you’re paying by the minute!

, If it’s a possibility that you’ll have to leave a voice message, prepare one in advance. Having a message prepared in advance will help you cover all of your key points clearly and concisely; that way, you don’t have to call back with anything you’ve forgotten to say.

Dial “011” on your keypad.,
Put in the country code next.,
Dial the city/area code, if applicable.,
Input the remaining digits of the phone number.",How to Dial International Phone Numbers from America1," Use the International Direct Dialing (IDD) number for the U.S. before dialing any other numbers. This signals that the phone number you will dial next is outside of the United States.


Remember that “011” is the prefix for only the United States. If you are placing a call from a country other than the U.S., you will need to find the IDD for that country.Sometimes international phone numbers will be listed with a “+” symbol before the digits of the phone number. If you are dialing from a cell phone, you can use the “+” symbol (typically found on the same key as the “0”) in place of “011.” Or just replace the “+” with “011” if you wish.;
, Determine the country code for the country you are calling to. This number will vary depending on what the country of origin is for the number you wish to dial, but it will always have 1-3 digits.


As an example, if you were calling a phone number in Australia, the country code is “61.” So, you would dial 011 (IDD number) then 61 (country code).
Note that some countries share a country code. For instance, the United States, Canada, most of the Caribbean, Guam, and other U.S. territories all share the country code “1.”There may also be a number added to the country code if the given country has a different method for calling a mobile phone rather than a landline. For instance, in Mexico, you must dial “1” after the country code (“52”) to reach a mobile phone number., After the international dialing code and country code, you will dial the city code or area code, typically given as part of the local number. This narrows down the phone number to a specific city or region within the country you’re calling to.


The city/area code can be a number between 1-3 digits long.Note that smaller countries may not use city or area codes at all, in which case you will dial whatever phone number is given.
Note that if a city/area code is not given to you, you should ask for it from the individual that holds the phone number rather than look it up based on location. Someone’s current address or home city may not be the same as their area code, because a phone can be purchased in a different area code than where it is used.

, Dial the remaining digits of the phone number you were given after you have put in the IDD number, country code, and city/area code. Then press the call button on your phone to place the call.


Note that a phone number from another country may have more or fewer digits than the standard 7 numbers in a domestic U.S. phone number.
If a “0” is given before the phone number you are meant to call, omit this and dial the following phone number. The zero is a “trunk code” meant for domestic calls within many countries, but is not used for placing international calls.For a complete example, say you are calling the British Museum in London, England in the United Kingdom. To call from the U.S., you use the IDD number “011.” The country code for the UK is “44,” and the area code for London is “20.” The rest of the phone number is “7323 8299.” So, in total, you would dial 011 44 20 7323 8299 to place your call to the museum.

Find your international exit code.,
Find the country code of the country you are calling.,
Find the area code of area or city you are calling.,
Know the local phone number, This is the phone number for the person, business, or cell phone that you are trying to reach in Mexico.,
Check the time of the place you are trying to reach.,
Dial the complete international number.,
If someone answers by saying: ""¿Bueno?""",How to Make a Phone Call to Mexico," Every country has its own unique exit code. This is the number that you must dial first, in order to place a call outside of the country you are calling from. If you are making a call from the United States, your exit code would be 011, while if dialing from Argentina, you would use 00 to place a call out of the country.


To find your country’s exit code, you can run a simple search through your favorite online search engine. Simply type in a search phrase along the lines of “exit code.”;
, In this case, the country is Mexico. Mexico’s country code is 52.

, In Mexico, these area codes can be 2 or 3 digits long. The following list the area code for all of the major areas of Mexico. Their area codes are listed in parentheses after the name of the area or city.Acapulco (744), Cancun (998), Celaya (461), Chihuahua (614), Ciudad Juarez (656), Cozumel (987), Culiacan (671), Guadalajara (33), Hermosillo (622), La Paz (682), Mazatlan (669), Merida (999), Mexicali (686), Mexico City (55), Miquelon (508), Monterrey (81), Puebla (222), Puerto Vallarta (322), San Luis Potosi (444), Tampico (833), Tecate (665), Tijuana (664), Torreon (871), Veracruz (229).

, Phone numbers are either seven or eight digits long. So if you were calling from the U.S. you would dial 011-52-461-3456764 (this is a made up number.)If you are calling a cell phone, you will add (1) in between the country code and the area code. So to place a call from the U.S. to a cell phone in Mexico, you would dial: 011-52-1-(area code)-(cell number.)

, It would be terrible to wake someone up at 3 a.m. simply because you did not think to check the local time. Mexico has three time zones. Most of the country is on Central Standard time, while the areas of Chihuahua, Nayarit, Sonora, Sinaloa and Baja California Sur are on Mountain Standard time. Baja California Norte is on Pacific Standard time.You may also be charged for your call to Mexico even if no-one answers at the other end. It's not a bad idea to check time zones and ensure the person you are calling in Mexico is likely to be home - and not asleep!

, So, let's say we want to call our friend up who lives in Lagunas, Mexico - and you live in the United States. You would dial:


Your exit code - 011
Then the calling country code for Mexico - 52
Then the area code for Lagunas - 972
Then the phone number you've been given (either a seven or eight digit number.)

, congratulations. You've successfully called Mexico."

Consider buying an international calling card.",How to Call Vietnam from the United States," Every country has an exit code that needs to be dialed when trying to make a call to a different country. The exit code for the United States is 011., In order to be connected to the country you are trying to call, you will need to find its country code. The country code for Vietnam is 84., Area codes in Vietnam can be one to three digits long. For example, Ho Chi Minh City's area code is 8, while Hung Yen is 321.

, This is the number of the business, person, or cell phone you are trying to contact. The land lines in Vietnam are generally 7 digits long. Thus, you would dial, 011-84-(area code)-XXX-XXXX.


If you are trying to reach a mobile phone number, you will have to dial a special cell phone number after you dial the country code, followed by the 7 digit cell phone number. These special numbers are based on the cell phone carrier the person is using. The numbers can be: 91(Vinaphone,) 90 (MobiFone,) 98 (Viettel,) 95 (S-phone,) or 96 (EVN-Telecom.)

, Vietnam is 15 hours ahead of Pacific Standard Time (the west coast of the United States.) Vietnam is in the Indochina time zone. It is important to keep in mind the difference in time zones because it would be rude to call someone at 3 AM. It will also cost you money, as you may be charged for placing an international call even if the person you are trying to reach doesn’t pick up., To demonstrate, let us say that you are trying to place a call from San Francisco, CA to Ho Chi Minh City. You would dial:


011 (the US exit code.)
84 (Vietnam’s country code.)
8 (Ho Chi Minh City's area code.)
XXX-XXXX (the local number.)

, Prepaid phone cards are available online or at many local stores, and make calling Vietnam much easier. A phone card can help you keep track of exactly how much your phone call is costing, without the nasty shock of a huge phone bill later.


Services like Yahoo Messenger (popular in VN) or Gmail will allow you to talk for free but the other person in VN must be online and using that service at the same time for it to work. Both parties need a headset/mic or something built-in the computer to listen/talk.
When choosing a phone card to call Vietnam, check to see how increments are billed. Some phone cards round up to the next minute, while others can round up to every 3 minutes, making the cost of a 4 minute call and a 6 minute call the same.
