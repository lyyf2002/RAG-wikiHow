Use Skype for voice or video calls.,

Download Skype for free on a smartphone, tablet, or computer to immediately begin calling other Skype accounts for free. If you want to use Skype to call a regular U.S. phone number, add Skype Credit to your account to pay as you go, or select a monthly subscription to save on frequent calls.Make sure you are connected to a computer or phone with high-speed internet when you make calls from Skype, as the audio and video quality will be better and more reliable with a good connection.
Note that if you use a mobile app for Skype on a phone or tablet that is not connected to WiFi, you will incur data charges. Check with your phone or SIM card provider on these charges, or purchase a plan with unlimited or a large amount of data if you plan to use phone apps frequently without an internet connection.

, Load contacts, phone numbers, or credit (if applicable) for calls on an internet phone service or app before you use it to call the U.S. from the UK. Familiarize yourself with the process of making a call, the quality of the audio or video, and any other features so that you are ready to use it without any problems.


If you can, test out the app before you are abroad in the UK to get familiar with it. Make sure you have a good internet connection and, if possible, use the same device you’ll use to connect while abroad.
You might want to be prepared with a reliable microphone and pair of headphones for making your calls from the UK, particularly if you are using an older computer that doesn’t have a microphone or speakers built in, or you want to be able to make hands-free mobile calls.

To make a call from a mobile phone, turn on your phone, go into the telephone application, and bring up the keypad so you can dial the number.;
, Every country has an international call prefix, also called an exit code, that must be dialled before you can call out of the country to another one.Dial 00. This is the international call prefix for Portugal, and it must be dialled before making calls abroad.
If you're calling from a mobile phone, there may be a shortcut for the international call prefix. Look for the + sign, which is the shortcut. Sometimes it’s the same as the 0 button, and sometimes you can use ** as a shortcut., Just like every country has a unique international call prefix to dial out, so too does every country have its own code that you dial when you want to call in.Dial 1. This is the country code for the US. It’s also the country code for Canada and the Caribbean, because like international call prefixes, country codes can be shared by multiple nations.
A country code can be one, two, or three digits long, and some countries have separate codes for mobile phones and landlines.The US, however, is not one of these countries, so the code will always be the same, regardless of what kind of phone you're calling.

, Bigger countries have area or city codes that divide larger geographical areas into small sections, and countries like the US have hundreds of area codes. Most states have multiple area codes, and you will need to know the particular area code for the state and region you're calling.


Area codes in different countries can be one, two, or three digits long, but in the US they are all three digits.
When calling smaller countries, they may not actually have area codes, in which case you would only dial the international call prefix, followed by the country code and local number., This is the specific and direct number of the person or organization you wish to call. This could be a landline on a fixed phone or a mobile number.In the US, local numbers are seven digits long.


Once you’ve inputted all the numbers, the number you dial should look something like this: 00 1 123 456 7890. In this example, 00 is the exit number for Portugal, 1 is the country code for the US, 123 is the area code, and 456-7890 is the seven-digit local number.

, If you're calling from a fixed phone, it will automatically begin to dial when you’ve inputted all the right numbers. However, on a mobile phone, you will have to press Send, Talk, or the telephone icon to actually prompt the phone to dial the number you’ve inputted.

, The world is divided into 24 different time zones, meaning that daytime for you may be the middle of the night for someone in another country. When planning international calls, you have to consider both what time it is where you are and the time in the country and region you're calling.


Portugal falls into Western European Time. The United States, however, span six separate time zones, including Alaska, Hawaii–Aleutian, Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern Times. This means that depending on where you're calling in the United States, the time there could be anywhere from five to 10 hours behind the time in Portugal., Some countries use what’s called a trunk prefix, and this is a digit that gets added to the beginning of a phone number when it’s being called domestically. However, these won’t work when you're calling the number internationally, so the code must be dropped.


Trunk prefixes are often 0, so if you're having trouble calling an international phone number that starts with a 0, don’t dial the 0, and instead start with the next digit., Toll-free numbers are phone numbers that you can call for free because the subscriber takes on the charges on behalf of the caller. They are usually used by businesses so that customers can contact them without incurring long-distance fees.Toll-free numbers are often set up to only accept calls originating in the same country, and this means they cannot be called from international locations.
If you're trying to get a hold of a company or organization in a different country, you will likely have to call their regular local line and incur the long-distance charges yourself.

, While all phone providers are different and have their own rates, calling long distance and internationally is always more expensive than making local calls. Depending on your carrier, international calls could range from a few cents to over a dollar per minute.


Some providers divide days into peak and off-peak hours, and it’s cheaper to make long-distance and international calls at these times.Off-peak hours are usually hours when businesses don’t operate, such as very early in the morning and late at night
Talk to your phone provider before making any long distance calls if you're unclear about your phone plan. Otherwise, you could end up paying extremely high rates if you don’t have a long distance plan in place.

, Calling cards aren't always cheaper than long distance plans, but they can be if you get a good rate on the card or don’t make international calls often. Calling cards are prepaid cards that you purchase to make phone calls, and often require the caller to punch in a series of numbers before placing a call.


Calling cards are usually designed for specific countries, so if you're looking for one to call the US from Portugal, make sure the card you buy is for calling North America.
Note that while some calling cards have great rates, they may charge service fees that eat into the amount of money available on the card for phone calls."

Dial 00.,
Dial 1.,
Dial the 3-digit area code.,
Dial the remaining 7 digits.",How to Call the United States From France," This is the exit code that signals to your telephone provider that you're about to make an international call.


Not all countries have the same exit code, but 00 applies in most of Europe and quite a few other countries as well. For example, if you were calling from the United States, Canada or any other country that participates in the North American Numbering Plan, the exit code would be 011 instead.;
, This is the United States country code. This number is universal, meaning you would be dialling this number to call the United States from any other country in the world.


The country code 1 also applies to any country in the North American Numbering Plan.

, All US area codes are three digits long and are most likely included when phone numbers are displayed or given. If an area code is not provided, you will need to look up the ZIP code of the person you are calling. There are many online resources that will help you calculate possible area codes for each US ZIP code.


US mobile phones may be assigned to any area code. Usually a mobile phone's area code indicates the area in which service was first established. But an individual can keep the same cell phone number, including area code when he or she relocates. So the cell phone's area code doesn't always match the geographical location of the user.
If the 3-digit prefix is 800, 877, 866 or 888, this indicates that you're calling a toll-free number. The phone receiving a toll-free call could be anywhere in the country, or the call could even be routed to a call center in another country.

, In total, all United States phone numbers are exactly 10 digits long, including the area code.


Check the world times to ensure that whoever you are calling in the United States is available to take your call.

Purchase a mobile phone in Switzerland.",How to Call the United States From Switzerland," The international code for making calls from Switzerland is 00. Follow this with 1, the country code for reaching the United States.


On most cell phones, you can use the + button instead of the international code. To reach the United States from anywhere in the world, press +1. On some phones, the + symbol is located on the 0 button.;
, This is the three-digit code specific to the region you are calling.


If you don't know the area code, search online for ""area code"" followed by the name of the city or county you are calling. You may need to try several options from that area.

, You can now dial the seven digit phone number you are trying to reach.


For example, to call Chicago from Switzerland, you would dial: 001-773-###-####. (773 is the area code for most of Chicago.)

, Many U.S. businesses use a toll-free number with the 800 area code, but block international calls to avoid paying high phone rates. If you're lucky, you can replace this code with ""880,"" an out-of-date alternative which still works in some cases.If this doesn't go through either, you may need to find an alternative number for the company that does not start with 1-800.


Make sure your formatting is correct. These numbers are usually listed as ""1-800,"" but you do not need the 1 when calling from abroad. Start with ""001-800"" instead.

, If your mobile phone can't get through, try making the international call from a landline. In order to reduce the rates for international calls, buy a calling card at a grocery store or convenience store. Enter the code on the calling card to use the pre-paid minutes for an international call., This is not usually necessary to make a call, but if nothing else works, try seeking assistance by dialing one of these numbers:1141 — international operator
1159 — international inquiries
1144 — national cell phone operator

, VoIP or ""Voice over Internet Protocol"" lets you make calls using your internet connection instead of a phone network. This is usually much cheaper for international calls. Skype is a popular option for computers, while smartphones have many available apps such as FaceTime, Google Hangouts, or Viber.


In many cases, you will need to pay a small fee for international calls, even if the service is normally free. If you're not sure how to set this up, visit the help section of the service's website.

, The Swiss mobile phone network uses the GSM standard, which is not compatible with many North American phones.If you live in the US and are planning a trip, contact your phone provider and ask whether your phone model will work in Switzerland.


AT&T and T-Mobile phones use GSM, but double check with the provider anyway — other technical limitations may prevent your model from working abroad. Other major US networks use the CDMA standard, which is not usable in Europe, but some will loan their customers a phone while traveling., If your mobile phone is ""locked"" to a specific carrier, it will not work with a Swiss SIM card. Contact your network carrier and ask for the phone to be unlocked. Once the phone is unlocked, you can insert a SIM card from a Swiss carrier and use the phone to make local and international calls.


Before buying a SIM card, make sure it will fit your phone. Most standard cell phones will work with a standard SIM card, but iPhones and smartphones use special micro or nano SIM cards.Notify your U.S. phone carrier that you are going to be traveling to Switzerland and will be using your phone there with a different SIM card for a certain period of time. This will ensure your U.S. carrier does not suspend or change your service.

, If you do not want to bring your own phone, buy a mobile phone once you arrive in the country. Look for an inexpensive phone if you are only staying a short time in Switzerland and get a pay-as-you-go SIM card plan so you can make international calls easily and cheaply.Swisscom, Orange, and Sunrise are the three major network providers, but there are many smaller providers as well. The most affordable and reliable network depends on the region of Switzerland you are visiting, so ask a local for advice if possible.
Make sure you are aware of the rates for international phone calls using your Swiss phone as well as the data usage rates.
Keep in mind you are required to register your Swiss cellphone in Switzerland by law. You will get your own area code along with a local Swiss number. Your area code may be 076, 077, 078, or 079, depending on your provider.

Purchase a scheda telefonica.,
Consider an international calling plan for landlines.",How to Call the United States From Italy1," If you are from the United States and traveling in Italy, bring along an unlocked phone that allows SIM cards to be inputted from other providers. A SIM card is a small information chip that you can purchase from a cell provider while abroad.


Ensure that the cell phone you want to bring to Italy is a GSM phone—which is global cellular technology used by most of the world—and is unlocked—meaning that the provider you got the phone from does not have a restriction on that phone being used with other providers.AT&T and T-Mobile carry GSM phones which are typically unlocked.Look for a phone provider that carries a SIM card that will fit in your phone. Most cell phones have a standard SIM card size, but iPhones and other newer smartphones use special micro or nano SIM card sizes.You can set up an international calling plan through your current U.S. phone carrier, but note that these plans are typically very expensive.
Whether you choose an international call plan or the SIM card route, make sure to call your provider to change or suspend your service, or ask any other questions, before embarking on your trip.;
, Choose to buy a cell phone in Italy if you can’t or don’t want to bring your own from the U.S., as it is frequently simpler and cheaper. Buy an inexpensive phone for a short stay in Italy, and purchase a pay-as-you-go SIM card plan to make international calls.Check the pricing on the plan to make sure you know what the rates are for international calls. Check the data usage rates on a smartphone if you plan to use it for internet calling apps.

, To make a phone call from a public phone in Italy, purchase a scheda telefonica, also called a carta telefonica, or a prepaid calling card from locations such as a tobacco shop, train station, or post office. Insert these cards into a public telephone before dialing your number.You can use a calling card for a cell phone, but you should note that you may also be charged for minutes on the call from the cell phone provider as well. Or, you can use the cell phone without a card to pay the international call rates from your provider. Check with the cell phone provider and the details of your phone plan to confirm charges.Note that public phones are an increasing rarity, or are out of order when you do come across them, as Italy has one of the highest rates in the world for cell phones per capita., If you spend a significant amount of time in Italy and want to make frequent calls to the United States from your own landline, use an international calling plan from a local phone provider. Pay a fixed monthly rate to make unlimited international calls.


Note that these plans can be limited or have different charges based on what calling zone you are placing a call to. The United States is in the same zone (Zone 1) as Italy and other countries in the EU, so rates and plans should be less expensive than calling to other zones.
If you’re not using an international calling plan, the regular landline charges are higher for calling a mobile phone than another landline, but charges do not change based on time of day."

Consider the price of an international call.",How to Call London," Your exit code is the number that allows you to dial out of your home country (or the country you are calling from.) Keep in mind that each country has a different exit. If you are making an international call from the United States, your exit code is 011.


Run a search through your search engine of choice to find your country’s exit code. You can find your country code by running an online search with the query “--Your Country’s Name-- Exit Code”.
Two of the most common exit codes are 011--for the United States and other countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan--and 00, for Mexico, Europe and many other countries as well.
In some countries, such as Brazil, you might have multiple exit codes to choose from. Which exit code you use determines which international carrier you'll use to place the telephone call.;
, The country code is typically 1-3 digits long and identifies the country to which you are placing a call. The United Kingdom’s country code is 44.


If you're dialing from elsewhere in the United Kingdom, you don't need to input the exit code or country code (44). But you do need to add the leading zero to the London area code. So the London prefix becomes 020 instead of 20, as would be the case for an international call.

, This number can be 1-5 digits long and will narrow your call geographically in the country you are calling. These numbers always start with a 0 but the first 0 is dropped when calling internationally. London’s area code is 020, so you would drop the 0 and just use 20. So (if you were calling from the US) you would dial, 011 44 20, followed by the local phone number.

, As these are non-geographic they are tied to a specific area. You would still drop the 0 for cell phone calls. If you were calling a cell phone with one of the codes above you would dial 011 44 7939 or 011 44 7850.

, This is the direct phone number of the residence, business, or mobile phone that you are contacting in London. The United Kingdom uses 8-digit local phone numbers for landlines.,, London is on Greenwich Mean Time in the winter months, and British Summer Time in the summer months. London has an interesting geographic position in that it is located right next to Greenwich, where the prime meridian runs. Be sure to check the time in London before you place your call--it would be terrible manners to make your call when it is 2 am in London.


Clocks are set forward one hour on the last Sunday in March, and set back one hour on the last Sunday in October.

, Once you have gathered the required numbers, dial and wait for a ring to signal a proper connection. The following example represents the dialing sequence of a phone call to London, UK from New York, USA: (For the purposes of this example, the local phone number is 5555-5555) 011-44-20-5555-5555.


If you are calling a cell phone in London, you would dial 011-44-XXXX-555-555. (Where XXXX is the non-Geographic code such as 7939 or 7500)

, International phone calls can be very expensive. You may want to contact your phone service provider for information on international calling plans, Another option is to purchase a prepaid calling card to offset the cost.


Options for saving money include using a VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) program to place the call, using calling cards, calling during non-peak hours or signing up for a reduced-rate international calling plan. If more than one international carrier is available in your area, you might also get cheaper rates by switching carriers.

Make sure international calls are enabled on your phone plan.,
Find other methods of contact if a toll free number won't go through.",How to Call New Zealand2," Some VoIP services, or voice over internet protocol, allow you to make international calls without including your country's exit code. Try entering the number as described above but without dialing the exit code.

, Your phone plan may block international calls. If no international phone calls are going through, you may need to call your company and alter your plan details.


Keep in mind that international calls are usually more expensive than local or in-country calls. If you plan to make international calls frequently, you may wish to choose a plan that has a reduced international price rate.

, Toll free numbers in New Zealand begin with 508 or 800 (0508 or 0800 if dialing within New Zealand). Because these calls are not actually free for international customers, many companies block international calls on their toll free numbers.Try contacting the company by email, or see if you can find a regular number for them that does not begin with a toll-free code.

, This is the number of the person, business, or cell phone that you are trying to reach. Phone numbers are generally nine digits long, including the area code. For example, if you were calling Fukuyama, the whole phone number would be (84)-XXX-XXXX.If you are trying to reach a cell phone in Japan, you would dial 90 after the country code and before the area code. For example, to call a cell phone in Fukuyama from the United States, you would dial 011-81-90-XXXX-XXXX., It is important to remember that it is most likely not the same time in Japan as it is in the place you are making the call from.

Research calling cards.",How to Call Jamaica from the United States3," Although your cellphone can make and receive calls to and from Jamaica, call from a landline if you have one. If the recipient also has a landline, be sure to dial that number if possible, rather than their cellphone's, in order to save them money.

If cost is no object, go ahead and leave a message.

, Find your most recent phone bill covering your average amount of calls to Jamaica. Add up the charges for those calls. Compare the total to the monthly rate for a flat-rate plan with unlimited international minutes. If the flat-rate plan is cheaper, switch to that.


Be sure to factor in any extra charges for set-up and cancellation, as well as any others, to make sure that switching will really be worth it.

For some services, you can list your contacts, but you'll have to wait for the person to accept your request to communicate.

, Check to make sure the device you want to use is compatible with the service you've chosen. Since it may take a while to download, plan to give yourself plenty of time to do this before making your call. If you're accessing a service through your computer, you should make sure that your computer has a good camera and microphone or you may need to purchase them.


If you're unsure about downloading an app, some operating systems will offer a preview of certain calling applications before you download them.

, Many of these calling services offer a free calling program for international numbers if the other person is also using the same calling program. But, if you'll be using a service to call a landline or cell phone, you'll probably be charged a fee or international calling rate. Payment options might include:Setting up a monthly payment plan with a fixed number of international minutes
Buy credit to use towards a pay-as-you go rate
Talking with your cell phone provider to make sure you're using WiFi and not the data that you pay for

, Don't wait to try out the online calling service till when you need to make an important phone call. Become familiar with how to make a call, set up your voicemail (if it's an option), and receive calls. If you find that you don't like using the service, you can always uninstall it and try a different service.


While you're testing the service, ask the person you're calling how the audio and visual quality is on their end. If the other person can't hear you or see you, it may be a problem with their setup or with the service itself.

Be prepared to follow up.",How to Call Brazil," Your country’s exit code allows you to dial out of your country. It is also referred to as an “international access code or IDD (International Direct Dialling) code. Every country has a different code. If you do an online search for “<your country> exit code,” the code for your country should come up right away.


Exit code examples: USA and Canada = 011, United Kingdom (and many other countries, including Argentina and New Zealand) = 00;
, A country code allows you to call that country from another country — Brazil’s country code allows you to call Brazil from outside of Brazil. Country codes consist of one to two digits; you dial them after you’ve dialed your country’s exit code.


So far, the numbers you would dial into your phone would be <your country’s exit code> + 55: if you are in the United States or Canada, this would be 011-55.
If you ever want to look up a country code, the following online search should give you immediate results: “what is <country’s> country code.”

, An area code can be 1 to 3 digits long and will narrow your call geographically in the country you are calling. Brazil uses 2-digit area codes. Brazil has many area codes, so which one you use will depend upon which city/area you need to call. If you don’t already know the area code, do an Internet search for “<city> Brazil area code.”


Brazilian area code examples include Rio de Janeiro = 21, Anapolis = 91, São Paulo = 11: if you were calling somewhere in São Paulo from the United States, the numbers you would dial so far (before the local 8-digit number) would be 011-55-11.
It is likely that the area code is already included in the phone number. You might see it in brackets in front of the local number — for example (11) 5555-5555.

, This is the direct phone number of the residence/business you are contacting in Brazil. Brazil uses 8-digit local phone numbers. If you are unsure of the number, double check it via email/social media (for a personal contact) or through an Internet search (if it’s a business, government body etc.).

, Before making the call, you might want to write the number down or enter the entire phone number into a text document in case you need to use it again.


The order of the numbers will be <your country’s exit code> + 55 (Brazil’s exit code) + <Brazilian area code> + <8-digit local phone number>.
If you were calling the local number 5555-5555 in São Paulo, Brazil, from the USA, you would write down, and then subsequently dial, 011-55-11-5555-5555.

, Once you have gathered the necessary numbers, dial and wait for a ring to signal a proper connection.

, VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) applications allow you to make international calls for much cheaper than through your phone provider. All you need is a computer, tablet or smart phone, and an Internet connection.Popular applications include Skype, Google+ Hangouts, Viber, and Jitsi.If you call Brazil often, check to see if your VoIP app offers subscriptions, or monthly flat rates for a predetermined amount of minutes in calls to Brazil. This can significantly reduce your per-minute VoIP costs.

, If you’re calling someone you know, you might consider asking them to video chat with you instead. Many social media sites and applications (including Google+ Hangouts and Skype) provide free video chat services.


In the same vein, many applications (Whatsapp, Skype, Facebook) allow for free calls within the applications — meaning that you’d need an Internet connection on both your end and the receiver’s end to make the call.

, If you have no Internet connection, but you have a landline with free local minutes, a calling card is likely your best option. Calling cards vary greatly in rates and hidden fees. Look for a calling card that offers simple, straightforward pricing and few hidden and/or extra fees. Popular calling cards include Pingo, EnjoyPrepaid, Comfi, Nobelcom, and CallingCards.Unless your mobile phone has unlimited minutes, a calling card is likely not your best option, as you will end up paying for your mobile minutes on top of the calling card minutes: if your mobile phone provider charges you 25 cents per minute and the calling card costs you an additional 2 cents per minute, you’ll pay at least 27 cents per minute (not including any connection fees or hidden costs you may need to pay through the calling card).

, If you are consistently making international calls and are either unwilling or unable to use a VoIP application, considering calling your phone provider to see if they can offer you some sort of international long-distance rate package.

, There are 4 time zones in Brazil that range from -2 to -5 hours in relation to Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT), which is the international meridian marking the starting point for all other time zones. The official time zone for Brazil (where Rio, São Paulo, and the federal capital of Brasília are located) is -3 hours.


Example: If you are calling São Paulo from New York when Daylight Savings Time (DST) is in effect, be aware that São Paulo is one hour ahead of New York at this time. This would be particularly important to pay attention to when calling at night, when the recipient might be asleep.

, The official language of Brazil is Portuguese. Knowing some basic phrases will help you avoid confusion if someone other than your intended recipient answers the phone:Hello, my name is… = Oi, meu nome é…
Do you speak <insert your language here (ex., English)>? = Você fala <inglês>?
May I please speak to… = Por favor, posso falar com…
Can I please leave a message? = Eu posso por favor deixe uma mensagem?
My phone number is… = O meu número de telefone é…
Thank you very much = Muito obrigado (make it Obrigadoa if you’re a female), Some sources suggest that for Brazilian people, phone calls are not as effective as email and personal visits, and voice messages are rarely returned. If you leave a message for someone and your message is not returned within 2 or 3 days, you might try contacting the person or company by email, or simply calling once more.Try not to be rude or express frustration at having difficulty communicating via the phone and/or voicemail as it is likely just a cultural difference.

Move on.",How to Tell if Someone Is Ignoring Your Calls and Decide What to Do About It," Check to see if all your calls to your friend have been missed. What’s the ratio of missed calls to answered calls? Notice the call length, the time you called her, how often you call her and whether or not she has called you. If the balance of missed calls, answered calls and placed calls seems off to you, think of other reasons this may be. Perhaps her phone plan is limited or she can’t buy phone credit/minutes/top-up regularly.;
, Think of things that your friend might be busy with. If you know her well and are aware of her schedule, think of any activities she might be engaged in. Perhaps she’s in a meeting or is driving somewhere. Perhaps this is the time of day she takes a nap or she sleeps early. Has she mentioned any event that she might be attending that is not part of her regular routine? Perhaps her ringer is off/her phone is on silent or the battery needs to be charged. Don’t jump to conclusions. She may have a genuine reason for not answering your call.

, Has anything happened recently that has made things awkward between you and your friend? Can she have any reason for avoiding your call other than being busy? Think about her behavior toward you recently. If she’s been cold, possibly distant, then there’s a possibility that your calls are being avoided.


Be careful. Again, be careful not to jump to conclusions. Your assessment of your relationship may be biased. Consider asking an unbiased friend for advice on the matter.

, Pick a time that you know she’s available to talk. When you call, let the phone ring for at least a minute, in case she’s rushing to pick it up. Her phone might just be out of reach or in another room. Give her the benefit of the doubt.

, If she doesn’t answer, call back once. If she still doesn’t answer, leave a message asking her to call you back and give a brief explanation of why you’re calling. Unless you’re in an emergency, resist the temptation to call anyone repeatedly in the hopes your call will be answered. This can be irritating and can be considered rude.If you’re leaving a voice message, keep your message brief and be sure to speak slowly, state your name and your phone number. If you’re calling a number that they share with others (such as a landline number), be sure to state whom you wish to speak to. Speak clearly and calmly. This is especially important if the person you’re calling is an acquaintance or someone you know professionally., It’s possible that your mutual friend knows if your friend is avoiding your calls or if she’s busy with another activity and is unable to attend calls at the moment. Your mutual friend might also be able to give you any indication of whether or not your calls are being avoided.

, If your call is not answered, have someone else call that person immediately after you do. If her call is answered but yours isn’t, it’s possible that your friend is avoiding your calls.


If you’re close to your mutual friend, explain the situation to her. If her call is attended, she might weave into conversation that you were both trying to call and your call was not answered.
Make sure you pick a friend who is socially intelligent: pick someone who gets along well with others and whom you’ve seen successfully navigate tricky social situations such as making peace between two friends. A socially intelligentfriend will be better able to assess the situation and give you advice.

, It’s possible that your friend has lost her phone or prefers text messages over phone conversations. If you’re close to her, you’ll have an idea of which mode of communication she prefers. Try a social media platform that she frequently uses.

, Is this a really close friendship or a family member or someone whom you want a smooth relationship with? Has anything happened lately that could explain her behavior? Were harsh words exchanged recently or did you do something that might have offended her?


If the answer to all questions is no, then ask yourself if it’s worth worrying about it. Brush it off, busy yourself with other things and try other means of communicating with her, if you need to. Consider reducing the frequency of your calls if you are still bothered by your friend ignoring you. If nothing else, this will create fewer chances for your feelings to be hurt.
If this is a relationship that you want to be smooth, you'll need to put in some effort to make things better.

, If you know that something you have done or are doing is the reason your calls are being avoided, try to show you’re sorry or stop doing that particular thing. Pay special attention to the way you behave on the phone. For example, if you know that your friend doesn’t like to gossip but you do, avoid gossiping about others when you call her. Or if you’ve recently hurt her feelings, meet with her or write to her to apologize.


Once you make amends with a person, they are not likely to avoid you.

, If changing your behavior does not rectify the situation or if you want to get to the heart of the matter, talk to her about what is going on. Ask to meet her at a time that’s convenient for both of you. Make sure you set aside enough time, in case you have a long discussion. Tell her you’ve noticed that she’s missed your calls lately and you’re wondering why that is.

, Avoid speaking in an accusatory tone. This is especially important if she's already angry.If you’re confrontational, you might make your relationship worse. Often it’s not what is said but the tone in which it’s said that sours friendships., Ask her why she’s avoiding your calls. Ask her if there’s something you’ve done or something that she would like to talk about. Mention specific examples of times you’ve called her. Listen to her explanation patiently and without interrupting. Explain your point of view of the situation. Avoid pointing fingers or laying blame on anyone: you’re trying to solve a problem, not blame someone for the problem..


Avoid calling her names and be polite: this will show her that you’re frustrated because you care., Discuss solutions to any points she raises. This will show her that you want to make things better between you.Try to think of things from her point of view and empathize. Follow through on anything that you think you can do to make things between you better.

, Agree to bring up any issues in the future instead of avoiding each other. Avoiding problems doesn’t solve them and often exacerbates them. Accept that some times life becomes busier than usual or that friends grow apart over time. Try to find other ways of staying in touch if it’s difficult for your friend to talk on the phone as often as you used to.

Don’t ignore debt collectors.,
Beware of rogue and illegal debt collecting practices.,
Know your rights.,
Record the phone conversation.,
Don’t commit fraud.",How to Stop Collection Calls1," Answer the phone and find out if you owe money or not, what you can do to pay the money back while stifling collection calls, or even if it is just a mistake. Only after you completely understand the reason for the collection calls should you put an end to them. Ignoring legitimate collection calls won’t stop them.


The creditors have a legal right to collect the debt. Not paying money to collection agencies when it is due can have adverse effects on your credit score. Sometimes, you might forget that you owe money to a credit card company, a credit union, or your bank. If you don’t answer the phone, you may not realize that you have unpaid debt before it’s reported.;
, Oftentimes, collection agencies mix people up. People with common names like John Smith or Sarah Jones often receive collection calls meant for others by the same name. Sometimes, debt collectors will call all the people in a given area with the same last name, looking for the individual or family members.Be aware of the concept of ""phantom"" or ""zombie"" debt. This is debt that you do not legally owe, but an unscrupulous collection agency is still attempting to collect. Phantom debt refers to a settled debt that a collection agency continues to try to collect. If you do not pay the phantom debt, the agency has no recourse against you. But once you make a payment, the money won't be refunded, and you have little if any recourse against the agency.
Collectors often threaten legal action in the hopes of collecting debt faster. Debt is a civil matter and cannot be used to file criminal charges. The only way not paying a debt can be considered a crime is if the original sum was obtained under false pretenses, such as by identity theft, forgery, or other misrepresentation.

, Under the Federal FDCPA, a collector is not allowed to make any kind of threat or use abusive language. Tell the debt collector this. If it is a rogue collector or a fraud, most likely they’ll be scared off.


Being in debt can be embarrassing. Most people are not willing to have their family or friends know that they have fallen behind. State and Federal laws also do not allow debt collectors to talk about your debt to other people except your lawyer or with your permission.

, Lawyers love having recordings. If the collector has been using vulgar methods to intimidate you, start recording. Inform the collector at the beginning that you are taping the call as evidence for filing a formal, legal complaint with the State Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission. If your telephone has a speaker option, use a regular tape recorder to record the conversation. Most cell phones today have recording apps or built-in recording features., Do not lie and pretend to be another person. Don't pretend to be dead or to have moved. To do so is fraud under federal law. Collection agencies and investigators can easily determine if such a statement is false. Since collection calls are often recorded, your lie will be recorded as well.

You'd dial the same exit code if you were calling from Canada, but other countries have their own exit code. For example, 00 is the exit code for most of Europe.;
,


The country code stays the same, no matter where you're calling from.

, In Belgium, large cities are assigned 1-digit area codes, and 2-digit area codes apply to other areas. Examples of major Belgium area codes include:


Major cities: Brussels, 2; Antwerp, 3; Gent, 9.
Other areas: Hasselt, 11; Leuven, 16; Kortrijk, 56; Ostend, 59; Charleroi, 71; Verviers, 87.
Cell phones: Belgian cell phone numbers start with 04. But if you're dialing in from the United States, leave off the ""0"" and dial only 4, then the rest of the mobile number.

,


The area code and phone number usually add up to a total of 8 digits. If you dialed a 1-digit area code, the phone number will contain 7 digits. If you dialed a 2-digit area code, it's followed by only 6 digits.

Some types of organizations are not under obligation to pay attention to the Do Not Call Registry. They include:

Calls from organizations with which you have established a business relationship
Calls from organizations you've previously given written permission to call you
Calls that are not commercial or do not include unsolicited advertisements
Calls from tax-exempt non-profit organizations;
, This specialized department can place a trap on your line that inhibits specific callers from contacting you.

, If you're routinely getting calls from the same annoying companies, you can tell the telemarketers to remove your name and number from their calling list. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires that your number be removed from the requested company lists for 5 years.

, If you're not sure of the source of a certain number that pops up, do a search to find out. Entering an unknown number in a search engine may give you some hints about its owner. Many online report services also allow you to report and share your experience with other users.

Although collection agencies are required by law to send you a letter within 5 days of their first contact with you, not all of them comply. Looking up the phone number can serve as an alternate way of obtaining a mailing address so that you can contact them in writing.;
, There are certain behaviors that, under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, are illegal for collectors to engage in. If they are doing any of these, make note of the date/time of the infraction and include it when you right them a letter (see below). These infractions are:Calling you before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. or contacting your employer, neighbors, or family members about your debt. They may contact these people to locate you but not to discuss your debt.
Calling you at work, calling you repeatedly, or failing to disclose the identity of the collector for whom they are calling.
Engaging in deceptive conduct such as making false claims or statements including claiming to be an attorney or claiming that you committed a crime, that they work for or operate a credit reporting agency or that they represent a governmental agency, stating incorrect balances owed, etc.Publishing your name, sending you anything that looks like an official governmental or court document if it isn’t, or using any symbols or language on written communications, envelopes, or postcards that show the sender as a debt collector or an entity involved in the debt collection business.Threatening violence or arrest, loss of child custody or welfare benefits, lying, or using profanity.

, It may be tempting to simply ignore the phone calls, but creditors will generally continue to call until the issue is resolved. Worse, if they can't reach you, they may resort to contacting your relatives or associates instead.

, Remember, debt collectors cannot legally call you at work or call a relative or other third party if you tell them not to. Be sure to state this in your very first conversation with them.


Follow up with a letter confirming what you told them on the phone. Include the day and date and send it via a service that provides tracking and proof of delivery.
If you have an attorney representing you, provide the attorney's contact information. Once you've done so, they can only contact you through your attorney.

, If you can't pay the debt, say so. Briefly explain why (for example, tell them you've lost your job or are sick), and explain when you expect to be able to discuss it. Being forthright and reasonable often reduces the number of phone calls and may stave off a lawsuit.

, If you believe that you do not owe money, write the creditors a letter saying so within 30 days of the first time they contact you. Once the creditors receive the letter, they cannot continue to call you to collect the debt unless they can prove that you owe the money. If you do owe money to the creditors, offer to work out a payment plan in writing, and ask that they not contact you by phone anymore.


After receiving your letter they may contact you for three reasons:To acknowledge receipt of your letter.
To tell you their efforts have ended.
To tell you they are suing you.

, If your debt has been sold to a third party, it's likely the party purchased it for a small percentage of the total amount owed. The third-party may settle for a smaller lump-sum payment to avoid the cost of suing you to recover the money. Even if the debt is still held by the original creditors, you might be able to negotiate a similar settlement.

, If you have multiple outstanding debts, you may consider getting legal advice to understand whether bankruptcy or other options are best for you. You can also hire the attorney to handle the problem for you, and if you know they have violated FDCPA laws, an attorney can help you raise legal claims.


Attorneys can get expensive so be very sure you want to do this. Usually merely sending the letter will suffice. If, however, things get out of hand, many attorneys will either provide a free consultation or a minimal charge for one to help you decide what path to take., If a creditor is harassing you and taking reasonable steps to stop the harassment isn't working, file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.

, This is really Defcon 1 and should only be considered when your financial situation is grave. As a bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for 7-9 years, it will have a rather lasting effect on your credit and your ability to secure loans, some employment, and a mortgage.Creditors are required by law to stop contacting you immediately after your filing. In order to contact you they must get approval from the court, which the court will not grant to creditors representing unsecured debt.

, If you have not already done so, now is the time to hire an attorney because you are about to file a lawsuit. There are attorneys out there who specialize in debt collection law. While these types of cases can be difficult to win, if you are successful, you and your attorney may be able to collect attorneys' fees.To find a capable attorney, call your state bar association and ask about a referral. You can also check your state's bar website for information about attorneys in your area. Also try asking friends and family if they have any names they could pass along.

, If you are being pursued by a debt collector and you have exhausted all other remedies (e.g., offered a settlement, filed an administrative complaint, or declared for bankruptcy), you might want to consider filing a lawsuit against the person or company trying to improperly collect from you. Before you can file a lawsuit, the debt collector must have violated some law. Generally speaking, harassing debt collectors will either be violating the federal FDCPA or a similar state law. For example, California has a law regarding debt collection practices called the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (RFDCPA).


The FDCPA is violated when a debt collector calls you with the intent to harass, annoy, or abuse you. Furthermore, a debt collector can violate the FDCPA by simply calling and not disclosing their identity.The RFDCPA may be even more protective of your rights and may be violated when a debt collector does not correctly identify themselves, causes you to incur long distance charges, causes the phone to ring repeatedly for the purpose of annoying you, or when they call you so often that it becomes harassment., When you choose to file a lawsuit, your first task will be to choose what type of court to file in. If you are suing someone under the FDCPA, you can file in either state or federal court.If you are suing someone under the RFDCPA, you will have to file your case in state court.


If you file in federal court, you will have to file in a district court with jurisdiction over your case.
If you file in state court, you will file in a trial court having jurisdiction over your case.

, Once you have chosen where to sue, you will have to talk to your attorney and put together a complaint. A complaint will describe your injuries and explains how the defendant caused the harm. The complaint will also lay out why the court has jurisdiction over the case and the relief you are seeking.If you are filing under the FDCPA, you can seek the following relief:

Any actual damages sustained by you;
Additional damages up to $1,000; and
The cost of the action, which includes reasonable attorneys' fees.If you are filing under the RFDCPA, you can seek the following relief:

Any actual damages sustained by you;
Additional damages up to $1,000 if the debt collector willfully and knowingly violated the law; and
The cost of the action, which includes reasonable attorneys' fees., Once you and your attorney have written the complaint, you will file it with the appropriate court. To file the complaint, you will take it to the courthouse and hand it to the clerk of courts. They will stamp an original and give you copies. Keep one copy for yourself and keep another one to serve on the other party.

, When you file your complaint, you will be required to pay a filing fee. The fees will differ depending on each state and also whether you file in federal court. Check with the appropriate court regarding their fees.


If you cannot afford to pay the filing fees, you may be able to get a fee waiver. In state court, you will file a fee waiver form stating the reasons you are unable to pay (e.g., no income or all your income goes to pay for basic necessities). In federal court you can request to proceed in forma pauperis. If this request is granted your fees will be waived., Once you have completed your filing requirements, you will have to serve the other party with your complaint. Usually the sheriff or another competent person over the age of 18 will serve the other party by physically handing the complaint to them. Once this has taken place, your server (i.e., the person who served the other party) will fill out a form stating that the party was actually served.

, At this point, depending on how strong your case is, the debt collector may want to discuss a settlement with you. If they make you an acceptable offer, or if you make them an offer they accept, then you should execute a settlement agreement and end the dispute. This process may take time and may include various negotiations and discussions. However, in the long run, if you can settle before going to trial, your costs will be lowered and your time commitments will be lessened.

, If you and the other party cannot come to a settlement, the court process will resume and you will start the discovery phase. During discovery, each party will provide information about their case to the other party. This information might include the identity of witnesses and copies of documents related to the case. Discovery might also include depositions, where important witnesses may get called in to answer questions about the case before trial., At trial, your attorney and the other attorney will present evidence to the judge and possibly a jury. The attorneys will have an opportunity to call witnesses to testify and can enter physical items into evidence so long as they meet certain evidentiary standards. In a civil case such as this, you may be called to testify about the harassment by the debt collector. If you are called as a witness, answer questions honestly and do not provide details that are not asked for.


At the end of the trial, the judge (or jury) will decide your case. If the court rules in your favor, you will be granted an award. If you lose, you should talk to your attorney about the possibility of an appeal.

"
Pay your debt.,
Send a letter to the collection agency.,
Contact a lawyer.,
Ask how others successfully stopped collection calls.,
Alert the Federal Trade Commission.",How to Stop Collection Calls2," The easiest way to stop collection calls is to pay your debt, but you need to be careful when doing so. Speak with the collector to set up a payment plan. Many collectors will encourage you to set up automatic bill-pay. Make sure that whatever plan you agree upon, you are comfortable with. Scam collection agencies love setting up automatic bill-pay and will charge you an exorbitant fee for the service.

, Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), you are allowed to tell debt collectors to stop calling you. Tell them in writing that you prefer to communicate with them by mail only. Send any correspondence, including disputes to both the collection agency and the creditor by certified mail and request that a return receipt be sent back to you upon delivery.Sample letters are available online.Make sure you keep a copy of your letter. Written communication works to your advantage as you will have a record of everything that is said, whereas phone communication is only recorded on occasion.
If the creditor still contacts you after your written request, you can file a “cease and desist“ letter. Find a consumer lawyer who can draft such a letter. If the problem continues, you might even have a case to sue the collection agency.
Debt collectors are also prohibited from contacting you while you are at work.

, There are many lawyers who concentrate on debt collection. They’ll be able to help you if you owe money or if a collector is illegally harassing you. These lawyers will charge you a fee or will take a percentage of what they collect on your behalf. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, unlike most laws, actually spells out how much money you might receive if you win your case. The amounts can range from $5000 for individual cases to $500,000 for group law suites. The first thing a lawyer will do is look up the statute of limitations on your loan. Old loans, acquired decades earlier or by deceased relatives, sometimes can be the cause of collection calls. Statutes of limitations exist in many places. If the statute of limitations has expired, you could be off the hook. Even if a collection agency tries to pursue it, you are under no legal obligation to pay. When this occurs, if you do not wish to pay, you could use a cease and desist letter. Remember, you can receive a bad credit rating longer than the statute of limitations., They may have come across an alternate way that works well with this particular agency. Each collection agency is different. Sometimes, they require forms to be filled out. Others only need a letter. Rather than discover this for yourself, ask for help from others. , Report the collectors to the FTC online. They are generally slow to move on these kinds of problems, but if they receive enough reports about one specific agency, their wrath can be formidable."
"
Setup phone call filtering.,
Setup your phone system as WhiteList-Only.,
Setup your phone system as BlackList unwanted.",How to Stop Collection Calls3," Only after you’ve exhausted all other options should blocking collection call numbers be considered. Most phone companies offer ""anonymous call rejection"". If the calling party is not displaying caller id information for whatever reason, your phone will not ring. Instead the calling party will be confronted by a phone company system that will do one or more of the following:


Prompt the caller to release caller id information,
Prompt the caller to leave a very short voice message which is subsequently played to you giving you a chance to accept or dump the call, or instruct the caller to call back revealing caller id information.
This will weed out most collection calls.

,


Numbers not on your approved list (WhiteList) will not reach your phone. Collection agencies often employ caller id spoofing, sending fake or alternate caller id information to trick you into answering. However, a WhiteList-Only home phone setup puts a swift end to this, because it won't accept non-recognized numbers.
WhiteList-Only can be through your phone company for around $50USD with no monthly fees. Alternatively one can switch phone service from Land Line (conventional phone system) to VoIP (Voice over IP). This requires an internet connection and performs best on a broadband link; dialup internet is generally insufficient.
There are a variety of home VoIP providers that allow WhiteList-Only setup for as little as $8 USD monthly. If one is adventurous, one can setup a home PBX using Asterisk, an open source software phone system usually requiring a dedicated computer. PBX in a Flash is one such flavor of Asterisk and is well suited to the above average computer user.

, Similar to WhiteList-only, sometimes also called GreenList-only, BlackList allows all calls except those explicitly blocked.


Land Line phone service typically limits the customer to twenty blocked numbers whereas home VoIP providers or home PBX have no such limit. Additionally, these services often allow one to block all calls from toll free numbers: 800*, 866*, 877*, 888*.

If you're using an iPhone or Android, there are apps that automatically block calls from hidden numbers.


Blacklist call is the fastest and most intuitive app for Androids to automatically block SPAM calls from annoying telemarketers.
Call Control is the most popular app for Androids to block telemarketers.
Call Bliss is the most popular app for iPhones to block calls from unknown numbers.

, Androids and iPhones both have settings that allow you to only get calls from the people you want. The drawback is that if an organization or person you actually want to hear from has an unknown number, you won't get the call. If you get an inordinate number of unknown calls from spammers every day, this might be a good option.


You can set your Android to Privacy Mode so you only get calls from people you preapprove from your contacts list.
Use Do Not Disturb on your iPhone. You can silence calls from everyone except for those selected from your contacts list.

, Call trapping services are paid services that force the caller to show the number from which they're calling. TrapCall is the most popular service, and works with iPhone and Android (but not landlines)., Your phone company provides a range of call blocking and screening services. These types of services come with a monthly fee. Call your phone company to see what options are available to you. Services such as Call Screen, Priority Ringing and Call Return are ordinarily available in most states.


Call Screen can be set up to block calls from specific numbers by sending that caller to a pre-recorded message telling them that you will not take their call.
Priority ringing allows you to set up special ring tones for individual numbers so you know without looking at your phone if you want to answer it.
Call Return allows you to call the last person who called you even if their number came up as ""private"" or ""unavailable.""

, Inbound call blockers require the caller to punch in a code to reach you. This will stop calls from all callers who do not possess your personal code. While this might make it a hassle for friends, family and acquaintances to reach you, it might be worth it if you're being constantly harassed by solicitors.

Go through your exit interview.",How to Resign by Phone," If you have another job lined up, losing the income from your current job will not be an issue. However, if you are resigning without other employment lined up, you will have to find a way to cover your living expenses. How will you pay for your standard of living without the current income from your job? If this is a conundrum, it might be best to stick it out a while longer.


If you will need to rely on a new job's income, make sure that you have already clarified the details of your new job. This includes a signed contract or offer letter and a defined start date.Remember that your employee might owe you money from unpaid wages, unreimbursed expenses, and balances in your health insurance, life insurance, or company benefits plans. Figure these amounts into your financial planning.;
, The immediate problem of post-job health insurance coverage is one that troubles many individuals and families. As health care becomes more expensive, many rely on their employers to help pay premiums. Of course, this problem is particular to countries without a public health system, where a broader distribution of healthcare gives individuals more freedom to choose their work opportunities.


If you are moving to a position with fewer health benefits, go ahead and get procedures done while you are still on your current employer's insurance., There probably aren't any overriding issues in your job contract. However, reading over it before resigning will help you figure out if any of the fine print issues included in this agreement will impact your decision at all. Look for contract clauses or non-compete agreements that will affect future employment prospects.

, When you resign from your current position, where will you go? Are you taking time away from work or moving on to a new position as soon as possible? Ideally, you should have an offer in place for a new position when you resign. If you don't, you'll need to consider your options for finding employment. Figure out your present employer's policy on references for future employment, as you'll likely need them to find a new job.

, Resigning in person is always the best and most respectful way to quit a job. However, in some cases doing so is not feasible. If your boss works far away, is away from the office for a long period of time, or has never met with you in person, a phone call is a perfectly acceptable method of resigning. You should always resign by phone rather than resigning by email. If time is a constraint, choose notifying your employer by phone immediately over doing it in person and not providing adequate notice., There's no point in embarrassing yourself with an overemotional appeal, or inflaming feelings at the head office. When you've decided you want to resign over the phone, pull yourself together and make an effort to do this politely. You'll often find you have a better chance of an amicable solution to your problems if you do this. Try to frame your decision to leave in a positive light, even if you are leaving for decidedly negative reasons. For example, try focusing on the opportunity afforded by your new position.Try calming yourself down with a couple of deep breaths. If that doesn't work, talk into a mirror to reassure yourself that you're making the right decision in leaving this role.

, When it's time to pick up the phone, you'll want to effectively reach someone with authority to make your resignation effective. You can try the human resources department directly, or call up your direct supervisor or manager. If your manager cannot be reached, try reaching out to their direct supervisor. Even if your resignation will be handled by HR, always let your own manager know first. This will give them adequate time to prepare for your absence., The standard throughout most of the working world is giving two weeks notice for resigning from a position. However, this will vary by employer and position. For example, some positions may require that you cease your duties immediately after tendering your resignation. This is usually to protect sensitive information. However, if no guidance as to resignation timing is provided, follow the two week rule.


Be very clear about the date of your final day., When talking to your boss, open by clearly stating your intentions. A good, standard way to phrase this is, ""I offer my resignation effective ."" If it helps, soften by the blow by saying something like, ""I understand this may not be the best time, but..."" or ""I appreciate the experience I have had here"" or ""This was a difficult decision for me."" Allow your boss to negotiate with you about your specific departure date, unless you are starting your new job immediately after., Leave on a good note by speaking kindly of your time in the position you are leaving. Don't burn bridges; it costs you nothing and you will reap benefits down the road. Talk about how you have developed professionally during your time there. Then, provide your manager with a reason as to why you are leaving, whether it is due to disagreements with the employer or if you are leaving to take a better position elsewhere. However, be as polite and objective as possible.


If possible, limit the specifics that you provide about your new position or future plans. You can tell your manager or coworkers about it in casual conversation at a later date, if you wish.Some good examples of an explanation as to why you are quitting include:

""I need to move on with my career and have found a promising next step.""
""are a better fit to where I want to be professionally.""
""I am happy here but the other employer made me an even better offer.""
""It is an offer than I cannot refuse."", You may be required to provide a resignation letter in addition to your resignation by phone. However, you don't need to write anything complex. You can write a detailed resignation letter if you wish, but most employers don't require a long one if they require one at all. All that you will likely need to provide is a statement that says that you are resigning and an effective date. You usually don't even need to include a reason for leaving.


Check for company requirements for resignation to make sure that you are following them., Transfer over all purely-personal files on your company phone, tablet, and/or computer, if you have them. Odds are, the company will take these from you and wipe them clean when or soon after you announce your resignation. Make sure to get personal files off of them or back them up online beforehand. Just make sure not to copy any files that contain proprietary company information, including customer or prospect lists. This could subject you to criminal penalties., Work with HR to figure out how you can move your 401(k) or 403(b) over to a new employer. You'll need to figure out exactly how to transfer retirement funds on both sides, and complete all requirements for doing so, before switching to your new position. Make sure to take special care so that everything goes smoothly, because you don't want to lose your retirement fund.Other benefits issues to settle might include life and health insurance, purchase of a company car or other assets, and payment for unused vacation time, among others.
Work with HR to ensure that you are duly compensated for these benefits or that they are transferred to your new employer.

, Find a good time to clean your personal items out of your office. If you are asked to leave immediately, you may have little time to do this. Otherwise, you will likely have time to go back to your office, perhaps several times, to get your possessions out. Be sure to leave your workspace clean for the next occupant., If another employee will be trained to fill your role when you leave, be ready to assist in transitioning that person into your role. This may include giving advice, training them, or transferring over relevant documents. Leave any in-process projects and related document well-organized so that your successor can easily pick up where you left off., Continue to fulfill your objectives as normal, or even work harder, up until the last minute of your last day at your current job. This shows your employer that you are still a dedicated employee. After all, who knows when you might need a reference for a future position? Show your current employer that you are a hard worker to earn their respect and a glowing reference if you ever need one., During your exit interview, pay attention to the information presented to you. In many instances, the employee in charge of your exit information will give you specific information on the company's rules regarding information you can give potential employers about your work. Note any confidentiality agreements or limitations on referral letters, recommendations, or other interactions with potential employers."

, Most phone companies offer ""anonymous call rejection"". If the calling party is not displaying caller id information for whatever reason your phone will not ring. Instead the calling party will be confronted by a phone company system that will do one or more of the following: prompt the caller to release caller id information, prompt the caller to leave a very short voice message which is subsequently played to you giving you a chance to accept or dump the call, instruct the caller to call back revealing caller id information. This will weed out a great many collections calls. There are a number of hardware devices that can accomplish this without invoking a monthly fee.

""Should I send my resume?""), as well as information they may ask for such as your full name, address, telephone number, and current employer information.

Stop a repeat offender at home.",How to Get Someone to Stop Talking Loudly on Their Phone1," This will allow you to address the behavior without embarrassing the caller or making a scene in public. See if you can take the caller aside to a secluded corner, office, or wall. Address them formally, and be as polite as possible.Ask the caller something to the effect of, ""Sir/ma'am, can you talk a bit lower? Your voice is carrying."" Most of the time this should be enough.
You may be dealing with a more stubborn individual or even a hostile one if asked to quiet down. In this case you want to avoid a confrontation and should not press the matter with the isolation step.;
, This risks a confrontation with the loud caller. Attempt something subtle at first such as making eye contact, throat clearing, head shaking, or hand waving. The caller’s reaction could vary from compliance, to ignoring you, to hostility. You can try insisting if you are ignored, but this increases the risk of a hostile reaction. You might be better off moving to another location yourself or giving the other steps another try.


If subtle gestures don’t work, then tell the person directly something similar to: ""Sir/ma'am, can you please talk a bit lower on your phone?""

, Sometimes simply asking someone to talk more quietly isn't enough, but if you ask the caller to take the conversation elsewhere, then you can give the caller a way out. If you're in a public space with alternative rooms like a movie theater with a lobby or doctor's office with a coat room--then suggest the loud caller move there. You can also offer alternative timing. This is a bit easier if it's a person you know talking loudly that is more willing to wait at your insistence, but it could work on a stranger. You can also try striking up a different conversation with the caller.For example you could say: ""Sir/ma'am, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation, could you please take it into the lobby?""
You also could ask something to the effect of: ""Sir/ma'am, could you wait until after the movie is over to continue your conversation?"" or ""Perhaps that can wait until after dinner?""
If you are in a restaurant you might try interrupting the caller’s loud call by asking something such as: ""What's good on the menu here?""

, If you are in a public space, then you may have the benefit of official help from staff attached to the business, restaurant, hotel, or whatever establishment you are in. This is also a good step to take if the isolation step showed the person to be excessively stubborn or hostile. Look for uniformed staff or security associated with the business. Let the official staff/security or even a manager know about the loud caller. If the caller has proven to be rude or hostile, then you should let this staff member know as well. Identify the offending caller clearly to the staff, and then let them handle it. If for some reason the caller repeats the offense, then you should consider asking a higher ranked staff member or manager. Also file an official complaint with the business office.You can say to a cafe manager something such as: ""I've been sitting in the corner booth having a coffee, and the gentleman in the hat at the next table has been loudly yelling in his cell phone for ten minutes. Can you please do something?""

, If the caller is frequently getting loud again, then you may need to take more aggressive action. Repeat the isolation and direct asking steps if possible. This will ideally preserve your congeniality with the coworker is repeatedly getting loud on the phone. If the loud talker continues to return to a higher volume, then what you do will depend on where you are. If you are with a coworker on the job you may need to ask a supervisor for intervention if the loud talking is interfering with work., If you are at home, and have a third family member or friend available, ask for the third party’s assistance in convincing the loud talker to quiet down. Repeat the isolation and direct asking steps if possible. If not, use the relocation options. In the case of a public scene you should remind your friend, or family member of where they are. Be prepared to leave the location and let the loud talker know that you are going to leave if the caller won’t quiet down."

Deep breaths should come from your diaphragm. Place a hand on your stomach and feel it expand when you breathe in and contract when you breathe out.
If taking a deep breath doesn’t help, count to five.
You might also clench muscle groups for several seconds and then relax. Begin with your shoulders and then work down to your feet.;
, You might be angry, but don’t start threatening the caller or yelling at them.That’s counter-productive and you won’t get helpful information.


Instead say, “You’re calling in a bomb threat? I’m listening.”

, You need to take down as much information as possible from the caller. Reach for nearby notepad or sheet of paper. Grab a pencil or pen.

, If your phone has a display, then write down the number that shows up.The police might be able to trace this number.

, For example, “Monday, March 27, 2017 at 11:44 am.” Do this as soon as possible so that you don’t forget.

, Stay on the line. Hand your colleague a short note asking them to call the police.Write “Bomb threat. Call police now.” Keep it short.

, Avoid talking all over the caller. Let them speak, because they have important information to share.If you have trouble hearing, hand the phone to a coworker so that they can listen to the caller.
Sometimes, when we’re nervous, the blood starts pumping in our ears. It’s okay. Just hand the phone to someone who can calmly listen to the caller.

, The police need to find the bomb, so get its location. Obtain as much detail as possible:building
floor
room
location in room

, Say, “Can you tell me when it will go off?” The police will need this information also. Write down whatever the caller tells you.

, Get some details about the bomb, which the police will find useful. Ask the following questions:“What does the bomb look like?”
“What’s the bomb made out of?”

, Ask the caller, “Why did you place the bomb here?” If they say they didn’t place it, then you can note that information as well.


Many bomb threats are called into religious institutions, such as places of worship or community centers. Be prepared for the caller to use derogatory language. Nevertheless, write down exactly what the caller says.

, “Can you tell me your name?” The caller might give this information, or they might not. It can’t hurt to ask.


Write down whatever they tell you. They might give you a made-up name, like “Avenger of the Night.”

, The caller might withhold helpful information, or they may talk all over you and not let you ask a question. Continue to ask questions anyway. A good technique is to mirror what the caller has just said and then follow up quickly with a question.


For example, you can say, “I definitely hear that you’ve put a bomb in the school. Can you tell me why?”
If the caller refuses to answer, ask again.

, It might be hard to hear background noises while listening to what the caller says at the same time. One good technique: ask a repetitive question. For example, if the caller told you what the bomb was made of, ask “I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you. Can you repeat that?” As they answer, listen carefully to background noises. Note any of the following:music
motor running
animal noises, such as barking
people talking in the background
machinery
street noises
no background noise, clear

coughing

, Some people can give away important information based on their word choice and tone of voice. Note the following:reading from a message
tape-recorded voice
well-spoken
incoherent, mumbling
profane
familiar voice

, Ideally, the caller will be on the phone when the police arrive. Try to keep the caller on the phone for as long as you can.Pretend you can’t hear. Say, “I’m sorry, I have a weak connection. Can you speak up and tell me that again?”This will drag out the conversation.
Play dumb. “I don’t think we have a Room 205. Gina, is there a Room 205 in that building? My cube mate doesn’t think there’s a Room 205. Do you think you put the bomb in a different room?”

, Even if the caller hangs up, you should keep the phone line open. It may still be possible to trace the phone call.Don’t hang up until the police arrive.


If the caller hangs up, note the time.

, If you left something out, it’s best to supplement your notes now while your memory is fresh. You might have noted a background noise that you didn’t write down. Complete your notes soon after the call ends.

, If a coworker didn't call, you should call as soon as the caller hangs up on you. Go to a different phone and call emergency services.


Say, “I just received a bomb threat. I’m at the Outer Borough Memorial Hospital. What would you like me to do?”
Answer any questions the police have. You may need to read your notes to them.

, If people are located where the bomb has been placed, then you should evacuate the area according to your organization’s policies. Make sure the evacuation route does not take people past the location of the bomb.Alert your supervisor, if necessary, so that they can trigger the evacuation.
Don’t go looking for the bomb yourself. Now is not the time for heroics, and you don’t know how to defuse a bomb anyhow.

In most situations, you can simply wait for your caller to pause between sentences and state that you must end your conversation.,
A caller that does not respond to normal etiquette may be more difficult to handle in a polite manner.",How to Finish a Phone Conversation Without Being Rude," Then both parties can politely end their thoughts, say good-bye and disconnect.;
,


When you begin a phone conversation with someone likely to keep you on too long, set a limit. ""I can only talk for 15 minutes.""
When you get close to the end of the conversation, give a small warning, ""I only have 3 more minutes.""
When you have reached the end of the conversation, respectfully excuse yourself and hang up, by saying something along the lines of ""Sorry, but I gotta go. See you later.""

Actively listen.,
Allow the client to express their opinions.,
Maintain your personal integrity at all times.,
Be sympathetic.,
Be empathetic.,
Ask questions.,
Move into solution-mode - know when to ask open-ended questions, and when to stick with ""yes"" or ""no"" questions.

,
Apologize when appropriate.,
Offer to try to fix the problem.,
Gain agreement on your resolution.,
Write a clear, concise log of the incident.",How to Handle an Irate Customer on the Phone," Let the angry client talk through their problems and get it all out of their system. As they talk make indications that you are listening such as ""uh huh"", ""really?"", etc.. This step is important because the more time a customer spends airing their grievances, the more time they have to calm down.;
, Allow them to communicate their feelings however they choose to without passing judgement. Step in only if the client becomes directly abusive towards you.

, If the customer is abusive, calmly interject something to the effect of ""I appreciate your frustration with the situation however attacking me will not improve anything - I would like to help you.""

, Make sure the customer knows that you understand their frustration and acknowledge any mistakes that have been made. Recognize the customer's feelings about the mistakes - that is, how it must have felt to be the customer in this situation.

, When appropriate, show empathy. Empathy implies that you feel the same way as the customer and truly understand their feelings. It can create further issues to say ""I understand your anger"" if you do not truly understand, as the customer may shoot back ""You have no idea!"". Using a phrase like ""I can imagine how upsetting that must have been"" is a better way to phrase this.

, After they complete their story, ask about the facts and details of the matter at hand.

,, Apologies can often be interpreted as an admittance of guilt. There are three types of apologies that can be employed in these situations, choose the most appropriate:


Direct: ""I apologize that we did not send your order on time.""
Blameless: ""I apologize for the fact you are frustrated - let's see if we cannot turn this around.""
Fake: ""It sounds like we owe you an apology.""

Many customers interpret this to be an apology when in fact none is ever made.



, Never promise to outright fix the issue, but always promise to try. If you make an attempt and fail, it will create further issues if you promised total resolution.

, Make sure your client understands what has been done at the end of the call. Even if the issue is not totally resolved, gain agreement on the resolution that was reached.


Example 1 (total resolution): ""So just to confirm, I have walked you though reinstalling your application and now everything works - correct?""
Example 2 (pending resolution): ""So just to confirm, we have decided that your toaster is in need of a repair under warranty and I am sending you a box for you to ship it back to us - correct?""

, Document (in detail) every major point of the call. It is not important to note every single word uttered, but keep a point-form log of anything that may assist others who deal with the customer in the future.

Adjust phone volume settings.,
Ask the other caller for location information.,
Request if you can reschedule the call.,
Use the privacy factor.,
Ask the caller to stop talking loudly more directly.",How to Get Someone to Stop Talking Loudly on Their Phone2," You want to be sure your own phone volume settings aren't the problem. Make sure the other caller's settings aren't the problem either. See if your handset volume setting is too high and adjust accordingly. Ask the caller on the other end if the caller’s handset volume is too low and resulting in over compensating by speaking louder.


Most phones have these settings on the settings section of the caller’s apps menu if it's a cell phone. If it's a landline, then these settings may be a physical button on the handset, but could also be a menu setting. Check the phone's instructions if you are unsure.

, This is a good way to remind the loud caller of the caller’s own surroundings while working it into the normal flow of the conversation. Ask if the caller is in a noisy place like a restaurant, bar, airport, or similar. If the caller is in a loud establishment, then ask if the call can be handled in a a quieter place nearby such as a lobby or office. If moving isn’t an option, then you might need to adjust your own phone volume to compensate., This can mean moving the call to another place and/or time. If you or the loud caller talking to you are at dinner or a movie, then you can ask to postpone the call until later. You can use moving your own location as a way to quiet things down. Ask the caller to wait until you've moved into a lobby or another office before resuming the caller’s call. This can be a reminder for the caller to reduce volume.This should be asked simply as: ""Can I call you back, or you call me back in a couple of hours?"" or something similar.
You could also say, ""Wait a moment until I've gone into the next empty office."" Follow up by saying something such as, ""Ok, you can talk again....lower please.""

, Calls typically are private matters. The caller may reduce volume upon realizing their own loud voice is violating privacy. Let the loud caller on the other end know that either you are in a public space or issue a reminder about being in a public space. This also works if you are in a private dwelling with close by neighbors--such as an apartment building.You can say something such as: ""Do you want the neighbors to hear what we're saying? Speak lower.""
If both of you are in private dwellings without neighbors in adjacent spaces, then this step will not work.

, This could be interpreted as rude so there is a risk of confrontation with the caller on the other end. This is a last resort when the other methods aren't working or practical to use. This can bring about several responses including the loud caller agreeing to continue the conversation at a lower volume, the caller ignoring you with continued loud talking, or taking offense. If the caller is offended you may receive an insult in response or the caller may just end the call. If the caller ignores you, then you can try repeating your efforts to ask the caller to reduce talking volume or attempt the other steps again. But this increases the risk of offending them.


Simply say something to the effect of: ""Stop talking so loudly."" or ""Talk more quietly.""

Set up a signal between you and the caller.,
Ask the caller to leave.,
Interfere with a coworker’s recurring loud talking.,
Remind coworkers to control their volume.,
Soundproof the office.,
Wear headphones.",How to Get Someone to Stop Talking Loudly on Their Phone3," This can be a word, hand signal, or similar message. There are a lot of choices here, but you want something visible and quick that the loud talking coworker will understand means “quiet down.” You can prepare the caller beforehand by letting the caller know about frequent loud calls that disturb you and others in the office, then set up the signal


You could say, “You make a lot of loud calls. How about I wave a hand in front of you and you can quiet down some?” or “I can clear my throat and send you a text message.”

, This is similar to earlier steps in that you are getting the ongoing offender to take their loud call elsewhere. If you have a multi-line phone you may be able to reduce volume on the line itself. This is a limited option depending on the model of phone.


Tell the caller something such as, “Can you take the call in another office?” Do this each time the caller makes make a loud call.
You can consider making this an automatic request by asking the caller something to the effect of, “Could you make all of your calls in the empty corner office?”

, This may be a verbal or physical intervention. During the coworker’s loud calls you can try physically walking into the office or cubicle to get the caller’s attention. Let the caller know about reducing call volume at the time. You can also place a hand on loud talker’s phone or handset without interfering with any buttons. Never disconnect the call. However, the physical contact can begin to communicate to the caller that you want a lower talking volume.


Say something such as, “You are disturbing the others around you. Talk lower please.”

, This can be preventative as much as action taken when the call is made. Politely let the loud calling coworker know to keep a call’s to a normal volume before a call is made. Make a point of showing the caller what the proximity is to your workspace, and other offices. Also remark on the loud call’s impact on productivity.

, This can take more effort, but once in place it may solve the problem for a while to come.You’ll need to add foam and plastic to the walls and windows of your office space to accomplish soundproofing. Adding strips of foam, easily purchased at any hardware store, to cracks in walls and floors will help absorb sound. Put in extensions to walls and paneling where allowed to seal off any gaps. Use plastic sheeting (with sticky backing) on windows to keep out sound without hurting the view.

, This can offer a range of personal solutions to nullify the loud call’s effect on you every time it occurs. You might think about getting noise cancelling headphones. These use sensors to determine the frequency and volume of incoming sound and transmit a counter pulse to neutralize it. You could listen to music you prefer as a distraction to drown out the other person’s call whenever the caller is on the phone.

Dial the international exit code for the USA.,
Dial the country code.,
Dial the number four.,
Dial the mobile phone number.",How to Call Australia from the USA2," The process of calling a cellphone is highly similar to the process of calling a landline phone. You would again start by dialing the international exit code for the US, which is 011., From there, dial Australia's country code. This signals the call should be directed to Australia. The country code for Australia is ""61."", The number ""4"" indicates you are calling a cellphone. You need to dial the number ""4"" if the number you're trying to reach is not a landline., From here, you can dial the phone number. As with a landline, ignore the number ""0"" before a phone number. This is a trunk code, which is only necessary for national calls.To review, to call a cell phone in Australia you would dial ""011-61-4"" followed by the cell phone number.

Go for a cheap subscription service.,
Use something free, like Skype.,
Try a Google voice account.",How to Call Australia from the USA3," There are many online calling services you can install that only cost a small subscription. These services may be cheaper and easier than making international phone calls, and may be worth the money if you must frequently phone Australia.Many of these services require a small attachment for your computer. YMax magicJack, for example, comes with a small attachment that must be plugged into a laptop's USB port.
Usually, you must purchase the software for a fee. Some fees are as low as $40, while others are as high as $250. Once you purchase the software, however, rates are fairly low. Some services only have a yearly subscription fee, which can be as low as $320.

, Skype is free, as long as you sign up for an account, and can easily be used to make international calls. As long as the party you're trying to reach has Skype, this can be a free alternative to calling. Also, you will need to make sure your computer has speakers and a microphone. Many computers have these things built in.Log into Skype, click on ""contacts,"" and then double click the party you wish to call.
There are two icons, one of which looks like a phone. You should press this button, which will allow you to make a voice call.
Skype also allows you to call multiple people at once if you need to do something like a conference call for work.

, Google voice is free to use, but international calls do cost money. However, rates tend to be much cheaper than they are for international calls, and adding credit to your account is fairly simple. You just log into your Google voice account, and click ""Calling credit"" and add credit if necessary.You can make an international call by clicking ""call"" on your Google voice account. You would then enter the number as you would normally enter an international number, including things like the calling code.
Keep time in mind, as Google calls are not free. While rates are cheaper, you still to make sure you do not let the call go on too long.

Buy an international calling card.,
Scrutinize international calling plans carefully before signing up.,
Consider alternatives to calling.",How to Call Australia from the USA4," International calls can get expensive, especially if you have to make them frequently. You can save some money by investing in an international calling card online or from your phone provider.With a calling card, you pre-pay for the minutes. This can stop you from receiving high fees as you'll have to make sure you do not let calls run too long.
However, read calling card contracts closely. Some have a variety of hidden fees, and you can rack up extra fees fast. You do not want to end up spending the same amount, or more, on a calling card.

, If you need to make calls to Australia frequently, an international calling plan can help. Your service provider may offer a discount or specialized plan, depending on your services.A country specific calling plan is best. If your calling plan assures you can make calls only to Australia, it may not cost as much as a general international calling plan. If you only make calls to Australia, you will not need to pay for other services.
As with a calling card, be wary of hidden fees. Read any contract you sign closely and scan it for any fees that look suspicious or extravagant.

, If calling is getting expensive, look into alternatives. There are other ways to communicate besides over the phone.


Use social media to your advantage. Add international friends to social media accounts and communicate with them via things like Facebook and Twitter.
You can also email. You can agree to email back and forth with a friend to update him or her on your life. This can be a free way to stay in touch with a long distance friend.

Type the number into a search engine.,
Enter the number into Facebook.,
Use a reverse phone lookup site.",How to Look Up an Unknown Number1," If the unknown number if from a large establishment, it may come up in a search. The first thing you should do with an unknown number is type it into a search engine and see if it yields any recognizable results. You may find that a local companies and large business, such as your bank, was trying to contact you.;
, If you're on Facebook, you may actually be able to use it to use this to identify an unknown caller. Simply type the number into Facebook's search bar. You may find a profile linked to the number online.Keep in mind, this does not always work as some people's privacy settings prevent their numbers from being linked to their profile.

, If you type ""reverse phone lookup"" into a search engine, you should find plenty of sites that allow you to type a phone number in to identify the caller. Try a few of these sites to see if any of them yield helpful results.Reliable sites include sites like White Pages, Reverse Phone Lookup, and AnyWho.Some sites may not be able to give you the exact name of the caller, but can provide you with a general location of the caller. This can help narrow it down. For example, if you know a classmate of your lives in a particular neighborhood in the city, the number may be linked to that area. If you recently gave that person your number, they may be calling you.

Save every incoming number even if you must save it as ""Don't answer"".,
Be honest.,
Consider you may just be in a non-talking mood.,
Give older family or friends respect and the benefit of the doubt before dismissing a call.,

Since everyone is bored sometimes you should try to indulge them for at least a few moments. Try to think of why the person calls you and insist for speaking too long. Do you not talk often? Are they lonely?

, If you prefer not to talk on the phone, tell people. Just be polite and don't use excuse for select people who may get their feelings hurt. It is also not advised when you are young and speaking with your parents.


Being rude isn't generally necessary.

, Don't be rude to a friend. You may regret it later.

, They could be calling about an emergency.

, If they happen to call the other person or discuss it later you'll get caught in a lie.

,, Just say, ""Take me off your call list"", and hang up. Don't give out information about your family, parents or household.

Check the time difference.,
Dial the exit code of the country which you are calling from.,
Dial 971, the country code for the United Arab Emirates.,
Check the phone number before continuing.,
If the number is a landline, dial 4, then the last seven digits of the number.,
If the number is a mobile number, dial the last nine digits of the number.",How to Call Dubai," Dubai operates on Gulf Standard Time, which is UTC + 4.Its current local time can easily be checked online, so you can be sure to call during business hours, or while residents are awake.


Dubai is is four hours ahead of London, and nine hours ahead of New York. It does not observe daylight savings time, so during summer it is three hours ahead of London and eight hours ahead of New York.;
, This is also known as the international access code, which should be dialed before each overseas call. This exit code differs from country to country.


When dialing from the United States, Canada, or most of the Caribbean, use the exit code 011.
From Russia, or from formerly Soviet Central Asian nations, dial 8, wait for the dial tone to change, then dial 10.
From Brazil, Chile, Colombia, or Indonesia, look up the code for the international phone carrier you are using.
For countries not listed above, try 00 or look up your country's exit code.

, Next, dial the code that directs your phone call to the United Arab Emirates, the nation in which Dubai is located.

, After this point, the process varies slightly depending on whether the number you are calling is a landline or a mobile number. Fortunately, it should be easy to test this just by looking at the number:


If the number is seven digits long (xxx-xxxx), it is probably a landline.
If the number is nine or ten digits long, the area code may be included. If it begins with a 5 or a 05 (05x-xxx-xxxx), it is a mobile number. If it begins with a 4 or a 04 (04x-xxx-xxxx), it is a landline.
If the number is longer, it probably includes the country code, 971, which you have already dialed. Look at the rest of the number after the country code, and follow the instructions above to determine what type of phone it is.

, The number 4 is the area code for landlines in Dubai. After entering it, complete the call by dialing the last seven digits of the number you are trying to reach. You should hear the phone ring soon.


Do not dial more than the last seven digits, even if you see a digit that has not been covered above. There may be a 0 in front of the area code, which is only used when calling from within Dubai.

, Instead of the Dubai area code, a mobile phone will have its own two-digit code preceding its seven digits. Dial all nine digits, then wait for the call to go through.


The two digit code will typically be 50, 55, or 56, depending on the mobile phone operator (55 for Du, 50 or 56 for Etisalat)."

Focus the conversation.,
Wait for a lull.,
Interrupt.,
Give a time warning.,
Apologize.,
Affirm your enjoyment.,
Plan to talk again.,
Suggest an alternate way to communicate.,
Call between activities.,
Be conscious of their schedule.,
Return their call.,
Make a list.",How to End a Phone Call With a Talkative Person," When you are near the end of your phone call, be sure that you are not inviting the other person to continue talking. For instance, you might be really interested in something they just told you, but asking a question in response invites the other person to continue talking.For example, your mom might have just told you some juicy gossip. Instead of asking an open-ended question (such as, “How did you hear about that?!), make a statement (e.g., “Well, you can’t believe everything you hear.”). A statement works to close that conversation so that you can move on to other topics that you need to discuss or shift the conversation to a close.
If you are on a business call and need to redirect the conversation, respond to what the other person has said with a statement and an indication that what they have just said is also important to you. Then immediately introduce the topic you need to address. For instance, you could say, “Thank you for alerting me to the issue with payroll. I will address that with our office manager as soon as I get off the phone, but I did want to discuss the progress on the quarterly report.”;
, All conversations have pauses. Wait for the speaker to pause, and explain that you need to get off the phone.Do not pause when you are taking advantage of the lull. Otherwise, the person on the other end of the phone might begin telling you a new story. In this case, tell the person that you have enjoyed talking with them, that you will call again soon, and goodbye immediately one after the other. Do not prolong the goodbye.

, Although we typically see interruption as a rude behavior, you can interrupt someone politely!Interrupt when it is your only possibility, and always apologize for doing so. You could, for instance, interrupt when a pressing task or emergency arises while you are on the phone. Alternately, you can interrupt when you have a specific time limit that you have already clarified.
Maybe you are on a business call, but someone has just come into your office or you have a scheduled meeting. Let the person on the other end of the call know your situation and tell them when you will call again to finish your discussion.
If you have an emergency, explain it briefly: “I’m so sorry to interrupt, but my dog just threw up. I need to check on him.”
If you need to stick to your already specified time limit, remind them of your constraints: “I’m so sorry to interrupt, but my break is over now and I need to get back to work.”

, Letting the other person know your time limit will help you avoid an awkward or rude goodbye. Tell the other person when you have five or ten minutes left to talk. If they need to ask you a specific question or tell you something important, a time warning will remind them to focus their end of the conversation.


Alternately, a time warning can be a way for you to transition into a last question or topic. After the other person has responded, thank them for their time and end the conversation.
For business calls, a time warning can help you redirect the conversation and prioritize what you need to discuss with the other person. You can say, for instance, “I only have five more minutes before my next meeting, but I wanted to ask if you are on track with the quarterly report.” Once the other person responds, you can thank them and tell them that you are looking forward to reviewing the report soon.

, If you needed to end the conversation abruptly, be sure to say you are sorry. Explain that you wish you could keep talking, but that you need to address the emergency situation that occurred while on the phone.

, Be sure to tell the other person that you had a nice time catching up and that you appreciate them taking the time to talk to you. In this way, you are reinforcing that they are important to you.

, If you are talking to a close friend or family member, setting aside a time to talk in the near future will help you end the conversation more quickly. The other person will know they can tell you the other things they wanted to say soon and won’t feel that they need to extend the conversation by telling you everything all at once.


Asking the other person when a good time to call again is might lead to a prolonged phone call. Instead, tell them you will text or email to see when they are available to chat next week.
Alternately, if you don’t know when you can talk again, suggest a vague time frame. Say, for example, “I’ll call again later this week or over the weekend.”
If the person is someone you don’t talk to on a regular basis, say something like: “We should do this again soon!” By doing so, you suggest that you’d like to keep in touch, but you don’t limit yourself to a particular timeline.

, If you don’t like to talk on the phone, mention that you would like to Skype, text, or email to stay in contact.


For business contacts that tend to be longwinded, you might tell the other person that you are able to respond more quickly by email rather than by phone. The other person may be more likely to email if they are responding to an email you have sent, rather than initiating the first email in the thread. Email them a follow up to your phone conversation later that same day, and encourage them to respond via email.
Sometimes, personal phone conversations are prolonged because the other person feels that they need to fill you in on everything that has been going on since you last talked. If you keep in contact through social media (such as facebook), text messages, or emails, they will feel less pressured to spend a long time on the phone catching up.
Tell the other person that you will text or email pictures of something you told them about on the phone. You will be prolonging communication, but doing so in your own timeframe. Texting or emailing as a follow up to the conversation can also open a new method of communication.

, If you know the person you want to call is usually very talkative, call between scheduled appointments, meetings, or activities. You can say that you only have ten minutes to talk, but really wanted to call while you could. Tell your friend or family member your time constraints at the beginning of the conversation so that they know your situation.


Often, talkative people want to tell you “one more thing” when you are trying to finish your conversation. By telling your conversation partner that you have only a few minutes to chat, this will help them prioritize the most important things they want to tell you.

, Consider your friend or family member’s regular routine. If you know they eat at a certain time and won’t have an unlimited amount of gab time, call then. You can, for instance, call on their lunch break or before they usually eat dinner. That way, the pressure to end the conversation is on the other person (not you).


Show consideration for the other person’s schedule. When you call, say something like: “I know you are on your lunch break. I just wanted to call and chat for a few if you have time.”

, If they call you, and you don’t have time to talk on the phone for an hour or so, don’t answer. Be sure, though, to call them back the same day so that they don’t think you are avoiding them.


Be honest and explain why you weren’t able to answer their call. Maybe you were in the middle of working on a project, at the gym, or finishing homework, et cetera. Tell them you are sorry you missed their call.
Call when you do have ample time to chat so that your friend or family member does not think you are being dismissive. You want to affirm that you respect and care about what they have to tell you. By not answering the original call and calling them back, you indicate that you now have time to give them your full attention.
If you know you don’t have time later that day either, answer the original call. First, ask them what is going on; they might have an emergency or some important news they need to share. If they called instead to chat, simply tell the caller what you are doing and that you have a busy day ahead. Ask if you can call them back later in the week when you have more time.

, If you are calling a talkative person for a specific reason, jot down what you need to tell them or ask them before you call. This will help you keep the conversation on track.Jotting down a list of topics you want to discuss will remind you what you wanted to tell the other person if your conversation gets sidetracked. If you can, try to shift the conversation back to one of the topics on your list by connecting it to what the other person has told you: “Oh, that reminds me! I really wanted to tell you about what happened yesterday!”

Know on what terms you are with the person you want to call.,
Decide on the reason you want to call them up for.,
Don't wait too much.",How to Decide Whether to Call Someone," Your relationship with that person is very important in order to make up your mind.


If you don't get along too well with the person, probably you would feel less tempted to call that person up, while they wouldn't really enjoy hearing from you. Don't call them, unless you have something important to talk about with them. Calling them just to chat or to find out something you can find out from tens of other people is inappropriate.
If you're just acquaintances, a phone call wouldn't make any harm, would it? However, in case the person is somehow superior to you (older than you, in a more important function than you or otherwise superior), be respectful and polite.
If you're bosom buddies, you can call them anywhere, anytime! Or at least you're supposed to be able to; some people don't accept this even from their closest friends.;
, If you're thinking about calling them up, you must have a reason.


When calling just to chat, there are a few phone etiquette rules you must know. It is impolite to call someone up before 08:00 in the morning (although this hour depends on the person's daily routine) and after 21:00 in the evening- unless it's something urgent, which is not the case. Also, it would pay to be aware of the person's agenda- know when they are at home and when they aren't. Make sure that the person isn't in the middle of something important when calling them just to chat, otherwise it may be very annoying. Leave a message if you're not sure of that. Also make sure you don't call that person just to chat if you're not on friendly terms with them.
When you have to tell someone a relatively important issue, but one that can wait, just call or leave a message; unlike when calling someone just to chat, it doesn't matter on what terms you are with that person.
When calling to make an invitation, prepare a little speech before, so that you don't forget to mention any important things about the time and place you want to meet that person. Especially if you want to call someone that usually makes you feel a bit nervous, like your crush or your boss, a speech is important.
If you have to tell that person something urgent, ignore all rules- phone etiquette doesn't matter now. Just do it.
If you're angry and just want to call that person to insult them, to make them feel bad or to fight with them, hold it right there. Don't. Take a deep breath, calm down, count up to 10, then think about it again. Would your phone call be productive for your relationship with that person? Probably not.
If you have the bad habit of calling someone up just to talk, talk, and talk until you drive them crazy, put the phone down and do something else. Some of us often feel tempted to call people up just to talk out every little thing that happened to us, but remember this is often very annoying for the ""victim"", unless the person you want to call is someone who enjoys listening as much as you enjoy talking.

, If you think too much about it, you may give up and come to the conclusion you'd better not call them up. If you can't find any logical reasons for not calling them, you may miss an interesting conversation. Who knows?

Download phone apps.,
Install a CallerID app.",How to Look Up an Unknown Number2," If you have downloaded the Facebook application on your mobile phone, you can use this to identify an unknown number.

Avoid answering calls from numbers you do not recognize.,
Read privacy policies of phone apps carefully.,

Abusive phone calls are not usually stopped by ignoring them. Even if people calling may only want a response, they likely will not quit if you simply ignore them.Even if you're not ignoring the abusive phone calls, that does not mean you have to engage with the calls. You can simply write down the calls and report them to the appropriate authorities.

, If you're receiving abusive phone calls or text messages, it's important to tell someone. Receiving abusive calls or texts is a big problem that you should not keep to yourself.Your teachers and principals need to know if any abusive texts are happening at school. They want everyone to feel safe and comfortable at school.
Abusive text messages can be a big problem for teens. Since the people sending the messages don't see the person they're abusing, they can often be even more vicious and mean., Your parents need to know if you are getting abusive phone calls or text messages.

Introduce yourself and politely ask for the caller’s identity.,
Talk politely.,
Invoke memorable imagery in your conversation.,
Ask for follow-up plans.,
Talk about personal interests.",How to Call Someone You Don't Know Very Well or at All1," You want to establish your identity and intentions to the unknown caller without giving too much information, but you also want to put them at ease. However, you also need to confirm who they are whether it’s a business contact or person you met informally at a party.


If you met the person briefly try then you can introduce yourself by describing those circumstances. If you encounter a secretary or some other agent first then you might mention these circumstances so they can pass that along to the target person.
For example, you can call and ask ""I met Mr. Doe at yesterday's business luncheon and would like to speak with him again."" Or if you get the person directly say, ""Hello Ms. Jane, I met you at the lecture on the way out and would like to speak with you further.""
If you are calling someone you didn't meet then use what you can learn in context. For example, if you are calling someone at an electronics department store you might start by telling the receiving caller: ""Hello, I am interested in your latest deals on blu-ray players.""
Or if you are calling a professional at their home, a professor from your university but not one you have a class with, you can try something such as: ""Hello Dr. John, I attend the State University and would like to consult with you on a matter.""
Upon calling someone you met in an informal setting you should still use your first name, but perhaps without titles.;
, You don't want to offend a stranger by being rude or wasting their time. So be courteous while in conversation and when scheduling calls and return calls.Call during the day--preferably around the middle of the afternoon or early evening.
Try not to make a call during nighttime or dawn when you are likely to disturb a person's sleep and/or morning routine.
Pay attention to any specified hours the caller may leave in automated messages or credentials.

, You don't want this to be the last call to the person whether you know them only a little or not at all. But you also want however they remember you to be positive.Use language that evokes the senses such as visual imagery or describes vivid events. However, you don't want to be crude.
For example, you could be calling a new business contact to help recruit customers for your flower shop. You could start by asking, ""Wouldn't you like your clientele to invest in the smell of roses, and see the color of lilacs?""
You could be calling a person you met at a bar and want to describe how you met by reminding them of the “smell of alcohol” or “smoky atmosphere.”

, Give the receiving caller something to look forward to. This is good to establish a longer lasting professional or personal contact if you don't know them very well or at all.Set up a time to call your new contact perhaps even at regular intervals to keep the relationship going.
Do this early, but once you have a conversation going when you can find a convenient break point.
For example, you could be talking for a few minutes about your respective professional interests, and then say: ""Oh by the way, I would like to set up a business call again next week."" Proceed accordingly.
For a personal call you could try waiting until you’ve established a rapport with the caller before asking them for further contact. See the later section on personal calls.

, This involves listening at least as much as talking.Ask light personal questions, but don't pry. For example, you can start with some simple domestic questions such as ""How is your family"" or ""I see you like the local sports team."" In a personal setting you can ask about common interests.
Taking some interest in the contact personally without pushing to the point of making them feel like you are violating their privacy is a good way to run the first few calls.

Check with your telephone service provider to see their procedure., If you have a ""trap"" applied to your phone , incoming phone calls will be tracked back to their real destinations (not the fictitious tracking information that robocalls provide on caller ID) and can be blocked in the future. Trap lines are now offered by private companies and many telephone service providers., While many people know of the national Do Not Call list, private companies are also mandated to remove anyone who asks from their call lists. As with the national Do Not Call registry, your request must be renewed every five years., If your phone company has failed to protect you from unwanted calls so far, ask to be put in touch with their Annoyance Desk/Annoyance Department the next time you talk to one of their representatives. Most companies have a such special group, and usually they largely deals with harassing calls.

Emergency numbers include parent's cell phone number, a trusted neighbor, a nearby relative, etc. It's best to memorize them, but you should also write them down and post them near the phone or on the refrigerator for quick access. If you need to, call these numbers. If you're scared, call these numbers. Be safe, not sorry. You should also learn to dial 911 in case a serious emergency occurs.;
, In order to stay out of trouble, follow their orders and don't answer the phone if they instruct you not to. This will prevent you from getting into danger, as some people may try to extract important information from you. Giving away any personal details, such as your address, age, etc. is dangerous and unwise. Follow your parents' wishes for the sake of your safety.

, If your phone has one, it's wise to check it before making any decisions. A caller ID shows you who is calling, which can help you decide whether to answer the phone or not. You should not answer the phone if you don't recognize the caller ID. However, if you do answer the phone, just check and say ""Hello, who is this?"". If they say something weird or creepy, then get off of the phone right away and notify your parents immediately.


Avoid answering any 1-800 numbers. These are most likely scams calling and attempting to convince you to purchase one of their products. They may ask for personal information, so it's better to leave their calls unanswered. If you must, you can tell them not to call you again or you will call the cops because some are persistent to the point where it can be considered harassment.

, If you choose to take the call, press the ""talk"" button or pick up the handset, which will connect you to the caller. Be sure to answer with a polite tone. You can greet the caller using a phrase an adult has instructed you to say (ex: ""Hello? This is (your name).""). However, if you don't recognize the caller ID, avoid giving away your name or information when you first answer the phone. Simply answer, ""Hello?"" to protect your privacy.


Other phrases you could greet callers with are ""(Last name) Residence, (your name) speaking"" or ""Good afternoon, (your name) speaking."" Be sure to talk to an adult about which one is best to use.
If the caller informs you that they're coming over to fix something, tell them, ""Mr./Mrs. (last name) will have to call you back about that."" Then, hang up and immediately call one of the emergency numbers. Tell them that someone called and said they were coming over.

, If they ask to talk to your parents, don't tell them that you're home alone, as this puts you at risk. Instead, tell them, ""I'm sorry, it is inconvenient for Mr./Mrs.(insert last name) to speak with you at this time. May I take a message?""

, Even if you recognize the number that is calling, it is important to be aware of who you are speaking with. The response of the caller should directly impact how you reply, whether to carry out a conversation, or to hang up. If they refuse to give their name or sound suspicious in any way, you may want to hang up and ignore their calls. Although it may seem like you're being paranoid, your safety should come first.

, That way, before disconnecting the call, you can take down information or messages that they would like to share with you. You might say, ""May I take a message?"" Write down all the details you can, including the caller ID and phone number if possible. You can give it to your parents once they return home.

, Avoid giving out any personal details about being home alone, your age, where you hang out, where your parents work, or any other identifiable information. This puts you and your family at risk, and you're only supplying the caller with information that they may take advantage of. You can however say, ""I'm sorry, but the person you are looking for isn't available to take your call. Can I take a message and have them call you back later?""

, If the caller continues demanding that you hand the phone to your parents, tell them, ""Okay, one moment; I'll get them."" Then, hang up and ignore any further calls from them. When your parents arrive home, inform them about the situation. There may be a way for them to check the phone, and if they know the caller, they can call back and talk to them. You should also hang up the phone if the caller keeps asking you personal questions. If they continue pursuing answers despite your protests, immediately disconnect the call and don't answer if they call back.


It's best to hang up if you feel unsafe or suspicious about the caller.

, If a wrong number calls, don't hang up without saying anything, as they may call back. Say, ""Hello?"" and they may tell you who they are looking for. If you don't recognize the name of the person they're looking for, say, ""I'm sorry but I think you have the wrong number"" and hang up.

, Simply let it go to voicemail. Then, when you have the chance, check your voicemail to see what they want. If it is a true emergency, call them back; if not, wait until someone else is at home with you.

, If you have caller ID, this is your first indication. If not, listen for the caller's identification. You may have to prompt the caller and ask for their name in order to make sure you know who you're speaking with.


If the caller does not identify themselves, consider hanging up. If it really matters, they'll call back and identify themselves because they'll realize that they didn't come across properly with the first call.

, Have a line that makes it sound as if you're not the only person at home. For example, you could say, ""Hello, to whom do you wish to speak?"" if you don't know who is calling you. You can determine from their response whether or not the call is worth proceeding with.

, You also have the power to reveal nothing at all, so don't be persuaded to say things to this caller that you don't feel comfortable sharing or explaining. If you don't know them, then it's none of their business. It's best to keep personal information to yourself, especially if you're uncertain of their identity or intentions.

, When answering the phone, simply greet them with a ""Hello?"" With this introduction, you can keep your identity a secret and require them to tell you theirs. Sometimes, you may get a caller who won't tell you who they are until you identify yourself. Understand that the person who called - and not the person who answers the phone - must identify themselves first. You may want to consider hanging up if they refuse to tell you who they are.

, This depends on your comfort level after getting the information. After the caller has identified themselves, you have the option to (a) acknowledge yourself, (b) gather more information about the caller without identifying yourself, or (c) just hang up.

Call the person on their business or work line.,
Exchange credentials.,
Tell your contact your intentions and needs accurately.,
Talk about personal links to your business contact.,
Terminate the call with reminders and politely.",How to Call Someone You Don't Know Very Well or at All2," Make sure you have prepared information on how you first met the person if it's someone you didn't know well. If it's someone new then think about what their formal position is.


For example, you could be talking to a customer service agent for help with a recent purchase.

, Allow the receiver to identify themselves as official representatives of the company. They may ask you for identifying information including name, address, account numbers, and so on.


Be wary about exchanging your social security number. Most companies only ask for the last four digits, or offer alternative means to identify you. If neither is the case, and you have confirmed the identity of the receiver, you can consider risking giving this information out. But you should strongly think about finding more secure means to do this.
You may exchange pleasantries and small talk to let the conversation become more comfortable. The agent could say something like, “I hope you are having a good morning. It’s nice weather we’re having?”

, You want to make it clear to your contact what you need from them in an efficient manner.


If you have a lot of details then ask them to have a way of recording them ready as a courtesy. This can be as simple as asking them if they have “pen and paper” ready.
If you have a more elaborate proposal then this is a good time to make further plans for contact. Introduce the plan and offer the receiver an opportunity to get to know you and your proposal better. You could say something such as: “I have a plan for a new shopping mall let’s discuss the details over lunch.” Or if they don’t want to meet in person just yet you can say: “How about we schedule a conference call later in the week?”

, This can help relationships between companies. If you call a new contact and the both of you establish at least a small personal interest then conversations can proceed more smoothly.


Ask them about their location’s interests such as sports teams or attractions. For example you might call a contact you don’t know very well in Kansas City and ask: “How are the Royals this year?”
You can ask about the new contact’s personal life, but don’t press this too far and violate their privacy. For example you can ask “How are your kids these days?” They might tell you their status, but don’t belabor the issue.

, Don’t end the call abruptly or without a proper parting word.


Remind the new contact of what you discussed briefly and of any upcoming plans.
Thank them for their time and give a sign off such as “Goodbye” or “Talk to you again soon” before hanging up.

"
"
Call the person at their residence.,
Talk about common interests.,
Use phone etiquette.,
Invoke imagery to liven up the call.,
Ask for further contact.",How to Call Someone You Don't Know Very Well or at All3," This is a more intimate form of communication than the previous method.After introducing yourself you will want to try some of the memory techniques from the earlier steps if it's someone you know a little.
If you are calling someone you don't know very well then you might try some catching up. Ask, ""It's been a while, do you remember meeting me at graduation?"" or you can substitute some other relevant event.
If you are dealing with someone you don't know at all then think more about why you’re calling them and what you know about their identity. If you know something about their activities or work then those can be clues as to how to start a phone call conversation.
For example, you could call someone you don't know that you found out played high school football in games you had watched. You can start the call by introducing yourself and saying: ""I remember you from the high school playoff game...."" then go on with your conversation.
If there is no connection you can establish then the burden is on you, as the caller, to introduce yourself and your intentions. State your name and what you are calling about quickly to reduce any sense of anxiety the other caller may have. Perhaps say, ""I'm John Doe and I need to ask you a favor regarding the noise level in your house...."" or whatever the reason may be.

, This will help ease communication and reduce any antagonism whether the recipient of your call is someone you know a little or not at all.


For someone you don't know very well you should steer the conversation to common interests in popular culture, literature, food, and so forth. This will extend the conversation and make it more positive. For example, you could ask: ""Do you like sushi?"" or other cuisine. If they agree, this can even be the means to an in-person meeting.
For someone you don't know at all, you can attempt this common interest approach as well. Perhaps after you've made your intentions clear you can then make the conversation friendlier by asking ""So, do you enjoy science fiction movies?"" Depending on the degree of your involvement with the other person this may even lead to an in-person meeting. But don't press.

, Even though this is a casual conversation it doesn't hurt to be polite.You don't need to use formal titles and positions when addressing the recipient in this scenario, but you don't want to use crude nicknames or shorthand. Use their full names unless they suggest otherwise.
Make calls at the same reasonable times you would for a business--late morning or early afternoon. Unless told otherwise.

, Allow this call to be a memorable one through vivid description.Take advantage of visual, auditory, and other sensory descriptors. But don't be crude.
For example, you could be calling someone you don't know very well and recalling for them: ""Remember when you ran into me by those wonderful smelling flowers?""
Although, even a foul smelling memory might help with the call if you can play it off as humorous and say it something like this: ""Remember me? The guy you fell into the puddle of mud with?""

, You don't need to set a hard schedule to meet as you would with a professional contact. But think of ways to keep in touch.


Use the common interests you established earlier to discuss activities you might do together or at least have regular conversations about.
For example, you can have phone conversations about the latest comic books, or exchange recipes.
Be diligent about giving each other new and updated phone numbers if and when they are changed.

Take your number off of all public listings.,
Switch to cellular only.",How to Block People from Calling You on Your Home Phone2," This does not stop businesses you have recent dealings with (including debts and collectors) from calling, nor does it stop not-for-profit organizations. However, if you are plagued by telemarketers, this will significantly reduce your calls. This project is headed by the federal trade commission and located online at www.donotcall.gov . State programs exist as well and you can often join them online too.

, Most phone companies will now let you block all calls that do not display a caller ID number or come through as ""Private."" This will specifically remove a large number of telemarketing calls., Some phones have a feature that will allow you to designate a special ring tone for any specific phone number that might call in. Select a different ring tone than your normal ringtone for their number and when you hear it, lift and lower the receiver quickly. This will keep you from having to speak to them. (or you can let the machine get it.)

, Alternatively, buy a phone made for hearing impaired that features a flashing light (and which can be muted) that alerts you to calls.

, Phone books are a bit out of date, but phone number listings still exist online, and companies capture as many of these as they can. You can tell your phone company that you no longer want your number publicly listed. It should instead be considered a non-published or private number, not even available through directory assistance., Obviously this is a last resort, but it can be highly effective. Most cell phones can be easily set up to block certain callers, and additional apps can be downloaded that will allow you to send all calls from outside your contacts list directly to voice mail. Best of all, the federal government bans all use of automated dialers (the devices used by the vast majority of telemarketing firms) to call cell phones."

Find where you should be speaking from.,
Learn how to breathe from your diaphragm.,
Speak from the diaphragm.,
Keep practicing.",How to Permanently Lower Your Voice1," Your voice will be its most natural and powerful when it comes from the area just behind and around your nose. In order to practice speaking from this place, hum mmm-hmm, as if you were responding to a question affirmatively. Feel the vibration in your face as you hum. This is where you should focus on speaking from., Breathing from your diaphragm as opposed to your chest will make your voice both more powerful and deeper. When you breathe, your stomach should rise, and your chest and shoulders should remain still. These are full, diaphragm breaths., You want your breath to come from your diaphragm, and go out through the part of your face you identified in step one. Practice this often, saying anything you like, but focusing on these two parts of your body. You will notice that you can get more power in your voice with less vocal strain, resulting in a louder, deeper voice., At first, breathing this way will feel unnatural and you'll probably switch back to your normal way of breathing and speaking often. But if you practice for a couple of weeks, as often as you can remember, eventually it will become second nature. Learning to breathe from your diaphragm is one of the easiest ways to naturally improve your voice.

Scream into a pillow.,
Sing karaoke.,
Whisper as much as possible.,
Clear your throat or cough.,
Attend a concert or sports event.",How to Lose Your Voice Fast1," Screaming at the top of your lungs is the most effective way to lose your voice. Find a thick pillow to scream into to muffle the bulk of the noise, preferably when no one else is close enough to hear it and be concerned. Continue until your voice feels raspy, and stop if you experience pain., While professional singers generally warm up their voices before performing, amateur singers have a tendency to wear out their voices by singing too loudly and out of pitch. Spend an evening doing karaoke with friends to enjoy yourself while trying to lose your voice. The act of projecting your voice to fill a room or hall is very likely to cause bruising or swelling of your vocal cords, resulting in temporary laryngitis., While whispering might seem like a method of preserving one's voice, it actually puts much more strain on your vocal chords than speaking normally does. Whispering also has a drying effect that can cause voice loss. Take every opportunity to whisper instead of talking at a regular volume by pretending that you need to be discreet during conversations, or by starting discussions in quiet places (e.g. a library)., Coughing or clearing your throat can put a strain on your larynx, diminishing your voice. Excessive coughing commonly causes laryngitis, either in the short term or long-term. To lose your voice fast, prompt yourself to cough, or clear your voice repetitively until it becomes hoarse and raspy., Lose your voice in a fun way by attending a loud concert or sporting event. Get into the action and cheer, sing along, or scream as much as possible. While losing one's voice is often considered a downside of these fun experiences, it can be seen as a success when that is your ultimate goal.Visiting a dance club, attending a demonstration, or going go karting are also options for loud activities that encourage voice exertion.

Tell a good backstory.,
Use ethos, pathos, and logos.,
Put your request in the right order.,
Don’t ask them to make a decision.,
Speak in the affirmative.",How to Persuade Someone to Do Something1," People are compelled by personal stories. When you ask for something, start at the beginning and tell a coherent narrative. Why are you asking for this? What are the emotional and/or personal elements tied to this need? Sharing this info will significantly up your persuasion points.In general, just tell the truth! You didn't come upon this opportunity or develop this need out of thin air. Tell the story of how you arrived here.
It is OK to add some drama to the story. What obstacles have you overcome? What continues to stand in your way? How has your passion, diligence, or street-smarts allowed you to persevere?;
, According to Aristotle, there are three pillars of rhetorical persuasion. These are ethos (a speaker’s credibility), pathos (emotional appeals), and logos (appeals to logic). When you converse with the person you’re trying to convince, include information about your credibility, provide a logical argument, and find a way to tug at their heartstrings.Explain your credentials. How long have you been working in a given field or researching a particular investment opportunity? This speaks to your ethos.
Lay out what you need logically. How can this be a benefit to them as well as to you? This will be a logos-based argument.
Try to get them emotionally invested. What would it mean to you if they were to help? This is an appeal to pathos.

, Commonly, we have the tendency to try and sweet talk the person we’re requesting something from. Unfortunately, this often has the opposite effect: making your kind words seem disingenuous. Instead, come right out and ask for what you want, and then say a few nice things.Instead of saying: “Hi! I haven’t seen you in so long. Congratulations on everything you’ve been up to! It all looks great. By the way, I am wondering if you would be able to help with a project.”
Try it this way: “Hi! I am wondering to see if you can help me with a project. I haven’t seen you in so long. Congratulations on everything you’ve been up to! It all looks great.”
Using the second format surprisingly makes you seem more sincere.

, Generally speaking, people don’t like to make decisions. Even simple choices can be stressful. So don’t give the person you’re persuading a surplus of options. Simply ask for what you need as directly as possible and make it easy for them to say yes.For example, if you would like someone to help you move into a new apartment, simply tell them the date, the time, and exactly what you need from them.
You may be tempted to offer flexible moving dates, flexible times, or other accommodations, but ironically, these excess decisions are more likely to cause stress and influence them to say no.

, People respond most effectively to declarative, positive statements. Don’t dance around what you want to say. Give clear directions, and provide affirmative statements.Rather than saying, “Don’t hesitate to call me,” you should say, “Give me a call on Friday.”

Turn your shoulders and head to face the other person's eyes.,
Choose a focal point near the eyes.,
Make gentle eye-contact.,
Break eye contact briefly every 5-15 seconds.",How to Make Eye Contact1," Opening up your body to the other person tells them you are listening, engaged, and ready to communicate. It also makes eye contact easier and more natural to maintain. Position yourself a few feet away from the other person's face;
, Most commonly, this is one of the other people's eyes, but if your are uncomfortable you can look between their eyes, just under or above the eye, or at the earlobe.

, Think of how you would look at a painting or great view -- you are not focusing intently on their eye but instead looking at them gently. Hold your eyes in this position and resist darting them around. Relax your gaze by breathing slowly as you make eye-contact and nodding occasionally while you listen.

, Too much eye-contact can be as off-putting as none at all. While you don't need to count the seconds, you should look away every once in a while to keep the conversation light and easy, but only for a few seconds. Some casual ways to do so include:


Laughing, nodding, and acknowledging the other person.
Looking at the sky/weather
Looking off to the side briefly, as if remembering something.
Running your hands through your hair.

Make good eye contact.,
Don’t be distracted.,
Show interest and enthusiasm.",How to Listen More Than You Talk1," Face the speaker. Don’t look over the speaker’s shoulder or down at the floor. Failing to make eye contact can seem rude and impersonal. Be relaxed and make your eye contact seem natural., Try to not be distracted by other things that are happening in the room or by any other people who are speaking. More importantly, try not to be distracted by your own thoughts while the speaker is speaking. Give all of your attention to the person who is speaking to you.Put down your phone. If you are too tempted by your phone, consider turning it on silent or shutting it off to listen.

, Be an engaged listener and show your enthusiasm for what the speaker is telling you. Use your body language to let the speaker know that you are listening to what they are saying. This cuts down on the need for you to say anything, and helps you to talk less. It is very obvious to the speaker when their audience is not actively listening.Nod your head or use a genuine smile to help convey to the speaker that you are listening. You do not need to use words for the speaker to know that you are truly listening to them.
Things like raising one eyebrow and leaning in toward the speaker slightly shows that you are interested and listening.

Start speaking from your stomach instead of your throat.,
Start off slow.,
Lower the end of your sentences.,
Practice consciously lowering your voice for a while till it becomes habit.",How to Permanently Lower Your Voice2," Consciously lower your Adam's apple by slowly swallowing, the last movement of a swallow before your throat goes up is the position you want. Another way is to lower the back of your tongue into your throat. This sounds difficult but play around with it till you find something that works.

, If your close friends or family suddenly hear you go from a 1st soprano to a bass you're going to be found out and have decongestants thrown at you. In conversation say a few words at the beginning and end of a sentence in a lower tone. Just be subtle.Trying to speak too deep too soon not only will seem conspicuous, it can do serious damage to your vocal chords over time. Be careful, and reign it back if you start to feel serious strain., Whenever you find yourself speaking and you've forgotten to try to consciously lower your pitch, just take a deep breath, clear your throat, and finish whatever you were saying with a lower voice. Ending sentences with a high pitch indicates a question, therefore, consciously lowering the end of your sentences will help you sound more confident., Like any other habit, you will forget often at first. With enough practice, what once was a conscious habit will become something you do unconsciously. The only key is to continue consciously speaking in a deeper tone until it becomes natural.

Decide whether more costly options are right for you.,
Look into voice lowering surgery.,
Get voice training from a speech expert.",How to Permanently Lower Your Voice3," Depending on your reasons for trying to deepen your voice, you might decide that it's worth pursuing options that cost money. Voice training and surgery are two of these options, both with large potential for success. If you want a lower voice to improve your confidence or social or dating life, you may want to stick to the slower but safer and cheaper options.

, One surgery shown to reduce the pitch of one's speaking voice permanently is called a thyroplasty and it involves reducing the tension in the vocal chords.Another involves injecting a subjects own fat into their vocal folds, which can reportedly lower pitches and improve voice quality. Though hormone replacement therapy alone usually lowers trans men's voices to more masculine levels, surgeries like these can be a next step for those that desire deeper voices., Vocologists specialize in helping their clients improve their speech in any number of ways, including altering their pitch. A good vocologist will help you identify the causes of your high-pitched voice and teach you change them. There are even vocologists who specialize in helping transgender people achieve more masculine or feminine voices.Your chances of lowering your pitch permanently are increased greatly if you get the help from a professional rather than just relying on self-guided practice."

Gargle vinegar and lemon juice.,
Drink caffeinated drinks and alcohol.,
Consume fatty, spicy, or acidic food.,
Enjoy high-sodium foods.",How to Lose Your Voice Fast2," To cause irritation to the vocal cords and promote voice loss, make a mixture of white vinegar and lemon juice. Add 1/4 cup vinegar (2 oz.) and 1/4 cup lemon juice (2 oz.) to a glass, then stir. Gargle with the mixture for about 30 seconds, then spit it out and repeat if desired.If the mixture is too potent for you, add 1/4 cup water (2 oz.) to dilute it.

, Caffeine and alcohol can have a dehydrating effect on the body, leaving your throat dry and raspy. Healthy vocal folds need moisture to vibrate and close properly, otherwise your voice will get breathy and hoarse. Spend a fun night out with friends at a cafe or bar and consume plenty of caffeinated or alcoholic drinks to lose your voice fast., Consuming food or drink that has a high acidic content can cause acid reflux, which in turn can irritate the vocal chords and trigger laryngitis. Fatty or spicy foods can have the same effect.To lose your voice fast, try consuming:Citrus fruits
Tomatoes
Fried foods
Red meat
Cheese

, Eating food with high sodium content is bad for your voice because of the drying effect of the salt. To dry out your vocal cords enough to promote voice loss, go for bacon as an ultimate high-salt indulgence (which is also high in fat, another voice-diminishing element).Some other sodium-rich foods to eat include:Pretzels
Salted nuts
Soya sauce
Instant soups
Pickles

Turn up the heat.,
Expose yourself to cold, dry air.,
Increase ambient noise.",How to Lose Your Voice Fast3," Heating systems absorb moisture from the air, leaving rooms dry. This dryness can dehydrate your body, including your throat and vocal cords. To lose your voice fast, turn up the heat in your room or home as much as possible and leave it at that temperature overnight., Cold, dry air can irritate the larynx and hinder the vocal cords, diminishing your voice. If you are living in a cold climate, get outside for prolonged winter activities (e.g. cross-country skiing) or go for a long walk outdoors. If you are living in a warm climate, crank up the air-conditioning as much as possible., To help lose your voice fast, increase the ambient noise level in your home or work space so that you automatically have to speak louder or yell to communicate. People tend to naturally increase their voices by 3 decibels for every 10 decibel increase in ambient noise around them. Play loud music or movies in the background, or opt for instrumental scores if you need to concentrate without distractions."

Start with small talk.,
Listen to body language.,
Listen more than you speak.,
Use “fill-in-the-blanks.” Sometimes when you ask someone a direct question, it can trigger feelings of being on the spot.,
Move the conversation towards ""needs.""",How to Persuade Someone to Do Something2," Begin your persuasive conversation by having a friendly chat with the person you'd like to persuade. This can help to break the ice and create a casual atmosphere. People will be better persuaded when they are relaxed.


Try to know a little bit about their lives. Use this as a jumping off point. Can you ask about the daughter who was recently married, the new home, or the recent accomplishment?
Ask questions. If they say, ""I've been thinking about taking a vacation,"" ask them where they'd like to go. Ask for more details about that place.

, One easy way to forge an emotional bond is to match the other person’s body language. Pay attention to what they do with their body and mirror those expressions. Mirroring body language is a non-verbal way to say, “We are like minded.”If they are smiling, you should smile.
If they are leaning in, you should lean in.
If they are taking up lots of space with their body, make your body bigger too.

, People enjoy talking more than they enjoy listening. By listening more than you speak, you can get your person to open up and feel at ease. The more they talk, the more they reveal crucial details about themselves--such as what is important to them or what they believe--that can aid in your persuasion.Avoid spinning the conversation back to yourself too quickly. If they are talking about a vacation, don't immediately jump in to describe the vacation you'd like to have.
Ask follow up questions, and listen intently to the responses.
Pay specific attention to any powerful adjectives they use. If they say something is “amazing” or “wonderful” this indicates something they have passion about., To avoid this feeling, mix fill-in-the-blank style queries with traditional questions.Instead of asking, “How would you feel about buying a new car?” try stating, “If you were to buy a new car, you would feel…”
Allow them to finish that sentence for you.

, Casually steer the conversation toward needs. Hopefully, by listening to them, you have already ascertained a little bit about what they like or what they care about. Use this ""needs"" portion of the conversation to determine how you can help them, so that they will help you.You may ask, for example, “What could make you day go smoother?”
Sharing a need of your own can prompt them to speak about their own needs. You could say, “I wish my investment partner would listen to my ideas,” in order to find out if there is some interpersonal lack in their life.

Choose the right person to persuade.,
Wait until after lunch.,
Help them, so they’ll help you.,
Choose the right environment.,
Practice what you’re going to say.",How to Persuade Someone to Do Something3," Chances are, there are a few different people who could give you what you want. How do you know which one to persuade? The best person will be the one with whom you are already have the strongest personal connection, who is in the best place emotionally, and/or who may need something from you as well. Aim to for two out of three of these conditions.

, People are more likely to be open and helpful if they are not hungry. Hunger can stir up anxiety, tension, and negative emotions. Allow your persuasion to be most effective by planning your conversation to occur right after lunch., Reciprocity builds trust and fortifies relationships. If you know you will be asking someone for a big favor, pave the way by helping them out ahead of time. If you see them in need of assistance, be the first to step up. Even helping them with a small task, such as carrying a heavy object or washing the dishes, can put you in their good graces, and position you as a good candidate for a future favor., Studies have shown that people are more likely to be “business minded” (thrifty, selfish, and/or aggressive) in business-like environments. You can guide someone toward a more generous mood by altering the location. Try speaking to them in a coffee shop, restaurant, or private home, rather than across a conference table., If you want to be convincing, you’ve got to seem like you know what you’re talking about. In order to come across as confident, practice your key talking points ahead of time. If possible, it will be helpful to rehearse your conversation with another person. If no one is available, practicing in a mirror can be great as well."

Look slightly above the crowd.,
Shift your gaze every every few sentences.,
Alternatively, choose 4-5 people to look at.,
Rotate your gaze from person to person in small groups.,
Make full eye-contact when someone else is speaking in a group.",How to Make Eye Contact2," You will never be able to make eye-contact with every person in a large group, so don't even try! Aim your eyes 2-3 inches above the heads of the group without focusing on one particular person.


If you are at a podium or raised above the crowd, aim for the middle of the crowd without focusing on one particular person.

, You do not want to look straight ahead the entire time you are speaking. Every so often, turn your head a different direction. Try to look at every section of the crowd once or twice so that the whole audience feels like they have your attention.

, This works best if you know several people in the crowd and feel comfortable speaking to them, like a classroom presentation. Simply rotate your gaze from one to the other every 10-15 seconds.

, If you keep eye-contact on one person the entire time the rest of the group may become disinterested or feel left out. As you speak, look in each person's eyes for 5-10 seconds before moving slowly to another person.


This works best with groups of 3-5 people.

, This lets the speaker know that they have your attention, are listening, and care about what they have to say. Most likely, they will only make eye-contact with your briefly, keeping things from seeming awkward."
"
Make a conscious effort to start making eye-contact slowly.,
Make ""whole-face contact"" to make your eye's feel more natural.,
Practice with a TV, web-camera, or mirror.,
Know when good eye-contact is essential.",How to Make Eye Contact3," Do not try to force yourself to hold the eyes of every person you meet if you are uncomfortable. Start slowly, reminding yourself to make eye-contact in every conversation .


It is easier to practice while listening to someone instead of while you are talking.

, Smile and nod along to the conversation, rotating your gaze though both eyes, the person's nose, and mouth. When talking, don't feel like you have to make eye-contact the entire time-- change your expression or look away to keep the other person's interest.

, If you struggle with real people, you can practice with a screen or mirror. Try to make eye-contact with every character you can on TV or video blogs. News channels, where the anchor looks right at the camera, are a great way to practice comfortably in your home., Making eye-contact is a sign of trust, reliability, and openness, and helps in a variety of social settings. However, there are some settings when it is vital for success:



Job Interviews: Good eye-contact tells a boss that they can trust you. Be sure to look them in eyes while you talk, as it assures them that you know what you're talking about.

Dates: Eye-contact can help you make an intimate connection, but it can be difficult to look away in a one-on-one setting. Hold your gaze longer than usual to show your attraction.

Arguments: Strong eye-contact is a mark of assertiveness and power. Hold your opponent's gaze for longer periods of time so you do not appear weak or unsure of yourself.

Remain open minded.,
Remember what the speaker is telling you.,
Feel and picture what the speaker is saying.,
Allow room for silence in a conversation.,
Use your words infrequently.",How to Listen More Than You Talk2," Don’t go into a conversation with a preconceived opinion about what the speaker will be saying. When you go in with your opinion formed, you are prepared to talk instead of listen. Open your mind to the information that the speaker will be giving you and you will be forced to listen more than you talk., If it is appropriate, use the information that you learned from the speaker during a future conversation. This will allow the speaker to know that you were listening to them last time you had a conversation. It will make them feel important and respected. More importantly, you can show that you were really listening even by saying very little from your previous conversation.For example, you are listening to a co-worker talk about a new great restaurant in town. After you try the restaurant tell your co-worker, “I tried that new restaurant that you recommended. It was great! Thanks for the recommendation.”

, If the speaker is telling a story, try to really picture and feel what the speaker has to say. If the speaker is talking about something sad, feel their sadness. If the speaker is talking about something happy, feel their joy. This will allow you to be a more active listener and will help you to remember what the speaker is saying., Silence in a conversation is not always a bad thing. Just because there has been a moment of silence, doesn’t mean that you need to fill it with words. A break in the conversation could allow for more thought before the conversation resumes. Be comfortable with the silence and use this time to feel and comprehend what the speaker what telling you., Only speak when you have something new and insightful to add to the conversation. Instead of responding as soon as there is a break in conversation, pause for a moment and think about whether you need to say anything. Even if you do, the pause can show that you are listening and help you talk a little less."
"
Don’t interrupt.,
Ask questions to gain a deeper understanding.,
Resist listening for your chance to speak.",How to Listen More Than You Talk3," Go back to the basic principles of conversation that were taught to you when you were a child. Don’t interrupt the speaker in the middle of their sentence. This includes interrupting the speaker to finish their sentence. When you are the listener, simply listen.Don’t finish the speaker’s sentences, even if you know what they are going to say. Allow the speaker to complete their thoughts.

, A good reason to speak when you are listening is to ask questions. Use questions to prompt further conversation or to gain a deeper understanding of what the speaker is saying. Be sure to wait until there is a break in the conversation so that you do not interrupt the speaker.Avoid derailing the speaker by asking a question that will stray them away from the topic. If you must do this, be sure to guide the conversation back to its original topic.

, You are not actively listening if you are just waiting for your chance to speak. Instead, you are thinking about what you are going to say. You could miss important parts of the conversation and possibly even repeat something that has already been said."

Develop a set of questions; be sure you understand what you want to learn from the interviews.,

For each topic and subtopic generate a synthesis.,
Measure the topics’ mindspace.,
Review your report and briefing and add any missing contextual information.,
Tie up any loose ends and deliver the report and the briefing.,
Follow up.",How to Interview Experts," Write out the questions. Getting to a good set of questions may take several tries. Focus on questions whose answers enable you to take action. Try to keep the questions open ended to encourage conversation.;
, You will have to trade number of interviewees against completeness of information and breadth of perspective. Try for ‘just enough’ interviewees. It may be better to interview some people before others.

, Schedule at least 45 minutes. Some people may be willing to schedule only 20-30 minutes. However, if you are genuinely interested in what they have to say, they will go on for over an hour. Schedule only two interviews per week. You will need the rest of the time to do Steps 6 & 7.

, Ask the questions, but do it conversationally. Use the list only as a checklist to be sure you have covered everything. Too much structure closes down conversation. Also, be sure to note the information that the interviewee wants you to know. Ask if there are others that should be interviewed. Ask for sample materials/products you can take with you.

, You might develop a list of these topics based on the first few interviews, extend it with each following interview, and use it to prompt comments if/when conversation flags. However, if you want to capture the relative importance of different topics by measuring interviewee “mindspace” (see Step 9), do not prompt interviewees by bringing up new topics. Instead review the notes you’ve taken during the interview and give the interviewee the opportunity to make additional comments.

, Write quickly to avoid slowing down the conversation; try to write only enough to remind you of the whole thought, but don’t omit key words. Write legibly. Consider recording the interview.

, Do it the same day or the following day, or you will lose important information that is only in your head. Save any editing for the next step; for now focus on capturing the complete thought behind each note.

, This means finding the topic of each thought, grouping all statements on the same topic together and generating coherent paragraphs on each topic. Add in the interviewee’s title, organization, contact information, the interview date, and your name as interviewer. This usually comes to two or three pages of text.

,, Give them a reasonable deadline. Typically, interviewees provide a number of clarifications and respond to your questions. Non-responses and complete rewrites sometimes happen too. If they don’t return the edited interview to you before you need to move on, use it as-is.

, Put all the interviews into one document, determine the topic of each paragraph, and sort by topic (use subtopics if necessary). The Table function in most text editors makes this relatively painless. First convert the paragraphs to a one-column table, and then add columns to the left for topic and subtopic; you may want to add a column to the right for interviewee name. Use the Table/Sort command to sort the paragraphs by topic and subtopic.

, Expect conflicting perspectives, “Where you stand depends on where you sit.” Reorganize the document into sections, each containing multiple topics. Write findings and recommendations based on interviewees' statements. Write an introduction and a conclusion. Develop a briefing.

, You can obtain some indication of the importance of a topic or subtopic by measuring how many people talk about it, how often they mention it, or how much they have to say about it. The more interviewees that mention a topic, the broader the group’s interest in it. The more mentions of a topic (by any person) the greater the topic’s importance or ‘mindspace’ in the group. You could also do a word count on each topic. The Pivot table function in spreadsheets makes this analysis straightforward.

, Review it with some of the interviewees to see how well it captures what they meant. Review it with a sample of your intended audience to see how well it communicates the experts’ message. In each case, present the results as tentative, listen to the comments, and modify as necessary. Restate all inflammatory comments neutrally. Remember, your goal is to enable your audience to take action.

, Generally, you should include the interviews as an appendix to the report. Who said what does matter. Expect the write up, review, and delivery to take at least as long as generating the individual interviews.

, Your work will become shelf ware unless you stick around to make sure that someone follows through on the actions that need to be taken.

Boost confidence.,
Gain knowledge and do research.,
Know the person you are trying to influence.,
Ensure honesty by being genuine and absolute.",How to Influence Others1," You can influence others to your benefit through total confidence. Confident people tend to be leaders more so than those who lack a sense of confidence and are insecure. A bold posture, tone and positive mind will indicate poise and power. Those are two things people look for and will want to follow to gain that themselves.


A way to sound more confident is to avoid words relating to ""might"" or ""try"": Instead of saying ""We will try to overcome this issue by so and so plan"" say ""We will overcome this issue and here is how"". By removing the questionable words people will believe that you truly have the answer and will be more willing to follow.
Franklin D. Roosevelt had great influence on the American people during WWII by confidently stating ""we will win through absolute victory"" in his 1941 speech after the attack on Pearl Harbor: ""No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory."";
, Find out what is it that you really want to achieve and study everything about the topic of your goal. You must know everything behind what it is you want to influence others on and be prepared to answer any question on the topic. By having knowledge you gain authority. Research will help you to have total understanding of your case and you will impress others with your complete expertise. By having knowledge, others will want to learn what you already know.


It is in our nature to listen to those who know more than we do. We want their advice, philosophy and wisdom., As Dale Carnegie once stated in How to Win Friends and Influence People: “Talk to someone about themselves and they'll listen for hours.”People will immediately start liking you if you show interest in them first. Learn what their hobbies are, what they like, what they dislike, their favorite sport teams, etc. Get to know them; Make yourself likable and use that on your behalf by gaining their trust.

, Telling white lies can get you in trouble if you are caught. Altering the truth might cause people to distrust you and speak against you which can hurt your chances to influence others.

, This may seem obvious, but it isn't. No one gets better without practice.

, Having said that, don't stare at them. They will begin to get nervous.

, Too many people aren't as knowledgeable about their subject as they should be.

, Don't interrupt. Not only is it rude, once you interrupt a person's train of thought, they may lose what they were saying.

Make the right amount of eye contact.,
Nod occasionally.,
Smile.,
Use open and inviting body language.,
Encourage the speaker to continue.",How to Improve Your Listening Skills1," Too much eye contact can come across as aggressive or dominating. If you don't make eye contact at all, the speaker will think you aren't paying attention to them.One rule of thumb is to make eye contact about 30-60 percent of the time, depending on the situation.
People who seek eye contact are usually thought to be more confident, competent, and honest.
Eye contact creates an automatic natural connection. Babies lock eyes with their parent instinctively, to get their attention and ensure they will be protected and fed.;
, Show the speaker that you are still with them by nodding your head now and then when they make a point., Remember to use friendly facial expressions, to help make the speaker more comfortable. Smile as much as you can without it seeming forced., Turn your body at a slight angle toward the speaker, not exactly full frontal. Standing at a slight angle is perceived as less confrontational, and makes you seem more accessible.If you motion with your hands while talking, be sure the palms face upward. If you speak with your palms facing down, it may seem like you are lecturing or scolding.
Angle your chin to face forward – if your chin is facing up, it looks like you are looking down on someone. Face forward so you appear to be equals.
Turn your head at a slight angle to the right or left. This sets a casual and relaxed tone.

, Make the speaker feel their thoughts are welcome by making encouraging sounds and comments. Coaxing them to continue speaking will reassure them that they are not boring you or taking up too much of your time.Encouraging sounds should be along the lines of, “Mmm,” “Yes,” and “I see.”
For longer pauses, you can say, “Please, go on,” or “I can't believe it – what did he say next?”

Know your opponents' side.,
Prove your dedication and commitment.,
Show that you are an expert and have total belief.",How to Influence Others2," See their point of view and understand their full opinion. It is important to know all answers to questions presented on their side as well as your own. If you know all their answers you can search for reasons why yours is better. Agree that they make valid points and prove that you understand what they are saying and why.


Use their sides positive points to enhance your own by comparing facts and end with why your facts overpower theirs.
Give credible examples and present your intention as the best.
Do not belittle your opponent or their opinion. Treat them as an equal and show them that with your help you can both be influenced into greatness.

, Your opponent will challenge you with questions of ""why."" They will also reveal all the negativities on your point of view but you can win them over by showing you're dedicated and committed to your knowledge.

, As stated above, people listen to those who are experienced. If you prove your expertise on the subject your opponent will want to gain that same education and acceptance as you.


They might think they are an expert on their side as well but once they see the devotion in your point they will start second guessing themselves. If they think you truly believe what you are saying, they will start to believe it themselves.

"
"
Grasp the power of persuasion.,
Use conformity and social impact.,
Believe that what you are selling, your product, is truly the best.",How to Influence Others3," Persuasion is generally forming sentences to be structured in an appealing manner. Think of who you want to influence and why. Think of how you want to influence them and form your thoughts into engaging sentences.


Word-play is a strong skill and can be extremely beneficial in trying to gain a client or sale. For example say: ""You're not spending money on a new logo, you're investing in a marketing solution.""
Don't confuse persuasion with manipulation; You want to keep their trust and can do so by reinforcing important features of facts.

, The general population tends to conform to what society, at large, agrees on. People think that by following the majority they will be accepted and liked and will go to great lengths to change their opinion just for that purpose.Use conformity in influencing a person that what you are attempting to sell is greatly accepted in your general region.


Include yourself as part of the population that has conformed.
Use examples of how your product is or how it can be popular and why (using actual facts, of course). ""The majority of Palo Alto residents are buying Teslas because their supercharger only takes about 20 minutes to fill halfway, saving both time and money!"", If you can convince yourself that the product you are selling is the way to go, then you can definitely convince others!

Avoid finishing other people's sentences.,
Avoid offering unsolicited advice.,
Avoid interrupting.,
Avoid one-upsmanship.,
Avoid deflecting.",How to Improve Your Listening Skills2," It can be tempting to finish someone's sentences when you are convinced you know what they are going to say next– especially when you don't have a lot of time. But most of the time, you'll only be expressing your own train of thought, and the speaker will become frustrated because you aren't letting them express themselves., Often, when people want to talk about a problem, they are looking for support more than anything else. If you impose your own solutions without being asked, or give advice when it wasn't asked for, it will seem as if you don't trust them to figure it out for themselves., Any time you interrupt someone when they are speaking, it comes across as rude and thoughtless. Interrupting tells the speaker that you think your ideas are more important or interesting than theirs, and that you don't have time for them or care what they think., If someone is telling you a story about something that happened to them, don't counter it with a similar anecdote from your own life. It will come across as boastful, which most people find extremely unattractive. It will also appear that you are more interested in “winning” the conversation than learning more about the other person.If someone is talking about their recent vacation, it's fine to mention that you've been there and really enjoyed it. But don't tell stories about your time there – allow the speaker to remain the center of attention.
At all costs, try to avoid mentioning how much money you earn or how much you have saved or invested. Especially if you're more successful than the speaker.

, Be careful when listening not to abruptly change the topic of conversation. It is natural to want to move away from an uncomfortable topic of conversation, but it shows a lack of respect for the speaker."
"
Rephrase.,
Ask for additional information.,
Defer judgement.,
Find the crux.",How to Improve Your Listening Skills3," To show the speaker you are paying attention, paraphrase what they are saying. Don't repeat back exactly what they just said – digest the information and then put it into your own words.Wait until they look to you for a sign of understanding, or for a lengthy pause in the conversation.
Rephrase in question form. Say, “So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're saying...?”
The focus of the rephrased comment should be on the speaker. Don't change it to include yourself or everyone in general. If someone says, “I don't have the funds to finish this project,” don't say, “Yes, it never seems like we have enough money to get things done.”
The ownership of the rephrased comment should be you. Say, “What I'm hearing is...,” not, “What you're saying is....”
Your version should be shorter than the speaker's original statement.

, Asking questions shows that you are trying to understand the speaker's point, and that you understand where you have gaps in that understanding. Request additional information where it is needed, so you can be sure you understand what the speaker means.Don't ask questions that challenge what the speaker has just said – this will just make them defensive.
Phrase your questions in a way that makes it obvious you aren't being argumentative. You're just trying to fill in the blanks.
Avoid asking “Why?” questions, because this can put people on the defensive. (“Why do you think that happened?”)
Use “How?” or “What?” questions. (“How do you feel about...?” or “What are your biggest concerns about...?”)

, Keep an open mind when someone is saying something you don't agree with. Try your best not to mentally correct or criticize them, or you will cease to hear what they're saying. Don't jump to conclusions – wait until they complete their thought before trying to interpret their meaning. , When listening to someone speak, try to look for the central theme of the conversation. Figure out the main idea they are trying to communicate, and why it is important to them.Pay extra close attention to the points of conversation that pertain to the core objective of their story or argument.

Practice active listening on kids.,
Practice with coworkers on Monday.,
Record yourself.,
Allow yourself to be awkward.",How to Improve Your Listening Skills4," Children are good people to practice with. When you ask them to explain their thoughts further, and ask for additional information, they will usually stop to gather their thoughts and then give a thoughtful answer. They are usually happy that someone is taking a genuine interest.Try to use a natural tone of voice, and avoid patronizing behavior.

, Catch up with a colleague on whichever day you return from break, and ask them what they did over the weekend. Give them your undivided attention, and try to get to know them a little better.Any time is a good time to speak with coworkers, but people often have more to say after they have been away from work for a couple of days.

, Record a conversation between you and a friend, coworker, or spouse. Listen to the tape on your own, and judge your responses for yourself. Work on areas where you need improvement; this will help you become a better listener.Most people dislike the sound of their voice on a recording, but if you can get past this it's an excellent learning tool.
Be sure all parties involved are aware they're being recorded. Recording someone without their consent is illegal in most cases., Listening skills take practice, and you won't be perfect at it right away. Rephrase the speaker's ideas, and ask additional questions – even if you think it sounds awkward at first."

Check if their eyes are on yours.,
Look for a “plastered” smile.,
Observe the motion of their head.,
See if their body is angled toward yours.,
Check if they’re fidgeting.,
Determine if they are mirroring you.,
Ask follow-up questions.,
Throw in something strange or unrelated.,
Say, “Are you listening to me?” It can’t get more candid than that.",How to Know if People Aren't Listening to You," If their eyes are wandering all over the room, seeing what else is going on, they aren’t listening to you. It’s an uphill battle trying to talk to someone who is checking their phone, staring at their computer, looking out a window, or seeing what everyone else is up to. Someone who is actively listening will make eye contact with you to show that they hear what you’re saying.On the other hand, eye contact that is unwavering can be a sign that they want to look like they’re listening when they aren’t. The key is that eye contact is natural and relaxed, rather than forced and tense.Some people are shy and uncomfortable with making steady eye contact. If they're looking away from you but otherwise seem attentive and in-tuned, they are still probably listening.;
, If someone wants to appear to be listening, they’ll smack on a smile and call it a day. Look for the unnatural smile that looks like it’s permanently just glued on to their face. That’s probably not genuine, and that means their interest probably isn’t genuine either!Just like with eye contact, they important thing to notice is that the listener seems tuned-in but still relaxed.
Many people know how to look like they’re listening when they’re not, so any actions that seem robotic and insincere probably are.

, If it’s extremely still, they might be zoned out. If they’re staring at you with glazed-over eyes but not moving their head at all, their mind might be on a different planet. However, if they’re nodding aggressively to everything you are saying, they might be simply overcompensating physically in order to appear attentive. Instead, look for relaxed heads that nod at the correct moments.Everything should feel and look natural.

, This is key. When someone becomes fully engaged in what someone is saying, they tend to shift their body to point towards the speaker. When you’re speaking to someone, observe how they position their body and the space they put between you. If they face you and lean closer, you most likely have their genuine attention. If their body is angled away and they lean back, they aren’t fully in the conversation, or they want the conversation to end.

, If someone is bored with the conversation, antsy to finish it, or just thinking about something else altogether, they tend to fidget. They might play with their watch or necklace, tap their fingers, or adjust their clothing. Maybe they fix their hair or move around in their seat. When someone is listening well, they won’t be worried about these little distractions, and their body will be still.

People often don’t even notice when they’re listening. They’re probably not trying to insult you or give you a hint that they’re bored, simply unaware that they’re doing it.

, When someone is enthralled in a conversation and really connecting with what you’re saying, their body language will mimic yours. Perhaps they’ll lean to one side when you do, or cross their legs after you do. Even if you’re standing and they’re sitting, people who are totally absorbed will tend to subtly mirror your movements. This is a major indication that they are totally focused on what you have to say. If they aren’t mirroring your gestures, their mind might not be in the conversation fully.If the conversation is tense or emotional, they may not mirror you. It doesn’t always mean they aren’t listening, it’s simply one clue.

, This is easy. If you think they aren’t listening, simply ask something like, “So, what do you think?” If they respond with, “Wait, about what?” then they probably weren’t in the conversation to begin with. Ask for opinions and feedback to ensure that they’re engaged in the conversation. You can even simply say things like, “We went to this restaurant– have you ever been there?” Their responses are the easiest ways to know if they’re listening or not.

, If their eyes are wandering, their body is turned away, their foot is tapping, and they just seem totally oblivious to what you’re saying, test them. If you’re telling them a straightforward story about something that happened to you, say something like, “So after that, both of my parents were killed in a vicious unicorn attack.” If they nodded and said, “Uh huh,” then walk away. They aren’t listening to a word you’re saying.


Not only is this a way to see if they’re listening, but it can also be a bit of fun for you. Get creative with your interjections.

, If you have reasons to believe that someone isn’t focused on your words, ask them. Many people will be caught off-guard by the question, and this can help them re-focus. They’ll realize that you’re noticing their mind wandering.


This can also be a helpful way to figure out why they aren’t listening. They might respond with something like, “I’m sorry, I’m trying to, but I really need to get to class,” or perhaps, “I was, but an ice cream truck just drove right behind you and I got distracted.” This might clear the air.

Learn some of the basics.,
Say Merry Christmas.,
Understand the pronunciation breakdown:

Mele: the Hawai'ian Mele is said just like Pele (The Hawai'ian Goddess of Volcanoes).","How to Say ""Merry Christmas"" in Hawaiian"," You should know that Hawai'ian has eight basic consonants, more if you include ones that can be switched in between for each other.

The P in Hawai'ian is the same as the English sound.
In English, the ʔ does not exist. When in written Hawai'ian, it is marked by a ', or 'okina.
K may be substituted for T, but only speakers from Ni'ihau (the one place where Hawai'ian is still a first language) use this dialect.
H may have a soft h, as in honor, or a hard H, as in harangue.
M and N sound just like their English substitutes.
Only in Ni'ihau is N used over L, but out of respect, it is still called Ni'ihau instead of Li'ihau.
Everywhere except Ni'ihau uses the V sound when a W appears. Ewa, for example, is pronounced Evah. (Ever, but with the r dropped.);
, In Hawai'ian, it is Mele Kalikimaka. Mele means Merry, and Kaliki is Christ. That leaves -maka to mean -mas. However, since there are no currently known native Hawai'ian speakers who are also Christians, you will never see Kaliki by itself., This is similar to the English word melee, but shorter vowel sounds. Instead of may LAY, it is MAY lay.
Kaliki: Kaliki is said just how it looks. KAH lee kee. Say this slowly a few times until it rolls off your tongue just like you've been saying it your whole life. Then add Mele; it becomes Mele Kaliki.
Maka: maka is said just like Mach, with an ah sound at the end. MAH kah.

Deep breathing is important to project your voice. In order to speak loudly, you need to use more air than you do when you speak quietly. Deep breathing, as opposed to short and shallow breaths, ensures that you have enough air to project your voice.
Always try to breathe through your nose. Breathing through your nose is your body’s natural way of filtering air into your lungs and is the most efficient way to breathe deeply.;
, The diaphragm is a dome shaped muscle at the bottom of your ribcage and is the main muscle used in respiration. Breathing with your diaphragm helps to open your lungs so you can take in the most air possible.


To find your diaphragm, sit comfortably or lie down. Placing your left hand on your upper chest, place your right hand on your abdomen just below where your rib cage ends. Breathe deeply in and out through your nose. Your left hand should remain still on your chest while your right hand moves up and down. If your left hand moves while you breathe, you are breathing too shallowly and aren’t utilizing your diaphragm. , When you practice specific breathing techniques that use your diaphragm, you strengthen these muscles and become more aware of how deeply you are breathing.


To practice breathing using your diaphragm, maintain the same comfortable position with your left and right hand placed on your chest and abdomen respectively. Practice taking deep breaths through your nose, tightening your stomach muscles and breathing out through pursed lips. This will help to strengthen your diaphragm muscles and instill good breathing patterns. You can practice diaphragm breathing for as long as you feel comfortable, but try to take at least 15 deep breaths.Try different breathing exercises that focus on taking deep breaths. One popular exercise is called 4-7-8 breathing. Here, you inhale deeply through your nose for four seconds. Then, hold the air in your lungs for seven seconds before taking eight seconds to exhale slowly. This breathing technique strengthens your muscle control and many people find it to be very calming.

, We breathe using our core muscles and our diaphragm, so keeping these muscles strong through regular exercise is a great way to strengthen your breathing.


Abdominal exercises like planks, crunches, planks, and side planks are all great ways to target your abdominal muscles.Regular cardiovascular exercise, like running or cycling, will also strengthen your core muscles and improve your cardio-respiratory function. A healthy cardio-respiratory function means that your body is able to efficiently transport oxygen throughout your body., Good posture allows your muscles and lungs to fully expand so you can take in the most air possible. Poor posture compresses your respiratory system and distorts your breathing.


When standing, you should stand tall by straightening your back and drawing your shoulder blades together. Your arms and hands should hang comfortably at your sides, and your weight should be balanced primarily on the balls of your feet.When sitting, keep your feet on the ground and avoid crossing your legs. Use the back of the seat to support your lower and middle back while you keep your shoulders parallel above your hips., Voice projection allows you to control the volume of your voice. Some people are naturally louder than others, but learning how to correctly project your voice will ensure that you can be heard over a crowd.Breathe deeply using your diaphragm to draw enough air into your lungs. Breath is what powers our voices; when we breathe shallowly we do not have enough air to project our voices without straining our vocal cords.
Imagine filling your lungs from top to bottom. As you breathe, imagine that you are completely filling up your lungs with air and breathe until you feel as though you’ve reached your lung's capacity.

, As you speak, push the air from your deep breaths out. Notice that when you push the air out, your diaphragm and abdominal muscles contract but that you don’t feel a strain on your vocal cords.


Continue to speak loudly and with authority so that your voice will carry across the room.

, Articulation refers to the careful pronunciation of each sound in a word. When we speak articulately, it is easier for others to understand the words that we are saying.


In a noisy room, there are background noises that might interfere with your audience's ability to understand what you are saying. Speaking articulately and deliberately will help your audience hear and understand what you are saying.

, If you begin to feel your throat tightening up while you are projecting, stop speaking as soon as you are able to.


When you strain your voice you are putting stress on the muscles and ligaments of your vocal cords and throat. Over time, stress can irreversibly damage your vocal cords.
If you feel yourself straining, you should return to your attention to your breaths. If you are breathing deeply enough, you should not need to strain your voice to be heard. You may need to drink water to help lubricate your throat to make speaking more comfortable after straining.

, Drinking lots of water will help to lubricate your throat, prevent your voice cords from drying out, and making your voice sound hoarse.Alcohol, smoking, and caffeine are all drying or constricting to your vocal cords. It is best to avoid these substances before situations where you need to project your voice.
Some medications, like antihistamines, are also drying to your vocal cords. Plan to drink more water if you are taking these medications in order to protect your voice.

, Your vocal cords are fragile and can become easily overworked. If you find yourself straining while you are projecting your voice, it is best to take a break and rest your vocal cords before attempting to project again.


If you are sick, especially with a respiratory condition, you should also rest your voice since illnesses put extra stress on your respiratory system.

, Even though you have used breathing exercises to learn how to project your voice, you should continue to exercise your diaphragm and respiratory muscles to keep them strong.



Yoga or other meditative activities that focus on deep and thoughtful breathing are great ways to incorporate breathing exercises into your lifestyle.

Say ""air-oh-post-all"".,
Know that ""aeropostale"" is a French word.,
Take your cues from the company.,
Stress the last syllable.",How to Say Aeropostale," This is the correct pronunciation of the name. If it's easier, try saying ""arrow-poe-stall"" or ""arrow-post-all"".Say each syllable separately, then string them together. Don't say the word too quickly – take your time, especially while you're still getting it right.


Aero: Pronounce as ""arrow"" or ""air-oh""
Po: Pronounce like ""poe"", as in ""Edgar Allen Poe""
Stale: Pronounce like ""stall"" or ""stahl"";
, It refers to the transfer of mail by air – something like ""air postal"" or ""airmail"".As such, it is most ""correct"" to say it according to the French pronunciation. Aeropostale is, however, an American clothing company, and you can vary your pronunciation somewhat to fit your natural cadence of speech. ""Air-oh-post-ull"", ""air-oh-pas-tell"", and even ""arrow-paw-still"" can be acceptable pronunciations as long as people know what you're talking about., If you are trying to talk about the American clothing company, and not refer specifically to French airmail, then you should pronounce the word the way that the Aeropostale company says it's pronounced. Try calling the Aeropostale's 800-number and listening to the automated recording. Ask a store employee, or write a letter to the company., Many English words place their emphasis on the first syllable or two, but many French words emphasize the final syllable. Instead of ""AEROpostale"", say ""aeropoSTALE"".

Ask yourself the following questions:


Do I have Influence over it?,
Realize that the way something is said is very important and can make all the difference in the world (and in results).,
State your issue in an active voice (versus a passive voice).,
Be aware of your tone of voice.,
Have open body language.,
Address an individual.,
Tell the person why you want their opinion.,
Ask ""What would you do?""",How to State an Issue in a Way That Encourages Answers,"
Is it Important to me?
Does it need Imaginative thinking?;
,


An example is, ""I don't have enough money"". Basically, you are just saying it. It doesn't encourage thought or ask for answers. An alternative could be:

""How might I get more money?""



, Say what you are doing, instead of what is being done to you.

, Do you sound like you just want to complain or whine? Or do you sound curious and open-minded?

, This allows others to know that you are hoping for some type of response.


We need ways to make more money with arms crossed and toe tapping does not encourage people to step forward with an answer.

, Sometimes when you address a group, whether in person or online, people are less likely to respond. Try one-on-one communication. This shows the person you really do want their opinion.

, For people who are hesitant to give feedback or advice, telling them why you value their perspective helps. Example: ""Sarah, I know you went through something similar with your family. I'd really love to know your take on this.""

, Sometimes people don't feel comfortable answering because they don't want to tell others what to do. But, if you rephrase it asking what they would do in your shoes, then it becomes about them.

Decide on your break-even point.,
Know what you're worth.,
Never feel rushed.,
Plan how you will structure your proposals.,
Be ready to walk away.",How to Negotiate1," In financial terms, this is the lowest amount or cheapest price you will accept in the deal. In non-financial terms, this is the ""worst-case scenario"" you are willing to accept before walking away from the negotiating table. Not knowing your break-even point can leave you accepting a deal that is not in your best interest.


If you are representing someone else in a negotiation, get your client's agreement for a target deal in writing beforehand. Otherwise, when you negotiate deal, and they decide that they don't like it after all, your credibility is the one that takes the hit. Proper preparation can avoid this from happening.;
, Is what you're offering hard to come by, or is it a dime a dozen? If what you have is rare or noteworthy, you have the better bargaining position. How much does the other party need you? If they need you more than you need them, you have the better position, and can afford to ask for more. If, however, you need them more than they need you, how can you give yourself an edge?


A hostage negotiator, for example, isn't offering anything special, and needs the hostages more than the abductor needs the hostages. For this reason, being a hostage negotiator is very hard. In order to compensate for these deficiencies, the negotiator must be good at making small concessions seem big, and turn emotional promises into valuable weapons.
A rare gem vendor, on the other hand, has something that is rarely found in the world. She doesn't need a particular person's money — only the highest amount of money, if she's a good negotiator — but people want her particular gem. This puts her in excellent position to extract extra value from the people she's negotiating with.

, Don't underestimate your ability to negotiate for what you want by simply outlasting someone else. If you have patience, use it. If you lack patience, gain it. What often happens in negotiations is that people get tired and accept a position that they wouldn't ordinarily accept because they're tired of negotiating. If you can outlast someone by staying at the table longer, chances are you'll get more of what you want.

, Your proposals are what you offer to the other person. A negotiation is a series of exchanges, where one person offers a proposal and the other person counter-proposes. The structure of your proposals can spell success or lead to disaster.


If you're negotiating someone else's life, your proposals need to be reasonable right off the bat; you don't want to risk someone's life. The downside of starting off aggressive is just too much.
If, however, you're negotiating your starting salary, it pays to start off asking for more than you expect to get. If the employer agrees, you've gotten more than you asked for; if the employer negotiates you down to a lower salary, you're heightening the impression that you're being ""bled,"" thereby increasing your chances of securing a better final salary.

, You know what your break-even point is, and you know if that's not what you're getting. Be willing to walk out the door if that's the case. You might find that the other party will call you back, but you should feel happy with your efforts if they don't.

"
"
Depending on the situation, open extreme.,
Shop around, and bring proof.,
Use silence.,
Offer to pay up front.,
Never give away without getting something in return.,
Ask for something that's valuable to you but doesn't cost them much.,
Offer or request extras.,
Always hold back a closer or two.,
Don't let personal hangups sidetrack the negotiations.",How to Negotiate2," Open at your maximum sustainable position (the most you can logically argue for). Ask for what you want, and then some. Starting high is important because you'll most likely be negotiated to a lower level. If your opening offer is too close to your breaking point, then you will not have enough bargaining range to concede to the other party as a way of giving satisfaction.


Don't be scared to make an outrageous request. You never know — you might get it! And what's the worst that could happen? They might think you're vain, or delusional; but they'll also know you have guts, and you value yourself, your time, and your money.
Are you worried about insulting them, especially if making a very low offer to buy something? Remember that this is business, and if they don't like your offer, they can always counter-offer. Be bold. If you don't take advantage of them, remember that they'll take advantage of you. The act of negotiation is mutually and beneficially taking advantage of each other.

, If you are buying a car and you know the other dealer will sell you the same car for $200 less, tell them so. Tell them the name of the dealer and salesman. If you're negotiating a salary and you've researched how much people in equivalent positions get paid in your area, print out those statistics and have them handy. The threat of losing business or opportunity, even if it's not a serious one, can make people compromise.

, When the other party makes a proposal, don't reply immediately. Instead use your body language to indicate that you're not satisfied. This will make the other person feel uncomfortable and insecure and often force them to come up with a better offer to fill the silence., An up-front payment is always desirable to a seller, especially in situations where most people do not pay up front (we're looking at you, car dealerships). As the buyer, you can also offer to buy in bulk, paying in advance for a certain number of products or services, in exchange for a discount.


One tactic is to come into the negotiation with a pre-written check; ask to buy the product or service for that amount, and tell them that's your final offer. They may accept it, since the lure of an immediate payment is hard to resist.
Finally, paying in cash rather than with a check or credit card can be a useful negotiation tool because it reduces risk to the seller (e.g. check bouncing, credit card declined).

, If you give something away ""for free,"" you're implicitly telling the other person that you think your bargaining position is weak. Smart bargainers will smell blood and swarm you like sharks in water.

, Having both parties feel like they're on the winning side of the negotiation is a good thing. And contrary to popular perception, negotiation doesn't have to be a zero-sum game. If you're smart, you can get creative with what you ask for.


Let's say you're doing business with a winery, and they want to pay you $100 to perform there. You want $150. Why not suggest that they pay you $100 and give you a $75 bottle of wine? It's worth $75 to you because that's how much you'd have to pay to buy it, but it costs them much less to produce that bottle.
Or, you can ask them for a 5% or 10% discount on all their wine. Assuming you buy wine regularly anyway, you'll save money, and they'll still make money from your purchases (just not as much).

, Can you sweeten the deal in any way, or ask for something to sweeten the deal? Extras or perks can be cheap to provide but push the deal closer to the ""sweet"" territory.


Sometimes, but not always, offering lots of small incentives, as opposed to one larger incentive, can make it seem like you're giving away more when in fact you're not. Be aware of this, both in giving away incentives and in receiving them.

, A closer is a fact or argument you can use when you sense the other side is close to a deal but needs that final push. If you are a broker and your client is going to buy this week whether this seller is willing or not, that is a great deal closer: your client has a time constraint that she'll want to meet, and you can persuade her why meeting that time constraint is important.

, Too often, negotiations are sidetracked because one party takes an issue personally and doesn't let go it, reversing any progress made in the initial stages of the negotiation. Try not to take the process of negotiation personally, letting it offend your ego or your sense of worth. If the person you're negotiating with is rude, overly aggressive, or abusive, know that you can walk away at any time.

Be knowledgeable about language.,
Use proper and smooth articulation and pronunciation.,
Make use of inflection.,
Speed up and slow down.,
Practice the PAIR.",How to Speak Effectively1," You are or you've been in school. The first step to being a good speaker is to be knowledgeable about your language (presumably, English, in this case). Study English, especially grammar, so that it will be natural for your tongue to speak English. To be fluent and accurate, understand the structure of the language, as well as its proper usage. You can't be good in English if you don't know about it.


If you are a student, pay attention to your English class.
Surround yourself with English. Read English books, and watch English movies.;
, A clear and correct pronunciation is appreciated and easily understood. However, bad pronunciation is like an annoying monotonous sound of a machine. Familiarize yourself with phonetics. Phonetics is concerned with the production of speech sounds, and their representation in writing. For example is the sound as the ""u"" in ""but."" The as in the ""a"" of ""apple.""


Moreover, in articulating, freely move your mouth; jaw, tongue, and cheeks, to produce sounds. Don't just speak with a small mouth. If a sound is a stretched sound, stretch your mouth. If the sound is short, keep it short.
Aspirate sounds that are meant to be.
In English, a letter can have two or more sounds.
Also, there are sounds that have long and short sounds. For example, ""feet"" and ""fit"", ""pool"" and ""pull."" The way you pronounce words may vary the meaning. Check how different pronunciations give different meanings.

Short sounds vs. Long Sounds:

pill – peel –> pill is a medicine. (To) peel is to remove the skin of a fruit or something.
nit – neat –> nit is the egg of louse, neat means clean.
mill – meal –> mill is a building with machinery, meal is food.


Common Spelling for short and long sounds of ""i"" and ""u""

Short hit, captain, chocolate, cabbage, necklace
Long she, me, sweet, believe, receive, meal, people
Short book, stood, would, full, pull, bush
Long tooth, group, truth, womb, blue



Don't let the ""a"" of ""car"" and ""apple"" sound the same way. ""Car"" has a broad ""ah"" sound , while ""apple"" has the sound between ""ah"" and ""eh"" .
Some vowels are solid sounds ""o"", and others are soft ""ow."" See the difference between ""ball"" and ""bowl.""
Pronounce soft ""th"" as in ""thin""and hard ""th"" as in ""they."" ""Thin"" is different from ""tin"", so are ""they"" and ""day."" To pronounce soft and hard ""th"", place the tip of your tongue between your upper and lower front teeth. Relaxing your tongue, let the air come out of the space between your front teeth to make the soft ""th."" To make the hard ""th"", voice out the sound.
Practice some tongue twisters. Give your mouth exercise.
These are important so you won't sound strange and to avoid having hard accent. Do some exercises for pronunciation. Remember to articulate but don't exaggerate it.

, Don't worry if you speak too high or too low sometimes. Effective speaking is also like singing. If the sound is not varying of high tone and low tone, it will sound dull, boring! Intonation helps you show your feelings about what you speak. Thus, you can have emotional relationship with your listener or audience. Intonation indicates you are sure about what you say, if you are asking, angry, commanding, suggesting, and so forth.


Try to speak with variations of pitch. As you speak, discourse in normal tone, then shift to high tone for some emphasis, and low tone for a serious tone that can make your listener listen more attentively. You must not stick to one tone. But, make sure that you use intonation appropriately to match what you are saying. Use of inflection makes your talk interesting, climactic. Again, we have three pitches in speaking, the middle or normal, high, and low. There is no such perfect pitch in speaking. Play with your pitches when speaking.

, The rate, or how fast or slow you speak, is also important. Avoid speaking with one tone and one rhythm. Aside from inflection, your rate in speaking makes you sound enthusiastic.


Speaking too fast, but still understandably, will make you sound alive. Your listeners will focus more to what you say, because the fluctuation in speed gets their heed, and they will try to catch your words. Speaking too slowly makes you sound serious and emphatic. Listeners will hear each word and understand it. When you give a pause, at the moment of silence, they will reflect on what you said. Thus, your listeners will feel they are really involved, and they will come to think on the subject being talked about.

, Don't only study those, but apply and practice. Pronunciation - Articulation - Inflection - Rate. With your knowledge of how to use good English, complement it with the skills mentioned above. Speak with good articulation. Speak with the appropriate volume. Speak clearly. This way, you will sound educated and skilled. Combine inflection and rate to create a melody as you speak, and so your listener will get hooked. As you boost your PAIR, you will sound interesting, confident, smart, skilled, charismatic, and effective.


Get some articles/texts in books and read them. Then, read it viva voce (orally) and apply the PAIR. Record yourself speaking and check if you did it well. Practice!

Put yourself first.,
Have some standard stock phrases ready to push aside media queries.,
Point out the realities.,
Be polite.,
Avoid falling into the trap of ""half talking"" with the media and then clamming up.,
Have support.,
Consider how you might talk to the media if you want to.,
Have a plan in place for leaving with dignity where possible.",How to Refuse to Speak to the Media," If you don't want to speak to the media, never feel obliged to do so. If you're concerned that you might be judged for not speaking to the media, there are better ways of counteracting this allegation or rumor than giving a doorstop byte when you're feeling harassed and upset, such as making a written statement later, etc. Make up your mind from the outset that you don't want to discuss anything with the media as your base point.


Take some time now to think about how you'd respond to media if you were ever involved in a crisis incident and media came at you. While you don't know how you'd react to the incident itself, you can at least have some notion in your mind about such issues as privacy, safety, and dignity for yourself and others around you.;
, You don't need to answer anything, no matter how pushy the media representative is, and some of the journalists will be very pushy – it's their job. Some phrases to keep in mind include:


No comment.
I don't wish to talk to the media at present. Thank you.
Thank you.
I wish to get to right away. I don't have the time to talk now.
When I feel better/am across all the facts/have had a chance to recover, etc., I may consider giving an interview. Until then, I am not able to talk about it.

, In some cases, it may be beneficial to point out that the situation is an inappropriate one for media coverage. For example, if you've just survived or helped save someone from a shark attack or a train wreck, you might point out that you or someone else is injured and that it's far more important to deal with the injuries and shock before talking about the incident. You might say something like: ""I just did what needed to be done and I only care about the injured person right now. I don't want to talk about it thanks.""

, Avoid getting into skirmishes because they turn into the news, instantly. Keep your cool and simply ask repeatedly that the media and camera crews step aside to allow you through.


Use polite body language as well. Keep a neutral face (neither smiling nor scowling). Avoid using obscene hand, facial, or other gestures; the camera will have it caught in an instant.

, The more you do say, the more the journalist has to translate into something of a news or investigative item. Remember that every single word you do say will be reported in some way of other because the journalist has to make a story.

, If you know that media is about to descend upon you, have a neutral or strong-willed person stand up for you to walk you through the scrum. Allow this person to do all of the talking and to shield you as you pass through. This could be a lawyer, a therapist, a doctor, a family member, a friend, etc., whoever is willing and able to take on this role. Again, maintain a neutral appearance and stance so as not to provide any source of commentary about your attitude.

, If you're not completely against talking to the media but you're not ready, you might wish to say so to the media representative. For example, ""I don't wish to speak on camera but if you'd email me the questions, I'd be happy to respond in writing."" Or, ""I'm not ready to talk to the media right now but when I am, I'll call you for an exclusive"".

, It's probably impossible to leave an accident site lying on a stretcher with dignity but you can ask medics to shield you. But for most other situations, the manner in which you leave can leave a lasting impression, so don't lose your bottle but remain pleasant in your uncooperative retreat.


Have escape routes planned, such a waiting car, a friend's house you can run into, a private place that the media cannot enter, etc.
Have a recovery system in place. Although you might manage to do your best to remain stoic in front of media glare, the after-effects can have you reeling in shock and anger. Take the time out to sit down, catch your breath, and debrief on the situation with someone you trust. Then get on with your day and don't let the media hounding get to you. You'll soon be yesterday's news.

Be a good listener!,
Project confidence.,
Widen your vocabulary.,
Get a thesaurus and a dictionary.,
Practice in front of mirror.,
Maintain eye contact.,
Omit some informality.,
Add some humor (without offense).,
Read more; learn more!,
Talk to elderly people.,
Evaluate your own speaking.,
Keep on conversing - Communicate!",How to Speak Effectively2," A good speaker is a good listener. And a good listener listens to good speakers. This means, you should observe how good speakers (they can be public speakers, ministers, pastors, priests, actors/actresses, teachers, reporters, politicians, etc.) speak. How do they pronounce each word clearly? How do they use variations of tones while speaking? What's their accent (American, British, Posh, or Standard English)? Have your models and get ideas from the way they speak. But, be yourself and have your own uniqueness.

Besides, good listeners don't only listen to experts, they also listen to normal people. If you listen to others and give them chance to speak, you will gain respect. In return, they will listen to you as well.







, Your confidence is reflected on how you speak. An effective speaker is confident. Don't lose your listeners' interest and trust when you speak. Overcome social anxieties in speaking in front of people, if you have it. Project a strong voice showing that you can speak effectively and you know what you say.

, A person who knows and uses many words will sound smart! It will be easier for a person to convert his ideas to spoken words if he/she can pick the right, appropriate words from his/her mind. You can convey what you really want to say without much effort. In addition, your talk will sound interesting and not dull if you use different words. It's like a colorful picture not just a black and white photograph. As you use different words, your listener can easily picture out in their mind what you're talking about. And you can avoid redundancies with words


But, don't use complex highfalutin words often. Most people will not understand you. Use them minimally.

, These books will help you absorb new words for a richer vocabulary, and will help you to know synonyms and antonyms of words. The dictionary can help you know the proper pronunciations of words – especially those words you're not sure how to enunciate. Do not, however, always read and memorize words from dictionaries. Candidly, you will just forget them! The proper way of remembering new words is just by knowing its spelling, pronunciation, and meaning and by using it whenever and wherever you can. Apply those words to daily matters or conversations.

, By practicing speaking in front of mirror, you can see how you speak. You can see if you do unnecessary things when speaking, and so you can rectify it. This is also important to see if you do nice articulation. When practicing articulation, face the mirror. Take note, professional speakers rehearse in front of mirror and they suggest it.

, This is a sign that you are paying attention to your listener, that you are really conversing with them. You make a magnetic power through eye contact with your listener. Besides, you can get your listener's attention. You can make an instant camaraderie and a warm treatment. However, don't just stare at your listener's eye the whole time you speak. It's normal to look to your left, right, up, down, when you are thinking of what to say. You may look away from your listener, but after you pick from your mind what to say maintain eye contact again.


If you are not comfortable of maintaining eye contact:

Try to practice speaking in front of mirror and look to your eyes.
Try to look at your listener's nose if you are a meter away. Your listener won't notice that you're actually looking at their nose. If you're about 2-3 meters away, you may look at your audience's forehead.



, Speak professionally. It doesn't mean you're not going to talk the normal way with your family and friends. You will still talk normally but should sound professional and with image. Avoid using slang and unnecessary expressions. Most people think that doing such expressions will make them sound like Americans or any other innate English speakers. But, they just look like classless and somewhat uneducated. You don't want to be like that. Also, try not to add fillers or the ""uhms, hmm, ahh, like"" when you converse. To do that, think before you speak. Speak with a moderate speed so you'll not cram of ideas you want to say.

, Humor makes your conversation alive and colorful. Use it minimally and smartly. Avoid humors that could offend someone.

, The more you read, the more you learn. If you read a lot, you will know more and more topics. If you know more and new information, you will have more to talk about. You can expand your general knowledge. It will be easy for you to relate to others because you have a wide knowledge base.


But, don't just read and read. Read texts/articles from reliable books, websites, and other resources. Be smart in choosing.

, Elders are wiser than most of us, because they have more experiences and they are more mature. Although at first it may seem boring, talk to them sometimes. They can teach you many things. They can share their experiences and tell you how they overcame their obstacles. You can hear about events that happened before and when you understand those, you can relate those to present. And when you are able to talk with them, it means your mind can hold an elder's level of thinking.

, After giving a presentation or talk to class, work, or in public, ask close friends or someone about how you spoke. Were you audible? Did you convey your message clearly and convincingly? Ask them if there are some little problems you did when you spoke. Evaluate and rectify your mistakes.

, Even if you're not yet a professional speaker, talking with people is essential. This will be your foundation. It will be easy for you to face people and talking can be comfortable. This is also considered the best way of socializing. Your effectiveness and impressive exhibition in speaking is nothing if there is no communication.


Speak and speak and speak to be fluent!

Know the word.,
Speak the word out loud.,
Create a mental picture.,
Make a list of your words of the day.,
Install dictionary and thesaurus apps on your phone.,
Read novels when you can.,
Watch English movies.",How to Speak Effectively3," Know how it is pronounced. If you know phonetics, it will be easy for you to get the right pronunciation. Then, get its meaning - not only one definition but also look for the other definitions. Like when we say ""object"", it could mean a tangible thing, or a goal, or ""to object"" as in to oppose.


Choose words that you think you will use often for your daily activities in school, work, and so forth.
Choose the words that you usually hear from other people or from TV and movies that you don't know the meaning.

, Don't murmur. Say it loud. Let it come out of your mouth that it's like you already knew it. By this way, you can easily remember the sound of the word and you'll be familiar.

, After knowing the definition of a specific word, visualize an image that resembles the meaning of the word. This will help you remember the word. For example, we have the word ""hurtle."" It means to throw or rush swiftly and violently. So imagine a man throwing a ""turtle"" swiftly and violent towards you.

, Challenge yourself to have a new word for each day. Have a notebook and list down the words. This is really effective. You can remember the word after knowing its definition, saying it out loud, and writing it down.

If you don't like having a notebook, you may make a list on your phone.







, If you think bringing a pocket dictionary will make you look like a nerd or a geek, install dictionary apps on your phone. Phones are handy. There is a free dictionary app in iTunes; it has a blue icon. Moreover, the app provides a ""Word of the Day.""

, Reading is fun! In reading, you will encounter words that are new to you. The more you read the more new words you’ll discover. When you encounter new words, underline those using pencil and check for their definition in the dictionary.


Novels are indeed long and can take time to finish. If you feel overwhelmed, start with short stories then move to longer ones.

, You can learn new words and expressions in watching English movies. Take note, Watching is a combination of seeing and listening. However, avoid watching English movies exposing too much slang and too many inappropriate expressions.

Choose a good topic to talk about.,
Know what your listener needs.,
Stick to general topics with new people.,
Dig deeper and wider.",How to Speak Effectively4," Your eloquence would be nothing if you don't have a good subject matter. Think of topics that have sense, that are interesting, and are relating to you and to your listener. You don't want to talk about things you don't like to or listen to balderdash things either.

, Don't just talk and talk. Your listener might not listen and get annoyed. If you will initiate a conversation, know what your listener likes to talk about and what not to. Your listener will just listen if he likes to. Know the purpose of your talk. Would it be worth listening? Are you talking about significant things? Or just rumors and gossip?

, After introducing yourselves to each other, don't ask, ""What are your interests?"" But rather think of what they may be interested in. Ask them about the recent sports news. Ask them if they are new to the place, or tell them if you are new to the place. You may talk about fashion, if you are both girls. Talk about yourself - but avoid sharing personal information - if you love to sing, draw, dance, play computer games, and so forth. But don't boast! Make them feel they are your friends, not only listeners.



Be careful! Avoid talking about general subjects that cover politics, religion, and specific controversial matters. You might offend them about their political and religious views. Sometimes, you are speaking but your listener feels insecure or vexed deep inside.

, After you have determined your topic, talk more about it. Get deeper by not only talking about the thing, but also by sharing your thoughts and feelings about the matter. Think of things about it that you may exchange ideas. Show your opinions, but don't be too outspoken. You may offend your listener. Then, get wider, extend your topic to other topics. Make sure that that topic is very close and related to your main focus.


By deepening and widening your talk, your conversation will grow and will become more meaningful and substantial with facts and opinions. In addition, you will get new information from your listener, and so will your listener. You and your listener hold in your minds the same thing. Both of you stick to the same thought and focus. That is what we call communication.

Meet, greet and take a seat.,
Get physical.,
Listen loudly.,
Speak sensibly and bookend with small talk.,
Don’t rely on digital dialogue skills.,
Interview the interviewer.,
Snail mail a thank you.",How to Nail an Interview and Land a Job After Graduation," That is, shake with a firm hand, introduce yourself confidently and sit down prepared to impress. Obviously your name should be known, but that does not prevent you from offering the gift of your name regardless: ""Debra Fine, thank you for the opportunity to interview with you."" Don’t forget to listen to how the interviewer introduces himself. Is he Jon or Jonathan or Mr. Wright? If it’s the latter, say, “Hello Mr. Wright, I’m Debra Fine and it’s nice to meet you.”;
, Making eye contact in an interview is one of the most important moves you can make. It says, “I’m confident and capable.” Use your convincing smile to show that you’re personable and friendly. With this physical activity you’ll have a winning formula for positive non-verbal communication.

, In an interview, it’s important to listen to how the interviewer describes the job and listen to the questions being asked. Let the interviewer know you are actively listening by offering verbal cues such as: ""That is interesting,"" or ""Tell me more...""

, Begin and end your interview with small talk. Approach interviews prepared to talk about the industry, current events, the weekend and even the weather to prevent awkward moments or appearing distant. Don’t just answer inquisitions, elaborate on interview questions to show that you’re mature enough to have an adult conversation. If you get an opportunity, try to make a more personal bond. If an interviewer asks you where you grew up, say, “I’m originally from Dallas, Texas. What about you?” Or, if you’re asked about how your weekend was, reply with more than the cursory “good.” Make conversation and say, “I had a great weekend; I went to the new Impressionist exhibit at the museum. Have you had an opportunity to view it yet?” If you can draw a connection with this individual, and he/she with you, it will make your interview a bigger success.

, You may be extremely advanced at texting on your phone or networking on LinkedIn, but it’s critical that you aren’t just a technical device talker. Before an interview, practice calling your friends instead of texting them or meet in person for a more intimate conversation. Be particularly aware of your body language and tone since this is a 3-D interaction. For example, it’s easy to casually slouch when typing or texting, but when you’re engaging in a face-to-face conversation, you should sit straight up and in a professional position. And, instead of using slang or pop culture abbreviations as you would with your digital dialogue, use your most sophisticated vernacular.

, Show the interviewer that you are groomed for sophisticated conversations by asking intelligent and thought provoking questions at the end of your interview. Use this time to ask how the decision maker originally got into marketing or what the interviewer’s career path has been.

, Before leaving an interview, get the interviewer’s business card. This will ensure you have the proper spelling of the individual’s name and also address. If there are multiple interviewers, be sure to collect all their cards. You’ll want to send a proper thank you note through the mail, not email, because your communication shouldn’t end when you leave the interview, and a personal note delivers a lasting positive impression.

Test your volume and sound quality.,
Stand with good posture.,
Improve your breathing techniques and diaphragm control with these three exercises:

Hissing: Take a deep breath and expel the air by hissing for as long as possible.,
Learn to articulate.,
Stand close to a wall and listen as you speak.,
Practice repeating phrases in an appropriately large room.",How to Project Your Voice (Without Yelling)," Ask a friend to stand at the other side of a large room and rate your volume and sound quality. This will give you an idea of how quiet you really are, and how much you have to improve. Setting reasonable goals is a must when learning to acquire a new skill
, Have your chin up, head straight, shoulders relaxed and back straight. When you breath in, completely fill your lungs will air.  Imagine your lungs filling with water from the bottom up. Place your hand on your abdomen to feel the rise and fall of your chest.  The key to projection is breathing from the diaphragm, Imagine the air seeping out of your lungs
Ahhh: Take a deep breath and expel the air by saying “ahhh” for as long as possible. This usually takes less time than the hissing version. Again, imagine the air leaving your lungs and being pushed into the room.
HA!: Take a deep breath and expel all of the air with a sudden, forceful, “HA!” sound. Repeat, gradually getting louder and louder.

, This can be complicated but the main thing to keep in mind is to pronounce each word distinctly and clearly by putting crisp emphasis on constants. Visualize the words you are saying, and focus on how your mouth and lips move., You should observe a small echo. As you move away from the wall, increase the loudness of your voice by increasing the volume of air you are expelling from your lungs. Check to see if you hear a small echo as you move into larger spaces. Make sure you are speaking from your chest, not your throat., Focus on how big of a breath you need take in. Gauge the amount of air you need to achieve your volume and sound quality goal. It may help to visualize your voice hitting a spot on the wall."

Talk, talk, talk.,
Sing.,
Cough.,
Keep your mouth open.,
Don't drink water.,
Consume acidic foods and/or dairy.,
Drink very cold water.",How to Lose Your Voice1," The most straightforward way to lose your voice is simply to use your voice box until it can't be used any more. Vocal activities like talking, shouting, singing, etc. require the vocal cords of the larynx to vibrate smoothly - with overuse, these cords can become inflamed, interfering with your ability to do these things. Try talking constantly at as loud of a volume as is reasonable for wherever you are. With persistence, your voice should eventually begin to fatigue.


If you're looking for opportunities to talk loudly and at great length, try signing up for a public speaking class or simply holding conversations in a crowded bar or club.;
, Singing can put serious demands on the vocal cords - singing at a high volume or in a very low or high register, even more so. These dangers are amplified if you're not a trained or experienced singer. So, for a sure-fire way to ruin your voice, try singing at full volume in a vocal register that's difficult for you.


Obviously, you'll want to make it a point to avoid performing warm-up exercises before you sing.
If you're embarrassed to sing loudly, try singing in the car with all of the doors closed and the windows rolled up. Other motorists will assume you're just singing along to the radio.

, Though it's not uncommon for people with colds to cough until they lose their voice, you don't necessarily have to have a cold to cough. Any kind of repeated coughing will irritate your larynx and eventually cause inflammation that can lead to losing your voice. Try combining your coughs with one of the other methods in this article for maximum effect.


As with shouting and singing, excessive coughing in the long term can cause lasting pain and damage to the throat.

, As discussed above, a dry throat is a throat that's easy to wear out. To speed up the process of losing your voice, allow your mouth and throat to dry out by keeping your mouth open throughout the day. This will work especially well if you live in a dry climate.


If you're worried about how you'll look after adopting a ""slack-jawed"" look, try sleeping with your mouth open instead so that no one will see you.

, Well-lubricated vocal cords are the enemy of anyone who's aiming to lose his or her voice. In fact, people who speak or sing in a professional capacity often keep a glass of water onstage to protect their vocal cords. If you're trying to lose your voice, do the opposite! Don't ease your worn-out vocal cords with a refreshing sip of water after you've been talking, yelling, or singing.


Be reasonable when it comes to this rule - don't avoid any source of moisture to the point that you become dehydrated.
If you're looking for a water alternative that will wear your throat out further, try a drink that's acidic or contains dairy (see below for more info).

, Certain types of food and drink, especially foods that are very acidic (lemon, vinegar, etc.) and dairy products cause most peoples' throats to produce phlegm. While phlegm won't irritate your vocal cords on its own, it does promote coughing, which can. So, if you're looking to lose your voice, try consuming these types of food and drink in conjunction with one of the other methods in this article.

, Some people find that very cold drinks can have a similar phlegm-producing effect to dairy and acidic foods and drinks. Try drinking an ice-cold glass of water to test its effects on your throat - if you find that you produce lots of phlegm after a cold drink, you may want to use this method to motivate yourself to cough.

Give a map of your speech.,
Determine your audience.,
Gauge the appropriate length of your introduction.,
Define your interest in the topic.,
Inject some humor.,
Pose a compelling question or use a catchy quote.,
Read the introduction out loud.,
Include tangible examples and images.,
Prepare a visual aid.,
Perfect your non-verbal cues.,
Choose your outfit.,
Scout out the space.,
Reduce any stress.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Introduce a Speech," What are the key ideas that your audience will take from the speech? What do you want them to remember when your speech is over and they return home?Avoid opening with any statements that will make your audience doubt your credibility. Don't say ""I wasn't given any time to prepare"" or ""I have been too stressed to focus on this."" Even if you haven't prepared thoroughly, pretend like you have.
Signpost your points. For example, in the introduction you could say something like ""Today I'll begin by talking to you about how to start a small business. I'll follow that with some marketing advice, and later I'll be talking about how to continue to grow your business."";
, The content and structure of your introduction will depend on the level of knowledge and interest of your audience. Are you speaking to an audience at a conference, where they might already have some knowledge or your topic? Or is this an audience that you are unfamiliar with and that has no prior knowledge of your topic?Consider the demographic of your audience. Are your listeners family members, friends or colleagues? Are you speaking on a cultural, scientific, political or economic issue? Are the members of your audience from very similar backgrounds or are they more diverse?If your audience is already generally informed on your topic, don't spend your introduction explaining very basic concepts. Your audience might find this to be insulting or patronizing.If your audience is uninformed on your topic, explain why they should care about it. How does it affect them? What should they gain from listening to your speech? Avoid using any jargon or complicated concepts that your audience might not be familiar with. They might easily become disinterested and distracted from your words., The introduction should be short, only about 10% of the length of the total speech. You have a limited amount of time to keep your audience captivated, so getting to the heart of your speech is important.Give yourself time to give your audience a map of your points, but don't use the introduction as a way to delay actually making those points in the body of your speech.

, How did you first become interested in the subject of your speech? How has your interest evolved since then?A very clear example or anecdote will draw in your audience early and help sustain their attention throughout the speech. For example, you could begin by saying ""I didn't start out a small business owner. I started out as a veterinarian, but after a few years I realized that my heart really lay in entrepreneurship. I'm here today to share my passion with you.""

, A joke will help capture your audience's interest and also give them a sense of your personality, making you more relatable and engaging.


If you are giving a speech in a professional setting, be sure to avoid profanity and anything that might offend some of your audience members. Stick to neutral jokes.
If you are giving a best man or maid of honor speech at a wedding, make sure your jokes are tasteful and don't include anything that could be truly hurtful toward the bride or groom or their families. Remember: it's a toast, not a roast., If humor is not an appropriate hook for your audience, use another rhetorical device to capture their interest. Is there a question you would like for the audience to consider as you give your speech? Is there an important metaphor or allegory you are using to illustrate your overall points? If so, then include these in your introduction.If you have an inspiring quote you want to use to represent your points, then you can consider using this as well. But beware of using anything that is too cliche or trite. It might prompt your audience to doubt your originality.

, Introducing a speech is an auditory experience; you have to make sure it can be followed by the ear, not the eye.


Generally avoid long, rambling sentences or cramming multiple ideas into one long sentence. Your audience will struggle to follow your train of thought if you don't provide pauses in your speech.
Use simple, common language. Unless you are speaking to an audience with specialized knowledge, you should avoid using any jargon or obscure vocabulary.Read with a highlighter in hand. If you cannot read a sentence in one normal breath, highlight it. It's too long, and you'll need to shorten it.

, If you speak in obscure, abstract language, your audience will quickly lose interest. Instead, incorporate concrete examples to support your ideas.


Imagine trying to draw an image with words as you tell a story. If you are using an anecdote, give compelling details that are relevant to the story. Describe important details, like the physical setting of the story and your emotional reaction to specific events.
For example, in a best man speech you could say something like ""The first time I met Jake, he was covered in mud and bruised from head to toe. We had just finished running the Tough Mudder race, and right from the start, I knew he was going to be a one-of-a-kind friend.""

, You will find the introduction is a good time to discuss any visual aids you are incorporating into the speech. Perhaps you have a powerpoint, a slideshow or a handout. Alert your audience to your plan to refer to this aid in the speech.

You can also include an key quote or example on a visual aid that encapsulates your main thesis (or argument) in the speech.
Don't overwhelm your audience with text in the visual aid. A few punchy visuals and bullet points are more effective than walls of words.

, Delivering a speech is not simply an act of reading. Rather, you have to use many non-verbal cues to engage your audience.Make eye contact. Whether you are speaking to just a handful of people, or a room filled with thousands, you should try to make eye contact with different members of the audience. It will show your audience that you are not just reading your ideas out loud, but are trying to make a genuine connection with them.
Use engaging facial expressions. Smile when you discuss something pleasant; if you are discussing something somber, your face should reflect this. Using engaging facial expressions will give the audience an indication of how to react to your ideas.
Be mindful of your gestures. If you plan to walk around a stage as you give your introduction, you might move one hand in a slight circular motion as you talk. But make sure you don't gesticulate wildly or in a way that will distract your audience.
Practice in front of an audience. Try to give a practice run of your introduction and speech in front of a few friends. This will give you the opportunity to become comfortable with non-verbal cues.
Practice in the mirror. If you don't have a live audience you can practice in front of, then you should try delivering your speech in front of a mirror. This will give you a clear sense of your posture, your expression and your gestures as you talk.

, This might seem like a small detail, but if you can pick your outfit ahead of time, it will remove stress later.


Pick something comfortable and that you know will suit you. Dark colors tend to hide stains or sweat marks more effectively than light colors.
Don't pick something with a really busy pattern. You'll end up distracting the audience.

, If you can, try to visit the venue where you will be delivering the speech ahead of time. You will get a sense of the placement of the audience, the lighting and any necessary technology beforehand.

, Public speaking can be nerve-wracking, but it is easily mastered with practice. There are many stress-saving steps you can take to make sure you deliver a great speech.

Exercise before giving the speech. Exercise can curb the production cortisol in your system, thus reducing your overall levels of stress. It also releases endorphins that will keep your stress at a minimum.Listen to other famous speeches. You can read to speeches delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., President John F. Kennedy, President Barack Obama, President Ronald Reagan to get inspiration on how to deliver your views with passion and confidence. Watch Ted Talks presentations will also feature compelling public speakers.

, Nothing will make you feel more confident going into your speech than knowing it back-to-front. If you practice repeatedly, you will be able to speak more conversationally rather than in a stiff, stilted cadence.

Yell.,
Give yourself a cold.,
Aggravate your allergies.,
Don't give your voice a chance to rest.",How to Lose Your Voice2," The harder you work your vocal cords, the quicker you'll wear them out. Yelling and screaming strains your vocal cords much more than ordinary talking and should lead to a hoarse or lost voice in a fraction of the time. For maximum results, try yelling as loudly as you possibly can. Keep in mind, however, that yelling like this can be quite painful and may even lead to lasting damage.


If you're worried about bothering people with your yelling, try attending an event where people are encouraged to yell, like a sporting event or rock concert.

, Often, when someone loses his or her voice, it's as a result of a recent cold. If you're really serious about losing your throat, consider putting yourself in situations where you're likely to catch a cold. For instance, you may want to spend time around friends with colds and get less sleep than you're used to. Obviously, however, giving yourself a cold on purpose can result in many unpleasant side effects, including fever, nausea, aches, and general malaise, so stay far away from cold viruses unless you're really serious about losing your voice!


It may go without saying, but, to be perfectly clear, it's never a good idea to knowingly expose yourself to serious diseases. Use common sense.

, Allergies are known to cause throat irritation and hoarseness under certain circumstances.If you have a history of mild allergies and have gotten sore throats from your allergies in the past, you may want to expose yourself to allergens to help you lose your voice. For instance, if you have seasonal allergies triggered by pollen, in addition to using one of the methods above, you may want to go for a walk in the park and smell some flowers!


If you have a serious allergy, don't flirt with danger by triggering an allergic reaction simply to lose your voice. Severe allergy attacks can be fatal.

, With time, the body will heal most throat irritation on its own. If you want to lose your voice, don't let this happen! The less you allow your larynx to rest, the quicker you'll be able to lose your voice. Push through the fatigue!


Keep in mind, however, that you put your voice at risk by doing so. Wearing your voice out (especially doing so over and over again over a long period of time) can cause permanent vocal damage. For example, many once-powerful singers find themselves with diminished abilities after years of vocal fatigue.

Make some mental notes first.,

, All skills take practice, and good conversation skills are no different.If you have a big speech to give or an important conversation coming up, it can be helpful to practice it with yourself in the mirror beforehand. This way, you'll at least have a run through in your mind already before you attempt the real thing.

It shows attentiveness and interest in what's being said. Increased eye contact is associated with credibility and dominance, so it is important to maintain solid eye contact when speaking to someone.

, Something as simple as a smile can completely change the way a conversation goes. Smiling helps us form and sustain interpersonal relationships, so it is an essential part of communicating with others.

, Your body language should be relaxed. This means that you should not cross your arms or stiffen your body. Keeping your arms open invites reciprocated communication rather than sending a message of being closed and unreceptive.

, Your tone of voice can be an immediate deciding factor for how someone interprets what you say. You could say a phrase in a positive tone and someone would interpret it positively, while saying the same thing in a harsh tone would lead to a negative interpretation.

, Verbal communication is different than other forms of communication in that it is easier to get off topic, which can make it hard to remember what the conversation was really supposed to be about. This is confusing for your listener. So, stay on topic.

, Before you start talking, you should be confident that you can achieve the goal you have for engaging in this conversation. If you are unsure of yourself, your conversation partner will be less receptive to your message.

, Making and maintaining eye contact is crucial when speaking to people, whether one-on-one or in a group setting. It shows attentiveness and interest in what's being said. Increased eye contact is associated with credibility and dominance, so it is important to maintain solid eye contact when speaking to individuals or to a group.

This is especially important when addressing groups of people because it is a simple way to build a foundational relationship with people you may not have any one-on-one interaction with. Smiling helps us form and sustain interpersonal relationships, so it is an essential part of communicating with others.

, Do not speak in hurry, as it will make the listener think that you are confused or that you don't know what you're talking about. Speak slowly and confidently.

, From the standpoint of a listener, a sarcastic remark requires a process of decoding and interpretation before they can understand what has been said, what has been meant, and if the two are the same., Everyone likes to laugh, so humor can be a great way to lighten up your conversation and make your listener more receptive to your message.


Note: Of course, you should avoid vulgar or inappropriate humor to avoid offending your listener.

, Your body language should be relaxed. This means that you should not cross your arms or stiffen your body.


When addressing groups of people, it is important to use your hand gestures to emphasize your message.Try not to be overly animated, but don't keep your arms stiff at your side either.

, Your audience won't put any stock in what you say if you act unsure or timid. You have to show your listeners that you believe in your message before you can expect them to believe you too.

While you can use Google Voice from mobile devices, you will need to download and install separate apps rather than using an extension for Chrome. This tutorial only focuses on using Google Voice via Chrome directly on computers or notebooks.;
, Begin by clicking on the menu in the top right corner of the Chrome window. It's the one that looks like three horizontal lines (≡). Then select ""More Tools"" from the dropdown menu that appears after clicking the menu, and then click on Extensions. This will take you to a page featuring a variety of popular Chrome extensions.

, Simply perform a query for ""Google Voice"" in the search box located on the upper, lefthand side of the page.

, After performing a search, you'll find the ""Google Voice (by Google)"" option under the Extensions section. Click on the blue ""Add to Chrome"" button to its right.

, You'll find this icon along with an introductory message added to your toolbar immediately after adding the extension to Chrome. Upon clicking the icon for the first time, you'll be directed to a new tab with a ""Getting Started"" screen. First accept the Terms and Conditions in order to proceed.

, Note that you may either select ""I want a new number"" or ""I want to use my mobile number."" For this step, select the latter, enter your phone number and then click ""Check for available options."" You'll then see a list of the different kinds of Google Voice accounts that can be linked to your number.


Note that you must have a mobile phone in order to select this option. Should you do so, you can access additional Google Voice functionality like having voicemail transcribed online and sent to you via email or text. You can learn more about how to set up Google Voice at ].Though only some account types are available to some customers, there are several varieties available in general. They include: Sprint (which uses your Sprint number), Number Porting and Google Voice Lite. You can learn more about their respective functionality at: https://support.google.com/voice/answer/115073?hl=en&ref_topic=3038506&rd=1.
Porting your number will incur a one-time $20 fee from Google and may also trigger early cancellation fees from your prior carrier., Select the ""I want a new number"" option when prompted. If you decide to create a new number, Google Voice requires that you provide a forwarding number associated with a home, work or mobile phone. This phone will ring via call forwarding when your Google Voice number is called. Add your phone number and allow Google Voice to call the phone so that you can verify it.

, You'll likely find Chrome located in your Dock or Taskbar, among your Applications or on your desktop. Simply click the Chrome icon to launch the program.

, You can launch the extension either by clicking the phone icon on your toolbar or by navigating to https://www.google.com/voice.

, This button is located at the top, left hand side of your screen. Clicking it will begin the call process and prompt you for the number you wish to dial and the number from which you'll be placing your call.

, You may type a phone number or contact's name in the ""Number to call"" box, or you can also click on any number in Chrome that you want to call (e.g. a business for which you've searched).

, Just select the dropdown menu next to the ""Phone to call with"" box and choose your preferred number in the event you have more than one linked to Google Voice. To have Google Voice set this as your default option, check the box next to ""Remember my choice.""You may alternatively direct a call to one of your contacts by clicking on Google Contacts on the left hand side of your Google Voice screen. Then click on one of your saved contacts and hover over his or her phone number. Finally, click the phone icon that appears next to the number.

, Simply click ""Connect"" to call directly through your phone. Remember that if you're dialing one of your Google Contacts, you need only click the phone icon appearing next to his or her number in order to place the call.

, Click on the phone icon on your Chrome toolbar to listen to recent voicemail, and you can also place calls to those who tried to reach you. Click Call in the top, right hand side to place these calls.

, You can opt to have either your caller's number or your Google Voice number appear as caller ID when receiving a call (the latter option denoting that someone has dialed your Google Voice number rather than your mobile number). To set your preference, click on the ""Calls"" tab under ""Google Voice Settings."" Then click the radio button associated with either ""Display caller's number"" or ""Display my Google number.""

, This will enable you to determine whether you wish to take a call depending on the nature of the caller's voicemail. Begin by pressing 2 from your phone when receiving the call and then remain on the line. If you opt to accept the call while listening to the voicemail, simply press * on your phone.

, Open Google Voice and click the ""Settings"" (gear icon) at the top, righthand corner of your screen. Select the ""Calls"" tab under ""Settings"" and then check the box next to ""Do Not Disturb"" if you want your calls sent to voicemail. You can also specify an amount of time you for which you want calls sent to voicemail by indicating your preference next to the ""Ends in"" text.

, If you haven't used your Google Voice account for an extended period, you may receive an email from Google notifying you that the number you created with Google Voice has been ""reclaimed."" If you'd like to keep that number, sign into Google Voice and select ""Get a Google Voice Number"" on the lefthand side of your inbox or from the ""Phones"" tab. Then enter your current Google Voice number and click ""Search."" Select that number when it appears. You'll have 30 days to complete this process after receiving the reclamation notice.

, When trying to reach your Google Voice number, some callers may receive an error message. They may need to dial ""1"" before entering the rest of your Google Voice number. If that doesn't solve the problem, double-check that you haven't inadvertently blocked that caller. Finally, the issue may be associated with that caller's carrier, so you may want to determine if there's a consistent problem with callers from that carrier and contact customer service.

, If you or any of your contacts have had difficulty leaving voicemail when using Google Voice, you may wish to link your account to a different phone and see if the problem persists. If that doesn't solve the problem, you or your contact should try again in an hour. Finally, if all else fails, report the problem to the Google Voice Help Forum.

, Google Voice maintains that its call quality is linked entirely to the phones being used. So if you're noticing issues with call quality (e.g. echoes or static), it's likely related to your phone or carrier. If you believe otherwise, Google Voice encourages you to rate the quality of specific calls located under you ""History,"" ""Received,"" and ""Placed"" labels. Simply click the ""x"" box next to the ""Call quality?"" text located in the bottom, righthand corner of the call listing.

Know who your audience is.,
Read it like a story: A logical progression of ideas will make for a clean presentation.,
Give the whole picture, then zoom in: As Robert Anholt says in Dazzle 'em with Style: You can't lead your audience anywhere if you haven't given them a reason for following you.,
Use lots of examples: You can't use enough examples, because they are going to be the parts that the audience remembers most.,
Smile!,
Focus on the intangibles: audience attention, hand movements, posture, tone of voice.,
Remember who your audience is: If you find there is a large diversity of both knowledge, experience, and personality traits in the room, then please don't feel like you have to completely change the style and delivery of your talk.,
Keep a critical eye: This is mainly for the sake of your own work and presentation layout.,
Know your topic: This doesn't mean that when you get up at the front of the room you have to tell them everything you know.,
Get plenty of rest beforehand: Maximizing the amount of healthy rest you get beforehand will remove the distraction of tiredness and allow you channel the passion and focus you have for your subject and topic at hand.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Post-Presentation: Follow up with people who had additional questions that you didn't get to cover in the lecture.",How to Make a Scientific or Technical Presentation," This involves preparing your presentation beforehand and listening to your audience during the presentation to find out what they need and don't need. Usually you don't have to involve the audience as you are speaking, but if the talk is more of a;
, Your audience will remember what you were talking about if they can visually construct an image in their heads. Make sure there is a clear beginning and end if you are making a scientific presentation about a complex area of research. However, not all presentations need to be structured this way; for example, if you are making a proposal about a new business plan or idea that you want to develop, it may be interesting to flash images at the audience as you talk about them, giving them a more real and personal understanding of your idea.

, Take the specific and place it in the context of what you have explained to be important or true in the general scientific community.

, If they are not relevant, the audience will lose the greater purpose of what you are trying to talk about.

, Remember, you are the presentation, not the slides or whatever medium you choose to go with. Your presentation is only as good as the way you present it, so let your passion for the subject show in the words you say and the movements you make. If you can make the audience excited about the topic, chances are they won't get lost and stop paying attention. Visual aids should contain all the information your audience needs, but it shouldn't be what helps them understand it. Your purpose is to translate that information and uncover its meaning and relevance.

, If you know you tend to sway back and forth, or clap your hands between each point you make, adjust your style beforehand to minimize anything distracting. The more you practice and give talks, the more you will know yourself and understand your strengths and weaknesses.

, You don't have to! The content of your presentation will stay mostly the same, but how you choose to state it will more or less change.

, Even detail of your work will be seen by a different set of eyes each time you make your presentation, which means that any mistake will stand out to at least one person in the room. Even more important than your grammar is how you handle the structure and organization of your ideas. Remember that if you can't explain how you got from one step to the next, the audience will be just as confused as you are.

, Know your topic well that you can offhandedly create a well executed argument in clear and simple terms. This will not only please those who are well-versed in the subject, but keep the younger and less experienced individuals on their toes and attentive.

, You are less likely to make mistakes in your speaking and more likely to speak clearly if you are completely focused on the subject matter.

, The main reason you should do this is to cut down or lengthen the presentation to the ideal time. When you actually says words verbally, you get a sense for how long it takes to convey a particular idea and when it is time to move on to the next subject. The other reason you should practice is for your own sake, so that you know when your next slide is coming up and what it says, so you can start talking and introducing the audience to your topic before it gets to them. The process of practicing will help you gain more confidence as you speak, as well as familiarize yourself with your topic.

, Conduct a survey or brief questionnaire to see if people really understood the basic concepts of your talk. You might want to ask some questions about your presentation style, but also about the material itself, so you can see which aspects you can stress more and which ones aren't as worthwhile.

Determine where to get your pizza.,
Decide on pickup or delivery.,
Choose your pizza and toppings.,
Choose drinks or any extras.,
Write down larger orders.",How to Order a Pizza Over the Phone1," Make sure you order from a pizza restaurant that accepts orders over the phone for delivery or pickup/takeout. Check the website for the pizza place, or call their phone number to briefly ask if they do deliveries or will let you order something in advance and pick it up when it’s ready.


If you want the pizza delivered, check to make sure that you live within an area that the pizza place will deliver to. If you’re outside the city limits of where the restaurant is, for instance, that may be beyond their maximum mileage for deliveries.
Make sure you also have a type of payment that the pizza restaurant accepts. For instance, you will likely want to have cash for a delivery and not plan to use a check in stores that don’t accept them. Have several types of payments ready just in case.;
, Choose whether you’d like to have your pizza delivered straight to your door, or simply go pick it up from the store location. Deliveries are great for convenience, while carry-outs are good when you’re on your way somewhere.


Note that the potential downside to delivery is that there may be an extra delivery fee added to the cost of your food, and unexpected delays can occur with your driver.
The potential downsides to a pickup/carry-out order are that you have to get to the location to pick up the pizza yourself, which may take longer. This may be a particular challenge if you don’t own a car, can’t get a ride, or can’t use public transportation.

, Consult an online or paper menu for the pizza place you wish to order from to make your selections. Or choose an item that is common or that you’ve ordered before, like a plain cheese pizza.


Consider pizza size, type of crust, toppings, and any other options available. You may need to ask how large a size of pizza is to determine what you’ll need, but otherwise the choices are entirely up to you.
Look for menus online from most chain pizzerias. Take note if they have certain items that are only available in-store and not for delivery or takeout.

, Don’t forget about drinks, appetizers, desserts, or any other dishes that you may want along with your pizza. Consult the menu to find out your options.


Also consider the specifications you may need to make when you order on the phone. Decide on a Small, Medium, or Large beverage, for example, or the kind of dressing you want on a salad if given the option.
Take a look at the menu, website, or any promotional material you may have received or heard about that provides a special offer or discount on ordering other items with your pizza, or even additional pizzas. You might want to add to your order to take advantage of a deal.

, Make placing the order easier for yourself and the person taking the order by knowing exactly what you want, which can be difficult with a large group of people or large order. Write it all down on a piece of paper you can look at while you’re on the phone.


Make sure everyone in a group comes to a firm agreement on the order before you place the call, and they understand they can’t make changes or additions once you’re on the phone. You can even go into another room to find some peace and quiet for the call if you need to.Don’t hesitate to write down any order, even if it’s a small one, as it can help you to remember and speak more clearly when on the phone.

"
"
Say a polite greeting and your type of order first.,
Clearly state your pizza order.,
Give your address and phone number for delivery.,
Confirm the price and thank the employee.",How to Order a Pizza Over the Phone2," When someone at the pizza place answers the phone and says hello, say hello back and state whether you’re ordering for delivery or pickup. You should specify this before any other details.


Don’t be surprised if you are put on hold. Pizza places can get busy, especially around popular meal times, and they may not have someone available right away to take your order. Wait patiently for just a minute or two until someone comes back on the line.
You can say, “Hello, I’d like to place an order for delivery” or “Hello, I’d like to place an order for pickup.”

, Give your exact pizza order, including details about size and toppings. Don’t forget any add-ons, like drinks or side dishes. Speak slowly and clearly so the employee taking your order can understand you.


State your order beginning with the size of the pizza, then the type of crust (if options are available). Follow that with the toppings you want, in no particular order. This is the easiest way for an employee to take down your pizza order.Read off your order if you wrote it down so that you don’t miss anything. Remember that the person taking your order must record it all too, so speak slowly enough to give them time to do so.
After you state your food order, you may also provide the appropriate numbers or codes for a coupon or gift card, if you have one for the pizzeria and want to use it for your order. It’s best to do this on the phone, otherwise it may take time and hassle to adjust your price later.

, If you’re making an order meant for delivery, provide any contact information they need when asked. This typically includes your name, a phone number that they can reach you at, and your current physical address.


Don’t forget to provide your apartment or unit number if you live in a building or complex with more than one. Also give out any access instructions or an area you can agree to meet your delivery person outside the building.
It helps to provide a recognizable landmark or any special instructions about where you live to the person taking your order, especially if it may be difficult to find. For example, you could say “between the post office and yellow apartment buildings” or “the house with the blue door.”
If you placed an order to pick up, they will only need your name and phone number, not an address.

, Ask for the price of your order, and the estimated time it will be delivered or ready for pickup, if they haven’t already told you this information. Answer any other questions and confirm the order before you hang up the phone.


The person taking your order will likely repeat what you’ve ordered back to you so that you can make sure they got everything right. Tell them “correct” if it’s right, or state any corrections or changes if it's wrong.
He or she will then give you a total price, which will have any discounts you used excluded, as well as possible fees added on if tax applies or there is a delivery charge. Make sure this is the price you expect, then write it down if you need to to remember it.
Say “thank you, goodbye” to end the call, then hang up the phone.

"
"
Pay by phone if using a credit card for delivery.,
Have payment ready, including tip.,
Wait for a delivery.,
Head to the store at the right time for pickup.",How to Order a Pizza Over the Phone3," Specify that you want to pay with a credit card while on the phone ordering for delivery. While some companies may have delivery people equipped with modern conveniences like Square to swipe your card, you can typically expect to pay for a delivery in cash unless you specify otherwise.


Have your credit card on hand when you specify that you’d like to pay with one. Then give the information for the card to the employee on the phone. You can request to add a tip on at that time, write in a tip on the receipt that comes with your pizza, or give a separate cash tip to the driver when he or she arrives.
If you’ve placed an order for carry-out, many forms of payment, including credit cards, are accepted at the store itself, where you will pay when you pick up your food. If you’re unsure about a method of payment, ask while you’re still on the phone.

, Be ready for the pizza delivery driver, or show up to the pizza location, with a form of payment that covers the amount given to you on the phone. You’ll also need enough for a suitable tip for whoever served you.


Add a tip of 15-20% of your order total. Some pizzerias suggest that for any order under $20, you should tip a minimum of $3 to make the delivery worthwhile for your driver.You can always tip more for excellent service, complicated orders, or bad weather, but never tip less that 15% on regular orders or 10% on large orders.Pizza delivery drivers often rely on tips to supplement a low hourly income rate and cover the costs of using their own car.
Some restaurants have a delivery fee on top of the typical price for the food. They will tell you the total price with this fee included on the phone. Note that this fee is not a tip for your delivery driver; you still need to provide one.

, Stay at the address you gave over the phone if you ordered for delivery. Be prepared to answer the door and make payment when someone knocks, rings the doorbell, or you get a call from the delivery driver.


While you’re waiting, go turn on the porch light outside your home if it is dark or getting dark outside, so that the delivery person is better able to find their way and know that you’re home.You can also use the wait time to calculate the tip on your order total and get the money for the total amount ready, to have on hand or by the door. This will make payment quicker and easier.

, Wait for the call from the pizza place saying your pizza is ready, or the time frame during which you were told you may pick it up. Then go to the location to pick up and pay for your food.


Factor in the time it will take you to get to the pizzeria when you decide on a time to leave.
If you arrive earlier than the time they suggest or call you, your order will likely not be ready and you will have to wait. If you arrive much later than suggested, your pizza will likely not taste as fresh or be as hot.

Also look at texts. You can’t read the message of the text, but you can note the time it was sent and the recipient.Promptly raise questionable calls with your children. For example, if you don’t recognize a phone number, ask your child who they were talking to.

File your lawsuit.,
Make a request for production.,
Subpoena phone records from the phone company.",How to Obtain Phone Records3," Probably the only way to get someone else’s phone records legally is to request them as part of a lawsuit. You must have a lawsuit already going on, and you can’t file a lawsuit simply because you’re curious about what’s in someone’s phone records. Instead, phone records are usually requested as part of the following:


Divorce proceedings. You might claim that your spouse has been unfaithful, which could impact whether you get alimony. You can request phone records.
Criminal trials. For example, the prosecutor might try to connect a defendant in a bank robbery to the driver of the getaway car. They can help establish a relationship using phone records.
Business lawsuits. In any lawsuit, it might matter whether two people talked. For example, in a fraud lawsuit, you might want to prove someone spoke to you on a certain date.

, In most lawsuits, there is a phase called “discovery.” The purpose is to let each side request documents and information from the other side. As part of discovery, you can request production of the other person’s phone records.


Ask for specific records. For example, identify the months or date range. If you make an unreasonable request—“all phone records in your life”—then the judge won’t allow the request. You should always have a reason why these records are important to the case.
If you don’t know how to make a request for production, then you should work with an attorney. You can find an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral., If the other person won’t hand over their phone records, then you can subpoena them directly from the phone company. A subpoena is a legal command to turn over documents. To request documents, you will need a subpoena duces tecum. Because it can be complicated to request and serve properly, you might want to consult with a lawyer.


You should find out the name of the person in charge of the phone company’s records department. Call up and ask. You will need to serve the subpoena on this person.
There should be a request form you can fill out. Check with the court clerk for the courthouse. You can also search online, since some legal service organizations publish forms.The process for getting the subpoena authorized will vary by state and even court. Often, you’ll need to file the subpoena request with the court clerk and wait for the judge to sign off on it.
You also must serve the subpoena properly, depending on the law. Acceptable service might be personal hand-delivery, first class mail, certified mail, or another method.

Do not hack into someone’s account.,
Avoid opening someone’s mail.,
Don’t steal someone’s phone.",How to Obtain Phone Records4," It is illegal to use someone’s password and username to access an online account. You may be committing identity theft and/or computer fraud.Accordingly, you should resist the temptation to access someone else’s phone records.


There are no exceptions to the law because you suspect your spouse is cheating on you or think your business partner is trying to steal money from you.
If you are convicted of computer fraud in the U.S., then you could go to prison for up to 20 years and pay a fine.A better strategy is to ask to have a conversation and explain what is bothering you. If you are afraid someone is cheating, then raise those concerns. Say, ""Can we find some time to talk? I'm afraid we're growing apart.""

, It’s also illegal to take someone’s mail and open it yourself. Stop yourself before you pinch someone’s phone records and review them. You could go to jail for five years for intentionally opening someone else’s mail.There is no exception because you live in the same apartment or house with the person or because you gave them the phone.
However, someone can give you permission to open their mail. Opening mail is illegal only when done without permission.

, Another way to find out who someone has been talking to is to look at their call logs. Most cell phones and smart phones store this information. You might be tempted to pick up someone’s phone and scroll through to see who they have been talking to.


Avoid taking someone’s phone, even for a brief period of time. You could be breaking multiple laws.

Measure.,
Categorize the calls appropriately.,
Use skill-based routing.,
Roster staff based on volume.,
Monitor, record and review.,
Update training.,
Display call status prominently.,
Ensure that the call center is able to handle large amount of simultaneous calls.,
Ensure an ability to transfer and forward calls.,
Get a response menu.,
Keep in contact with customers.",How to Optimize Call Center Performance," Information is critical. Keep a thorough database of every call, when it arrived, how long it took to answer, how long it lasted, who answered it, how many times it was transferred and to whom, and (very important) the category of the call. It is also vital to score and measure performance on calls. Too many call centers are obsessed with productivity metrics and don't focus on how their agents actually perform on the phone. This is bad. Use a tool that scores calls like LogMyCalls or HyperQuality.;
, There will always be some kind of “miscellaneous” bucket in the database for calls that don’t fall into one of the predetermined categories. Make sure the Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) make good notes on all calls, but especially the miscellaneous ones; you’ll use these notes to determine if new categories need to be created. Remember that calls in different categories will take differing amounts of time to handle.

, As your categories develop, you can route different types of calls to the CSR pool most adequately trained to handle them. This will reduce the amount of time needed to handle individual calls. Depending on the size of your call center you might have anywhere from a few to a few dozen different staff categories (many people will be cross-trained in multiple categories).

, This is stating the obvious, but you will typically use a combination of Call Volume, Call Duration, Time-to-Answer and SLO Percentage to estimate the staff you need at any given hour.


An Erlang-C calculator is an excellent tool to help determine how many staff you need based on volume, duration and SLO (Erlang-B calculators are used to determine how many incoming trunks you need).
The results can also be used to predict abandon time and percentages.

, You absolutely must have staff that reviews recorded conversations. Those people are process improvement specialists that help identify what went right and what could be improved on the calls. The work product is a list of training improvements that will help the CSRs serve the callers better and faster.

, Keep your CSRs trained. One training session before they start is just not enough. The CSRs need to be regularly trained on the improvements developed by the process improvement specialists. One or two days of training each quarter is a reasonable place to start, to keep training new and interesting.

, There is some data to indicate that when the call statistics displayed so the CSRs can see them, performance spontaneously improves. The rationale behind this is the human psychological desire to compete and win. People feel naturally rewarded when their game improves. There are many vendors that sell light boards that will interface with your systems.

, In bigger call centers, hundreds of clients can call simultaneously. Therefore, it is important that the calls be queued and while the call is on hold, play a relaxing music.

, There are cases when the agent is not able to resolve the customer’s problem and then the agent has to be able to forward the call to a technician.


Call center software is good if it is able to handle a large amount of simultaneous calls as well as containing functions essential for the agent’s work, such as call queue, hold, transfer, call recording, IVR menu and e-mail handling.

, Every bigger call center has an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) menu that removes a lot of strain from the agents, because it helps the customers with basic services, usually with their account transactions or they can get their billing information.


Call centers have many functions that make the everyday life of their agents easier, such as auto dialer applications and the screen pops with useful information.

, This means not only by phone but by e-mail and fax too.

, It can be weird if you actually call with the sole purpose of talking. (For example, ""I'm calling to thank you for inviting me to your party,"" or ""Can you tell me what the homework was?"" or even ""Did you see that episode of Supernatural?"")

, Think of all the reasons they will be happy to hear from you.

, Inhale through the nose for seven counts, hold for four counts, and exhale for eight counts. Do this three times.

, Make sure you do it slowly and concentrate.

, What's up?"" This gives them a chance to tell you it's a bad time.

, It can help spark conversation. (For example, ""Thanks for inviting me to your party. What gifts did you get?"" or ""Can you believe what Summer did on The O.C.?"")

, Ask any possible question that pops into your head. (For example, ""Thanks for inviting me to your party. What gifts did you get? Who gave that to you? What was your favorite? Were you hoping for anything else? I have one of those..."")

, A little preparation can go a long way...

Take care of your body.,
Get to know your students, and help them get to know you.,
Lecture less.,
Encourage discussion.,
Bring in other voices.,
Insist that they listen.,
Listen to your students.",How to Improve Listening Skills in the Classroom," If you get easily distracted in class, try visualizing a tunnel between yourself and the instructor. Doors opening and closing, students getting up and sitting down, and other noises and movements can really snag your attention if you don't regulate it. Train yourself to block out distractions. When the instructor isn't talking, imagine a tunnel between your face and the material you're supposed to be focusing on.If you catch yourself listening to distracting noise or turning your head to look at someone leaving the room, remind yourself that they are outside the tunnel.
The more you practice this, the better you'll do.;
, This is a technique for regulating your attention. Whenever your attention drifts, remind yourself to ""be here now."" You can also state (in your head) the topic at hand. Remember that when your teacher is talking, you are trying to learn what he or she is saying, and you need to be present to hear it.


You may notice your attention has drifted because you are thinking about something else, not taking notes, or fidgeting., It's hard to listen in class if you're worried about other things. If you notice your mind returning to other work you have to do, make a note in your planner that you will worry at a certain time, say 4:15-4:30. Keep the date with yourself! Knowing that you have time to think will help you clear your mind and focus on class., Sit in the front row, in the middle of the class, as close to the teacher as you can get. Students who do this get substantially higher grades than students who sit back or to the side. Get in early on the first day and stake out a seat, and stick to it.


You will hear better if you are in the front row, as well as see better.
It's harder for your attention to wander if the instructor can see your face.

, Answer questions, and ask questions when you get lost or when you have a thought. If your class is discussion based, be an active participant. Respond to other students' comments as well as the teacher's. If it is a lecture, write down questions as you go, and see if the professor answers them.


At a moment of pause, ask the questions if they haven't been answered.
Participating in discussion will stop you from drifting off. However, don't just wait for your turn to speak. The conversation may move on, and you don't want to zone out while you formulate your statement, only to miss a crucial point.
If you participate, your ideas will become part of the work of the classroom. This means that you are implicated in the discussion—the instructor will direct comments at you, as may other students. Hearing your name will keep you actively listening.

, Before each class, go over your homework and notes from the previous class. If you had to solve problems, go through them slowly and explain to yourself what the key concepts were and how you worked them out.Jot down any questions you were left with, as well as ideas you get from the reading.


This may prepare you for questions your instructor will ask during class. It will also fill your head with material relevant to the class ahead, so that the new information you hear will have something to connect to.

, Don't write down everything the professor says, but write the main themes, and try to group information that seems related. Underline key points. Keep writing questions, and answer them if you can. If your notes point you to a question you can't answer, ask it in class, or ask another student after.


Listen for clues before a lecture begins that will help you organize your notes. Your professor might say something like ""I am going to discuss three main points…"" ""Now I want to move on to…"" ""Let's not forget to mention the contribution of…"" ""To summarize…""
Take note when words or phrases are being repeated. Underline or circle in your notes any words that seem to be significant.

, If you try to copy everything down, you won't take anything in. Your main task is to listen and engage. Use shorthand for repeated words and references. Don't copy slides if they're going to be available online or in a handout.If you have a handout, write brief notes in the margins instead of having a separate page of notes.
Skim your handout beforehand so you have an idea of the content of the lecture.
If you are dyslexic or cannot write notes and listen at the same time, ask if you can get help. Some schools have professional note-takers, some teachers will help you arrange to share notes with a classmate, and some teachers don't mind if you record the class and listen again later, taking notes and pausing.

, Check in with yourself as your class goes by. If you are feeling hyper, take a few deep breaths and try to relax your body. If you are feeling sleepy, sit up straight and stretch a little. Check in at the beginning of class, at break, and whenever you notice yourself acting unfocused.


Notice how you are sitting—are you tapping your foot? Tearing paper? Doodling? Staring out the window? Adjust yourself in your seat and remind yourself to focus on the lecture.
Regulate your emotions. Check in with your emotional state as well as your energetic state. Are you down on yourself? Sad? Happy? Worried?
State how you feel instead of pushing it away. Take a minute to think ""I am anxious"" or ""I am proud"" so that you own it and it doesn't distract you.

, Get a full night's sleep every night. Adults need 7-8 hours of sleep a night, and teenagers need 9-11 hours.Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Come to campus with water and a healthy, satisfying snack on hand, like nuts or fruit.


Shift in your seat to stay alert, and get up and walk around during the break. Your mind wakes up when your body does.

, Students will zone out less if they think of you as a person, not an authority figure. Encourage students to speak to you before and after class, or in office hours if you have them. Have your students include some of their own personal experience in discussions and writing assignments, and share material from your life if it is appropriate.You can maintain professional boundaries without acting cold or inhuman. Don't probe for information about your student's personal lives, but know that their personal experience informs their thought processes, and they will be interested in how your personal experience informs yours.

, Lectures are effective at delivering information, but they are not effective for stimulating thought, teaching values, or inspiring interest in a subject. When you lecture, keep it brief and informative, or break it up with other forms of work: group discussions, pair presentations, or individual reflection and problem-solving.When you do lecture, show slides, and engage students in questions and answers.Change approaches every 10-15 minutes to keep students engaged.

, Your students will think more critically if they are debating (and learning from) one another. Discuss daily with a smaller class, and put them in groups if your class is large. If your students are hesitant to disagree with you, take yourself out of the mix—have them sit in a circle and talk, and observe them, taking notes, from the margins. Only interfere if they are behaving badly or not being rigorous., Have students listen to guest speakers, and video or audio clips. Give them worksheets, or tell them what information to look for, to encourage them to listen actively and take efficient notes. Your students will learn how to listen to you if you give them exercises that teach them how to listen to others., Every few minutes, ask questions and check for comprehension. Call on students who are not speaking. Encourage them to ask you questions and to respond to one another. Don't design your class to be attendance-optional. Portions of your class should only be available from attentive attendance. #*You may share slides online, but your students should be getting information from you and from class discussion.Connect their homework and tests to material and critical thinking they perform in class.
Do this from the first day, so that they get in the habit of paying close attention.
Hold them accountable for listening to you and to one another. Ask them to restate your points and things their classmates say.

, Model attentive listening by paying close attention when your students talk. Rather than trying to anticipate their questions, or supplying words for them, let them struggle to get it out. When they have, echo what they say back to them. Restate their question to let them know that you hear them (and to help their classmates in the back row keep up).Answer them, then ask if you answered their question.

Come up with a few objectives that you hope to accomplish on your call. You could even try making a checklist so that you stay on task.One possible objective could be to make a strong impression with a potential employer. This might entail showing interest in the job position, displaying knowledge about the company, and making a strong case as to how you would be beneficial to their mission. You could write down specific accomplishments of yours that are relevant to the job to make sure you don't leave anything out.
Another possible objective is to sell a product. This could involve explaining the product's use, making a case as to how the product would benefit the customer, and offering a benefit to buying the product immediately.;
, The simple act of writing down the person’s name and any talking points before making the call will put you at ease. That way if you start to feel nervous while talking to the person, you don’t have to worry about forgetting anything important. It’s right there in front of you!

, Spending time practicing your phone call will help you work out any problem areas ahead of time. Perhaps you aren’t exactly sure how to word something or how to bring up a difficult subject. If you figure this out beforehand, you’ll be able to breeze past any potential challenges.


Try asking a friend for help. For example, if you will be interviewing for a job position, your friend could act as the potential employer and conduct a mock interview with you. This can be helpful because your friend might think of questions or notice aspects of your speech that you have overlooked.
Try recording yourself speaking as well. This will give you a chance to hear what the other person will and to make adjustments. Pay attention to the sound of your voice and work on wording phrases in a clear, concise manner.

, Since a phone call relies entirely on sound, using a quality phone is of great importance. No matter how well you speak, if the person can’t understand you, they won’t be impressed. Use a landline over a cell phone since cell phones cut in and out depending on the service. Make sure there isn’t any static on the line and turn off call waiting to avoid any interruptions., Since the person can’t see you, it might be tempting to slouch or hunch over. But did you know that this can come through in the sound of your voice? If you stand with your shoulders back and look straight ahead, your voice will sound much more authoritative and confident.Try smiling to help your voice sound positive and upbeat. It might feel strange at first, but remember that your physicality comes through in your voice. The caller will only think you sound warm and pleasant and won’t have any idea that you’re awkwardly smiling on the other end.

, Preferably, not in your car! Find a quiet, stationary room where you won’t be bothered. Background noise can be incredibly distracting on a call and always sounds unprofessional. A quiet room will help you focus on the caller and allow them to focus on you rather than that weird beeping noise or the boisterous couple nearby., If you’re having trouble sounding positive, try looking at something that makes you feel good. Have a picture of your favorite place or your family nearby. This can boost your mood, which will always show through in your voice.

, In case the conversation lingers, you don’t want your voice to get dry and scratchy. Sometimes nerves can also contribute to dry mouth. The simple act of having water will help you speak at a good volume for as long as you need to., This is for taking any notes during the conversation. Get this ready before you make the call so that you don't have to think about about it. Sometimes telephone calls require follow up or additional steps. Instead of trying to memorize all of this on the spot, write it down so that your conversational success can continue even after the initial call.

, Depending on the nature of the phone call, having relevant resources for reference can be very useful. This way you can quickly check your resources rather than relying entirely on memory.


For a job interview, you might consider printing out some information about the company and any questions that you have.
For a sales call, you probably want to have the information about your product on hand.
If you are trying to make a date with someone, try having information about the place you’d like to go and have your calendar with you.

, This means enunciating words, using proper intonation, and speaking slowly. Practice this ahead of time so that it becomes second nature and record yourself to check how you sound. It should never sound robotic or forced, but clear and pleasant. The sound of your voice goes a long way on a phone call. Make sure you don’t mumble!Practice speaking more slowly than you normally would. Since it is harder to understand someone over the phone, be sure to take your time without dragging on.
Breathing plays a big role in speech as well. Take a deep breath before you start the conversation and then try to maintain even, steady breaths throughout.

, Making good word choices is of utmost importance. If you are trying to sound professional, swearing is never appropriate. When in doubt, err on the side of politeness. For example, instead of contacting a colleague and saying, “What’s up?” try something a little more formal like, “How are you today?”A common courtesy when making the call is to ask the caller, “Is this a good time for you?” This shows consideration for the other person and can eliminate the potential awkwardness of having them rush through the conversation.
Courteous speech in other conversational realms also applies on the telephone. For example, don’t underestimate the power of simple phrases such as “please” and “thank you.” Additionally, make sure not to interrupt the other person.Be courteous of the listener's time, as well. There is no need to ramble on or talk someone's ear off. Try to get to the point.
Perhaps the number one courtesy is simple honesty. It shows the person that you respect them enough to tell them the truth. No matter how tempting, don’t try to stretch the truth to make yourself look better. This damages rapport and eventually comes to the surface.

, A big part of being a good conversationalist on the phone happens without even speaking. It is important to truly listen to the other person and then respond accordingly. If you are having a hard time paying attention, try writing down a few notes about what they are saying.


To show that you have listened, repeat part of what they said when you respond, such as, “I appreciated what you said about putting customers first. That’s very important to me as well.” Then you can add on to what they said to continue the conversation.

, This is a nice personal touch. It helps to develop a connection with the caller as a person rather than just that voice on the other end of the line. There’s no need to overdo it, but on occasion be sure to include it. You could try saying, “I really enjoyed the time we spent together, Linda, and I hope we can meet up again sometime.”

, The final impression you make is the note you will leave the person with. This will be what stays in their mind. Be sure to thank them for their time and try briefly reminding them of a positive of your conversation. For example, you could say something like, “I appreciate you taking the time to talk today. I’m glad we had the chance to set those goals for our company.”, If you are expecting an important call, keep your phone nearby and try to answer it within three rings. Letting your phone ring for a long time can make the caller feel unimportant or get impatient.

, Try to respond as soon as you are able. This shows the caller that you value them. If you were supposed to be available when they called, make sure to apologize and give them a brief explanation of why you weren’t there. For example, you could say, “I’m sorry I wasn’t there when you called. My son’s soccer game went into overtime.” Whenever possible, try to let the person know ahead of time that you won’t be available., For those times when you aren’t able to get to the phone, have a prerecorded message rather than a computerized one. The messages you leave say a lot about you. If they are unfriendly or haphazard, they can leave your listeners with a negative impression.


Choose something like, “Hi! This is Drew. I’m currently unavailable to answer your call. Please leave your name and number and I’ll return your call as soon as possible. Thanks a lot and have a great day!” instead of having a computerized voice say, “Box 3709 - leave a message at the tone.”

, Oftentimes, a phone call requires multiple conversations. Be sure to get any information needed to follow up with the person and always do what you say you will. If you tell someone, “I will check on those figures and get back to you later today,” then make sure that you check on the figures and get back to them that day!


If someone asks you for information that you don't currently have, ask them if it is acceptable to look into it and call them back. You could say something like, ""I'm sorry, but I don't have that information right now. Would it be ok to find out and give you a call back?""

, If you aren’t sure when to call, normal business hours (9am to 5pm) are usually a good time. There is nothing worse than being woken by a phone call.

, State your name, number, and the reason for your call. Make sure to slow down when leaving your phone number so that they have a chance to write it down.

Let the caller know that you are putting her on hold before actually doing it.,
Remain composed, and never lose your temper or become rude, even if the caller becomes hostile.,
Do not allow yourself to become distracted at your desk by conversation.",How to Maintain Your Professionalism as a Telephone Receptionist," You want to be able to transfer calls quickly and efficiently, and if a caller wants to know the name of an employee, you should be able to answer that promptly. ""Umming,"" and ""Ahhing,"" is not professional phone etiquette, and neither is putting the caller on hold while you search for a name.;
, Answer it promptly, and the caller will not be frustrated before she even speaks with you.

, Make sure that it is not long winded and that it sounds natural. You may want to practice it so that it rolls off the tongue naturally. e.g ""Good Morning, Lanco Investment"" or Landscape Survey, Good day.""

, Even if you are not in the mood for smiling or the caller is frustrating you, your smile will help you maintain a cheerful tone.

, You should sound genuine and pleasant.

, Refrain from using vocabulary you are not familiar with, and never use slang. Additionally, avoid using responsive sounds like, ""uh-huh."" ""hmmm"", ""aha""

, A skilled telephone receptionist gets the caller's name and other details she may offer before she even asks any questions. Be sure to make a note of how to pronounce unusual names so that you can say them correctly when transferring the call. Make sure that you write down any message that the caller leaves you, and read it back to her. Reading back ensures that you have the message correct, and it assures the caller that you took the message and will pass it on accordingly.

, When removing the person from hold, apologize for having to do so before inquiring about her call.

, If necessary, put the caller on hold for a few seconds while you take that time to breathe deeply and remind yourself that you are the ""director of first impressions."" This means always sounding professional, being patient, and willing to assist the caller.

, If the phone rings, make sure to stop conversing before answering the phone so that the caller does not hear a part of your conversation. This does not mean that you should finish your conversation; rather, you should cut your conversation off and answer the call.

Understand the different factors that make up a voice.,
Record your voice.,
Decide how you want your voice to be.,

Slow down and lose the filler words.,
Watch your pitches.,
Open your mouth and jaw more.,
Learn exercises to relax your voice.,
Listen to the details of your voice.,
Listen to good speakers.,
Get elocution lessons.,
Try drama or singing lessons.",How to Have a Nice Voice," The first step towards improving your voice is to get a good sense of what your voice is like now. There are six main categories that make up someone's vocal profile:Volume: How loud do you speak?
Articulation: Do you slur your words or mumble?
Voice quality: Is your voice nasally, breathy, or raspy?
Overall pitch: Do you speak in a shrill, high tone or a deep, low pitch?
Pitch variation: Do you speak in a monotone voice?
Speed: Do you speak too quickly or slowly?;
, To get a better sense of what your current voice is like, you need to record it and listen to it. This may not be fun, as a lot of people don't like the sound of their recorded voice, but this is much closer to what people actually hear when they listen to you. Record your voice using audio software like Garageband, and then play it back and listen for the details that make up your vocal profile, your volume, articulation, quality, pitch, variation, and speed.Recording and listening back to your voice will allow you to get an enlightening, objective look at what your really sound like to others. Take note of the flaws in your speaking voice, from mumbling, to filler words, to a nasally quality, and more. Write down everything you notice.

, Look at your notes about your voice and its weak spots. Then think about how you want your voice to be in comparison. Not everyone is going to have the same goal voice. For example, women with particularly low and raspy voices might want to raise their overall pitch and achieve a smoother vocal quality, while men with high, fast voices might want to slow down and deepen their speech., Speech starts with breathe, so good speech starts with good breathing. Ideally you want to breathe from your diaphragm, slowly and steadily, at all times. Start practicing by placing a hand on your stomach and breathing deeply so that you stomach rises and falls with each breathe. Practice this several times a day.Another breathing exercise you can do is to read a paragraph with a mix of long and short sentences. Use just one deep, single breathe for each sentence, exhaling gradually as you read out loud. Then take a breathe and start the next sentence. This is just an exercise to improve breathe strength. This isn't how you should try to talk normally., Faster speech will make you sound less confident, and will make you harder to understand. One way to improve the quality of your voice immediately is just to slow down. Practice by reading anything out loud, first with your normal speaking speed, and then slowed down. Another way to practice is to read off a list of numbers as if it were a long phone number, writing them in the air with your finger as you go. This is the ideal speed for natural, clear speech., Depending on where your natural pitch and pitch variety are right now, you may need to work on this a lot, or just a little. Work on your overall pitch by consciously trying to speak in a lower tone, as often as you can remember. It's important to do this gradually though, just around a half-tone lower at a time. Work on your pitch variety by injecting different pitches in your sentences to add interest and emotion. Two ways to practice this are the following exercises:Practice saying a two syllable word over and over with varying pitch changes. There are four types of pitch changes, rising pitch, falling pitch, rising up then down, and falling down then up.
Repeat a sentence over and over and change which word gets the emphasis. For example, say ""I didn't steal the bike,"" first by emphasizing that it wasn't you who stole the bike, then by emphasizing the ""didn't,"" then by implying that you did something to the bike besides stealing it, and then by implying that you stole something other than the bike.

, Practice talking with a more relaxed mouth and jaw. The best way to do this is to practice on your own, exaggerating the normal movements of your face as you speak. Open your mouth wide when you make ""oh"" and ""ah"" sounds, and let your jaw move low. Add this to your daily voice practice routine., If your voice isn't relaxed, you're going to be speaking from your throat instead of your diaphragm, and your voice will come out tense, harsh, and forced. Follow this method several times a day to relax your voice:Start by placing your hands on your throat and talking normally, noting any tightness in your throat and jaw.
Make a big yawn and let your jaw fall as low as it will comfortably. End the yawn by saying ""ho-hum."" Continue the ""hum"" for several seconds with your lips shut, and as you do so, move your jaw from side to side and let it hang a little. Do this several times.
Say the words ""hang,"" ""harm,"" ""lane,"" ""main,"" ""lone,"" ""loom."" Exaggerate your facial movements as you do so. Yawn again whenever your throat gets a little tired.
Use your fingers to softly knead your throat muscles.
Relax your throat as your repeat the following sounds slowly: ""nay,"" ""nay,"" ""nee,"" ""no,"" ""noo.""

, To really work on the details of your voice, you need to once again record yourself talking. Record yourself reciting a long paragraph out loud, doing your best to use a relaxed, slow, articulate voice. Then listen to this recording and make note of what areas your voice still falls short in. Practice saying those parts of the paragraph better, and then rerecord your voice. Compare the first recording to the second and note the improvements. Repeat this process until you are happy with the way your recorded voice sounds saying that paragraph.


Do this exercise often to target the specific things about your voice that you want to improve the most.

, Download some podcasts and audiobooks and take some time to listen to the way they speak. Listen carefully to the control they have over their voice, the way they articulate and move their pitch up and down. Part of developing a good voice is getting familiar with what a good voice sounds like. And, people naturally learn from example, so listening to good speakers regularly will start to have an effect on your own voice.

, The best and most effective way to improve your voice is through professional voice coaching. Find a voice coach in your locality and book in for an assessment. Once you're seeing the coach, you'll discover new ways to project and improve your voice., These can be a great way to improve the way that your voice comes across. Singing and speaking are very closely relating, so improvement in one area will carry over to improvement in the other. Search online for singing lessons near you."

Get help becoming more assertive.",How to Go from Passive to Assertive," More to the point, learn to value your perspective. If you tend to be relatively passive when interacting with others and hope to become more assertive, you need to both recognize and more frequently verbalize your needs, feelings, and opinions. The best way to do with is by reminding yourself of your specific needs and desires and actively communicating them directly and respectfully with those around you.Working to increase your assertiveness will become a self-fulfilling process as soon as you begin; even the slightest increase in your assertiveness will help you convey what you’re thinking and feeling more effectively.
When you notice you have a need or desire that is not being met, perhaps in part because you haven't vocalized it, think about how you want the situation to be different.
It may help to write out the needs and desires you intend to better vocalize, or talk about them with a close friend. Practice identifying and vocalizing your needs and desires so you feel more confident about asserting yourself when it is necessary to do so.;
, It will be easier to be more assertive within one area of your life first. This does not mean you should be more assertive with those who are younger than you or in a less experienced position in your work environment. Instead, look to be more assertive with those who know you well and will likely respect your more active participation in social interactions.Be specific. Choose to become more assertive in one specific place or during your interactions with one particular person. For example, you could decide to be more assertive with a friend who always tries to plan things for you without asking you first.
Be consistent. Make sure to practice being more assertive whenever you’re in that place or with that person. If your friend often calls you up on Friday afternoon to tell you what the two of you will be doing, then anticipate the call each week and practice what you will say.
As you realize you’re successfully becoming more assertive, expand the positive changes you’ve made in one area of your life into another social sphere. After being more assertive with this friend, you might start being more assertive at work, with family members, or with your significant other.

, The classic example here is maintaining eye contact. Make sure you’re making frequent, direct eye contact with the people with whom you interact, especially when speaking directly to someone. Sit or stand upright, with your body turned towards whomever has your attention.Smile when you’re happy and frown when you’re angry. This alone will go a long way in helping you externalize emotional honesty.
Make sure your body language is relaxed. Not only does this convey confidence, it will actually give you more confidence too. In particular, make sure you’re not clenching your jaw.
Practice in the mirror. It may feel silly at first, but looking at how you sit or stand in the mirror will help you recognize aspects of your posture that may be read as passivity by other people.

, As you attempt to increase your assertiveness, understand that people’s reactions will not always happen as you expect. In fact, if people have become accustomed to you interacting with them passively, they may initially be startled or even respond negatively the first few times you express a healthy, respectful assertiveness.Accept that you will likely face some discomfort while increasing your assertiveness. However, this is a good thing! It means that you are growing and learning.
Remind yourself that it is within your rights to assert your needs and feelings – and that doing so will lead to better relationships in the long term.
If you encounter any resistance or negativity, remind yourself that you are in control of your own reactions and continue to behave respectfully and assertively.
Say something like “I’ve decided not to allow others to take advantage of me, and I won’t allow us to attack one another for seeing things differently.”

, Aside from all the benefits of reducing stress, being more assertive will help prevent the resentment that can sometimes grow within the context of passivity. Aside from offering a more healthy way to process your anger, increased assertiveness will literally help you get more of what you want out of life. Remind yourself that you deserve it.Think about how your life will be better when you're able to be more assertive in certain situations, and visualize the relief from tension and other rewards your assertiveness will likely bring.
Write down the benefits of being more assertive that you're most looking forward to. Carry this list with you as motivation to continue respectfully vocalizing your needs and desires.

, It is especially important to recognize and embrace your right to simply say “no.” Especially if you usually find it challenging to turn people down, literally practice doing so in front of a mirror. Look yourself in the eye and say, ""No, I’m not able to do that right now.""When actually turning a request or demand down, be direct. Include an explanation, but keep it brief, and emphasize that you are unwilling or unable to do what has been asked of you.
Rehearse what you intend to say. If there are recurring things you’re asked to and comply only because you feel pressured to do so, prepare yourself to stand up for yourself by practicing exactly what you’ll say next time.

, Aside from what you’re actually saying, how you say it is also an extremely important aspect of healthy, constructive communication. Monitor your use of your voice to ensure you speak firmly, but in a relaxed tone and at a steady, confident pace. Limit your hesitations. Try to speak with depth and warmth – this will help reflect the emotions you’re feeling.Emphasize sincerity and clarity in the way you speak.
Monitor the volume of your voice too. Speaking too quietly – or too loudly – will lead people to take you less seriously.

, Whenever anything is unclear, ask questions! Part of listening is understanding exactly where people are coming from. If you’re not understanding someone, ask for clarity and convey your willingness to listen and collaborate with the language you use.Ask things like “What are your thoughts on this?”, “Does this work with how you’re feeling?”, or “How do you think we can approach this differently?”
Take care to maintain respectful and active nonverbal listening behavior. Focus on the person, maintain eye contact, and set aside your personal perspective to allow yourself to fully comprehend theirs.
Repeat others’ key points back to them when they’re finished speaking with statements like “It sounds like you feel like ___________.”

, Do this early in a conversation to introduce the positivity you want to maintain. You don’t have to agree with the other person, but you have to acknowledge what they’re feeling.Be explicit. Say something along the lines of “I understand you see this issue differently.” Or, “I understand why you need help with that.”
If you cannot help the person, be ready to clearly state why. Be brief, but also sincere. For example, if a friend wants you to help him or her move over the weekend and you already have plans, then you might say something like, “I would help if I could, but I can’t. I already have plans with my family.”

, Particularly when there are multiple perspectives to consider, or when a decision is yours to make, it is important to be clear about why you see something differently. If there is a conflict between perspectives, the more clearly you convey the specific difference in your perspective, the better chance an issue can be worked through cooperatively.For example, if you have just explained to a friend that you can’t help him move because you have plans with your family, then you might try following it with something like, “Spending time with my family is important to me.”
Be assertive when distinguishing between fact and opinion. While responses to opinions should mostly start with “I feel” or “I think”, responses to facts should be more direct and start with clauses like “I’ve had different experiences” or “I have come to understand that differently.”

, While discussion is healthy, and absolutely necessary when there are multiple perspectives to consider, a proposal on how to move forward is one of the most constructive and assertive contributions you can make in a conversation, particularly in a group.Avoid the words “should” or “ought” when making suggestions, opting instead for “What about…” or “Would it work if….”
Maintain a collaborative approach by shooting for an action that has the best chance of pleasing all relevant parties.

, If you have already made a decision, particularly when declining something that has been asked of you, convey your understanding of the situation and corresponding decision all in one statement. For instance:“I absolutely agree that it would be great to _______________. However, I can’t because _________________. How about figuring out .”

, For instance: “I’m glad that we’re able to share . However, it frustrates me when . Let’s figure out a system to deal with .”, Whenever you know what you need, what you want, or how you’re feeling, make sure this is conveyed simply and directly. Especially when making a request, state what you’re asking in one or two short, clear sentences.Start the statement with a simple declarative, such as “I want”, “I don’t like”, or “I feel.”


Convey excitement or enthusiasm with “I” statements in particular, by saying things like, “I would very much enjoy it if_______.”

, As you become more assertive, it is extremely important to avoid using language that conveys aggression. In particular, avoid starting statement with “you”, as this will put the other person on the defensive and will only complicate or unnecessarily prolong conversations.For instance, opt for “I disagree” instead of “you’re wrong” or “I feel irritated when you interrupt” instead of “you’re always interrupting me!”

, Anger and other emotions have a complex relationship with your ability to communicate. If you tend to be passive, you’re likely not at fault for overreacting to anger with aggressive behavior. However, you may need to realize that it is healthy to express the fact that something angers you.Anger is normal and natural.
Learn to recognize your anger by listening to your body for clues. A rise in your heart rate and blood pressure, the feeling of blood rushing to your face or other parts of your body, and a wave of warmth may all indicate that anger is rising beneath the surface of your skin.
Avoid hiding your anger, as this may lead to stress, resentment towards those that anger you, feelings of victimization, and the growing – though suppressed – desire to act out.

, Recognize that passive-aggressiveness is just as detrimental to your relationships as blatant aggression. Own and admit your anger, and respond to it with maturity by voicing it directly while being calm and respectful.The easiest and clearest way to do so is to take a deep breath and simply tell someone that their behavior has irritated you.


Take care not to attack whomever has angered you. Keep your statement simple and straightforward by saying something along the lines of “I felt aggravated when ___________ and I need you to know that I’m not comfortable with like that.”

, Though there is nothing wrong with being shy or easy going, you should always participate in a conversation or interaction when you have a relevant perspective. If you constantly just “go with the flow” for the sake of avoiding conflict, people may start to disregard your thoughts and feelings.If, in fact, you actually don’t want to go for pizza yet again, and would rather grab some sushi – say it!
Certainly, some stuff simply isn’t important, so don’t feel like you always have to be a part of every conversation. The point is: when you do have feelings on a matter, voice them.

, Often, passive people will agree to things that ultimately make them more stressed or simply diminish the quality of their lives unnecessarily. If and when you want to say no, you have to accept and practice the necessity of doing so! , Recognize that changing your mind about something and acting on your decision to do so is actually an assertive, healthy behavior.Understand that your mindset, and your understanding of a situation will frequently change, and that increased assertiveness will make you more flexible about changing the decisions you’ve made and when making new ones.


As you become more assertive, you should be taking a more active role in the conversations that concern you.
Take pride in making independent contributions and decisions.

, Be patient and understanding with yourself. It’s tough to start voicing your perspective more frequently, especially when you’re used to staying quiet.If you’re struggling with increasing your assertiveness or become increasingly stressed about how to go about doing so – or if you’re just looking for support while doing so – see a mental health professional.


The act of getting help is itself an assertive step, as it is an active demonstration of your willingness to improve your ability to voice your perspective and pave yourself a road to a healthier, happier life.

Evaluate who your audience is and what their expectations of you are before deciding what tactic will work the best.


If you’re trying to prove a point to an authority figure, like a parent, your boss, or some other figure who has power over you, you’ll want to be sure to highlight how your point will make the situation better for everyone. How will the family, company, or group benefit from your proposed point?
If you’re trying to prove a point to a child or a subordinate employee, it’s important to explain the details and reasoning of your point without being condescending. Even if you’re “teaching a lesson,” don’t talk down to the other person and your point will get across much better. No ""because I said so"" reasons.
If you’re trying to prove a point to a partner, spouse, or even a very close friend, someone on equal footing, it’s important to maintain an even keel and speak clearly. Don't mince words. If you’re talking to someone who knows you intimately, avoid the more public rhetoric you might use to talk to your boss.;
, It’s important to focus your points on solving a problem, not “winning an argument.” If your goal is to get a point across, make sure that it’s something that needs to be heard for the benefit of the person hearing it, or the benefit of the group, not just because you want to make it. It’s a lot easier to make points that are necessary and productive. Your point should help the other person, not bring them down.


To figure out whether or not your points are productive points, imagine that someone else were going to give you the same piece of feedback or advice, or bring up the same idea. How would it feel? Would it give you something concrete to do or change?
It would be one thing for a boss to say, ""Our overhead's too high, so you're all going to have your hours cut. Sorry."" Point made, but unproductive. Instead, try out something like this: ""We're really struggling with overhead costs. To be able to keep you all on board and working as a team doing the great work you do, we're going to need to cut some of your hours slightly.""

, The most important part of getting a point across is in figuring out what exactly your point is and why it's a valid point to bring up. Provable points are points that have good reasoning behind them. Even if it's an unpleasant truth, something the listener may not want to hear, you can be sure that it's a truth that needs to be heard.


Obviously it's important for your child to work hard in school. But why? It's easier to get your child to study harder if it's focused on how your child will be happier with better grades and enjoy school better, as opposed to ""because I say so"" or ""because your friend Jimmy studies hard.""
Tell the truth, as straight and as simple as possible. Tell your child that studying is an important part of growing up and learning to take care of yourself. You won't always be there to help them, and it's important for kids to learn as much as they can to grow up right.

, If you want a rock-solid point, anticipate all the possible holes in your argument and your point that the other person might make. Before you make your point, beat the other person to the punch by bringing up their rebuttal and debunking it before they get the chance.


If you tell your child to study harder to grow up into a well-rounded adult, you might be likely to hear, ""But I don't want to be a well-rounded adult, I want to play video games."" It's understandable that lots of parents resort to the ""because I said so"" at this point, but use it as a teaching opportunity.
State the anticipated argument out loud: ""I know right now you just want to play video games all day. I did too when I was 7. But that'll change as you get older, and you'll need more skills.""

, Mumbled, rushed, and chaotic points can't be accurately communicated. If you want to prove a point, slow down and speak it confidently, and don't stop until you're finished making your point. People tend to listen more closely if you slow down and speak in an even, measured tone, rather than quickly rush over your words as if nervous.


If you're in a big group discussion and are struggling to be heard, cut yourself a chunk of air-time by grabbing the floor and then slowing down the back-and-forth. Say, ""I'd like to say something"" and then pause for a beat. Take a breath before continuing. Once you've got the floor, you've got the floor for however long it takes you to make your point. Make everyone hear you.

, If people sense lots of emotion or hesitancy in your voice, they may not take you seriously. Anger or snobbery in your tone also causes people to get defensive or tune you out, rather than listen closely. Speak calmly, even when giving someone bad news or disagreeing with the boss.


Give other people the benefit of hearing your true thoughts and feelings. Trying to be ""friendly"" by hedging your points, or hemming and hawing, will undercut the good points you're trying to make and only give people reasons to doubt them.
Let a clear head prevail and take a deep breath before you need to make a contentious point. Introduce your point by saying, ""This may not be popular, but here's what I'm thinking."" This suggests that you've got the good of everyone at heart, rather than trying to be provocative or dissent for the fun of it., Package your point as just that: an idea that you have, which is perfectly valid to disagree with. If you're going to say something contentious, keep it focused on yourself, using the word ""I"" as opposed to lashing out at someone else.


For example, you shouldn't say “Your music is too loud,"" which is confrontational and unproductive. Instead, say something like, “It'd be helpful for it to be a little quieter in here so I can finish this project. Would it be ok to turn it down for a bit?” Big difference.

, Reasoning is important when you're trying to make a point, but it's also important to focus not only on why it is you think your point is valid, but how that point or idea will help reach some larger goal. Points need context more than they need complicated reasons.


For example, it may be a valid point that the music your office mate is playing is ""too loud,"" by quoting decibel statistics, talking about hearing loss as a result of listening to loud rock music. However valid, these may not be the best way of getting your point across. Stay focused on how the music is distracting you from doing your job, the goal of the work day, not on your office mate's hearing.

, The best points are concise. Cut out all the hedging and learn to recognize when your point has been made. It's common to use too much packaging, when it's usually better to just cut to the heart of the matter, make your point as simply as possible, and then hash it out.


If you tend toward making points that sound like this: ""So, it might just be my own personal opinion, because I'm pretty new here and less experience than everybody else, so feel totally free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I was just noticing that it seems like maybe we could possibly use less paper in the office?"" try cutting straight to the point and speaking more authoritatively. ""I noticed we use a lot of paper in the office, five reams a day. Have we talked about cutting back before?""
Lots of people talk too long, repeating the point that's already been made. If you tend toward this, just stop talking. Embrace the silence. Pausing after you’ve delivered your message gives your idea a chance to sink in, and also gives you time to regroup and organize your thoughts. Practice hitting pause, then putting on a calm face., After you've made your point, stop talking and listen to what other people have to say. It's not your job to immediately launch into a defense of your point, or package it like an argument. Just sit calmly and let the other people or the other person respond, listening closely. The less protest you put into it, the more likely the others will be to agree.


It's very important to listen actively in a discussion. A good way for a chat to turn into an argument is to stay focused on what you're going to say next, rather than actually hearing the other person out. Don't worry about forming a response until you've really listened to and processed the other person's thoughts.
Respond calmly to their points if you need to. Allow yourself to be swayed as well, and use the conversation as an opportunity to deepen your collective ideas and form a new plan or a new point together. Collaborate.

, To try to get your point across, lead with your biggest and best reasoning, tell the person once, and then let it go. Getting sucked into a petty argument with someone who just wants to bicker isn't a productive use of your time. Once you've put your point out there, you shouldn't try to make the same point with weaker evidence, or allow someone else to wear you down with pettiness. Just learn to let it go and give the other person a chance to mull over it.

, If your point is especially complex or technical, it can be a good idea to prove your point in writing, as opposed to trying to talk it out or explain it in words. Complicated business proposals, technical project descriptions, schematics, and even complicated emotional talks can be more helpful to write out, so the other person can read it before you talk more directly and answer questions.



Write a memo for a business idea, or a new concept about how to do business. Whether you're proposing to your boss or to subordinates, writing it out will give your point more credence, and allow the other people to think through it on their own time.
Write an outline for a complicated concept or point, to break it down and make it easier to understand. If you think you've just uncovered the philosophical thesis for your new black metal collective's aesthetic manifesto, you should probably write it out instead of trying to explain it.
If you’re struggling in a relationship, consider writing out your complicated feelings in a letter. This will help you gather your own thoughts, and could provide a more smooth transition into a hard discussion.

, Sometimes it’s true that a picture is worth a thousand words. If you can use an image, a photograph, or a video to make some point without speaking, you’ve made your job a lot easier. Using charts, graphs, and photos can be quick ways to present statistics, showing growth or decline, and letting the viewer come to their own conclusions about your point. It's hard to argue with a graph showing an employee's productivity dip.


One common way of proving to alcoholics that they need to sober up is to record a particularly ugly example of their drunkenness, then play it back later. You shouldn't have to say anything.

, An excellent rhetorical technique can be to ask lots of questions that lead the other people in the conversation to come to the same conclusion that you've come to, essentially planting the idea in their head. Play Socrates and ask a series of probing questions that help to create change.


If you've noticed the absurd amount of paper used in your office, ask your boss how much paper the office goes through in a week, and have the specific answer prepared yourself. Follow up with, ""Does that seem like a lot?"" (Have statistics about the average paper consumption at similar offices handy). Think of it as showing the horse to water.

, While personal experience isn't necessarily the most valid reasoning for a particular point, it tends to have a big effect on the ability of people to relate to you as a speaker and to connect emotionally to the point you're trying to make. Especially if you're making a point about some contentious issue, putting yourself in the context of the issue is often an important way of presenting your point as credible.If you've got a point to make about something that you've personally experienced, say so: ""As someone who watched a grandparent suffer through prolonged dementia, I know that palliative care is more complicated than picking between various medications.""

, For some people, big rhetorical flourishes are a lot more frustrating than they are effective, making it important that you evaluate the expectations of your audience and the context of the conversation before you decide to use a particular technique. You probably wouldn't bring a Power Point presentation to make a point to your poker club, just as you wouldn't want to incorporate a bunch of goofy audience-participation into your panel discussion with representatives from the Board of Mental Health. Make your presentation match the occasion.

If you are organizing a work group, use company email.



 


If you are organizing a school group, ask for telephone numbers or emails. Also, research a school LISTSERV to encourage new membership.






If you are hosting a church group, make sure the meeting time is in the church bulletin.






If you are starting a support group, post the information at hospitals, online and in counselor/doctor offices.





;
, Look online and in books for ideas on what topics to choose. If you are leading a work group, get all the research and reports sent out a few days ahead of time so that everyone can be on the same page for the meeting.

, Starting and ending meetings require an outspoken person who will keep track of time and any remaining agenda items. Wear a watch and refer back to it occasionally to make sure you are on track.

Announce the start and end time in your communication with group members. Also, consider announcing topics and the time structure so that members can adequately prepare.






One important structure to announce is whether it is an open group and whether the group has “cross-talk.” This means that the group can discuss, rather than just sharing an opinion when it is their turn.







, It can be exhausting to lead a group, especially for professional and emotional topics. Get a good night sleep and do some deep breathing techniques before you start the group meeting., Sitting in a circle is a classic approach, because no one is left out. Move chairs into a circle before anyone else arrives.


Avoid a “classroom” approach. If everyone must see you, but can’t see each other, you will be more of an authority figure and have a harder time encouraging discussion between group members.

, It is your job to encourage participation without affecting the outcome. If you are an opinionated person, practice holding your tongue in political or opinionated discussions., Keep it brief, but announce your qualifications or interest in the success of the group. Aim to keep the introduction between one and two minutes long.

, Groups like Alcoholics Anonymous have steps and traditions that are to be read at the beginning of each meeting. Don’t go overboard with rules, as they might restrict expression in the group.

, If there are desired outcomes or agenda points, review them now. Set times if necessary.

, If you are leading a small group, you may be able to go around in a circle (Round Robin) so that everyone has a chance to speak. If you are leading a large group, you may need to encourage the raising of hands or free speaking.


Announce the structure of the group before you start, so that everyone has the same expectations.

, You are serving as a neutral party, not a teacher.

, Avoid asking questions to the group with yes or no answers. If they must be yes/no answers, ask group members to elaborate on why that is the answer., Good follow-up questions include “How does that change the way you feel about X,Y,Z?” and “How do you think that applies to other issues that we are discussing?”

, If you are afraid that the group is too large to encourage adequate participation, small group work is a good way to encourage everyone in a group to interact.

, Encourage positive interactions. Thank people for their contributions.


Don’t be critical. Even if your group is created for critiques, criticism should be only give in small doses. Start each comment with positive reinforcement.

, Between subjects, encourage people to play a game, watch a related YouTube clip or get up and move around.

, It is your job as the group leader to recognize potential arguments and try to move on in a productive way.


Say, “It sounds like we have a difference of opinion.”
“Different points of view are encouraged in our group.”
“It sounds like you both feel passionate about this.”
“It seems that we can agree on X,Y,Z.”

, This is a good way for people to feel joint ownership of a group and its goals.

, Ask people to take a questionnaire or discuss changes or issues wit you.

Keep your promises.,
Show vulnerability.,
Keep their secrets.,
Avoid criticizing others.,
Mind your own business.",How to Get People to Confide in You1," Before someone can confide in you, you have to demonstrate that you are dependable. If you promise someone that will do something, make sure that you actually do it. Fulfilling your promises regularly will show that you can be trusted.


If you cannot keep a promise, let the other person know. Rather than just standing them up or falling through, you can give a call or text message telling them why you had to cancel. They will appreciate the gesture.;
, Trust is a two-way street. If you want someone to confide in you, you may have to confide in them first. If you find a person trustworthy, you can share with them some of your feelings, thoughts, or problems. Since you were willing to share with them, they may be more willing to share with you.


Another way to show vulnerability is to be silly in front of them. Do karaoke together. Tell bad jokes. Dance. These activities will strengthen your bond, and they will show that you trust the other person enough to be yourself in front of them., If someone shares something personal with you, don’t tell others. People will judge your trustworthiness based on how well you respect their privacy. Even if you are gossiping about people they do not know, blabbing will only demonstrate that you cannot be trusted. They will worry that you are sharing their secrets with other people.

, Complaining, criticizing, or insulting other people can show that you are judgmental. People will be hesitant to confide in you since they will not want to be judged. Try to keep your negative opinions to yourself.

, Do not be nosy. Once you're friends with people, it won't be long until they tell you things. However, if you're always asking them to include you or butting into their conversations, they will not trust you. By being nosy, you are signaling that you are more interested in their story than their well-being.

"
"
Spend time with your friends.,
Answer your phone.,
Help them solve minor problems.,
Allow them to come to you.",How to Get People to Confide in You2," People tend to confide in those they spend a lot of time around. They feel more comfortable in their presence. They will also be more certain of your honesty. If you want them to trust you with their secrets, you should prove that you are willing to be there no matter what.

, Sometimes, friends need friends on short notice. If your friend calls, try to answer it right away. Promptly respond to their text messages if they are having a problem. If they are upset, offer to come over and talk. While you cannot always be available, you can demonstrate that you are always willing to help them.


If they call you and you think something is wrong, you may not be able to talk to them right away. You can, however, send a text or email saying, “Hey, I got your call. I am unavailable right now. Is everything ok?” This lets them know that you are concerned about them, even if you were unable to take their call.

, People may not confide their deepest secrets in you right away, but by assisting them with small problems, you can slowly build your way up to the big stuff. Perhaps they are struggling with homework, or maybe they need a ride to the doctor’s office. Little favors can help build trust and reinforce your friendship., In most cases, if you try to force someone to tell you something, they will become more defensive. While you can encourage someone to confide in you with gentle and supportive statements, you should not insist that they tell you something.


If someone has experienced a nasty breakup don't call them and say, ""You've got to tell me what happened exactly! Please!"" Respect their feelings and say, ""I heard what happened, and I'm very sorry. Do you want to talk about it?""
If you think that there is something seriously wrong with your friend, intervene.

"
"
Observe your friend.,
Find a safe, quiet place.,
Express your concern.,
Ask open questions.,
Listen patiently.,
Allow them to cry.,
Validate their feelings.,
Give them space.",How to Get People to Confide in You3," If you suspect your friend has a serious problem, you may have to intervene. In this scenario, you should be watching carefully for signs that your friend is depressed, angry, or upset. Note any abnormal behavior.


They may be less talkative than normal.
They may not be answering your calls.
They could be sleeping more often.
Their temper might be shorter.
They may be missing class or work often.

, Your friend should feel comfortable when you speak to them. The goal is to get them to open up. Find a private location where you will both be comfortable. This may be at either of your homes. Alternatively, you can take a walk together.

, In a gentle tone, tell your friend that you are worried. Let them know that you have noticed their recent behavior. They may become defensive, so avoid accusative terms. As you do so, inform them that you are there for them.You can say, “I’ve noticed that you’ve seemed sad lately. I want to make sure everything is all right. Is there anything you need to talk about? You’re not alone, and I’m here for you.”

, Rather than ask “yes/no” questions, try asking questions that will get them to talk about their feelings. These are broad, open-ended questions that give them room to express their feelings.

Some examples include:

When did you know?
How long have you felt that way?
How did that make you feel?
How have you been coping?
If they do not want to respond, don’t push them.

, If your friend does confide, allow them to speak. They may need to vent, or they might struggle with how to state their thoughts. Do not interrupt them. Instead, make eye contact, and nod along to their words. Wait for them to stop talking before you speak again., If someone you know starts crying, don’t laugh or roll your eyes. Allow them to cry. Ask them what is wrong. If they are not ready to confide in you, sit quietly with them offering support. If you are close to this person, you may rub their back or offer gentle words of encouragement. Let them know that you are there for them no matter what.You can tell them, “It’s ok. Let it all out.”
If they try to apologize for crying, let them know that it is unneeded. You can say, “You don’t have to be sorry. It’s good to cry every now and then.”

, If someone tells you something is wrong, you should tell them that you understand. Let them know that they are allowed to feel the way that they do. You may even want to share similar experiences that you’ve had. This will show that you are not judging and that you understand their feelings.Try telling your friend something like “You have every right to feel angry” or “It’s ok to feel sad.”
Don’t use statements like “Get over it” or “You should be more positive.” These invalidate others’ feelings. Instead of wanting to confide in you, they’ll only want to hide their feelings.

, If the other person says they do not want to talk about it, do not push them. They will only become more defensive and closed off. Instead, you can tell them that you are there for them whenever they need to talk. At that point, you should drop the subject.


You can say, “I understand, but if you do want to talk, you can come to me. I am always available for you.”

"
Use active language.,
Use I-statements.,
Be concise and direct.,
Don’t exaggerate.,
Be persistent.,
Stick to the point.",How to Get People to Listen to You1," Speaking assertively means saying something in a way that is active and direct. This is a more effective way to talk than speaking more passively, which is less likely to get someone to listen to you. If, for example, you are asking somebody to do something for you, a clear and assertive request may get better results than a more passive one.


An assertive request could be as simple as “will you pick up the kids today?”
A more passive version of this might be “after you’ve finished messing around with that, could you get the kids? If you’re not too busy of course.”Avoid adding tag questions to the end of your statements, such as “is that okay?” or “does that make sense?”Clear and direct communication can help you communicate more effectively in all kinds of relationships.;
, One helpful method for direct and effective communication it to use plenty of I-statements. Using I-statements helps you express how you feel to somebody, without explicitly implicating or accusing the other person of anything. It focuses on your feelings and experience, rather than the other person.For example, if you always end up buying the milk, address this with an I-statement.
Say, “when we run out of milk in the morning, I feel frustrated because I buy it every day.”
Avoid accusatory you-statements such as: “you never buy the milk!”, You have something important and interesting to say, but often explaining it less rather than more can be most effective way to articulate it. If you try to give a great amount of detail, or talk for too long, you run the risk of people losing interest and you losing their attention. Try to think of ways to summarise what you want to say before you say it.In order to be concise, you need to have a certain confidence about what you are talking about.
You will be able to explain something concisely when you have a strong understanding of it.
If you are asking a question, be polite but concise. For example, saying “will you please pass me that file?” is more direct than saying “excuse me, would you mind, if you’re not too busy, passing me that file?”
A more direct request conveys more force, but if you are impolite or too blunt, your request may be met with resistance., If you are prone to wild exaggerations, you shouldn’t be too surprised if people start to take you less seriously and don’t listen to what you say. Frequent and inappropriate use of words like “never” and “always” indicate that you might have a tendency to exaggeration. If your friend is sometimes late to meet you, don’t say “you’re always late, every time. It’s so annoying.


Try to stick to facts. If your friend was late twice in a row, say that “you’re late again, that’s twice in a row.”, Sometimes you will have to be prepared to be persistent and patient in order to get your point across. If you are talking to someone who is easily distracted, or not a great listener, persistence can really help. Repeating yourself over and over can be very frustrating, but is worth it if it’s the only way to be sure you are understood.


If you are arranging to meet someone, repeat the time and place until you are sure it’s got through.
“We’re meeting at the bar at 8pm, right?”
You can also use a technique called fogging to reflect what the other person has said, and then repeat your point.
For example, you might say “you said that originally we were meeting at 7, but there’s been a change of plan, and now I’ll meet you at the bar at 8.”, Long diversions are liable to prompt people to lose interest in what you are talking about, and could alienate your audience. It can be best to keep a conversation focussed on the immediate issue at hand, especially if this is a work meeting, or you are discussing something with a friend, partner or family member.If you change the subject or lose focus, the person you are talking to may interpret this as a lack of interest on your part.
Keeping to the topic at hand shows a level of respect for the people you are talking to.
For example, if you are talking about an issue at work, don’t suddenly change the subject to something unrelated.
If a colleague says something like “we have this problem with our supplier, and we need to figure out what to do,” respond directly and don’t say something like “yeah, ok. Actually I was just thinking about what holiday to take next year.”

Adjust your tone and volume.,
Maintain eye contact.,
Think about body language.",How to Get People to Listen to You2," It’s not just what you say that is important, it’s also how you say it. The tone and volume of your voice can have a big impact on how people respond to you, and whether or not they listen to you. Try to speak at a normal conversational volume, not too loud, and not too quiet. Use a tone that is firm but not aggressive. This will make you sound more confident and assured.Don’t mumble your words, and pay attention to the responses of your interlocutors to judge their reactions.
If they are leaning forwards, it might be because you are talking a little too quietly and they are struggling to hear you.

, Eye contact is an essential part of non-verbal communication. Just by looking at somebody you are inviting a certain level of interaction and engagement. Research shows that somebody returning eye contact is generally indicative of the acceptance of an invitation, and averting the eyes can suggest a rejection. People who seek eye contact with their interlocutors are generally perceived as more believable and earnest.Try to maintain eye contact with the person you are talking to, but be sure to do so in a non-aggressive way and don’t stare.
Try to maintain eye contact for around 50% of the time you are talking, and 70% of the time you are listening.
Once you establish eye contact, hold it for around five seconds.
When you look away, do it slowly. Don’t suddenly look in another direction.
Try to establish eye contact before you start speaking to someone to make a strong initial impression., Good body language can really help you create a strong impression when talking. It’s important to consider your body language and how well it matches up with what you are saying. For example, you will be sending mixed and confusing messages if you speaking firmly, but looking down at floor.


Try to maintain good eye contact, stand tall and straight, and relax your face while talking.Body language is thought to give an honest expression of how you are feeling.Try to look appropriately relaxed for the situation, but don’t try too hard and look overly relaxed. This might signal that you are disinterested."

Evaluate your audience.,
Listen.,
Find commonality with your audience.,
Identify non-verbal signals.",How to Get People to Listen to You3," If you want to be an effective communicator, and ensure that people listen to what you have to say, it’s important to understand who you are talking to. If you trying to engage people on a subject completely alien to them, it’s going to be a difficult task. Ask yourself the following questions about your audience:


Who are they, and what do they do?
How can the audience benefit from listening to you?
What do they already know about the topic?
What is the relationship between you and the audience?
What are your audience interested in?
What impact will what you say have on the audience?
Asking the audience simple questions will help you to answer these questions.
For example, if you are talking about a recent report, you could ask “how many of you have had time to read the new report yet?”, Being a good listening is an essential part of being a good communicator. Whether it is a serious conversation with a significant other, or a business discussion with some colleagues, making the effort to listen and understand the concerns of other people will really help. If you feel like the person you are talking to is not properly responding to you, stop for a moment and just listen. Maintain eye contact when the other person is speaking, and try to concentrate and empathise.Try to practice active listening by following these basic rules:


Try to understand before you try to be understood.
Be non-judgemental.
Give the speaker your undivided attention.
Use silence effectively, and don’t interrupt unless necessary., If you want to get people to listen to you and take your ideas on board, it can be very helpful to try and find some common ground with your interlocutors. Your audience may be more receptive to what you have to say if you can frame it in a way that is more inclusive and connects directly with their concerns.


For example, if you are explaining a problem you have had, you could try and introduce it by relating it to something that happened to the person you are talking to.
You may be more likely to form trusting relationships with like-minded people, who you share certain experiences or outlooks with., Try to pay attention to non-verbal signals from the people you are talking to. If you can identify body language and gestures that suggest you are losing your audience, you can try to get to the point more quickly, or try to engage more directly with those who seem disinterested. Look out in particular for the following signals:


Folded arms: this may suggest the person is feeling closed off or defensive.
Lack of eye contact: this can indicate that someone is not listening or interested. It may also suggest embarrassment or being uncomfortable.
Turning away: if someone turns his back, or leans away, it may mean they are losing interest and looking to get away."

Use this exercise if you say ""TH"" instead of ""S"" or ""Z."",
Smile at a mirror.,
Close your teeth together.,
Place your tongue in the correct ""S"" position.,
Push air through your mouth.,
Try saying ""EET"" while paying attention to your tongue shape.,
Turn the EET sound into an EETS, then an EES sound.,
Practice these exercises frequently.,
Ask a speech therapist for more tips.",How to Get Rid of a Lisp1," In a frontal lisp, the speaker puts his tongue forward against his teeth when he says the ""S"" or ""Z"" sound, causing a ""TH"" sound instead.If he has a gap between his front teeth, he may push his tongue through this gap. If you're not sure whether this describes you, look at yourself in a mirror while you make the ""S"" or ""Z"" sound.


With a frontal lisp, ""S"" ends up sounding like the ""TH"" in ""math"" and ""Z"" ends up sounding like the ""TH"" in ""father."";
, Find a mirror in a well-lit area, so you can easily see your mouth while you speak. Smile into the mirror to display your teeth. Smiling will both make it easier to watch yourself, and help pull the tongue back slightly, where it needs to be for an ""s"" sound., Keep your teeth together, but remain smiling with your lips apart. You do not need to clench your teeth together hard.

, Move your tongue so the tip is just behind the teeth, high up against the roof of the mouth. Don't press your tongue against your teeth, and keep your tongue fairly relaxed, not pressing hard.

, If you don't hear a hissing ""S"" sound, your tongue may be too far forward still. Try pulling your tongue back and smiling forward. If you can't get it, don't get frustrated. Try the next exercise below, and keep practicing often.

, If saying ""s"" is still difficult in the above exercise, try this exercise as well. Separate your teeth slightly, and press the sides of your tongue against your upper back molars (the teeth in the back top of your mouth). Smile, and try to say ""EET"" and keep the back of your tongue in this shape while the tip of your tongue rises to make the final ""T"" sound. If the back of your tongue falls when this happens, keep practicing until you can say ""EET"" with your tongue in this position.


This is the sound ""EET"" as in ""sleet"" or ""meet.""
If you are having difficulty keeping the back of your tongue raised, use a tongue depressor or popsicle stick to hold your tongue up while you say ""EET.""

, Once you can say ""EET"" with your tongue in the right position, say it again while holding the ""T"" sound. Leave the tip of your tongue up there while you say ""T-T-T-T-T-T."" The flow of air past your tongue tip can turn this sound into an ""S."" Keep practicing this exercise until you can get an ""EEETS"" sound, then an ""EES"" sound, although you don't have to get this right on your day one.


You might end up spraying some spit on this exercise!

, Try these exercises at least once a day, and preferably several times a day. Once you can repeat the ""s"" sound many times in a row, try to use it in words and sentences. It might be easier for you to say nonsense words first, such as ""beejseet"" or ""ah sah asah,"" then move on to reading aloud.

, If you are still having trouble with your lisp after a few weeks, try finding a speech therapist in your area. She should be able to give you exercises that are individualized for your speech patterns, specifically designed to help you say the sounds you're trying to say.

Use this method for lisps that produce a ""slushy"" sound.,
Put your tongue in the butterfly position.,
Practice quickly putting your tongue in this position.,
Blow air through your mouth in this position.,
Keep practicing this exercise, and trying to say ""S"" normally.,
Visit a speech therapist (if necessary).",How to Get Rid of a Lisp2," In a lateral lisp, the speaker's tongue is in the position for an ""L"" sound whenever he tries to make an ""S"" sound. In other words, the tip of the tongue is up against the curve where the roof of the mouth begins to rise higher. When the speaker tries to make an ""S"" sound, air escapes over the sides of his tongue, making a ""slushy"" or ""spitty"" sound instead.Often, ""SH"" as in ""shoot"" and ""ZH"" as in ""massage"" or ""conclusion"" are difficult to pronounce as well.

, Say ""knee"" or ""bin"" and keep the vowel going, without finishing the word. During this sound, you should feel your tongue's sides rise up in your mouth, but the middle stays lowered. The tongue tip remains lowered as well, not touching anything.


This tongue position looks something like a butterfly, if you picture the center of your tongue as the butterfly's body, and the sides as the raised wings.

, Think of this as strength exercises for your tongue. Relax your tongue, then quickly raise it into the ""butterfly position."" This is making the sides of your tongue stronger, and helping them get into the habit of blocking the excess air flow that makes the ""slushy"" lateral lisp. Practice this as long as necessary, until you can easily reach this position., Keep your tongue in the butterfly position. Blow air through the groove made by your tongue instead. This should produce a sound that sounds more like an ""S,"" or a ""Z"" if you vocalize while blowing., Practice the butterfly position every day, and blow through it to make an airy ""S"" sound. Then relax your tongue again and raise the tip to just behind your teeth. Try to say an ""S"" sound. As your tongue becomes stronger and you become more used to the position of the sides of your tongue, your ordinary ""S"" sound will sound less and less slushy.

, If you are still having trouble with your lisp in a few weeks, try to find a speech therapist in your area. She may give you specific exercises that help you shape your mouth in the right position.

Learn about lisps in children.,
Don't keep pointing out the lisp.,
Treat allergies and sinus issues.,
Stop thumb sucking habits.,
Consider using oral motor exercises.,
Talk to a doctor about ""tongue tie."",
Follow tongue surgery with tongue exercises.",How to Get Rid of a Lisp3," Most lisps in children are frontal lisps, in which the tongue is pushed too far forward when the child tries to make the ""s"" sound. Many children have this lisp, but most of them grow out of it naturally. If a child does not, professional opinion is divided on whether the child should start speech therapy for a frontal lisp at the age of four and a half, or wait until he turns seven. Consult with a doctor or speech therapist for advice specific to the child, but know that there is no need for concern if a child under four and a half years old has a lisp.


If the lisp has a different form, with the tongue positioned further back, consulting a speech therapist is recommended.

, Drawing attention to the lisp can cause embarrassment and shame, which does not help the child get rid of the lisp., If the child frequently has a stuffy nose, sneezing fits, or other sinus complaints, this may be affecting her speech. This is especially likely to be a cause if the child makes many sounds with her tongue pushed forward, not just ""S.""Seek the advice of a doctor for child-safe treatments for allergies and sinus infections.

, While thumb sucking is usually harmless in toddlers, it can contribute to a lisp by pushing the teeth out of position.If the child continues sucking his thumb after the age of four, stop the habit by substituting a favorite activity of the child's, one that uses both hands. Telling the child to stop or pulling the thumb out of his mouth is less likely to be effective than positive reinforcement, or rewarding the child when he stops on his own.

, Oral motor exercises are sometimes recommended for toddlers to help develop speech, but for ordinary circumstances research shows that they are not effective.However, it is possible that a lisping child may benefit from better mouth musculature, and the relevant exercises are simple and harmless: give the child a straw for her drinks, and encourage her to play with toys that involve blowing, like toy horns or bubbles., People with ""tongue tie,"" or ankyloglossia, are born with a short attachment, or frenulum, between the tongue and the base of the mouth, or an attachment too close to the tip of the tongue. If the child has trouble licking his lips, or sticking his tongue out, this short attachment may be the cause of the lisp.This does not necessarily mean the child needs surgery, but a doctor may recommend it in some cases. The surgery, called frenectomy, takes a few minutes at most, and typically results in no side effects other than a sore mouth., If the doctor does recommend tongue surgery and the child's guardians decide to go through with it, make sure to follow the surgery with tongue exercises. These will strengthen the tongue, help prevent speech problems, and prevent the frenulum from reattaching, which can happen in some versions of the surgery. If the baby is still breastfeeding, her doctor will likely recommend that you gently stretch the baby's tongue yourself, after cleaning your hands.For anyone older than breastfeeding age, follow the advice of the surgeon and the speech therapist.

Expect to make regular, weekly appointments until the lisp is cured.,
Be prepared to talk about your medical and speech history, or your child's.,
Expect to be screened and assessed, which is usually just a short conversation or set of word tests.,
Prepare for hands-on practice sessions with your SLP.,
Expect to get homework.,
Expect to work for several weeks, not to be fixed instantly.",How to Get Rid of a Lisp4," Speech pathology is not an instant fix. Great speech-language pathologists (SLPs) will work with you or your child to help develop great speaking habits and tricks. The more you can meet, the faster you will get rid of your lisp.Sessions are usually between 20 minutes and an hour.
Some clinics offer group therapy, easing the pressure on you to perform., You need to know the causes of the lisp to find solutions. While some people are born with lisps, some speech problems are rooted in medical history, sometimes going back to birth. Bring a copy of medical records with you. A good professional leaves no stone unturned.

Parents are instrumental in helping their children beat a lisp -- expect the therapist to enlist your help., In order to determine the next course of action, the SLP will want to hear your speak. This generally consists of simple questions or repeated words. You may even do an Oral Motor Exam, which is a series of exercises to see how your mouth moves independently of speaking.

If you've brought your child in, the SLP may want to observe them playing, with other kids, or with you. Seeing them speak naturally, and not under pressure, is important.
You may have your speech recorded for learning and practice., Once the issues are diagnosed, it's time to fix them. This usually consists of copy-catting. The therapist will say a word, and you'll work on copying the physical movements -- mouth, tongue, and breath. You may be given a mirror to help you watch your mouth's movements., Many of these exercises can, and should be, practiced at home. Expect to get a series of handouts helping you work on the lisp later on., Know that you will keep developing new strategies for as long as it takes. Don't get discouraged if he/she says it may take a few weeks or months. Once you've got the skills down to get rid of a lisp, they rarely ever leave you again.

Everyone is different -- some might have weekly sessions for a month, others may need a year or more.
Ask for exercises or ways to practice at home if you're dissatisfied with your progress.

Know what communication really is.,
Have courage to say what you think.,
Practice.,
Make eye contact.,
Use gestures.,
Don’t send mixed messages.,
Be aware of what your body is saying.,
Manifest constructive attitudes and beliefs.,
Develop effective listening skills: Not only should one be able to speak effectively, one must listen to the other person's words and engage in communication on what the other person is speaking about.,
Enunciate your words.,
Pronounce your words correctly.,
Use the right words.,
Slow your speech down.,
Develop your voice.,
Animate your voice.,
Use appropriate volume.",How to Develop Good Communication Skills," Communication is the process of transferring signals/messages between a sender and a receiver through various methods (written words, nonverbal cues, spoken words). It is also the mechanism we use to establish and modify relationships.;
, Be confident in knowing that you can make worthwhile contributions to conversation. Take time each day to be aware of your opinions and feelings so you can adequately convey them to others. Individuals who are hesitant to speak because they do not feel their input would be worthwhile need not fear. What is important or worthwhile to one person may not be to another and may be more so to someone else.

, Developing advanced communication skills begins with simple interactions. Communication skills can be practiced every day in settings that range from the social to the professional. New skills take time to refine, but each time you use your communication skills, you open yourself to opportunities and future partnerships.

, Whether you are speaking or listening, looking into the eyes of the person with whom you are conversing can make the interaction more successful. Eye contact conveys interest and encourages your partner to be interested in you in return.


One technique to help with this is to consciously look into one of the listener’s eyes and then move to the other eye. Going back and forth between the two makes your eyes appear to sparkle. Another trick is to imagine a letter “T” on the listener’s face ,with the crossbar being an imaginary line across the eye brows and the vertical line coming down the center of the nose. Keep your eyes scanning that “T” zone.

, These include gestures with your hands and face. Make your whole body talk. Use smaller gestures for individuals and small groups. The gestures should get larger as the group that one is addressing increases in size.

, Make your words, gestures, facial expressions and tone match. Disciplining someone while smiling sends a mixed message and is therefore ineffective. If you have to deliver a negative message, make your words, facial expressions, and tone match the message.

, Body language can say so much more than a mouthful of words. An open stance with arms relaxed at your sides tells anyone around you that you are approachable and open to hearing what they have to say.


Arms crossed and shoulders hunched, on the other hand, suggest disinterest in conversation or unwillingness to communicate. Often, communication can be stopped before it starts by body language that tells people you don't want to talk.
Appropriate posture and an approachable stance can make even difficult conversations flow more smoothly.

, The attitudes you bring to communication will have a huge impact on the way you compose yourself and interact with others. Choose to be honest, patient, optimistic, sincere, respectful, and accepting of others. Be sensitive to other people's feelings, and believe in others' competence.

, Avoid the impulse to listen only for the end of their sentence so that you can blurt out the ideas or memories your mind while the other person is speaking.

, Speak clearly and don’t mumble. If people are always asking you to repeat yourself, try to do a better job of articulating yourself in a better manner.

, People will judge your competency through your vocabulary. If you aren’t sure of how to say a word, don’t use it. Improve your vocabulary by reading new words in daily routine. Look in the dictionary to help you learn how to pronounce a new word.

, If you’re not sure of the meaning of a word, don’t use it. Grab a dictionary and start a daily habit of learning one new word per day. Use it sometime in your conversations during the day.

, People will perceive you as nervous and unsure of yourself if you talk fast. However, be careful not to slow down to the point where people begin to finish your sentences just to help you finish.

, A high or whiny voice is not perceived to be one of authority. In fact, a high and soft voice can make you sound like prey to an aggressive co-worker or make others not take you seriously. Begin doing exercises to lower the pitch of your voice. Try singing, but do it an octave lower on all your favorite songs. Practice this and, after a period of time, your voice will begin to lower.

, Avoid a monotone and use dynamics. Your pitch should raise and lower periodically. Radio DJ's are usually a good example of this.

, Use a volume that is appropriate for the setting. Speak more softly when you are alone and close. Speak louder when you are speaking to larger groups or across larger spaces.

Ask yourself if the issue is important.,
Reflect calmly.,
Choose the right time and place.,
Strive to understand before you criticize.",How to Criticize Tactfully1," Most people don't respond well to being criticized often or over unimportant matters. The first rule of tactful criticism is that criticism should be rare. Pick your battles carefully.If you give people negative feedback too often, they may begin to feel like you are going to criticize them no matter what they do. The result can be that over time, people may begin to ignore your criticisms.For example, if you think someone's wardrobe choices are unflattering, it's probably best to just keep that opinion to yourself, unless you see the apparel choices he or she is making affecting his or her personal or professional life in important ways. By contrast, if someone you know often makes jokes that are offensive or hurtful to yourself and others in their social circle, this might be an issue you want to bring up.;
, Before bring up the issue, spend some time thinking about what you want to communicate and what outcome you hope your criticism will achieve. Make sure you feel calm and collected before raising your criticism.


Get emotions under control before criticizing someone. Being emotional can decrease your ability to be tactful and make the other person feel attacked., To avoid embarrassing or upsetting the other person, be thoughtful about when and where you choose to offer your criticism. Never criticize another person in front of others.Use common sense and avoid criticizing someone during a time that he or she is likely to be stressed out or upset about something.You want your criticism to be received as calmly as possible.
Although it may seem like a good idea, avoid using email or other forms electronic communication to deliver criticism. This may be easier for you, but it also raises the likelihood that your words or feelings might be misunderstood by the other person., Before you criticize someone, try your best to understand the other person's perspective on the issue. If possible, bring up the topic, and listen to what he or she has to say about it before being critical.


Listening before you speak will allow you be couch your criticisms in terms that show you recognize and appreciate the other person's feelings and perspectives.For example, you might ask your friend who has been making offensive jokes, ""Do you ever worry about how some people might respond to your jokes?""

"
"
Start with a compliment.,
Use a calm tone of voice.,
Use appropriate body language.,
Choose your words carefully.,
Try to relate.,
Be specific and don't pile on the critiques.,
Offer praise.,
Accept criticism.",How to Criticize Tactfully2," Before you criticize someone, point out something that he or she does well or that you like. This can help soften the blow of your critique.


Starting with an honest compliment can get the conversation started on right footing, and avoid making the other person feel attacked.Sticking with the example of a friend who makes hurtful jokes, you might start by saying, ""Jim, I think you are a really funny guy. The thing is....""

, When raising your criticism, keep tone of voice calm and friendly. This will reduce the likelihood of the other person becoming defensive or angry.Even if the issue you are raising is something that makes you feel upset, keep your tone thoughtful and relaxed. The other person will be more likely to see your point of view.

, What you do with your face, arms, and body while criticizing someone can also play an important role in how the other person receives your message. Make sure your body language communicates calmness and matches what you are saying.For example, crossing your arms can communicate to some people that you are upset or closed off. Pointing at someone can be seen as an attacking gesture. Maintain eye contact, and try to keep your body language open and friendly, or at least neutral.

, Choosing your words with care may be the most important part of tactful criticism. Explain your problem with the other person's actions using non-judgemental language. Focus on your feelings about the issue rather than criticizing the other person.For example, if your friend has been making racially insensitive jokes, do not say ""You seem like a racist"" or even ""Your jokes are kind of racist."" Instead, say ""Sometimes your jokes are upsetting to me, and I worry that you might be offending others as well.""
Say what you need to say in ""soft"" terms that won't feel like an attack. Criticize the behavior that's bothering you, not the character of the person you are criticizing.Personal attacks are seldom well received.
Keep your message short and to the point. Talking too much can increase the possibility that you will accidentally say something you regret.

, Your criticism may be better received if you can point out that you have made similar mistakes in the past. This shows the other person that you can relate to him or her and that you aren't suggesting you are superior.In the case of your friend making the offensive jokes, you might say something like: ""I understand you aren't trying to upset anyone. One time, I accidentally upset some of my friends by..."" From here, you could go on to tell a story of a time you upset people without meaning to.

, Keep your criticism focused on one specific issue, and don't stockpile criticisms to deliver all at once. This can make the other person feel overwhelmed and attacked.If your friend who makes insulting jokes also has a tendency to burp loudly at meals, this is not something to bring up right now. That's a separate issue that you can raise at a later time if you decide it's important.

, During and after the criticism, offer praise for changes you see in the other person's behavior. This lets him or her know you have noticed any efforts that have been made in response to the issue you have raised.During the conversation, you might tell your friend, ""I really appreciate how sensitive to my feelings about this you have been during this conversation""
After the conversation, if your friend stops making offensive jokes, you could say something like, ""Your jokes have really made me laugh lately. Thanks for hearing my concerns about this.""

, It is not unusual for a person who is criticized to respond by raising issues he or she may have with you. If this happens, accept these criticisms calmly and with an open mind."
"
Be honest.,
Be factual.,
Offer alternatives.,
Ask questions to promote self-evaluation.,
Don't argue.",How to Criticize Tactfully3," When trying to criticize someone in a manner that is sensitive to his or her feelings, it's easy to end up sugar-coating things so much that you lose track of the important criticism you want to convey. Remember that tact is also about honesty, and don't soften the message so much that it gets lost altogether.Be assertive. Make it clear what it is that's bothering you and why.
If your friend's jokes are offensive, don't just say, ""You know, some people are just so sensitive that they don't get your jokes."" Tell your friend that you and others find his or her jokes hurtful.

, Similarly, focus your criticism on factual statements. This doesn't mean you can't express your feelings, but do so in factual terms. Don't speculate, judge, or talk down to the other person.This will help you present your criticism in an assertive, objective manner.
You can say, for example: ""When you said X, it made me feel very hurt. I talked to Sarah afterward, and she said your words made her really angry."" These are statements about emotions, but they are factual statements. This is much more effective than saying: ""Your jokes are mean and rude."" That's a judgement, not a fact.

, Criticism without a plan for change is of little use. Make sure it is clear what behaviors you would like to see.This way, you offer a positive alternative rather than just a critique.


For example, you might tell your friend, ""Instead of making fun of people's accents, I wish you'd do more of your celebrity impressions. Those are hilarious!""

, Asking questions can help the person you are criticizing to reach conclusions about why his or behaviors are troublesome and what he or she might do differently. Asking questions like, ""Can you understand why someone might be bothered by that?"" or ""Can you think of any way to handle this situation better?"" can help the person you are criticizing see the root cause of the issue and makes him or her a participant in planning ways to avoid the problem in the future.
This gives the other person a chance to give and follow their own advice. Often, people will be more likely to follow through on changing their behaviors if they think up alternatives on their own., Factual statements are harder to argue with, and hopefully if you've made your criticism in a sensitive manner, the other person will listen and understand. However, if he or she tries to argue with you don't be drawn into an argument.


Arguments can cause the person to become more rigid in his or her views and more resistant to change.For example, your friend might say: ""You don't know what you're talking about. My jokes are funny and people like them."" You might respond by saying: ""I've just told you how I feel, and what our other friends have told me. I hope you'll take that into consideration."" Then, end the conversation.

Use hand gestures to add emphasis to speech.,
Use open hands and palms up for a positive effect.,
Keep hands behind your back to show confidence.",How to Use Hand Gestures Effectively1," Hand gestures can be a way to add more force to what you're saying. These are often known as ""illustrative gestures."" It can be used to convey intensity, confidence, and even be used to garner attention to a point you're trying to make.Use a solid shaking fist to knock home an extremely important point you're trying to make. Be careful to not use an irritated voice to accompany it or it can come off as anger.
If you are giving a presentation, use your hand to highlight a particular paragraph or slide that contains important information.
Pointing can be used to literally make a point , or to accompany something like, ""This one's important,"" or ""Let me tell you."" It can also be used as playful gesture to acknowledge someone. Be careful about pointing directly at someone, though, as this can come off as rude or even aggressive.Make sure your hand gestures match up to your speech. Do not try to add emphasis to a point that is not worth emphasizing, or add force to a point that is not meant to be forceful.;
, Whether you're speaking in front of a large group of people or one individual, hands facing up usually invite positive responses from people. Combined with an outstretching of your arms, it can communicate effectiveness, acceptance, and trustworthiness.If you use this gesture with a shrugging of the shoulders it can give off a feeling of uncertainty, so you will also want to monitor other parts of your body, too.
Palms down typically gives others a feeling of confidence because they give you an aura of confidence or even dominance.

, Much like hands up front can show defensiveness, hands behind the back with an exposed torso shows confidence. This is especially an effective hand gesture if you are walking side-by-side with someone and communicating with them. This demonstrates that you are open to making yourself vulnerable, and not worried about protecting yourself with your hands. This gesture is especially useful to gain someone's trust."

Use persuasive hand gestures.,
Use hand gestures to aid in memorization.,
Use hand gestures to recall information.",How to Use Hand Gestures Effectively2," You can give off an air of authority and be more convincing by using hand gestures to seem persuasive. This is not going to necessarily compensate for mistakes in speaking, but can make you a more effective communicator.


For example, the ""steeple"" is when you press your finger tips together to form a gesture that resembles a church steeple. This is a gesture commonly used by superiors talking to subordinates and people like managers and lawyers. It gives off a sign of confidence and conveyance of command over a subject. , Just as talking about what you learn helps encode memories more effectively, hand gestures have a similar affect. Research shows that people who gesture while speaking or completing a task, are more likely to make it a memory than those not gesturing. Thus, gesturing while doing a task or speaking can be crucial to the first steps of storing memories away.When you have to memorize something, such as a speech, or directions, teach yourself gestures that go with each important moment.
Get in the habit of gesturing while you study.
People who are taught gestures to accompany new vocabulary and language are more likely to later recall those words later on by using the gestures they have learnt.When a child is taught a specific hand gesture to accompany new words and sentences, the memory of it is more likely to stick around., When you are having trouble remembering information, gesturing with your hands can help you bring the words to mind. If you have trouble recalling information as you speak, gesturing with your hands can help."

Avoid using hand gestures that convey nervousness or diffidence.,
Don't cause a distraction with your hands.,
Don't use hand gestures to compensate for verbal sputtering.",How to Use Hand Gestures Effectively3," Even if you think you are comfortable talking to someone, a number of ways you move your body can betray this. Certain hand gestures show nervousness, timidity, and even submissiveness. Hands in your pockets, for example, gives off a signal you may be nervous. Hands crossed in front give off a notion of weakness or timidity as if you are in need of protection.Squeezing hands together is also a gesture that can convey a ""self-soothing"" gesture that you are nervous or fearful., While hands can certainly make you a more effective communicator, and even cause people to be more comfortable around, they can also detract from your ability to communicate effectively.


It is recommended keeping your hand gestures in a ""box,"" while talking to others; a space from the top of your chest to the bottom of your waist. What this means is you should keep within certain parts of your body because then it allows people to keep looking at you and what you're saying, rather than trying to track your hands., Sometimes people who have trouble finding words use hand gestures as a sign of nervousness or distraction. Avoid doing this as it does not help clarify your point anymore, but only serves to likely confuse people more.If you find yourself unable to come up with what you want to say next, slow your hands down. Perhaps put them in a calming gesture in front of you, as this is better than using wild hand movements to exasperate difficulties communicating.

Know that you must focus equally on context and visual cues as the actual lips.,
Lipread sentences, not single words.,
Check in to facial movements and expressions to understand tone and mood.,
Study body-language and posturing to learn from non-verbal cues.,
Know which syllables look similar to avoid common mistakes.,
Use the words you do know to figure out the ones you don't.,
Ask people to speak a little bit slower if you're comfortable.",How to Read Lips1," Only 30-40% of sounds in the English language are noticeable by sight. Too many of our words and syllables are so similar that you can't actually just tell them by lip reading alone. Most lip-readers will tell you, at the end of the day, that lip-reading isn't actually reading. The words aren't so simple, and tics, mumbling, accents, and mouth covering all make straight ""reading"" impossible. Once you learn to make lipreading a part of your communication, not the only tool you have, you will be much more successful.


At Better Hearing Australia's annual lip reading competition, most people score only 40-50%. The few who hit 90% and higher do so through context, context, and guess work.;
, Trying to pick up every single word is going to be hard, and you'll struggle mightily. Most lip-readers know that long words and sentences are easier to read than short ones because longer phrases allow you to fill in the blanks through context. By focusing on the whole sentence, you can comfortably miss a few words here and there and still understand what was actually said., The eyes and mouth are incredibly express -- often more so than your tone of voice. Don't just look at someone's lips, as the rest of their face offers important contextual clues to determine not only the sentence but how the sentence is said.


Tugging at the lips (small grimaces or smiles) often indicate worry, fear, or anxiety.
Raised eye brows also tend to indicate anxiety or stress.
Furrowed brows and foreheads indicate displeasure or anger.
Creases around the edges of the eyes indicate happiness and excitement.
Cocking the head to the side usually indicates discomfort or even slight hostility. Looking down shows nervousness, shyness, or an unwillingness to communicate., You're trying to translate one sense (sound) into another (sight), and this is an inherently impossible task to perfect. The best lip readers use everything to their advantage, including body language, to gauge mood, tone, and themes of conversation. While imperfect, this list covers many of the basics:Closed off arms tend to indicate anger or aggression. Open arms indicate friendship, closeness, and honestly. Open and closed legs have similar connotations.
The way a person's shoulders and hips point often indicate their priorities or who they are most comfortable with.
Leaning towards you implies intimacy and connection. Leaning away generally indicates discomfort or confusion.
Big, expansive posture implies confidence, strength, and dominance. Slouching shows a lack of confidence .
There is a lot of nuance, subtlety, and interpretation involved in body language, and every situation is different. But, used with lip reading, you can learn a lot very quickly in most situations., There are roughly 38 different sounds formed in English. Unfortunately, only a third of them are visually different.The following list of sounds can get tricky, as they have similar mouth shapes when formed, or are frequently confused. Note that the brackets indicate the letters sound, not the letters themselves, are what gets confusing:


& & ,
& ,
, , & & & , You're basically given an incomplete map and asked to fill in the blanks, and you're not always going to get it right. But this is far more effective then harping on every word and sound. Many lip readers know they need to take a second to ""re-construct"" the sentence before responding, allowing them to speak more fluidly and skip over issues., Just be honest with your conversation partner and ask them to slow it down a bit. The point of a chat isn't to impress someone with your skills, but to actually talk to someone! Slower, better enunciated words will be much easier to read and pull context from.

Now go practice.",How to Describe a Person's Physical Appearance," Start with the big stuff, the things that are easy to describe. Are they tall, short, wide, thin, young or old? Take a quick look at the picture below, then describe what you see.


You can tell with just the silhouette that they are:

Young
Average height
Short hair
Male
Casually dressed
Musician
Bonus points if you recognized he's playing an electric guitar.


Don't over analyze—your first impression is what you're looking for here, and this whole process should only take a few seconds from start to finish. You should try to to look past obvious distractions, and notice as much as you can. If a guy has a massive tattoo on his forearm, or a girl is wearing a revealing top, that's great—note it in passing and take in the whole image. You can stare later!;
, Look at your person of interest's hair, and make a quick mental snapshot. Long, shoulder-length, or short? Blonde, brunette, or redhead? Does this person wear a distinct hairstyle? Do they even have hair? Take a look at the picture below, briefly, then describe everything you remember about her hair.


This one might have been a little harder than the silhouette, as there were a couple of distractions added in. Still, you should have remembered a few things about her from that brief glance:

She's blonde.
Her hair is on the long side
It's slightly wavy
Her hair is probably pinned up.
Bonus points if you noted she has blue eyes.



, Confirm your initial impression of body shape, and pick out a few more points—are they muscular, well-fed, thick, busty, or thin? What color is their shirt or blouse? What color are their pants or skirt? Again, don't go for too much detail, just the overall impression. Take a look at the picture below for no more than 5 seconds, then see if you can answer the questions that follow.


Male or female? OK, no peeking! Try to do this without referring to the picture.
What color is his hair?
What is his body type?
What color shirt is he wearing?
What color are the frames of his sunglasses.
Bonus points: turn away from the screen, then describe the blurry figure in the foreground. How close were you?

, The guy in Bermuda shorts may have legs that are whiter than the background of this article, or that woman in the short skirt may have legs that keep you from noticing anything else, but unless they're really unusual for some reason—an amputation, they are unusually thick or thin, or covered in tattoos—there's not much to legs. In fact, if you do notice a person's legs, it's more likely something else is attracting your attention to them. For example, take a look at this picture briefly:


Describe what you saw. Chances are what you remember is not their legs, but what they were wearing.
Bonus points: how many of the models were wearing shoes or boots? That’s right—just one.

, Are they new, old, well-cared-for or beat up? Knowing this will not only help you recall this person later, it's a good way to learn a little bit about them.


What kind of shoes is she wearing? Bonus points if you don't look back at the picture! Sorry, that was a trick question—you can't see her shoes. The most noticeable thing was the fact that the groom is wearing tennis shoes with his suit, and it may have distracted you from taking in the whole picture. More bonus points if you can recall:

What color is her hair?
Is his hair long or short?
What color is his tie?
What color is his belt buckle?



, Start from the feet, and work your way back up. What you're doing is taking those first impressions, and solidifying them into a memory by repetition. If you have the time and can do it without seeming creepy, take a second look.

, You have got the basics down, so now it's time focus on the details.

, Even identical twins have facial differences that make every face on earth completely unique.

, Are their eyebrows thick or thin, light or dark? Do they have small eyes or large eyes? Are they deep-set or bulgy? Are they almond-shaped or round? Do they have long, thick, curly lashes, or are they sparse, straight or short? Look at the picture for 3 seconds, look away, and describe his eyes.


Look again. How did you do?

, The person's nose can be almost any shape or size. Is it long or short, turned up or hooked? Is it wide or narrow? The nose carries a lot of the weight of how the face looks, and it matters whether you're looking from the front or from the side.


Bonus points if you can describe the nose of the man with the eyes, above. Mega bonus points if you can describe the nose of the woman with blond hair at the top of the page.

, Arguably the most expressive part of a person's face, this is the hardest to pin down. If the person's laughing, or angry, or shouting, they all change the shape of the mouth. Still, no matter what else is going on, there are a couple things you can pick out. Is the mouth wide or small? Does the person have full lips or thin lips, and is their cupid's-bow on top very defined?

, Such things as a mole or birthmark, scars, or tattoos are all fair game for recollection. If you see them, make note.


Turn away from the monitor, and sketch her tattoo. While you're there, earn some bonus points and describe everything else you remember about her.

, Ask yourself: Is it rapid, is it slow? Is the person clumsy and staggering, or confident with heads high up?, People sometimes use word and image associations to remember things about people. Here are some examples:

, Here we have a woman with very long blonde hair. If that were not memorable enough, add in her surroundings: a field of long, golden grasses.


Think ""long golden grasses, long golden tresses."" You have associated two images together, each of which will shore up the other.

, In this example, there's not a lot there, but there's certainly enough to form a mental connection to the surroundings. In the background, a solid brick wall. In the foreground, a guy who's about as solid, smooth, and hard as that concrete wall. Think ""hard as concrete,"" and you'll have a mental image that won't soon go away.

, The same thing applies here: pick out something in the surroundings that fit the image, and marry the two together. There are a couple obvious mnemonics with the image below:


What color are her eyes? In fourteen-hundred and ninety two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue! Her eyes, of course, are now ocean blue.
What about her hair? The sand in this picture happens to be very light, so use that. Sandy colored hair. Blonde hair.

, Tomorrow, when you get up, ask yourself, ""what color were the eyes and hair of the woman in the last picture?"" You will surprise yourself when you know the answer without even blinking an eyelid!

, Take a walk downtown, and pick a random person on the street. Give yourself about 5 seconds to lock in everything you can about them. If it's possible, take a picture.


Break it down like we showed you in the first section, top to bottom.
Add in mnemonics like we showed you in the second section.
When you get home, write down everything you remember about them, no matter how obvious or how trivial. Now, take a look at the picture you took. How close were you?
Repeat this exercise regularly, and you'll find you'll soon be able to describe not just the stranger you picked out, but the people around them as well.

Watch TV and focus on how people's lips move when they talk.,
Stare at yourself in the mirror, say the alphabet, talk out song lyrics, recite something.,
Ask your friends to help you practice by talking clearly, slowly, and head on.,
Consider taking a lipreading class.,
Be confident in your skills and push yourself to have conversations.",How to Read Lips2," Start with the news, as you'll have clear speakers who are looking right at the camera every single time. If you have partial hearing, turn the volume up and listen along -- you'll be able to attach the ""sounds"" to the lip motions. If you are completely deaf, turn the closed captions on and use them to guide your lip reading.

, The whole time focusing on what your lips look like when they make different sounds/words. Slow down and try out tricky syllables or related sounds (like p, b, and m) to get used to the combination of word and visual. By saying the words out loud as you read, you help internalize the syllable for future lip reading.

, Unfortunately, most conversations don't take place in a television studio. To improve your daily lipreading skills, start with your friends. Let them know you're working on lipreading, and that they can help by speaking clearly, slowly, and looking straight at you. As you get better, ask them to speed up to normal conversational pace.

, Offered in most cities and towns, these are casual, supportive communities to practice in. Frequently you'll work together on difficult syllables and tricks, then break into conversation groups to get some practice in. Look online for lipreading classes to grow and develop your skills., The best way how to learn to lipread in public is to start lipreading in public. You may feel nervous, but just remember that very, very few people are going to get angry, upset, or otherwise negative when they find out you're lip reading. Communication is a two-way street -- and people will be willing and happy to help you learn and repeat sentences you've missed."

Gather your materials.,
Poke the nail through the bottom of each can/cup.,
Thread one end of the string into one of the cans.,
Tie the string inside the receiver.,
Repeat steps 3 and 4 on the second receiver.,
Stretch the string out until it is taut.,
Talk to the person on the other end.",How to Make a Walkie Talkie1," For this simple project, you’ll need:Two tin or aluminum cans, or two papers cups
Five-to-ten meters of string
A hammer
A nail
Two tin or aluminum cans will hold up better than plastic ones. The string is less likely to tear through the bottom of a tin or aluminum can.;
, Make the holes in the cans large enough to feed the string through the holes., Take the entire length of string and thread one end of it into one of the receivers. Make sure you feed the string from the outside of the receiver through the bottom and into the receiver.Each can will be act as a receiver.

, Pull the string through far enough that you can tie a good knot in it without having to reach inside the receiver.If the first knot isn’t large enough to keep the string from falling out of the nail hole, then knot it again.
If you’re using plastic cups instead of cans for your receiver, tie the string to the nail and leave the nail inside the cup. This will help keep the string inside the cup, as the string is more likely to tear a larger hole in the plastic.
Make sure you secure the string in the first side before threading it into the other receiver since it will simply pull away from the first one.

, Now that you have finished your first receiver, you need to thread the other end of the string into the second receiver and secure it.


Again, if you’re using paper cups for receivers, then you may want to get a second nail that you can use to help tie off the string.

, All sound is created by sound waves traveling across a substance. This is the same for voices and even sounds vibrating down stringed instruments, such as violins or guitars. So, you want the string to be stretched tight like a violin string in order for the sound to travel across it effectively.Of course, you don’t want to pull so tight that the string breaks or pulls the string out through the bottom of your receivers. Just pull the string tight enough that you can pluck the string and it will twang.

, Now that you’ve finished the setup for your walkie talkie, use it communicate. Speak into the receiver as the other person listens on the other receiver and send some secret messages.


Do not pull the string connecting the paper cups or aluminum/tin cans too tightly when using the walkie talkies. Too much force could cause the string to pop out of the cups or cans.
If you make the receivers with tin or aluminum cans, be careful when placing your ear or mouth to the cans in case there are jagged edges around the lip of the cans.

Invite friends and family to download the app.,
Push to talk.",How to Make a Walkie Talkie2," Purchasing a smart phone solely to have a walkie talkie may not be the most cost effective, but most people already have a smart phone.


If you don’t have access to a smart phone, you can always use the first method in this article.
Push-to-talk apps are available for most major smart phone operating systems, including iPhone, Android, and Windows phones., Open the application store on your smart phone and search for push-to-talk apps. There several apps available, including:iPTT: this is one of the App Store’s original push-to-talk apps. It provides one-to-many group communication. It also offers one-to-one communication within a group channel, called “whisper”, or straight one-to-one communication. It’s simple to use and free to download for iPhone users.
TiKL Touch Talk Walkie Talkie: this is another simple but great push-to-talk app. All you need is your contact list and a data plan on your phone. TiKL supports group messaging and push-to-talk calls. It’s also free to download for iPhone and Android users.
Voxer: this app functions like a walkie-talkie, but it sends messages rather than real-time dispatches. The app runs on iPhone and Android. It’s also free, and works over any data connection, including Wi-Fi. You can also send text messages, location messages, and photos.
HeyTell: this app is a lot like Voxer, but with more customization. It has three levels of privacy, which allows you to add or block friends from Twitter and Facebook. Like Voxer, it works on any data connection. It’s free and can run on Windows Phone, as well as iPhone and Android.
Zello: this app caters to developers, who want to add push-to-talk functionality to their own apps. But as a regular smart phone user, you can use Zello to turn your phone into a walkie-talkie. Like Voxer, Zello saves messages for replay later. The app is free and works on iPhone, Android, and Blackberry.

, These apps don't use your phone number or plan minutes. So you will need to set up an account to allow other users to find you via the app., One of the sticking points of any push-to-talk app is that anyone you want to contact with it must also have a smart phone and the same push-to-talk app installed.


With the prevalence of smart phones, asking friends and family members to download an app is still easier than buying and sending them a walkie-talkie.
Most of the push-to-talk apps also have group messaging, so you can easily chat with many people at once.

, Once you and your friends or family have the same push-to-talk app, connecting is as easy as selecting the person from your contact list, pressing the ""talk"" button, and delivering your message.


Since push-to-talk app use a very small amount of data on your phone, you can connect through the app without using minutes at all. If you're connected to Wi-Fi when you use the app, then you won't be using any of your plan's data.You can also send messages and photos to any user, across the globe, which sure beats the range of a typical walkie talkie."

Build up your confidence to communicate boldly in English.,
Fake it till you make it.,
Watch Hollywood movies and the news in English.,
Use cards.,
Try to keep a personal note book for writing daily happenings.",How to Develop English Communication Skills," Pay attention to your mistakes and correct them. Speak English with your family and friends whenever you have the chance to do so.
, Plunge in and try it, the sooner you do, the better your English will become. Mistakes are inevitable for every language learner but it is through these that you will learn. Find someone who speaks English well and practice with them.

Use fillers (such as basically, well, certainly, you know, etc.). With the help of these, you can gain yourself time to search internally for the needed vocabulary.

, This is the best way of developing your vocabulary and strengthening your communication skills. In addition, movies have the added advantage of allowing you to develop both vocabulary and accents too. If you don't like to watch movies, just switch to news so that you can learn a more formal style of English.

Try to watch movies with subtitles for 3 to 4 months; doing that can help you to learn vocabulary. After that try to watch without the subtitles; this helps you to learn the accent and develop your listening skills.
If you can't follow the newsreader, just read the headlines at the bottom so that you can learn some new words.

, Get a set of plain white cards. Write a new word on one side and the meaning on the other side. Whenever you are free, start looking at these cards. After a while, just look at the meaning and guess the word (and vice versa).

You can use the cards with your friends to make a word puzzle and perhaps some sorts of games.
Additionally you can use cards in a different way. For an example you can write the lyrics of the songs in card and carry those with you while listening. You can sing along with the song which boost you accent skills.

, If you start writing daily a page. You will know the difference of you vocabulary strength.

If you are a creative thinker, try to write some creative and imaginary stories. Which will develop your vocabulary and content developing skills.

Grab a partner: You can't do a high five by yourself.,
Make sure you have a good posture.,
Smile.,
Wind up.,
Swing forward.,
Make contact.,
Celebrate with your partner by giving a hearty shout.",How to High Five1," This is instead called clapping. To perform a true high five, you'll need someone who's willing to join in your celebration. Ideally, you'll want someone with good upper body strength and strong forearms.


For the best high fives, you'll also want a great cause for celebration. It's difficult to replicate the spontaneous energy of true celebratory joy in a sterile ""practice"" environment, so look for opportunities to vanquish foes or do cool skateboard tricks wherever you go.;
, To put maximum power into your high five, you'll want to have sturdy posture. Plant your feet firmly on the ground about shoulder-width apart, keep your back straight, and roll your shoulders back as you puff up your chest. This strong stance allows you push off the floor, transferring power up through your body and into your wrist for an ear-splitting result.









Bad posture won't just make your high fives weaker - it'll also make you look worse. If you're slumped over with your gut hanging out as you go in for a high five, your friend will be able to tell that your heart isn't in it and will have ample justification for aborting the high five.

, High fives are primarily acts of celebration, but they're also cause for celebration in and of themselves. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be smiling as you high five. Being able to high five is a great honor - never take it for granted with a half-hearted smirk.









The sole exception to this rule is that in the few seconds after your hand makes contact with your partner's, it's acceptable to wince in righteous pain.

, Start to move toward your partner. As you take your first few steps, bring your dominant hand back as if you're about to throw a baseball. Your hand should rest in this ""cocked"" position with its palm open roughly behind your ear.









You may twist slightly at the waist and/or lean back slightly for added power.

, When you're a few feet from your partner, let loose with all your might. Snap your hand forward at maximum velocity, swinging your shoulder, leaning forward, and twisting slightly. If you hear a loud ""crack"" before your hand makes contact with your partner's, don't worry - this is your hand breaking the sound barrier. Aim square for the center of your partner's palm - he or she should do the same.


If you're having trouble hitting your partner's hand, try focusing on his or her elbow as you swing. Seriously, try it - it works wonders.

, With luck, your palm should meet your partner's so that both are roughly vertical. The resulting sound should be a quick, sharp ""smack"" that may reverberate for a moment or two (depending on the acoustics of the room you're in). Revel in the satisfaction of a job well done.









You'll know you've given a great high five if everyone around you immediately turns to stare with an annoyed expression on their face. Ignore these people - they are known as ""haters"" and are expressing their annoyance only as a way of masking certain deep-seated insecurities.

, Congratulations! You have just successfully given your friend the best high five possible. To increase the emotional resonance of your high five, shout out the words ""Yeah!"", ""Yay!"", or ""Whoo!"" with your partner. It's up to you!


Other good choices:

""Hell yeah!""
""Alright!""
""Cool!""
""Radical!""
""Right on!""
""Hip!""

Learn ""The Freeze"".,
Learn ""The Bro Fist"" and its variants.",How to High Five2," Initiate the high five by holding up your hand (palm outward) while facing the other person. Propel your hand forward while saying ""High five!"", ""Gimme five!"", ""Up here!"", or ""Hit me!"". Proceed to high five as above.









Keep your eye on the prize! Focus on your partner's hand or elbow to ensure accuracy and prevent either of you from getting smacked in the face.

, Instead of offering your hand to your partner with your palm facing outward, bring it down near your hip and turn your palm up towards the ceiling. Signal that you're ready by saying ""down low!"" Your partner should then slap your hand with a downward swing of his arm.









If you're feeling devilish, pull your hand out of the way at the last second. You may or may not want to gloat with a rhyming remark like ""too slow!""
If you liked this method and are looking to expand your repertoire, try coupling this move with its cousin, the aptly named ""Up High"".

, The Air five (also known as the ""Wi-five"") is a long distance high five which only requires a line of sight to accomplish. You'll want to follow the classic High five rules without the actual hand contact - in other word, shove your hand, palm facing outward, towards your friend while s/he does the same. Try to make your palms ""meet"" virtually at the same time. For best results, accompany the move with high five sound effects such as ""Whoopish!"" or ""Kapow!"" upon virtual contact.


This high five variant is perfect for the digital age, as it allows two people to high five over video chat from thousands of miles away.

, Perform a classic high five as normal, but, after the initial smack, maintain hand contact for several seconds before releasing. For best results, you'll want to make eye contact with your partner. Try to use your eyes to convey a sense of longing any other host of barely-suppressed emotions simmering just below your calm exterior!









For extra fun, slowly let your fingers weave between your partner's until your hands are clasped in a lover's embrace.

, This technique is not technically a High five, but it's a related gesture that's similar enough to bear mention here. In The Bro Fist, each bro forms a closed fist with one hand, lightly taps his fist to his partner's, making knuckle-to-knuckle contact, and finishes with a hearty grunt or shout. This technique has several of its own variations - just a few are listed below:










The Rocket. Bro 1, after impact, twists his fist and makes a thumbs-up, while Bro 2 mimics the rocket's tail fire by putting his hand under Bro 1's fist and waving his fingers like a trail of fire as he slowly moves his hand toward the floor. Both bros make a whooshing noise to mimic the sound of a rocket.

The Stick Shift. Upon impact, Bro 2 grabs Bro 1's fist with a frontal grip and yells ""stick shift!"" Bro 2 then proceeds to mimic the shifting motion of a manual transmission car using Bro 1's fist as a gearshift while making revving noises.

The Big Bang. Upon Impact, move both fists away from each other slowly as if there was an explosion in the middle. Make low rumbling noises to mimic the sound of an atomic bomb exploding far in the distance.

Stick to business.,
Schedule meetings regularly.,
Use different methods of communication.,
Share the job.,
Encourage questions.,
Ask for input.,
Use universal terminology.",How to Use Effective Communication in Small Organizations,"


You'll probably know most of the people within the small group you need to communicate with, but keep the topics business-related to communicate effectively in small organizations. Meetings and discussions will be more effective if they're focused solely on the important issues related to the business or organization. Save personal discussions for personal time or lunch breaks.;
,


Use effective communication in small businesses by holding regularly scheduled meetings to address business or operational issues. A regular schedule will assure employees that they're being kept updated and informed on all current issues and allow them to view you as a reliable source of information. Meetings that are held at regular times will also cause less disruption to the regular schedule.

,


Communicate effectively in a small organization by varying your methods of communication. Relay information about simple issues or regular updates through email that members can review on their own. Use scheduled meetings to review more in-depth issues that involve all personnel.

,


Make communications more effective by enlisting the help of other members of the organization to communicate with others. Assign topics in each member's area of expertise and ask them to lead a portion of the meeting or write an email to discuss and explain the topic to everyone else. This will keep the methods of communication fresh and new and make every member of the organization feel like their input is valued.

,


Communication will be most effective in a small organization if organization members feel comfortable offering input or asking questions about issues or news that they don't understand. Make time in each meeting to ask if anyone needs any further clarification or explanation and be sure members have your email address to communicate with you one-on-one.

,


Improve communication within a small business by asking members if there are any areas or methods of communication being used that aren't effective or that need improvement. Members should be encouraged to give feedback about how ineffective communication could be improved and how methods of the organization could better communicate with one another.

,


Most members of the small organization will be familiar with terms related to it and its business, but it's important to use simple language when you communicate that everyone can understand. This will help ensure that communication is effective and no one feels embarrassed about asking for an explanation.

Try using both hands.,
Switch fingers.",How to Flip Someone off with Style1," There is a simple straightforwardness to the classic ""flip-off."" Turn the back of your fist toward someone, as though you are shaking a fist at them. Then, extend your middle finger. Hold the pose and look the person in the eye. This is a quick and easy way to get the point across.


Wave your finger around for emphasis. Hold it out firmly and emphatically to make sure that you get the point across.;
, For added effect, whip out the ""double-finger"" flip-off. Flip the person off with both middle fingers at the same to show them that you are unusually angry.


Do ""the X"": cross your middle fingers into an ""X,"" and then hold them against your chest facing the offender.

, For a somewhat more dynamic insult, flash your left and right middle fingers at the person in rapid succession. Alternately, keep both middle fingers extended and wave them around for emphasis.

Then, use your middle finger to scratch your nose while staring pointedly.The person that you are flipping off might not notice this move. However, it might give other onlookers a laugh.

, You might feel a bit better simply by releasing your anger somehow, even if the person in question doesn't actually see you. Consider whether you want to provoke a confrontation, or just get your feelings out.

Do the ""jack-in-the-box"" flip-off.,
Practice ""the balloon."",
Pretend to ""find"" your middle finger.,
Try ""the trumpet."",
Try the ""double extreme.""",How to Flip Someone off with Style3," Hold your fist out in front of you, knuckles facing the offender – but do not raise your middle finger yet. Then, make a fist with the other hand, and crank it in circles next to the first hand as though you are winding up an old-timey jack-in-the-box toy. As you crank, hum ""Pop Goes the Weasel,"" the tune traditionally associated with jack-in-the-boxes. Hum and crank faster and faster as you approach the end of the tune. Then, at the final ""Pop"" of the ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" tune, extend your middle finger as though it is the jack popping out of the box. Finish humming the tune while flipping the person off.


Make sure that you have the person's undivided attention. This move takes a bit of time to pull off, and you want to make sure to get the full effect.

, Hold your fist in front of your face and put the tip of your thumb in your mouth. Act as though you are blowing up a balloon: ""blow"" into your thumb, and slowly extend all of your fingers as though your breath is inflating them. Then, hold you middle finger of the ""balloon hand"" with your other hand, and move the thumb away from your mouth. Slowly close the other fingers on your ""balloon hand"" until only your middle finger is left pointing at the person whom you want to flip off.

, Act as though you are looking for something: in your pocket, or between the couch cushions, or in a desk drawer. Make sure that you get the person's attention. Then, make a show of being relieved that you have found the thing you're looking for. Turn to show the person what you found: and flip them off!

Hold open one hand.,
Point your palm away from your body.,
Raise your hand.,
Make a “V” sign for victory.,
Make the Vulcan peace sign.",How to Do the Peace Sign1," Take the hand you want to make the peace sign with, and hold it in front of you, open palmed, with your palm facing away from your body.


Rake your fingers, excluding your pointer and middle finger, and fold them into your palm like you are making a fist.
Make sure your thumb is over your other fingers. Raise your index and middle fingers. The index finger is the closest finger to your thumb. It doesn’t matter which hand you use. This is how you make the standard peace sign with your hand,
Your extended index and middle fingers should form a “V.”;
, Keep your clenched fingers and palm pointed away from your body. This is very important.


When you keep your palm facing inward toward yourself, the gesture can be perceived as offensive in some cultures, almost a double middle finger.
Make sure you put your pointer finger and your middle finger out at the same time. If you put your middle finger out first it can mean something very bad in English (and in many other languages).
Don't stick out your little finger; this, too, has an alternate, obscene interpretation.

, When done correctly, the peace sign became a counter-cultural symbol of peace in the Vietnam War. Most people raise their hand in the air while making it.


Some people consider the meaning of the symbol to be a call for an end to war, and some people think of it as a general call for peace in the world.
Some politicians have made the sign with both hands while raising both arms (Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower).
This can be a cliche, though, that brings to mind Nixon. Many people just raise one arm when making the sign.

, When some people see the peace sign, they think of it as a “V” sign that means victory, especially in war. The V sign is also made by holding up the two fingers closest to the thumb in a V formation.


It doesn’t matter which hand you use. Allied troops started using this hand sign to indicate victory during World War II.Winston Churchill used the sign to indicate victory. So did Nixon, in the context of Vietnam. Protesters who were against Vietnam then started using the same sign and saying “peace” as they did it instead, to protest the war. They wanted to change the hand gesture to a symbol of peace.
The point is to be aware that the hand signal has both a history in the anti-war movement and in representing victory during war.

, This sign is another hand signal that derived from the television show, Star Trek. Its meaning is “live long and prosper.”To make it, press together the two fingers closest to your thumb at the same time you press together the two fingers farthest away from your thumb.
The middle of your hand will form the “V” shape when you do this with your fingers. You should keep your thumb extended outward as you do so.
Historically, the Vulcan was a pagan deity, a sun god who was linked to powerful energy such as thunderbolts."
"
Draw or sketch a peace symbol.,
Put your pen or pencil directly in the middle.,
Use a compass to make the peace symbol.,
Draw a dove.",How to Do the Peace Sign2," In addition to the hand gesture, there is a “peace symbol” that some people think of when they refer to a peace sign. It’s a drawn image.


To make this symbol, start by drawing a circle. To get a perfect circle, you could draw around a circular object, such as a roll of tape or the bottom of a cup.Draw two lines vertically down the middle of the circle to form a band. Use a ruler to make sure that the each edge of the lines is the same distance away from the center of the circle.
The line should be the same width as the outer circle. This symbol, as used for peace, dates to 1958 when it was drawn by a graduate of the Royal College of Arts in England to protest nuclear war., Start in the middle point of each of the vertical lines.


Draw two slanted lines straight from the middle to the outer circle.Draw another circle within the circle that is the same width to the outside of the circle as the center and sloping lines inside it.
Connect the inner circle’s lines to the bands, rather than drawing through them., A compass can help you get a perfect circle, and you could use a straight edge to get a straight line.


When using a compass, make a dot and then create a circle with the compass. Then lower the diameter of the Compass, and draw a second circle within the first.Take the straight edge. Draw a straight line down the middle of the circle. Then, draw a second straight line down the middle of the circle.
Use the straight edge to draw a sloping line from the middle of the vertical line to each outer edge of the circle. The sloping lines should form an upside down V that fills the bottom half of the circle. Then take an eraser and erase all of the lines inside the shapes you created.

, The white dove is another traditional symbol of peace. If you draw a white dove, most people know this means peace.


To solidify the meaning, draw an olive branch in the dove's beak. As with peace signs, the dove can have different meanings, though.
In Christianity, doves symbolize the Holy Spirit. Doves have also historically represented freedom.Doves are released on wedding days as symbols of purity and to mark the start of a new life.
Historically, the Greeks felt that the olive branch turned away evil spirits. The dove with olive branch is also said to symbolize hope as well as peace.

"
"
Be careful of the peace symbol’s dual meanings.,
Recognize the Christian symbolism.,
Use the peace symbol as an art form.",How to Do the Peace Sign3," The peace sign and symbol have complicated historical meanings that can resonate differently in cultures and religions.


Today, the drawn peace symbol is often recognized as a general symbol of peace or anti-war statement.
In Britain, this symbol is often recognized as representing nuclear disarmament, although elsewhere it’s seen as a general call for peace. However, throughout history, it’s been used for darker purposes.
For example, Hitler’s 3rd Panzer Division used the drawn peace symbol, and it exists on the tombstones of some SS soldiers.

, Some Christians do not like the drawn peace symbol because of its historical meanings.


It was used as an anti-Christian symbol in 711 AD by the Saracens. They used it to send the message that they could break the Christian cross when they used it on their shields.The upside down cross was first used by Christians because Peter the Apostle asked to be crucified with his head hanging down. However, anti-Christian groups then took the upside down cross and used it symbolize the opposite of Christianity.
Some heavy metal groups have used it. And the symbol has been used to indicate Communist support. The Founder of the church of Satan used the symbol on an altar.

, The peace symbol is often used in artwork, tattoos, and on T-shirts and signs. It’s commonly an anti-war symbol when used in this manner.


An artist famously drew the Eiffel tower inside the circle after the Paris terrorist attacks to emulate the peace symbol. The artist called it “Peace for Paris.” It’s also the number “2” in American sign language. In Asia, the sign is popular because of a peace activist ice skater who used it. There were also Japanese television commercials in the 1970s that used the symbol. The peace sign started to appear in Japanese photos even before that, dating to the 1960s when it appeared in the hippie movement.Today, Japanese people commonly flash it in photos.
Those who see religious significance in the peace sign or ""V” sign link it to rejection of authority and the Roman “V” for the number 5. "

Using facial expressions. Many deaf people use exaggerated expressions to get their points across in addition to signing.
Introducing yourself by name and area. Because it can be hard to find other deaf people, introductions are always made with the area you grew up in.
Staring is encouraged. Because eyes are used instead of ears, you should always look at the deaf person you are communicating with., If you're in the U.S., contact your state's agency that oversees deaf services. In Texas, it's the Dept. of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services. The place you live will probably have something similar. Keep in mind other countries will have different requirements.

Work from wherever a call center is located.,
Find out about other jobs in call centers.",How to Find a Career in a Call Center," In a contact center, emails and letters might be handled in addition to calls. Many times, a call center will employ web chat to interact with consumers as well.


A call center agent will wear a headset to keep their hands free to perform other jobs. A headset also protects the neck from injury caused by cradling a phone all day.
Call center agents will generally be placed in a cubicle with their own PC to use in addition to the phone.;
, Good computer skills are a must as details of each call are customarily required to be entered into the system.


A call center agent reports to a supervisor who will give regular performance reviews to help improve your customer service abilities.
Calls are also usually monitored and recorded to guarantee quality, or used for review in the case of a complaint.

, In a call center, the sound of phones ringing is a thing of the past. Modern day call centers use a queuing system to handle all calls fairly. When a customer dials in, their call is placed in the line in the order in which it was received.


If all agents are busy assisting other patrons, the call will be put on hold, typically with hold music. The first available agent will receive the call which has been holding for the longest time period.
There will generally be a screen in the call center that displays the amount of calls holding, and the time period of the longest hold.

, Goals are usually set to establish the maximum period of time a customer should be on time, the length each call should be, and the number of calls a day each agent should realistically be able to handle.


These goals help management plan for the quantity of staff they'll need every day based on average number of callers expected on each given day.

Supervisors and chiefs are needed to guide staff.
Trainers are wanted to train new staff coming in.
Business researchers are required for reporting of call center statistics.

, Ask open-ended questions to keep the conversation running smoothly. Questions like, ""Wow, you're a professor? What does it feel like being on the opposite end of academia?"" will keep the conversation from dying too quickly. People love to talk about themselves. Giving people an ""open mic,"" so to speak, will keep them comfortably conversing.

, It is important to know what you are talking about or what your audience is interested in when trying to present your conversation, so you need to know How it happened, what it is about, and why you explaining this.

Nothing will kill a conversation faster than an inattentive listener.,
Eye Contact.,
Pay Attention to what you are saying.",How to Be a Great Conversationalist2," The second your eyes begin to dart around the room or you eyes begin to glaze over, you have sent a signal to your conversation partner that what they have to say is unimportant and boring. Contrary to popular belief, it is evident when a listener begins to lose interest.

, Maintain eye contact and give your partner physical and verbal cues while listening to them. Nod your head and maintain eye contact. At least look like you're interested to what their opinion is.

, Looking around the room may signal to your partner that you are looking for somebody better to talk to.

Find ways to keep your listener(s) entertained.",How to Be a Great Conversationalist5," In other words, stick to the topic they are discussing until a clear tangent is made into another topic altogether. This can often be difficult to do because certain words or phrases can trigger our mind to think of something else. For example, if a friend is telling you about how “chilly” it was at their brother’s wedding the previous weekend, we may start to think about that “chili” we had two weeks ago and want to start discussing that. Refrain from internal distractions.

Check if your tongue touches your two front teeth.,
Listen for a wet sound when you speak.,
Notice if your tongue touches your palate when you speak.",How to Cope With Having a Lisp1," This is called an interdental lisp. When you have this kind of lisp, you make the “th” sound for “s” and “z” sounds in words when you speak. Interdental lisps often occur in young children and can be corrected if caught early enough., This is called a dentalized lisp. Your teeth will touch your two front teeth when you try to say “s” or “z” sounds in words. This type of lisp is common in young children and often goes away as the child gets older.Doing speech therapy and getting dental treatment can also improve this type of lisp.

, You may also notice air escapes outside the sides of your tongue, making the wet or slushy sound when you try to say words with the “s” or “z” sound. This is called a lateral lisp. A lateral lisp needs to be addressed with speech therapy so it can improve., Your tongue may touch your soft palate, or the roof of your mouth, when you try to say “s” or “z” sounds. This is called a palatal lisp. This type of lisp should be treated with speech therapy.Both lateral and palatal lisps are considered more severe than interdental and dentalized lisps.

While these speech therapy exercises are designed for children, they can be used by adults as well.

, Place an “s” in front of a vowel like “a.” Then, say “s” and “a” separately. This is a broken syllable. Try it again by saying the “s” and the “a” together. This is a blended syllable. Repeat broken and blended syllables 10 to 20 times to help improve your speech.For example, you may say “s” and then “a” or “z” and then “a.” You can then try saying “a” and the “s” or “a” and then “z.”
Try blended syllables by saying “a” “s” “a” in a row, followed by “a” “z” “a” in a row.
You can also say words like ""sax,"" ""pass,"" and ""lease."" Break them up into syllables and say each syllable slowly.

, This technique requires your tongue to imitate the position of a butterfly, where the sides of your tongue tilt upward like butterfly wings. This will allow the sides of your tongue to touch your teeth while air travels down the center of your tongue. Do this by saying “ee” like in “key” or “i” as in “him.”Words like “bin” and “fin” are also good ones to practice the butterfly technique with.
Practice this technique 10 to 20 times. Try to maintain the butterfly shape to your tongue.

, Doing this will force your tongue to pull backward, rather than forward. Drink water and other liquids from a straw between your speech therapy exercises to train your tongue to go back in its proper place.You can also try to drink all liquids through a straw on a regular basis to help train your tongue to pull back and to improve your lisp.

Ask your dentist about a teeth expander.,
Get a fitted tongue appliance for your lisp.,
Consider oral surgery to realign your teeth.",How to Cope With Having a Lisp3," Your dentist may recommend dental treatments like a dental expander on your front teeth to fill in the gap between your teeth. This can help make your lisp less pronounced., This device will prevent you from pushing your tongue between your teeth, thereby reducing your lisp. The device rests on the back third of your tongue to prevent you from pushing it forward too far. The tongue appliance must be fitted to your mouth by an orthodontist.You may need to then get the appliance refitted as you get older so it still fits your mouth correctly. Your orthodontist may suggest that you do speech therapy as well to improve your lisp.

, If your teeth are crooked, this can cause speech issues like a lisp. Your dentist may suggest oral surgery to straighten or realign your teeth. This can then improve your lisp. Talk to your dentist for more details on the procedure."

Use positive affirmations.,
Avoid words that are difficult for you to say.,
Laugh and move on when you struggle with a word.",How to Cope With Having a Lisp4," Boost your self-confidence so you feel less self-conscious about your lisp using daily positive affirmations. Repeat affirmations like “I am brave,” “I am bold,” and “I will not be bothered.” Say the affirmations in the mirror at the beginning of your day or before you go to sleep. You may choose positive affirmations that do not contain “s” or “z” sounds so your lisp does not come out when you say them. This may help you feel more confident.

, If you have to speak in front of others, get in the habit of avoiding words that you struggle with because of your lisp. For example, if you struggle with “s” words like “so” or “simply,” avoid them. Say words that are easier for you to pronounce.If you are writing a speech, avoid words that are hard for you to say aloud. Replace them with easier words or work around them so you do not have to worry about your lisp getting in the way of your presentation.

, Sometimes, you cannot help mispronouncing a word because of your lisp. Rather than feel embarrassed about it, try to laugh it off and move on with the conversation. Make a joke about how you just cannot get that word right and replace it with an easier word or skip the word and move on.Doing this can help to diffuse the situation and make you feel less self-conscious about your lisp. It can also show others that you are still confident despite your lisp and are not deterred by your speech impediment.

One modern approach is to use technology. There are apps that can run on smartphones and tablets that listen to what you say and then give you feedback. For example, on Android there is the free app ""Talking English."" You can also find similar apps in the Apple App Store.;
, Choose some speeches, short stories, or poems from a college English textbook (or any other text you like), and read them aloud. That way, you can concentrate on the sounds and muscle movements involved in each word and not have to worry about coming up with the words yourself.

, Doing so allows you the chance to review your sessions and track your progress. Practicing correct pronunciation, enunciation and diction may sound like a lot of hard work, but all the dedication does pay off. You will feel so proud once you have made significant improvement and you listen back on one of your very first sessions.

, Speaking slowly may be frowned upon by some people, but slow and careful speaking is a very effective way to express yourself when you have a speech disorder.You don't have to speak very slowly; merely speak in a pace that's comfortable for you and your listeners. A steady pace is better than speaking in a fast pace, especially if you want to send the intended meaning of your message across.

, Speech delivery depends on physical body mechanics just as it counts on verbals factors like inflection. If you keep your back bent and hunch your shoulders, you don't allow enough air to exert pressure on your diaphragm or pass through your larynx (voice box). The best public speakers and orators often maintain proper speaking posture, which includes:Stomach in
Chest out
Shoulders relaxed
Back straight
Feet steady

, The proper standing and sitting posture means that you draw your voice not directly from the larynx, but from the diaphragm. You also relieve pressure on your larynx by relaxing your shoulders, which means that you would talk in your natural pitch. If you keep your feet flat and steady, you also give yourself a very stable vertical base to support your body when you talk., Sometimes, impediments in speech, like stuttering, grow from nerves and anxiety.Before you have to speak in front of a group, go through a deep breathing activity to calm your nerves, relax your body, and get you in the right mental state for proper speech.


Sit comfortably and with an erect posture. Breathe in deeply through your nose. You should use your hand to feel your stomach expanding like a balloon being inflated. Hold the breath and then release it slowly, feeling your stomach deflating beneath your hand. Repeat this exercise before you have to speak publicly to relieve stress.

, Another great advantage to proper posture is that you look and feel good whenever you're speaking, whether it's a formal speaking engagement or a chat over lunch. Proper posture boosts your confidence, and tells people that you know what you're talking about.

, This professional will diagnose your specific speech disorder and discover the causes. Then, they will decide which interventions will be most helpful in enabling you to speak correctly. The therapist will determine how much speech therapy you need, and you should regularly attend therapy for the best results. Therapists are capable of improving speech impediments in both children and adults.Speech therapy is helpful for correcting your impediment. The therapist will point out the part of speech where you're having problems, and will work with you to correct it. Private speech therapy sessions do not come cheap, although most insurance policies will fund services needed to treat speech disorders.
There's no substitute for learning and practice when it comes to the proper and effective use of language. Take every opportunity to speak, to practice and brush up on the correct pronunciation and enunciation provided to you by a professional.

, These practitioners can help you overcome your speech impediments if they are caused by emotional distress or learning disabilities. Counseling provided by the professional is very useful if you need to break out of your silence and to talk about your problems, your frustrations, or your own personal tragedy. Such interventions might help you come to terms with anxiety and learn effective ways of coping that still enable you to speak properly., If you have misaligned teeth, you may have difficulty pronouncing some words because of a lisp. Most malocclusions are corrected through braces. Braces pull, push, and adjust individual teeth to correct your bite. The problem with braces is that they often cause a speech impediment, especially when the springs, bands and wires of a set of braces are adjusted every month.Every time the dentist adjusts your braces (or even dentures), you need to train yourself to talk and to eat properly. It may be quite painful at first, but remember not to go too far, lest you end up with a mouth injury.
Most braces are used for orthodontic purposes, although some braces can be used as decorations. Braces are rather expensive, and you may need to take out a dental plan or cash in on dental insurance to pay for them.
Kids and teenagers don't like to wear braces because they're often teased as “metal mouths” or “railroad faces.” The fact is that braces are still the best way to correct a lisp caused by misaligned teeth.

, Features that present at birth or due to physical injuries may result in medical conditions that limit your ability to speak. Many of these physical conditions can be rectified with proper speech and medical treatment.


Cleft lips and palates were a major cause of speech impediments until surgery became affordable. Now, children born with clefts can have reconstructive surgery and a multidisciplinary team of providers that help with feeding and speech and language development.Malocclusion is when the teeth do not have the proper normal bite. Malocclusions are usually corrected through braces, although orthodontic surgery is necessary in some cases. Individuals with this condition may talk with a lisp, make a whistle sound when certain words are spoken, or mumble.Neurological disorders caused by accidents or brain and nerve tumors can cause a speech disorder called dysprosody. Dysprosody involves difficulty in expressing the tonal and emotional qualities of speech such as inflection and emphasis., Dyslexia and other learning disabilities can prevent a person from learning how to speak properly. Children who suffer from learning disabilities often have speech impediments, although they can be overcome through speech therapy., People who suffer from traumatic experiences often develop speech problems like stammering and stuttering. A death in the family, a horrible accident, or a crime can often affect the ability of a person to speak clearly., Some speech impediments are permanent, especially when caused by neurological disorders. On the other hand, a speech impediment may be the result of not having been taught how to speak clearly and communicate effectively. If you or your child are not taught proper speech practices at school or at home as a youth, it could lead to a speech impediment. These conditions, however, can generally be overcome.

, On the other hand, many people with speech impediments encounter these problems because it runs in their families. In fact, research shows that inherited speech and language impairments are more likely to occur the more individuals in the family are affected. In other words, if both parents and one sibling have a speech disorder, the other sibling has a higher chance of having one as well."

This does not happen naturally–– you must prepare sufficiently. Use the internet to surf for ideas, read books, articles, journals or any other published and unpublished sources. It may even be worthwhile consulting some experts on the topic.;
, Whether you prefer to work from sketchy, simple notes or from detailed, full notes is up to you and the situation. A politician may prefer to read from extensive notes in order to be able to refer back when needed; on the other hand, a wedding speech may only require brief and summarized notes.

, All required materials should be put in place in advance of the speech. These may include overhead projectors, laptops, white boards, flip charts, props, etc., depending on the kind of talk to be delivered.

, On the day of the talk, give yourself plenty of time to ensure that you remain calm and to avoid feeling any tension due to rushing. Keep track of time. You must arrive in time and not on time. That will give you ample opportunity to relax and still yourself mentally.

, These may be overhead projectors, slide shows, laptops, etc. Good preparation in this area will prevent last minute or on-the-spot panic situations or embarrassment.

, The speaker's dress code matters. Good dress adds beauty to your talk. Nevertheless, extremes are always dangerous. Do not over dress; remember, this is not a beauty contest!.

, To elaborate: In every audience there are always three personalities; friendly, ambivalent and unfriendly. To deliver the talk successfully, focus on the friendly faces. Also, when giving a talk, you have to be animated. The audience often loses interest if the presenter is too polite, timid or sheepish. Share light moments with the audience to relax both yourself and your listeners. And yes, you have to be alive!

, Why should that be necessary? After all, you're the speaker. Sometimes, however, an audience can become aggressive. If you are bombarded with questions, analyse them before you respond. If necessary, throw them back to the author or the audience as a whole. By doing that, you can buy time to think of what to say. Also, this will discourage the audience from asking contentious questions. Only those who are genuine will persist.


It is also permissible to take questions and offer to follow up with an answer later if it's complicated. Ask the person to give you contact details after the speech.

, It is an undeniable fact that giving a talk can be intimidating. Nonetheless, it is also fun and entertaining if handled well. The steps outlined above will help you prepare for that special talk.

The location can be as plain and simple as your bedroom or a quiet corner of your house.
On the other hand, some people find it more beneficial to chant in a space that is spiritually uplifting. This could include a quiet spot in the park or a small church (or similar place of worship).;
, Remove anything in the space that could draw your attention away from your chants. This includes any visual or auditory distraction.


You can play soft instrumental music in the background or a soundtrack of natural sounds if it helps you focus, but any music that distracts you from the words you chant should be eliminated.
Clocks can be distracting because they draw your attention to the passage of time and away from the words you're chanting.

, Many people find it helpful to chant in front of a picture or similar symbol of the deity they worship. That image can help maintain your focus and elevate your chants to a spiritual level.You can use an iconic picture or an image that represents your deity.
Other options might include small statues, religious medals, and similar three-dimensional tokens.
Note that some faiths prohibit the use of visual images and icons, however. If this is the case or if you are otherwise uncomfortable with this practice, you can skip this step.

, Chant in the morning, before the distractions of the day have set in, or just before bed, when your thoughts are already winding down.


The important thing is to pick a time when there are fewer thoughts buzzing around in your mind. Early morning and late night are usually the best for most people, but if you find it easiest to focus your mind in the middle of the afternoon, that time of day would work just as well.

, Sit in a comfortable chair or lie down on a bed. Reduce the amount of physical suffering you have to endure to prevent your thoughts from straying toward the way your body feels.


Aside from sitting comfortably, you also need to do everything you can to make your overall body feel as relaxed as possible. Change into loose, soft clothes. Empty your bladder. Stretch if your muscles are sore or stiff.

, You can let your hands rest at your sides or in your lap, but if you position your hands in a specific, intentional pose, their placement will serve as a constant reminder of the purpose of your activity.


The most common hand posture associated with chanting and meditation is the mudrā. Touch the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb, and let the rest of your fingers curl gently and naturally. Do this with both hands.
Alternatively, keep both hands straight and lightly press the palms and fingers together, creating standard ""prayer hands.""

, Look straight forward and keep your gaze fixed on a single point. If this proves too distracting, you could try closing your eyes, instead.


If you keep your gaze on a fixed point, choose something simple, like a stationary spot on the wall or the handle of a closet door. Avoid looking at detailed objects or objects that move, especially if those movements are erratic or unpredictable.
If you choose to keep your eyes closed, make sure that you are not tempted to drift off to sleep. If you feel your thoughts wavering and your consciousness fading, you should open your eyes again.

, There are many different things you can chant. The right words will depend on your faith and spirituality. You can use a common prayer or mantra, or you could come up with your own chant that has meaning for you alone.


If you belong to a certain faith, you can chant a common prayer of your faith. For instance, a Christian could chant the Lord's Prayer.
You could also chant a verse from a religious text. For example, a Jew or Christian might chant a psalm.
Any set of meaningful words could be beneficial, though. Paramhansa Yogananda, an Indian yogi, wrote rhythmic chants that are still used by many people. One such chant goes: ""I am the bubble, make me the sea. / So do Thou, my Lord! Thou and I, never apart, / Wave of the sea dissolve in the sea, / I am the bubble, make me the sea.""
Another popular option is to simply chant ""om"". This is a sound that supposedly resonates within each person and vibrates throughout the universe.

, Begin the chant by reciting the words aloud in a clear, strong voice. By both speaking and hearing the words, you awaken your conscious mind to the meaning of those words.


To further guide your conscious mind, you can also play a recording of the chant for a few minutes and chant along with it. Doing so is only optional, though.
Chant at a normal volume or a slightly louder than normal volume when you start. The louder your own voice resonates within you, the easier it will be to drown out all unrelated thoughts and feelings., Gradually decrease the volume of your voice. Soften it to a whisper before closing your mouth altogether and reciting the words only in your mind.


Once your conscious thoughts are focused on the chant, reduce your volume to a whisper. This action brings your chant to a subconscious level.
As you whisper, you should eventually feel the words and rhythm of the chant vibrate throughout your mind. At that point, remain outwardly silent and continue chanting inside your mind. Imagine fixating your chant at a place in between your eyebrows. At this point, you have drawn the chant into your super conscious, elevating it to a spiritual discipline.

, As your volume decreases, the speed at which you recite the lines should gradually increase. After reciting the chant at a rapid speed for a short period of time, gradually decrease the speed back to normal again.


Varying the speed of your chants can refresh and refocus your mind when it begins to stray. By changing the pace of your words, you must pay closer attention to the words themselves.

, When you are reciting a repetitive prayer or mantra, keeping count of the number of recitations can also keep you focused. One of the easiest, most common ways to keep count is to use some form of prayer or chant beads.



Mala, or Japa-Mala, are strings of beads used to count Sanskrit mantras. These beads allow you to count your prayers in sets of 108 repetitions.
A Rosary is a similar set of prayer beads used by Roman Catholics. Each element of the Rosary has a certain fixed prayer assigned to it, however, so you'll need to know which prayers go with each piece.

, The goal is to coordinate your chants with your natural breathing pattern. Each time you begin your chant, you should try to do so on an inhale.


There is a theory that thoughts and stimuli from the external environment enter the internal mind as a person inhales. By focusing on your chant each time you breathe in, you can reduce the effect of these external distractions.

, If you are chanting for spiritual or worship purposes, a good way to remind yourself of the purpose for your chants is to speak an occasional prayer for guidance and focus throughout the chanting period.


The prayer you interject with should be from the heart, rather than one that you have memorized.
You can pray for focus and guidance by saying something like, ""God, please help me to concentrate on the words and meaning behind these words as I chant.""
You could also try a prayer of gratitude, like, ""God, thank you for speaking to me through the practice of chanting.""

, This means that you will need to practice chanting regularly. After chanting regularly for a prolonged period of time, it will become easier to stay focused even in the midst of distraction.


Chanting is a unique form of worship in that it requires no previous sense of inspiration. You do not need to perfect it or feel moved before engaging in it. You only need to commit to starting it.
In this sense, chanting is a devotional practice. Even if the words do not inspire you as you begin to speak them, you are offering a heartfelt prayer through the words and through the discipline you display in reciting them., Auto suggestions are ideas you plant deep within your consciousness to help guide your subconscious thoughts and behaviors.


Your autosuggestion could be something as straightforward as, ""When I think useless thoughts, I will become aware of it and refocus on chanting.""
After chanting for several minutes, repeat your autosuggestion five times in a row. You can either recite it in the middle of your chants or wait until you finish a full period of chanting.

, There is no rule saying that you can only chant when you have perfect peace and quiet. In fact, taking a few minutes in the midst of your busy day to recite a chant can help clarify your mind, heart, and spirit.


It is often easiest to repeat a chant during your daily activities when that chant is one you have already used during a time of focused meditation.

Figure out what you sound like.,
Stop talking through your nose.,
Don't speak from the back of your throat.,
Speak through your ""mask"".,
Project from your diaphragm.,
Change your pitch.",How to Change Your Voice1," If you want to change your voice to make it sound either higher or deeper, start by recording yourself so you'll know what approach to take. Use a recording device to capture the sound of your voice talking quietly, talking loudly, and singing. How would you describe the sound of your voice? What would you like to change?


Does your voice sound nasally or gravelly?
Is it easy or difficult to understand what you're saying?
Is your voice breathy or clear?;
, Many people have a voice that can be described as ""nasally."" A nasally voice tends to sound unnaturally higher than it should, because it doesn't have a chance to resonate properly to produce a deeper tone. This type of voice can sound grating to others as well as being difficult to understand. Make the following changes to eliminate that nasally sound:


Make sure your breathing passages are clear. If you tend to have allergies or your nose is often clogged for other reasons, your voice is going to be stunted and nasally. Clear up your allergies, drink plenty of water and try to keep your sinuses clear.
Practice opening your mouth wider when you speak. Drop your jaw and enunciate your words lower in your mouth, rather than producing them in your soft palate.

, In order to correct a high voice, many people speak from the back of their throat to produce a falsely deep tone. It's hard to get the proper amount of volume when you're straining to speak from the back of your throat, so doing this produces a muffled, difficult-to-interpret voice. In addition, speaking from the back of your throat in an attempt to sound as though your voice is deeper than it really is puts strain on your vocal cords and can cause a sore throat and voice loss over time., In order to make your voice sound deeper and more full, it's necessary to speak through your ""mask,"" which is the area comprised of both your lips and nose. Using your entire mask to speak gives your voice the best chance of sounding a bit lower and richer.


To determine whether you're speaking through your mask, touch your lips and nose as you speak. They should vibrate if you're utilizing the entire area.If they don't vibrate at first, experiment with different sounds until you find a way of speaking that works, then practice speaking that way all the time.

, Breathing deeply and projecting from your diaphragm is key to having a full, rich, strong voice. When you're breathing deeply, your stomach should move in and out with each breath, rather than your chest rising and falling. Practice projecting from your diaphragm by pulling your stomach in to exhale as you speak. You'll notice that your voice rings out loud and clear when you breathe this way. Doing breathing exercises in which you focus on deep breathing will help you remember to project from your diaphragm.Exhale, pushing all the air from your lungs. Once your air runs out, your lungs will automatically begin to inhale deeply in an attempt to satisfy your need for air. Pay close attention to how your lungs feel when you take a deep breath.
Inhale comfortably and hold your breath for 15 seconds before exhaling. Gradually increase the amount of time you hold your breath to 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, and 1 minute. This exercise strengthens your diaphragm.
Laugh heartily, purposefully making a ""ha ha ha"" sound. Expel all the air from your lungs with your laugh, then inhale deeply and quickly.

Lie on your back and place a book or solid object on your diaphragm. Relax as much of your body as possible. Pay close attention to the movement of your diaphragm, noting how the book rises and falls as you breathe. Flatten your stomach as much as possible when you exhale, and repeat until you automatically expand and contract your waist with each breath.
Inhale deeply while standing. Exhale, counting aloud from one to five with a single breath. Repeat the exercise until you are able to comfortably count from 1 to 10 on one exhale.
When you get the hang of speaking this way, you should be able to project so that your voice can be heard by people on the other side of the room without causing you to become hoarse.

, The human voice is capable of producing sound in a range of pitches. Speak in a pitch higher or a pitch lower to temporarily change your voice.


Pitch is altered in large part by the laryngeal cartilage. This is the movable piece of cartilage that rises and falls in your throat as you sing a scale: doh, re, mi, fa, sol, lah, ti, doh.Raising the laryngeal cartilage raises your pitch and creates a more feminine sound. Dropping the laryngeal cartilage drops your pitch and creates a more masculine sound.

Take care of your vocal cords.,
Examine your stress level.,
Practice singing.",How to Change Your Voice2," Your vocal cords, like your skin, need to be protected so they don't age prematurely. If you're hard on your vocal cords, your voice could end up sounding gravelly, whispery, or otherwise unpleasant long before its due. To protect your vocal cords, take the following measures:


Don't smoke. Smoking cigarettes has a very pronounced effect on the voice, causing it to lose volume and range over time. If you want your voice to stay clear and strong, it's best to quit.Cut back on drinking. High alcohol intake can also cause your voice to age prematurely.
Try to breathe clean air. If you live in a polluted area, load your house with plants to clean the air, and try to get away from the city to breathe fresh air as often as possible.
Don't scream too much. If you're a huge fan of hardcore music or you just enjoy screaming sometimes, be aware that using your voice in this way can strain it. Plenty of singers have experienced laryngitis and other vocal maladies from overusing their vocal cords.

, When we experience stress or surprise, the muscles surrounding the larynx contract and cause a high-pitched voice to emerge. If you're constantly nervous, anxious and stressed out, this higher pitch might be your everyday voice. Take measures to calm yourself down so that your steady, full voice is able to emerge.


Try taking a few deep breaths before you speak. In addition to calming you down, this will gear you up to project from your diaphragm, improving the sound of your voice.
Take 10 seconds to think before you react. When you allow yourself time to gather your thoughts before reacting in nervousness or surprise, you have greater control over your voice. Think, take a swallow, then speak - you'll find that your voice comes out more steady and relaxed., Singing alongside instrumental or vocal accompaniment is a good way to increase your pitch range and keep your vocal cords in good shape. Similarly, you could practice singing along to songs that are outside of your usual vocal range. Each time you sing along, match the notes and pitch of the original singer as closely as possible without straining your voice.With piano accompaniment, begin singing a scale: doh, re, mi, fa, sol, lah, ti, doh. Start at the most comfortable, natural pitch possible.

Repeat the scale, increasing your starting pitch by one note each time until your voice begins straining. Once your voice begins to strain, stop.
Repeat the scale again, decreasing your starting pitch by one note each time and stopping once your voice begins to strain.

"
Muffle your voice.,
Mumble.,
Speak in monotone.,
Speak with a different expression.,
Hold your nose as you speak.,
Practice a new accent.Pick an accent that fascinates you and study the way that it varies from your own way of speaking.",How to Change Your Voice3," Place your hand or a handkerchief over your mouth as you speak. The obstacle should be directly against your mouth to produce a more dramatic effect.


Your voice, like any sound, travels through various mediums in the form of sound waves. The way that those waves are transmitted through air differs from the way those waves sound when traveled through a different medium, like a solid. By placing a solid obstacle in front of your mouth as you speak, you force the sound waves through that obstacle, thereby changing the way that others' ears hear and interpret the sound.


, When you speak, do so in a quieter tone and open your mouth less as you pronounce words.


Mumbling changes both word formation and the manner in which your voice carries.
When you mumble, you keep your mouth more closed than usual. Certain sounds are pronounced while the mouth is only slightly opened, and those will not be affected much. On the other hand, sounds that naturally require you to open your mouth significantly more will be greatly altered.
Consider the difference in sound when saying something as simple as “oh.” First, say “oh” while opening your mouth wide open. Then, repeat the “oh” syllable while keeping your lips just barely parted. If you listen carefully, you should notice the difference in sound.
Mumbling also causes you to speak softer. Clear, middle sounds may come through well enough when you speak softly, but softer sounds and end sounds tend to be obscured.
Consider the difference in sound when repeating a simple phrase like “got it.” Repeat the phrase forcefully in your normal tone. You will likely be able to pick up on the ending “t” sounds, even if the “t” at the end of “got” blends into the next word. Then, try repeating the phrase weakly in a quiet tone. The two vowel sounds will likely be audible, but the “t” sounds should have weakened significantly.

, Most people naturally speak with some degree of emotion. Focus on maintaining a flat, consistent tone of voice as you speak. The less emotion you use while speaking, the more different your voice will sound.


The easiest way to notice the difference is by asking a question in monotone. When asking a question, the vast majority of people will end with a higher intonation. The same question can sound much different when spoken in a flat voice, without that final shift in tone.
Alternatively, if people tend to say that you have a flat voice, practice speaking with more enthusiasm or emotion. Think carefully about what you say and change your intonation as you speak accordingly. A good way to practice is with a simple phrase like “Yeah.” When someone says “yeah” in a hurt way, there should be a downward shift in intonation. On the other hand, an enthusiastic “yeah” will have a strong tone with a somewhat high pitch from start to finish.

, Try speaking while smiling or speaking while scowling, regardless of what you actually say.


Expression can affect the emotion with which words are spoken, but expression also changes the formation of your words because your mouth is held in a different position.
For instance, consider how the word “oh” sounds when you smile versus how it sounds when your face remains loose. A loose “oh” is more rounded, while an “oh” spoken through a smile will sound shorter in comparison and may even resemble the “ah” sound.

, A quick way to dramatically alter the sound of your voice is to block your nasal passages, and the easiest way to do this is to grasp your nose on either side and close off the nostrils.


You can also accomplish a similar effect by simply blocking breath from entering your nose through the mouth.
As you speak, airflow naturally travels through both your mouth and nose. Blocking off your nose restricts the amount of air that escapes through your nasal passages and causes more air to be trapped deeper in your throat and mouth. This change in amount and pressure causes your vocal cords to vibrate differently, which changes the way your voice sounds.

, Each accent is a little different, so you will need to thoroughly familiarize yourself with the quirks of each individual accent before you can speak in that accent convincingly.


Non-rhoticity is a common feature of several accents, including the Boston accent and many British accents. Non-rhoticity refers to the practice of dropping the final ""r"" sound from a word. For example, ""later"" would sound like ""lata"" or ""butter"" would sound like ""butta.""

The ""broad A"" is another common feature of many accents, including many British accents, Boston accents, and accents found in English-speaking countries in the Southern Hemisphere, including New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. This practice involves lengthening the short ""a"" sound.

",How to Care for Your Voice," Oxygen is the ultimate source of energy and essential for the proper functioning of your vocal instrument. Take long deep breaths, filling up your lungs from the bottom up as often as possible. After your breathe deeply, apply a little bit of pressure from your diaphragm to project your voice effortlessly. To understand how to use your diaphragm correctly, pretend that you are blowing candles on a birthday cake. The downward motion felt in the abdomen is the diaphragm engaging. Just a little bit of pressure is necessary to support the voice. Let your belly out when inhaling and always push down slightly (not in) while exhaling.;
, The placement and pitch of your voice should sit in the middle of your range. Be mindful of not speaking too low, too high, too nasal or with rasp. To find your natural dynamic voice, answer a few questions positively with “Mmmm”. There you go! That is your natural pitch. Try to speak at that level most of the time.

, Take time to pause often in order to take long deep breaths. Slowing down your speech and carefully enunciating allows your instrument to align itself and relax open its resonance chamber.

, Drink 5 to 6 bottles of water a day to maintain the elasticity of your vocal cords. This is the daily recommended amount. Avoid drying agents such as caffeinated drinks and soda. Gargle water to hydrate and massage your throat instantly!

, Try to pick up on signs of vocal fatigue early and be pro-active. Rasp, the frequent need to clear the throat, change in tone, and soreness are evident signs of irritation. If you notice these, pause and take a moment to realign yourself.

, Do not smoke or use drugs, eat healthy, and exercise regularly. To protect yourself from catching the common cold or flu, wash your hands often and keep them away from your face. Consult your family doctor or an ear, nose and throat specialist if vocal issues continue for more than 3 weeks or other health concerns.

, Try not to speak between lectures or long periods of vocal usage at work, especially when you feel vocal fatigue or you are getting sick. Stay home if you catch a cold or the flu and do not talk!

, Demand silence from your audience before initiating a lecture. Wait for quiet environments for private conversations as opposed to clubs for example.

, Learn to love your voice! Completely let go of the ego and accept that it's OK to make mistakes and that we cannot be perfect all the time.  Proper guidance, solid technique and daily practice should fix any concerns you may have.  Determination and perseverance will take you a long way.  Set realistic goals for yourself, create opportunities and go after what you want in life.  Only you can do it.  You can make it happen!

, Read books, blogs and take vocal lessons with a singing teacher or speech therapist. Make an appointment with an ear, nose and throat Specialist if you have concerns about damage to your vocal cords.

Better yet, read the passage through twice, reading quietly to yourself the second time, if you think you might be called on soon.



Take good notes. You’ll retain information even better once you’ve written it down.
Look up unfamiliar words. If you’re reading out loud and get stuck on a big word you didn’t know before, it can break your flow and mess up your confidence., If you have extra time one day, bring your textbook to the nearest reflective surface and read out loud to yourself. You’ll be able to check your own posture, and even practice looking up to make eye contact with yourself., If you have a study buddy, take turns reading important passages to one another. Take breaks to offer constructive feedback. Does your friend not know what to look for? Check in with these questions:


Was your voice clear enough? Did it sound timid or confident?
Does your body language help you seem more prepared? Are you slouching or standing tall?
Were there any glaring mistakes (like skipped lines or extremely mispronounced words)?

, Reading out loud can be stressful, and you probably want to do a good job. Still, no one expects you to sound like you’re part of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Don’t sweat it if you don’t sound flawless. Just do your best.

Pay attention.,
Stand up and smile.,
Take a deep breath.,
Start reading.,
Maintain eye contact if possible.,
Sit down.",How to Be Confident When Reading Out Loud in Class2," In classes that require reading aloud, be alert. If you get called on several times and don’t notice, you’ll start the reading off flustered, which is not what you want. Stay sharp and be ready.

, You will seem prepared and confident if you react promptly. Smiling will hide a look of surprise, if you’re worried about that. Not only that, but smiling will make you feel just a bit more confident--the movement fools your body into thinking it's happy.Also, you probably want to get this over with as fast as possible, so get started fast., Don’t make a gasping noise. Just make sure you’ve got a nice flow of air coming into your lungs. Stressed-out people tend to breathe more shallowly, but if you do that, your voice will sound choked. If you’re getting scared, try to breathe in for three to five seconds, then exhale smoothly., Check that you’re at the right place in the book, and go for it. As you keep reading, you will probably feel yourself growing in confidence, which is great! Focus on the words, and check in with yourself every so often.


Monitor the volume of your voice. Make sure you can hear yourself speaking, but don’t scream.
Check your speed. Do you tend to talk really fast when you’re nervous, or slow to a drawl? Try to even it out a bit if so.
You can throw in some emotion if you feel ready to do so (and there’s emotion happening in the text).

, You’ll have to look down at the book, of course, but if you feel up for it, looking up at your classmates can make you seem more confident.If you can't handle eye contact, go ahead and focus on the text.


Read to a friend in class who knows you're nervous. They can nod, smile, and give you other clues to assure you that you're doing a good job.

, Once you’re all done, you can sit back down. Try not to flop into your chair or heave a sigh of relief, if you can. Just be proud of yourself for accomplishing something you found scary before! Reading out loud is good practice for all kinds of public speaking, and you just did an amazing job with it.

"
"
Loosen up (literally).,
Think positive.,
Work through mistakes.,
Laugh it off.,
Don't mention it.",How to Be Confident When Reading Out Loud in Class3," If you are scared, your body reacts by tensing. Therefore, it makes sense that manually relaxing your tense muscles will make you feel a little less scared. You can roll your shoulders back quickly, but if that doesn't help, adjust your posture using some of these tips.


Let your arms hang loose at your sides when you stand. If your elbows are stiff for no reason, let them drop naturally so they hang at your sides.
Relax your neck. People who are scared or panicking pull their heads back, so letting your head float to a more natural position will help.
Lift your chin. This will make your voice sound more resonant and you seem more confident., If you feel nervous or fluttery and relaxing your body isn’t helping, try to comfort yourself with encouraging thoughts. Positive self-talk can power you through hard times, so try to concentrate on what you will find most comforting. If you have a mantra that you repeat when you’re stressed, think of that.Otherwise, try these thoughts.


Picture your classmates as friends from preschool. This will make you feel safer and friendly.Remember that no one knows how nervous you are but you.
Remind yourself that if you do a decent job, you may not be called again for some time because the teacher sees how well you do and moves on to other students who need more practice.

, No one is perfect, and sometimes embarrassing things happen, even if you've prepared to read. Remember that no one is flawless, and do your best to fix the problem. In many cases, no one will even notice that you did something wrong.


If you mess up a word, or make another small error, it's okay to go back and correct yourself.If you've made another, more time-consuming mistake (like repeating a whole line), push forward as soon as you notice the problem.
If your body betrays you, and you sneeze or feel your voice crack, try not to make a big deal out of it. Quickly excuse yourself (if you need to) and get back to the material., In the worst case scenario, others might laugh at your mistakes. If you hear laughter and you feel comfortable enough to laugh at yourself, go for it. If not, smile your most patient smile and wait until everyone's done.Keep your face as blank as possible, and your poise will be more memorable than whatever small mistake you made.

, It's a blessing that your reading in class will probably not be the most interesting part of anyone's day, including your own. If you don't want to talk about your performance, that's okay--you don't have to bring it up as a topic of conversation. Just do your best to move on with your day.If anyone brings it up or tries to tease you, and you don't want to talk about it, switch the conversation to something easier. ""I thought that reading would never be over, just like that video series we're watching in Spanish! How many more episodes could there be?""

Show, don't tell.,
Focus on key details.,
Avoid empty descriptive words.,
Get rid of most adverbs.,
Draw on all five senses.,
Make judicious use of similes and metaphors.",How to Be a More Detailed Writer1," Whether you're writing fiction, creative non-fiction, or a closing trial statement, this fundamental piece of writing advice holds true. Don't tell us your character is angry, show us by the tightness in her jaw, or the edge in her voice, or the way her posture stiffens ever so slightly. Don't tell us that the tenement building was run down; describe the broken windows, peeling paint, and pervasive smell of urine. The key is details, details, details.


Take this example of a house from Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. He is describing a traditional mud hut, but he gives us so much more than that: ""It was a bare earth house in the traditional style; brown mud walls, a few glassless windows, with a knee-height wall around the yard. A previous owner, a long time ago, had painted designs on the wall, but neglect and the years had scaled them off and only their ghosts remained."";
, Too many details can ruin the pacing of your story or clutter your argument. The key is not to describe everything, but rather to pick out a few precise details and let the reader fill in the rest.Consider why you are including details. Do they tell you something about a character or your story? Do they contribute in a specific way to the argument you are making?


In this excerpt from The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy draws on one aspect of a church – the heat – which she uses to draw a contrast that reveals the emotional state of a character: ""It was hot in the church, and the white edges of the arum lilies crisped and curled. A bee died in a coffin flower. Ammu's hands shook and her hymnbook with it. Her skin was cold.""

, One way to make sure you are showing and not telling is to seek out empty descriptors in your writing. These are words – usually adjectives – like ""delicious,"" which describe without really telling you anything. So the meal was delicious. How so? Did lightly fried sardines accompanied with a sweet wine smelling of apricots give way to a tartrate of egg and pungent cheese, spiced with cardamom and a dozen other spices she could not identify? Was the bread dense and rich, with a hint of earthiness, as if it had grown directly from the dark soil outside the hut? Some empty descriptors to watch out for include:


Beautiful
Amazing, incredible
Size adjectives (tall, short, big, large, small)
Good or bad
Young, old
Empty language also happens in non-fiction academic writing. For example, a thesis statement that says ""Shakespeare's Hamlet is a good play about the contrast between good and evil"" is shallow and doesn't provide any detail about your claim. In contrast, compare this detailed thesis statement: ""Shakespeare's Hamlet examines the nuances of intention. Hamlet's intent to avenge his father may be noble, but his willingness to annihilate everyone standing in his path to that revenge eventually outweighs any good in his purpose, making him as much a villain as King Claudius.""

, Stephen King believes ""the road to hell is paved with adverbs,"" and he is not alone.Adverbs – words that modify adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs and usually end in -ly – should be used cautiously. Occasionally, they can be helpful, but for the most part, you should search for a more descriptive verb, or add context that makes the adverb unnecessary. For example:Avoid said-modifiers. Instead of ""said softly"", try ""whispered."" Instead of ""said fearfully"", ""whimpered.""
Avoid motion-modifiers. Instead of ""walked slowly,"" try ""sauntered"", ""meandered"", or ""strolled."" Instead of ""walked quickly,"" ""hurried"" or ""scampered"".
Replace adverbs with detailed context: Instead of writing ""she walked softly,"" think about why she's walking that way and how it makes her feel. ""She tip-toed past the guard, each creak of the floorboards sounding to her like thunder.""

, Smell, sound, taste, and touch can make your descriptions more vivid and tangible. They can take you to a place in a way that visual description often cannot. Think of the salty smell of sea air or the hiss of wind over new-fallen snow.


Smell – Patrick Suskind's Perfume: The Story of a Murderer has, appropriately, some particularly vivid descriptions of smell. ""People stank of sweat and unwashed clothes; from their mouths came the stench of rotting teeth, from their bellies that of onions, and from their bodies, if they were no longer very young, came the stench of rancid cheese and sour milk and tumorous disease.""
Taste – Particularly effective with food, taste language can be even more powerful elsewhere: ""A wave engulfed him. He came up and spit the briny water from his mouth.""
Sound – Listen to how Robert Frost describes the sound of a wood at night: ""Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar / Of trees and crack of branches, common things, / But nothing so like beating on a box."" (Robert Frost, ""An Old Man's Winter Night"")
Touch – In ""Once More to the Lake,"" E.B. White vividly evokes the sensation of pulling on wet, cold swimming trunks: ""He pulled his dripping trunks from the line… I watched him, his hard little body, skinny and bare, saw him wince slightly as he pulled up around his vitals the small, soggy, icy garment.""

, A simile is a figure of speech that uses ""like"" or ""as"" to make a comparison between two things: ""his eyes were as big as saucers as he gazed at the cake."" A metaphor makes an implicit comparison without using ""like"" or ""as"": ""his eyes were saucers as he gazed at the cake."" A well chosen metaphor, like Shakespeare's famous ""All the world's a stage,"" can illuminate, while a poor one will only confuse. To get it right, follow these rules:Make your metaphors and similes simple and clear. The more elaborate they become, the more likely they are to confuse rather than to illuminate.
Don't mix them. Pick a comparison and stick with that. Otherwise, you risk writing nonsense like this: ""The president will put the ship of state on its feet.""Only use original ones. Using timeworn comparisons like ""slow as a snail"" won't add anything to your writing. If the comparison isn't vivid and interesting, simply stick with a straightforward description.
Use them to vividly evoke sensations. The most powerful metaphors and similes typically paint a picture or evoke a particular sound, taste, smell, or feeling. The more tangible the better, like ""The water made a sound like kittens lapping"" (The Yearling by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings)

Start with general background research.,
Use the internet to help with background research.,
Begin writing before you've finished your research.,
Use bibliographies and notes to find more sources.,
Make friends with librarians.,
Keep track of your sources.",How to Be a More Detailed Writer2," The beginning point for any piece of writing should be general research into the topic. This will mean different things for different types of writing:


Fiction – Explore in-depth details that are important to the story. This might mean learning more about the job of the main character, or the setting. The goal is to learn enough to start writing. Don't worry about learning every little detail.
Academic non-fiction – Background research means being aware of the literature in the field regarding your topic. You should have read and digested all the works that your own article or book is in dialogue with.
Professional writing – Whether writing a pitch or a pleading, you'll again want to have researched the important details. Know enough to frame the outline of your argument. Then, fill in that frame as you write.

, Wikipedia is a great place to start for general information. But never settle for internet research. Sources online are famously unreliable. Be sure to verify any information you are going to use with at least three independent sources.When doing research, peer-reviewed journal articles in your field are the gold standard. Books from well-respected publishers, especially university presses, and government sources are also places to look. Always try to find the most reputable sources possible.

, Whether writing fiction, non-fiction, or a professional document, you'll end up wasting time if you try to research every little thing before you start writing. This is because it's impossible to know exactly what information you'll need until you start writing. It is much more efficient to learn the basics, establish an outline, and then fill in the details you need as you go.

, If you find an interesting fact in a book, use the citation to find out where it came from. Read that. This is a great way to get to primary sources. That's where you want to be: looking at the actual material so you can provide your own insights or put your own spin on things.

, College and university librarians, in particular, can be a great resource. They can guide you to useful sources that you might not otherwise find. And they are usually happy to help. It's their job., Take careful notes regarding where you found any information that you are considering using. For non-fiction writing, citing your sources is vital to establish the legitimacy of your argument and to avoid accusations of plagiarism. But even when researching for fiction, it is helpful to know where you found things in case you need to look them up again.

Move beyond physical appearance with characters.,
Use voice to create character.,
Keep descriptions of settings and objects short.,
Use real place details judiciously.,
Describe through absence.",How to Be a More Detailed Writer3," It's important to know what characters look like, but how a character thinks, talks or moves can leave an even more powerful impression. Think of Sherlock Holmes. His defining features are that he is ridiculously smart, doesn't like other people, and is a bit of a drug addict. When establishing a character try:Using other character's reactions to convey information, e.g., ""The conversation ceased as Esmeralda entered the room. Every eye fixed on her.""
Use a character's history to convey his or her qualities: ""His appetite was legendary. It was said he had once eaten an entire boar in one sitting."" Or, ""He had once gone a year without uttering anything beyond 'yes, sir', 'no, sir', or 'I should think not, sir.'""
Focus on a character's movement rather than his or her appearance, e.g., ""She moved with the grace of a dancer.""
If you are going to discuss appearance, don't describe everything. Pick a particular defining feature: ""Vic's a square-set, ready-and-steady sort of bloke, the sort of bloke who rubs his hands together at the start of something. His hands are always clean."" (Graham Swift, Last Orders)

, The most powerful characters are often defined by the way they talk or think, like Balram Halwai, the hero of Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger. His voice is smart and humorous and alive: ""Out of respect for the love of liberty shown by the Chinese people, and also in the belief that the future of the world lies with the yellow man and the brown man now that our erstwhile master, the white-skinned man, has wasted himself through buggery, cell phone usage, and drug abuse, I offer to tell you, free of charge, the truth about Bangalore.""

, You don't need to go on and on to create a vivid picture. Doing so will only slow down your story. Instead, focus on a few key details and let the reader fill in the rest.


Few writers do this better than Erik Morgenstern in The Night Circus, a book filled with dizzily clever, yet surprisingly compact descriptions, like this one of a fantastic clock: ""The body of the clock, which has been methodically turning itself inside out and expanding, is now entirely subtle shades of white and grey. And it is not just pieces, it is figures and objects, perfectly carved flowers and planets and tiny books with actual paper pages that turn.""

, For many books – particularly historical fiction – the setting is almost another character. Yet when describing a real place – say 19th century France – you don't want to drown the reader in details. Instead, choose a few to give a sense of place, e.g., the small circles of light thrown by the gas lamps, illuminating sections of paved street; the smell of freshly-baked bread mixing with the stench of the Seine; the chiming of bells from a hundred churches.


Sprinkle in place names to give a sense of place. Instead of ""the river"", ""the Seine."" Instead of a broad square, the ""Place de la Bastille.""
Foreign words can also create a sense of place, if sprinkled judiciously throughout your text. James Clavell's Shogun, set in feudal Japan, does a fantastic job of this. ""Hai"" is used instead of ""yes."" ""Tomodachi"" for ""friend."" ""Domo"" for ""thank you.""

, Sometimes, the key detail is what is not there.A woman might enter a ball in a fabulous dress with a smile on her face, but no joy in her eyes. A forest might feature towering oaks and lush undergrowth, but no birdsong or animal calls, not even the buzzing of insects. Remember that what is not there can sometimes reveal more than what is there.


Erin Morgenstern's The Night Circus, again, provides a great example of description through absence. In introducing the circus, he defines it through what it lacks: color. ""The towering tents are striped in black and white, no golds and crimsons to be seen. No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields… Even what ground is visible from the outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick.""

Comb the text of your speech, circling every verb.,
Analyze all verbs that denote a state of being like ""is,"" ""was"" and ""had."",
Look at the rest of the verbs.,
Go back to your state-of-being verbs that are used with other verbs.,
Practice your speech with the new verbs, keeping in mind that the core of a sentence is the verb.,
Consider acting out your verbs.",How to Use Action Verbs in Public Speaking,";
,


Ignore, for now, the instances when these verbs are used in combination with other verbs to such as ""had begged."" Look for the verbs that are standing on their own, such as in the phrases ""she was angry"" or ""they are happy.""
Reword the sentences to replace these verbs with those that are more vivid. For instance, instead of ""she was angry,"" say ""she glowered."" Instead of ""they are happy,"" say ""they cheer.""

, Ask yourself if you have used the most specific verb possible.


Consult a thesaurus to find alternatives to these verbs.
Rewrite the sentences with verbs that say exactly what you mean. For example, instead of saying ""she expressed her happiness,"" say ""she smiled."" Instead of saying ""he ran,"" say ""he jogged"" or ""he bolted.""

, These combinations are normally used to construct sentences that help the listener know when the action occurred. For instance, if you say ""he had cheated"" after you say ""he failed the test,"" the audience knows that cheating actually occurred before failing.


Consider that many speakers use these verb combinations when they don't need to, which is distracting to the audience. For example, a speaker might say ""I had gone to the courthouse"" when ""I went to the courthouse"" works equally well and is more clear.
Try rewriting these sentences to replace the verb combinations with a single verb. If you find that making the change means that the speech is less clear, change it back.
Pay special attention to sentences in passive voice, since these kill even the best verbs. Passive voice means that there is no one causing the action in the sentence. For instance, ""a man was murdered"" does not tell the listener who committed the murder. Unless it's absolutely necessary to use passive voice in the interest of political correctness, such as admitting to a mistake without blaming your boss for it, change all sentences that are in passive voice.

, Emphasize the verbs and listen to how your speech has become shorter but more powerful.

, Depending on the occasion you're speaking at and the size of your audience, you can do this a little or a lot.


Search out the vowels that are representations of the action they describe. For instance, the word ""zoom"" sounds a lot like what you hear when something zooms past you. Don't just say ""zoomed,"" but draw out the vowel as if imitating the sound of the car speeding past: ""Zooomed!""
Add inflection to verbs that describe emotion. A little bit of a growl in your voice, for instance, will help emphasize a word such as ""angry.""
Keep in mind that although you may be standing behind a lectern, you are nonetheless performing a speech. Be a voice actor.

"
Think of a good idea or subject to make a speech or presentation on.,
Choose your audience.,
Research on your idea or topic.,
Rehearse and prepare several versions of your presentation.,
Always make a paper copy of your slides or handout.,
Find ways to connect with your audience.,
Engage the audience.,
If an audience member asks you a question that you don't know the answer to, don't panic.,
Show your audience how much you admire their intelligence, and how much you respect their opinions.,
Always tell the audience, in the end, that they were a great audience.,
Do not forget to smile.,
Don't speak too quickly.",How to Be a Confident Speaker," If you are just making an informal speech or presentation with no subject restrictions, it would be helpful to choose a topic that you yourself are interested in. This way, it would be less difficult for you to talk about the subject, as opposed to something that you know very little about. Of course, it would also be better if the subject that you choose is engaging enough to a wide variety of people to begin with, so that it wouldn't be very hard to capture their interest.;
, For the first few times that you are practicing being a good speaker, you might want to choose like-minded people who are likely to have the same orientation as you have regarding the subject of your talk. This could be a group of colleagues, acquaintances, members of your community, or other social groups that you deem appropriate. As you gain more experience and confidence, you would be able to gather knowledge and techniques on how to capture and engage even an audience who is just hearing about the subject of your talk for the first time.

, With any talk that you are giving, it is important that you know your subject. The general assumption of your audience is that you, as the subject matter expert, know about the topic more than they do, and that you are there to share knowledge and information that they do not know about yet. There is nothing more embarrassing than a speaker who does not do his homework, and who comes to a talk unprepared and with little knowledge about the topic. Be prepared to answer any questions that might come up relating to your presentation. If you research and prepare adequately, that in itself will already boost your confidence level and lessen any apprehensions that you might have with giving the talk.

, Depending on the reception and response of your audience -- which you will not know until the minute that you start your talk -- you might want to rehearse different versions beforehand to tailor to your audience's needs: one shorter, one more detailed, one for interested people, one for an audience who seem to be losing interest. This will ensure that you keep the audience engaged.

, This is so you can have a hard copy of something to refer to during your talk, and so you can distribute copies to your audience as well, if you wish. Even if you have a beautiful, stylized, and well-rehearsed PowerPoint presentation, you never know what you will find when you get to your speaking place. A very distracted IT guy who cannot get the presentation to display on screen right away, perhaps? It is always important to have a contingency plan in cases like these, so that you are not at their mercy. Encountering these situations and not having a back-up plan will not make you feel confident.

, Keep a pleasant, cheerful disposition all throughout the talk. Maintain eye contact with the audience members. Make simple hand gestures. These actions will also allow you to relax better, since by establishing a connection, you will be able to see your audience as humans -- just like you are -- who want you to do well in your talk, and not as high-and-mighty beings who would take a lot for you to impress.

, Remember they are there because you have already done something right: perhaps, you wrote an intriguing outline of the talk, or you have interesting credentials or a fascinating biography, which has persuaded them enough to come to your talk. Either way, you definitely have something they are interested in since they took the time to come and hear you speak. Engage them by interjecting humor in your talk, and by inserting personal anecdotes. Doing these will keep the talk from being too rigid and formal, and will definitely keep your audience more interested. If you sense that the audience is already losing interest, shorten your talk and go with Q&A for the rest of the time. People are always more engaged when there is more dialogue between the speaker and themselves.

, Take a moment to jot down the question with utmost consideration, ask for the name and contact details (including the e-mail address) of the person who asked, and tell them that you will send them that information no later than two business days. Of course, make sure that you follow-through with your commitment, even if you find the question ""silly"" or ""stupid"".

, No matter how difficult the audience can get, or even if there are some who might not agree with what you are saying, never become irritated with them. Remember that you are the speaker, so you need to maintain authority and keep yourself in check. Remain polite, calm, and courteous at all costs. If you address them properly and in a dignified manner, the difficult people who cause you troubles will end up standing out like a sore thumb in their rudeness, while you will look kind, patient and magnanimous. You will have plenty of time to indulge in those feelings and commiserate with your friends about it as soon as the talk is over, not before.

, Thank them for their time. Each person in the audience likes to think it was him or her who made you say that. It makes their day.

, This is an important thing to remember, no matter how stressed you are during the time of your talk. People are inherently attracted by a smiling face, and will already create wonders for how your talk would go.

, Even if you think you are speaking too slow, most likely, it is the perfect pace to go. If you do stumble with your words or mess up, just laugh it off and don't stress over it to much. You may have made a mistake, but you likely noticed it more than your audience. Remember that mistakes are an integral part of the learning process, and will help hone you to become a better speaker in time.

Lastly, remember that life is not about winning or losing one competition.",How to Win a Public Speaking Competition," This step is primordial if you want to win. Your principles will guide you through and keep you focused. Your originality will make you stand out. Your independent thinking will bring some reason into your speech.;
, Never be tempted to start a competition to get attention, fame or status. This is achieved after proper time to reflect on the reasons why you signed up for the competition in the first place.

, If you are serious about winning, you need to find someone who can coach you. Practicing on your own without feedback is tempting, but a mentor will help you perfect fine details of your delivery and speech content. The mentor may be a tutor or a friend you deem has the ability to coach you.

, This can be done by reading extensively to master the language you speak. This helps you find the right words for your speech. When you are in front of a crowd, you might naturally get self-conscious about the way you look. That is why you should always make sure you have dressed smart and that you are looking good before going up on stage.

, The more the audience can identify themselves with your speech, the more attention you will get. You can easily beat the majority of opponents just by the choice of your speech.

, The best of speeches are often those which are written in just a couple of minutes. However, you should revise and edit your speech, always thinking in terms of how the audience will respond. You should not use the opportunity to solely show off your personal knowledge and interests. Public speaking is about tailoring your information to please the audience. The audience is pleased when they understand what you are talking about.

, When they laugh, they listen more attentively because some sort of fun is sensed in your speech. Yet, do not make abuse of humor as it might undermine seriousness.

, It eliminates stage fright and makes you confident. You can practice in front of a group of friends and tutors. The more you practise, the better. It also allows you to get some feedback. You might then wish to modify certain portions of your speech.

, They will appear confident and deliver good speeches. You might start comparing yourself to them, but that is a mistake. You should forget them completely, and do not try to analyze how well they did.

, You should visualize yourself as being very charismatic and it will translate in the way you behave.

, Look at every single person in the room. People feel secretly flattered when you look at them: they think you intentionally looked at them because they are special in some way. Genuinely try to scan the entire audience with your eyes.

, You should realize that you become the center of attention and people are watching you all the time. You should also not forget to appear physically confident before and after speaking.

, A good public speaker must be able to speak without a microphone. This immediately draws attention and it is a sign of your commitment to passing on your message. Most of your opponents will forget this important aspect and the jury might not even hear their speeches properly.

, Your preparation is what counts.

Use a search website.,
Look for the person's Facebook account.,
Check the person's LinkedIn account.,
Search a phone book.,
Ask the person for their number.",How to Locate a Phone Number1," These sites are fairly easy to use, such as http://www.411.com/ or http://www.anywho.com/whitepages. All you have to do is click in the search box and type in one or more of the following: the name of the person, the address of the business, or the city that person or business is located. The search website will then compile lists of potential candidates and their phone numbers.Scroll through these search items until you see the person you think you are looking for. Do not call or text the number until you have checked the entire list.
Once you have compiled a reasonable list of possible candidate phone numbers (4-5 phone numbers is advised), you can either text or call each number to check them out. When you call or text them, ask nicely whether or not they are the person you were looking for. For example: ""Hello, is this Bob Jones?""
If you find the correct number, remember to place it in your caller index so that you do not forget it.;
, You can either type the person's name into Google and see what it shows, or type their name into the Facebook search bar. If you find a familiar face, click on the account. Underneath the person's name are a number of tabs. Click ""About."" Then click ""Contact and Basic Info"", which will show a phone number, address, other account names, and an email address for that person.If you are not ""Friends"" with this person, this information may not appear to you. You will need to click ""Request Friend"" or ""Send Friend Request"" in order to become ""Friends"" with that person and see this information.

You might be able to communicate with the person over Facebook and ask them for their phone number.
Business phone numbers are also great if you still aren't sure of the person's personal phone number. Call up the business that they work at during open hours and ask the receptionist if they have the phone number of the person you are looking to get into contact with.

, While this method is slightly outdated, it still works just great, especially for home phone numbers. Pick up your regional Yellow Pages book and search by the first letter of the person's last name. If it is a common name, there may be more than one person with the same name. See if you can pinpoint the person you want by address, which is usually located underneath the name in the book.If you still can't differentiate between two or three potential candidates, try all of the numbers. Ask politely when you call to see if it is the correct person.
You can also use a more modern way. Simply visit http://www.yellowpages.com/ to search using the person's name and/or their address.

, This may seem too obvious, but if you aren't in a hurry to find their number, wait until the next time you see the person. Walk up to them and ask them nicely, ""Would you mind if I got your phone number?"" Try to bring it up in conversation or at the end of one; don't just throw them off-guard.You also might want to ask one of their friends or one of your own. See if they have the person's phone number in their phone contact list.
If you have the person's email address, shoot them an email asking them in a similar manner. However, don't bother them with multiple emails over and over again. Stick with one and hope that they respond positively.

When thinking of confronting someone(if you have the opportunity), you should always try to organize your thoughts beforehand.,
Anticipate what your opponent may say to certain comments before you speak them, because they may find gaps in your logic and/or find the opportunity to put you down using words that should not have been spoken.

First of all, if you don't have the number of your crush, this won't work.,
Call.,
When your crush finally answers and most likely says ""Hello,"" you might usually say, ""Hi."",
If they ask why you asked for their number, then say to them, ""Oh, I don't know.,
Whenever you both get silent, ask a question such as, ""So... are you planning to go anywhere for (insert holiday or break here)?"",

At the end of the phone call, if you say got to go, say to them, ""So... want me to call you back tomorrow?""",How to Have a Phone Call With Your Crush," So, to get the number of your crush, the only way to do it right is simply ask. If they're popular, they might be used to it. But the only way to get it is ask, however frightening it might be. So if you can't do that, it's best to abandon this article and go to one titled 'How to Get Your Crush's Number'. See Warnings for more information.;
, The first sentence of this step might be simple, and quite frankly it is simple. If a parent answers, say ""May I Talk to (insert crush's name here)?"" If they ask who you are, the safest answer is ""A friend from school."" If they still persist and ask questions, answer them as honestly and sweetly as possible. DO NOT hang up if they get annoying. This is the off switch for ever contacting a guy or girl.

, but don't leave it at that! If this is your first time calling, or even your second or third, that's a conversation stopper! Say, ""Hey, (crush's name)! It's me, (your name)... remember, you gave me your number at school today."" Usually this will start a conversation, but if it doesn't and he/she just says, ""Oh... hey..."" start a topic on something you know about them. ""So... how did your basketball team do this week?"" or ""So, did you get that homework from Ms. L done? I still can't seem to figure out problem 5."" Although talking about homework is only if the conversation is in real danger.

, I like calling people, I guess."" and then laugh. Then, if they are silent, or just say ""Oh."" then reply, ""So, what's up with you?"" RED LIGHT! If THEY say ""What's up with you?"" do not reply, ""Nothing."" that can stop a conversation. If you really can't think of anything, then say ""Nothing"" but quickly counter with, ""What's up with you?"". But if they say nothing as well, that can lead to a real problem, so stop the problem before you start it and when they say ""What's up?"" say, ""I'm alright, just finished working on 'painting my bedroom' before I called."" that can start a conversation.

, if there is a holiday break coming up. Or, ""Hey, do you have a (facebook, twitter, myspace, etc.) account?"". Only ask this if you want to remain in contact with them AND if you have that same account that you ask them if they have.

, Wait until you guys are comfortable with each other on the phone and talk like friends. If that's the second phone call, fine. If that's the twenty-third phone call, also fine. Take as little or as much time as you need.

, if they say got to go, then ask them, ""So, I'll talk to you tomorrow maybe?"" their replies to these tell you if they want to talk. DON'T CALL if they sound like they'll be busy. And don't call every night. Maybe wait a space of two or three nights between calls unless they specifically tell you to call on a special day. But don't make your calling regular, like, 'Day One, Day Two, Day Three- Call! Day One, Day Two, Day Three- Call!'. Mix and match how much you call a bit.

Acquire a posture of deliberate politeness with guarded intent.,
Be prepared to respond to various scenarios.",How to Develop Good Telephone Skills," It involves much more than a polite voice and good manners. The key here is the same truth applicable in most scenarios in life, education.;
, It would not be suggested that one become a social skeptic and expect that at any moment some mistreat will randomly or deliberately call your number with mischief in mind.

, Therefore what matters is what your mindset is between the time the phone rings and you answer it. With today's technology caller ID is almost universal. It is a vital tool to prepare you to respond appropriately to the caller. Again, we haven't the time here to discuss all the ""what ifs"" a home phone can present. Let's return to the opening scenario. The one being called simply forget to glance at the caller I.D. We use the phone so often, complacency comes quite naturally.

, The receiver is lifted, a polite ""Hello"" is spoken, now it is safe to assume that the voice inquiring, ""Who am I talking to?"" is not so polite. Consider if you will a few of the things we do not know.

, The caller's situation. The caller's ID, by now you've looked at the caller ID on the phone and it provides no ID.

, Now, your reaction. Some might want to become defensive at which point the tenor of the voice will change. Any number of replies immediately come to mind. May I ask that we remember that we know nothing of the caller. Regardless, your reaction should not change.

,


""I'm sorry, who were you trying to reach?"" Expect to be pleasantly surprised to find out anything from a number dialed incorrectly to your oldest sons boss looking for a 30 minute late employee. Remember, continue to be polite but you are still guarded.

, It isn't an incorrectly dialed number, it isn't your oldest son's boss. It is someone intent upon criminal mischief? Do you still remain polite? Yes! However, you have your cell phone and have already dialed emergency services. The dispatcher will likely be intuitive and as you are politely explaining to the caller that you are hanging up now so that you may speak with the police on your cell.

, The agent will need this information to start a case file before transferring you to another department.

,

, There are many things you can do to make your English easier to understand. Here are some tips; more are available in How to Communicate with a Non Native English Speaker:


You may find that it helps to pronounce some words as the non-native speaker does.
Avoid running words together ( Do-ya wanna eat-a-pizza?). One of the biggest challenges for listeners is knowing where one word ends and the next one begins. Give them a small pause between words if they seem to be struggling.
When possible, opt for simple words instead of ones that are complex. The more basic a word is, the better the chance is that it will be understood. (""Big"" is a better choice than ""enormous"" for example. ""Make"" is a better choice than ""manufacture."")
Avoid using filler and colloquialisms ('um...', 'like...','Yeah, totally.')
Avoid using contractions or short forms. Use long forms. “Can’t” is one word you must use the long form with.

, Although it may be frustrating, working slowly will ensure the most effective communication.


You might want to read How to Be Patient.

, Following steps that you only partially understand may cause further issues making the call even longer. Do not proceed with any step until you are sure you understand all the instructions. Do not get frustrated or feel guilty for having an agent repeat and rephrase the instructions until you understand. This applies to working with any agent even when communication is clear. Always be sure before proceeding with any step.

, To gain agreement, allow the agent to explain an entire step, and then repeat it back to them in your own words. If the agent tells you that you're correct, then proceed - if not, try again to gain agreement. Example:



Agent: Can I please have you press the power button on the front of your computer for 30 seconds or until you hear a loud beep.

You: So, to make sure I understand, you would like me to hold the square button on the front of my computer for 30 seconds or until it beeps at me?

Agent: Correct.

, If you or the agent become overly frustrated, then discontinue the call politely (do not simply hang up). Take a small break before calling back.


Be sure to get a case number or incident ID number before disconnecting so steps do not need to be repeated when you call back.

Go to any Internet search engine and perform a search just for the phone number you are researching. For example, if you are researching a phone number located in the United States, enter the number using a format similar to ""555-555-5555.""
Review the search results displayed to determine the origin or location of the phone number. For example, if the phone number you entered is a business, the name of the business may appear numerous times in the search results; especially if the business has submitted their information to various online phone number directories.
If your phone number does not readily appear in search results, try searching for various formats of the phone number to widen your search results. For example, eliminate dashes that separate the area code and prefix in the phone number.

, A reverse lookup tool will prompt you for the telephone number, then provide you information about the place, business, or person the telephone number is registered to.


Visit any Internet search engine and type in keywords such as ""phone number reverse lookup"" to view a list of websites that provide reverse lookup services.
Locate the link or section on the website from which to access the reverse lookup tool. For example, you can visit the Yellow book website provided in the Sources section of this article and click on ""Reverse Lookup"" at the top of the session to begin using the tool.

Play around with your new app.,
Experiment with your app in a safe space.,
Update your app when necessary.",How to Fake a Cell Phone Call1," If you have a smartphone, and you said, “I bet there’s an app for that.” You’re right. There is. Go to the app store for your device and type in, “fake a call.” You will find that some are created to play jokes and others are more serious. Check the functions and reviews to see which one works best for you. Be aware that some free apps may involve ads which could make faking calls in the heat of the moment a little problematic. Consider whether it is worth it to you to spend the money and purchase the app.


iPhones apps allow you to set everything from who is calling to the wallpaper on the screen in order to look entirely convincing.Androids have apps which allow you to initiate fake calls by shaking the phone, tapping the power button several times, or using the proximity sensor.;
, Learn about all of the features your app offers and make sure you understand all of the functions of your new app. If you downloaded a free version and feel that it is not adequate, upgrade and purchase the app. If you are having too much trouble using this one, you can always delete it from your phone and download a different one.

, You want to make sure that you are comfortable using your app before you find yourself in a situation where you need it. Try faking phone calls by yourself, then take it to the next level and attempt to fake a phone call in front of a friend. See if they can tell that the call was not real. If you don’t have the need to fake a call for a while, be sure to revisit the app on occasion for a little practice.

, Periodically, updates will be available for your app. You can check back with your store and see if you have an alert for an update. If you have set your phone to update automatically, this will be done for you. Be sure to review the changes any time updates occur and reeducate yourself with any new processes.

Keep your phone handy.,
Acknowledge a fake alert.,
Silence your phone.,
Greet your fake caller.,
Sound sincere.,
Act natural.,
Make your escape.",How to Fake a Cell Phone Call2," Most of us probably do this anyway, but make sure that your phone is within reach. You never know when you may need to use it for your escape. Always keep it in the same place, so you know exactly where to find it. That could be a particular pocket in your pants or your bag.

, Since your phone is not making any noise, you will want to take the time to pretend you notice it buzz or light up. Take a second to look at the screen as you would normally to see who is calling and decide whether to answer.

, Now that you have your phone in your hand, you will want to silence the ringer and alerts. If your phone rings or sends alerts while you are pretending to talk on it, your cover will be blown. It is helpful if you already have your phone set up with no vibration in silent mode. This can be done in your volume settings.


iPhone has a silencing switch on the top left corner about the volume controls. You will see a small amount of red underneath the button to confirm that it is in silent.Android requires a series of steps from the settings screen to get to “total silence” mode. Swipe from the top of the screen using two fingers, then swipe down again to get to Quick Settings>Do Not Disturb>Total Silence.If you anticipate you may be faking a phone call to make an escape, you may want to set your phone to total silence in advance.

, Answer the phone as you normally would had you seen the name of the caller on caller ID. Picture in your head who it is you are talking to and it will help you find a tone of familiarity. Greet them as you normally would, whether that is a simple, “Hey!” or calling her by name, “Hey Morgan! What’s up?”

, The easiest way to do this is by doing very little. Avoid the urge to fill in the silence by talking too much. You don’t have to create a full dialogue here. Remember, a large part of talking on the phone actually involves no talking. Listen, and feel free to follow it up with quick reactions which also make the call seem important. Sound invested in the call.


Faking a call to get out of a socially awkward situation could be as simple as :

”Really?”
”Oh, no!”


If you are faking a call because you feel you are being followed or are in danger, say things which imply that the caller is in range to help you.

”Oh, I see you!”
”You’re so close!”
”Yeah! I’m almost there.”



, Match your body language to the conversation. If you are pretending that something the caller is saying seems surprising, make sure that is reflected in your face by raising your eyebrows. Acknowledge the person you are trying to avoid with a quick nod or hand gesture to suggest an apology and that you need a minute.

, Pretend to hang up your phone as you normally would. Make an apology to the other person and let them know that you have to leave. Don’t worry about making excuses regarding why you have to go, and don’t take too much time talking about it. It is urgent and you really need to leave, so leave.

Involve friends.,
Set an alarm.,
Record a voicemail for yourself.",How to Fake a Cell Phone Call3," If you are going to meet someone and you think you may need a way out, ask a friend to call you at a specific time. Make sure this friend is someone you can rely on to ensure they actually call. Now you only need to fake the content of the call and not the call itself. You can set up some code words in advance to let them know if you need more help or everything is okay.

, Go to the settings on your phone and set an alarm for an estimated time when you may need a reason to excuse yourself. Choose an alert tone which could sound like a ringer. The alarm will continue to go off until you acknowledge it, just like a ringer would. Turn off the alarm and continue with your fake conversation.

, Use someone else's phone to leave yourself a voicemail, or maybe even have them leave it for you. The recorded message should be only one side of the conversation, so that you can speak to yourself when you use this fake call tactic. To use this option, pick up your phone, go to your voicemail screen and play the recording. The benefit to this plan is that you already know what the conversation is, and can practice it in advance. If the room is quite, the other person will also hear a voice in the phone.

Introduce the survey to each respondent.,
Describe the survey process.,
Persuade respondents to complete the survey.,
Read survey questions word-for-word.,
Familiarize yourself with data entry.,
Enter each response carefully.,
Obtain demographic data from each respondent.,
Thank your respondent.,
Analyze your performance.",How to Conduct a Telephone Survey," At the beginning of each phone call you are expected to introduce yourself and the survey company, describe the topic of the survey and explain the demographics of the survey.


It's helpful to use dynamic language in your introduction. Instead of ""Are you interested in taking a survey?"" you might say something like ""This is a very important survey designed to directly impact the services and programs available to your family.""
Tell each survey respondent how their contact information was obtained. Inform the participant if their phone number was selected at random from a list or if it was obtained from a professional agency.;
, Reveal the purpose of the research and survey and provide an estimate of the time needed to complete the survey. Giving the respondent a clear picture of what the survey entails shows that you’re being forthright and makes them more likely to proceed with the survey.


Promise confidentiality and anonymity to the respondent when it is appropriate. Let the respondent know that participation in the survey is voluntary.
Inform the respondents that it is permissible to skip a particular question if they prefer not to answer it.
Provide the lead investigator's name if the respondent asks for it.

, Your employer should provide specialized training to teach you how to convert survey refusals into completed surveys. Some of these methods include stressing the importance of your research, assuring the respondent that the survey won’t be burdensome, and (if the survey is short) letting the respondent know you won’t take up too much of their time.Attempt to change a refusal to a completed survey at least twice. If you are unable to do so, request permission to call back at a more convenient time.

, When conducting the survey, stick to the script. Chances are, whoever wrote the questionnaire thought long and hard about the types of questions they wanted to ask. By reading each question verbatim, you’ll elicit the exact responses your employer is looking for and reduce the possibility of skewing survey responses.

, Depending on the survey, you may need to become familiar with the program or software your employer has chosen for entering data. Programs like Microsoft Excel, among others, are popular choices. Spend some time navigating the software so you’ll be aware of its limitations and unique features. This will prepare you to enter data efficiently and reduce the risk of mistakes., With computer-assisted telephone interviewing, you are given specific questions to ask the respondent. When he or she gives you a response, you enter that response into the computer, where it is immediately entered into the database. Make sure you enter each response just as you heard it to ensure accurate data analysis and interpretation.


You may find it helpful to pace the interview by alternating between simple questions and those that require lengthier responses. If you have an involved question, follow it up with a yes or no question to allow yourself enough time to record the answers accurately.
Some data entry programs will check your entries for errors, but it’s always a good idea to spot check your work.

, This is often the last step in a telephone survey. While it is often optional, it’s typically very useful because it allows the data to be coded more accurately. Demographic data includes gender, age, political affiliation, religious affiliation, gender identity and ethnicity.

, It’s very important to thank your participant for their time and effort. Aside from common courtesy, thanking your participant is key to the overall success of the survey. Many phone surveys are recorded for quality purposes, so it’s important to follow all the steps and conclude the survey properly.


You might ask your respondent something like, ""Do you have any suggestions for how I might improve this survey?"" This lets the respondent know that you value their opinion. Be sure to let them know you're grateful for their feedback.

, After you’ve ended the call, take stock of how the survey went and what you could do to improve. Check the time to see if you stuck to your schedule and communicated the questions efficiently.


Conduct a mini survey of yourself by asking questions about your performance and responding as honestly as possible. This will help you improve as an interviewer while you practice for your next survey.

Understand how debates work.,
Research the topic very thoroughly with credible information.,
Write an outline of your speech.,
Write an introduction that is catchy and interesting.,
Outline where you stand very clearly.,
Make key points to back up your stance.,
Develop your key points.,
Understand the art of persuasion.,
Write a strong conclusion.,
Work on your delivery from beginning to end.",How to Write a Debate Speech," You will be given a debate topic – this is called a “resolution."" Your team must take a stance either affirmative or negative to the resolution. Sometimes you will be given the stance, and sometimes you will be asked to take a position.


You may be asked to be the first speaker pro the resolution or the first con speaker. Often such speeches are about four minutes long each.The speakers then present arguments against the earlier pro or con speech that was just read. Speakers must listen carefully and be able to counter arguments. There are often segments involving crossfire, in which the debaters are allowed to ask questions and openly debate the topic.
Sometimes there is a second pro and second con speech to summarize the points made and end the debate round.

, Because you will be asked to counter the arguments of the other side, in addition to giving a speech of your own, you must spend time thoroughly understanding all aspects of the resolution.


Brainstorm the topic, and research it before you sit down to write. Write out a pro and con list. If you are on a debate team, do this together. Each member could discuss the pro and con lists, and then strike the weaker reasons until you are left with three or four reasons that seem strongest in support or opposition.
Spend some time at the library or on the Internet using credible sources to research the key reasons that seem strongest. Use books, scholarly journals, credible newspapers, and the like. Be very cautious about unverified information bandied about on the Internet.
You will also want to deal with the strongest arguments on the other side in your speech. Ignoring the other side’s best arguments can weaken your rhetorical appeal.

, If you create a basic outline of the speech, your writing organization will probably be better when you actually sit down to write the speech in full. It’s a good idea to memorize the ultimate speech or just rely on the outline as notes when giving it.A basic debate outline should contain four parts: An introduction, your thesis argument, your key points to back your stance up, and a conclusion. Be prepared to define any key words for the judges.
You can break each of those four part into subcategories. It’s often a good idea to write the introduction and conclusion last, focusing on the thesis argument and the evidence to back it up first., You want to introduce your topic very clearly and concisely right at the beginning of the debate speech. However, you should open with a colorful flourish that foreshadows the topic.


You should address the jury or audience with formal salutations. For example, you could say something like, “Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.” Debates are very formal in tone.
Making a good first impression with the judges is very important. This leads judges to assume the debater is persuasive. One technique to write a strong introduction is to contextualize the topic, especially in relation to real world events.Introductions can also focus on prominent examples, quotations, or on a personal anecdote that can help establish a rapport with the audience and judges. Be careful using humor; it involves risks and can lead to awkward silences if not done right. Find a relevant specific that illustrates the underlying point.

, The audience and judges should not have to puzzle over where you stand on the topic. Are you affirmative or negative to the resolution? Say - clearly and concisely and firmly. Up high.


Don’t muddle your position. It needs to be extremely clear whether you affirm or negate the resolution, so don’t hem and haw and contradict yourself. The audience also should not have to wait until the end to find out. Make your stance very clear, and do it early on
For example, you could say, “my partner and I firmly negate (or affirm) the resolution which states that unilateral military force by the United States is justified to prevent nuclear proliferation.”, You want to highlight your key points very strongly early on in the speech. You could provide rapid-fire examples, basically piling up the evidence to support your stance. A good rule of thumb is to back up your position with 3-4 strong points of supporting argumentation. You definitely need to have more than 1 or 2 key points to back up the stance you have taken.
The body of the speech – the key points and their development – should be, by far, the longest part of the debate speech (perhaps 3 ½ minutes to 30 seconds for an opening and for a conclusion, depending on the rules of the debate you are doing).

, You want to back up the key arguments you are using to justify your position. Back every single one of your key points up with examples, statistics and other pieces of evidence. Flesh them out.


Focus on the causes of the problem, the effects of the problem, expert opinion, examples, statistics, and present a solution. Try to use visual images, not just generic terms – show don’t tell, and illustrate a point with details.Appeal to the motives and emotions of the listener with a light touch. Appeal to their sense of fair play, desire to save, to be helpful, to care about community, etc. Ground examples in how people are affected.
Try using rhetorical questions, which make your opponents consider the validity of their point; irony, which undermines their point and makes you seem more mature and intelligent; simile, which gives them something to relate to; humor, which gets the audience on your side when done well; and repetition, which reinforces your point.

, Ancient philosophers studied the art of persuasion, and understanding their techniques will help your debate speech.


Aristotle believed that speakers were more persuasive if they combined elements of logos (persuasion by reasoning) with pathos (having an element of emotional appeal) and ethos (an appeal based on the character of the speaker) - for example, that they seem intelligent or of good will.
There are two ways to use logic – inductive (which makes the case with measurable evidence like statistics or a specific anecdote or example) and deductive (which makes the case by outlining a general principle that is related to the specific topic to infer a conclusion from it - as in, I oppose all wars except those involving imminent self defense; thus, I must oppose this one because it's a war that was not in imminent self defense, and here's why). Or the reverse.
You should use pathos sparingly. Emotional appeal on its own can be dangerous. Logos - the appeal to reason - should be at the core. However, logical appeal without any pathos at all can render a speech dry and dull. Consider what you are trying to make your audience feel. Explaining how a topic affects real people is one way to use pathos well.

, At the end, you should reiterate your overall stance on the topic to reinforce your position. It’s a good idea to conclude with your intention to do something and with a strong appeal for action as well.


One strong way to conclude a debate speech is to bookend the conclusion with the opening, by referring back to the introduction and tying the conclusion into the same theme.
Quotations can be a good way to end a speech. You can also end with a brief summation of the key arguments of the speech to ensure they remain fresh in judges’ minds.

, An advanced speaker carefully hones his or her delivery. The speaker understands the power of carefully timed rhetorical pauses and pays careful attention to the desired tone (firm, moderate, etc.) You don’t want to read a debate speech verbatim. Although you want to memorize the speech, and may use notes or your outline when giving it, it needs to sound natural and not too rehearsed. The key to giving a good debate speech is research. You will need to think on your feet to counter opposing arguments.
Use a clear, loud voice, and be careful to watch pacing. You don’t want to speak too loud or too slowly. Remember that confidence goes a long way toward persuasion.

Realize that you’re probably not going to “win.” You will come away with a better idea of the other person’s thoughts and ideologies, but it’s doubtful you will change their mind.,
Recognize (and perhaps discuss) your different moral frameworks.",How to Debate a Conservative As a Liberal," Even though you don’t agree with the person you’re debating, keep the discussion on a friendly level. Ask the other person about how they came to have the views they do. Discuss where they get their information from, and why they chose that particular media outlet., Though you might feel strongly about conservative politicians and how much you dislike them, don’t let your emotions get in the way. This doesn’t help your position in the debate.

, You might feel that the person you’re debating is flat-out wrong, but don’t insult them. It might be hard for you to imagine how another person could have such different views from your own and be an intelligent and engaged individual, but they have reasons for their views., If you’re going to be engaging in political debate, it’s important to know what is going on the world. Read and watch news from different sources -- they will often present issues in very different ways. Decide what you think about current issues and events, and think about what arguments have been the most convincing to you.

, Some issues are more personal than others. These topics are more likely than others to devolve into personal attacks, after which the debate will unravel. Because of the constant presence of these issues in the news and in public discourse, most people also know the pros and cons, leaving little room for a good debate with someone who disagrees with you. You are probably not going to tell them anything they haven’t already heard.


Abortion, for example, is not an issue that many people change their minds on -- people tend to know how they feel, often for emotional reasons.
Gun control is another issue often surrounded by emotion that tends to change little and fall along partisan lines., If you want people to listen to you, you need to listen to them as well. Ask them questions about their ideas about the issues, and if those ideas have changed at all. Sometimes understanding why someone else has the views they do makes it a lot easier to understand their position on different political issues.

, This can be a tough area for conservatives to win, because scientific evidence does not support many of their assertions. Be ready to be specific about the science.Lay out the overwhelming scientific evidence for climate change.
Discuss the variety of world leaders and organizations (Pope Francis, the UN, the EU, etc.) who have cautioned against our current pattern of consumption.
Ask how conservatives are going to deal with the increasing number of environmental disasters, rising pollution levels, and unsustainable carbon footprint of people in developed nations.

, Economists are increasingly concerned that the increasing gap between the rich and the poor will make the United States less competitive and more likely to lose the leadership role it has enjoyed in the world. Few conservatives have substantive ideas to address this issue at all.Tell your opponent about the well-documented stagnant wages in the face of rising costs of living.
Discuss the pay of CEOs rising to levels hundreds of times above that of employees of the same corporation. And they typically receive huge bonuses as well!
Show them the charts from the article below demonstrating the rampant inequality -- the top 1% make over $1 million per year, while the average for those in the bottom 90% is $30,000.

, Discuss the overwhelming legal decisions in favor. Point out that discrimination against gays and lesbians is illegal. Most of the conservative arguments on this issue are either based on religious values (and we have separation of church and state, right?) or on faulty logic.Lay out the logical problems with the conservative argument of the ""slippery slope"" that gay marriage equality will somehow lead to people being able to marry their pets.
Argue for the importance of equal rights for all people.

, Many states are trying to make it more difficult to vote, primarily through the kinds of identification they will accept. Lay out the claims conservatives make about fraud and debunk them.Reveal that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud anywhere in the United States.
Discuss how trying to curtail voting rights has become a way to disenfranchise poor and minority populations, who overwhelmingly do not support conservative candidates.

, Do you both feel the same way about the influence of money on politics? Or the need for educational reform? See if you can discover the ways that your political views might overlap. You also might see problems in the same places, but have different ways of solving them.

, Recent studies have shown that it’s very difficult to change anyone’s mind in a political debate. People inherently don’t want to question their beliefs -- they have them for a reason, and if they question them, what else might not be as it seems? For the most part, the best you can do is try to open the other person’s mind to another way of thinking about the issues., A group of social scientists have developed the Moral Foundations Theory to help explain why liberals and conservatives have such different approaches to the issues. Depending on where you are on the political spectrum, you are probably using different criteria to judge the situation. It might be useful to discuss these frameworks with your debate partner. You might be surprised at how he or she feels about the different elements -- it’s probably quite different from you. You can find more specific information about these frameworks in the citation below.Liberals tend to focus on debates around the first two, while conservatives use the last three to frame debates and ideology.“Care vs. Harm” -- are you taking care of yourself and others, or causing harm?
“Fairness vs. Cheating” -- this includes justice, rights and proportionality. Is everyone being treated the same?
“Loyalty vs. Betrayal” -- this one is most aligned with ideas of patriotism and self-sacrifice for a group to which you belong (like the nation).
“Authority vs. Subversion” -- relies on the importance of hierarchy and tradition as well as following legitimate leaders.
“Sanctity vs. Degradation.” -- often tied in strongly with religious belief, particularly around what should and should not be done with people’s bodies.

Be confident.",How to Rebut Better1," If the debate is prepared, you should be reading and rereading your teammates' speeches and improving them as a team. Brainstorm as much as you can. If the debate is in the short preparation format (that is, you have an hour or so between receiving the topic and speaking), make sure you are actively involved in the 10 minutes or so when you're coming up with your arguments, and focus on what your teammates are saying when they speak, not just what your opponents are saying.;
, If you can see an opportunity where your opponent will attempt to rebut, they will see it too. For example, if you are advocating Car A over Car B, and you say Car A is more expensive, make sure you add a disclaimer, such as ""Even though Car A costs more, the superior quality is well worth the cost"". This way, your opponents may not even try to rebut that point at all, and if they do, you've set the basis for an easy rebuttal.

, Sometimes it can be useful to pretend you have been allocated to the other side of the debate, and try to get into the opponents' minds. Does Car B have better safety features? A lower cost? Write down as many of these rebuttals as possible, and how you plan to counter them. If you can walk into a debate with a few semi-prepared rebuttals, it makes your job so much easier.

, The first speaker of the opposing team will outline the arguments their entire team will make. Write these down quickly, then pay keen attention to the rest of their speech. You must take in as much information from them as is possible.

, Do they contradict themselves? Are they cherry-picking arguments? Can you counter a hypothesis of theirs with facts? An opponent's argument is NEVER airtight. If needed, write down a note to yourself if you're not sure about a possible rebut, then have a quiet team huddle about it just after they have finished their speech. Write down anything and everything that you could use.

, A useful format is to write which speaker you're rebutting (1, 2, 3 or 'all' if it applies), a paraphrased form of what they said, and a dot point that you will use to rebut. Order your palm cards by speaker, and then by importance.

, When you rebut, you shouldn't be talking to an audience or the adjudicator. Rather, you should be having a conversation with an argumentative friend, or better yet, a teacher. Be polite, and be formal, but above all, relax. This will make it a lot easier to...

, Once you've exhausted whatever is written on your palm card, you treat the rebuttal as you would an ordinary conversation. When you talk to your friends, you don't think about what you're saying beforehand, do you? It just comes out. Try to position your mind so that you are having a conversation, and it will become much easier to give impromptu rebuttals. You'll get better at this over time.

, In a debate, nothing is worse than a person who clearly thinks the other team is smarter, better or winning. You're winning, and you just proved it with your rebuttal. Be proud of what you have achieved.

Open ended research usually entails shifting your reading and viewing habits to include sources that are educational or current event based.Conduct focused research on your topic. List the areas you feel you have strong background knowledge and any gaps in your knowledge on the topic. Try to fill in these gaps while coordinating your research with other teammates, so there is little to no overlap in your research efforts and you make the best use of your time., How you present yourself to your audience is often considered to be part of your delivery and will likely affect your scoring.Depending on the level of your competition and the expectations of those involved, the right outfit for your situation may vary.You will want to come across from the very beginning as being respectful of your audience and a respectable person, both of which can be achieved by wearing more formal clothing.


Ask your teacher or coach what the best clothing for your level of competition might be if you are unsure.
Lower level or less serious competitions might only require a dress shirt or polo with a pair of khaki pants.
High level competitions, championships for example, will probably be best attended in a suit and tie.Don't overdress; although a tuxedo will set you apart, it might seem to others like you are showing off.

, Once you have decided on your argument and the material you will use in it, you will need to write the speech you will use during the debate. Depending on the kind of debate and the rules your debate chapter, these can differ significantly, though every debate should have:An unbiased introduction that presents basic information and the topic.
A body that includes an emotional point, a logical point, and an ethical point in favor of your side of the debate. You should also have examples, quotations, and statistics to strengthen your case.
A conclusion that summarizes the important points made by you and/or members of your team., This is an important part of debate preparation.Rehearsal will help you feel more comfortable with your material, will make you more aware of your voice and body, and will help you identify problem areas.Record yourself if you are able. This way you can check your posture, gestures, and speaking volume.
Try rehearsing in front of mirror. Note how you use your hands, how your words sync with your expressions, and the naturalness of your body language.

, Additionally, memorization will put information vital to your argument/counterargument at your disposal. Demonstrating your quick wit can earn you points with your judges and put you ahead of your opponents.

, While constructing your argument, you should take weak points into consideration, as these will likely be used by your opposition. Beyond that, what are the best arguments you can think to use for the opposing argument? Keep this in mind, and think of specific ways you can question or undermine the validity of these arguments.

, Your level and the rules of your debate league might disallow the use of index cards during your debate, but these can still help you with memorization and organization.In the event that flashcards are allowed, these can help you keep your argument and rebuttals well organized and accurate.


Organize your flashcards so that the most important information is offset from other details by using underlines, highlighting, or other marks.
Include a bare-bones outline of your talking points so that if you are interrupted or lose your place, you can get back on topic easily.
Study with your flashcards regularly. Choose intervals throughout the day to study, like after waking up, during lunch, and before going to bed. Repetition will help reinforce your memorization., This can be especially difficult if you are a nervous person, but tension can result in even laid back debaters having a poor night's sleep. Sleep deprivation can hurt your response time, recall, and mental sharpness, which may translate into penalties in your score.To prevent nerves from harming your sleep, you might:


Exercise the day before a debate.
Take a natural sleep supplement, like chamomile tea or melatonin, to help falling asleep., Most veteran speakers will prepare for a debate by eating moderate meals. Most eat enough to keep hunger at bay during the debate, but avoid eating anything heavy that might cause drowsiness or lethargy.You might also want to avoid consuming dairy, as doing so can create mucous that might hurt your speaking voice, and caffeinated beverages, which can cause an over-active bladder.

, You will need to assess the environment in which the debate is held before you can know which speaking volume will be most effective.If there is a mic you are expected to use, you should check its volume before beginning your speech. Smaller rooms can benefit from a warm, conversational tone, while large presentation halls may require a louder than normal speaking voice.

, You will also be judged on how you integrate your body language with your speech.Identify emotional shifts in your speech and match these with the appropriate posture and gestures. Three key aspects of your appearance are:



Posture: avoid slouching or lazy posture, as these can be interpreted negatively. A straight-back, feet shoulder width apart, attentive but at ease stance will make it easy for you to transition to other gestures/postures throughout your speech.Gesture: make sure there is enough variety in your gestures; repetitive motions can hurt your score. Keep your gestures above the waist so that each can be easily seen.Eye contact: it is generally expected that you will have to consult notes for specific figures and certain points, but maintaining strong and consistent eye contact is expected throughout your debate. You should practice speaking and scanning your notes before your debate., For you to properly refute inaccurate information, rebut a point, or address a counterargument, you will need to address specific points in your opposition's case. Check the other team's statistics against your own and jot down any information that seems false, incomplete, or mis-portrayed., Framing can drastically change the way information is interpreted by an audience, and if you have the last word, framing can be an effective tool to change a negative opinion to a positive one.You may want to re-frame the obvious counterexamples that the opposition is likely to use, so that you have a strong refutation partially prepared.


The point, ""School uniforms restrict students' individuality,"" might be re-framed, ""School uniforms prevent individuality from negatively impacting the learning of all students.""

, For your proposition to be accepted, you will need to convince the jury that your plan (motion) is the way to go. This will require you to defend it against the opposition while making points in favor of your proposition., Classically, debate has objectives that are considered strong proof of a superior argument. Though these can take many different forms, there are three customary ways to win a debate as the opposition:


Prove that the problem solved by the motion does not exist.
Prove that the motion proposed does not solve the problem.
Prove that the motion is not the appropriate way to solve the problem and/or that the plan proposed brings more negative consequences than benefits., This is especially useful if you are the third speaker, as it can shift attention away from other, more important points you have raised. This can also return attention to the main thrust of your argument. However, you should not make any new arguments at this point, as this is oftentimes judged negatively.Though you are still allowed to attack or defend any argument from a new perspective.

, Identify and take note of the key arguments of the other team. Unraveling these will earn you points in refutation and put the other team on the defensive. You will need to refute the arguments of the other side while rebuilding any of your own points.An effective way of doing this during the debate is to ask the following questions:


Is the methodology of the other side flawed in some way?Does the opposition make any claims that have factual, moral, or logical errors?Does the opposition make an assumptions or logical fallacies?

, POIs can only be made during unprotected time which is usually defined as the time after the first and before the third minute of a speech.A POI must be in question form, but aside from that it can be used for many different purposes.


Some uses of POIs: clarification, disruption of someone’s speech, pointing out weaknesses, or to get an answer useful for your own argument.
An example of using a POI for your argument might go something like: ""After the second speaker of the proposition side accepted my POI, she admitted that...""
In most competitive debate, POIs are limited to 15 seconds., To offer a POI, you should stand up holding one hand atop your head with the other in the air.As a speaker, you can either deny or accept a point of information. During a speech of 4 minutes, it is considered good form to accept at least two POIs, but at minimum you should try to address at least one.Accept POIs by saying, ""Yes,"" or ""I'll take your point.""
Decline POIs by saying, ""No thank you,"" or gently waving your hand downward to indicate an opponent should sit., You and your team should pay attention to the POIs brought up by your opponents. These can provide an early warning for the direction of the opposing team's arguments and rebuttals, as pointed questions in the form of POIs can reveal the oppositions depth of knowledge or lack thereof.Use this foreknowledge to prepare your defense.


If one of the opposing team’s POIs references a specific study or authority, then you may want to consider what you know about that source. As you consider the source, think about how you can refute other points that your opposition might draw from that source.

, Due to the 15 second time constraint of POIs, and the speaker's ability to cut the POI short, your POI should be motivated by a key principle or argument.The very first line of your POI should include your main point to prevent being cut off. Be sure you are prepared to move back into your speech after finishing your POI.

Logic.,
Analogy.,
Historical Evidence.,
Remember why you are here.",How to Rebut Better2," Logic is just reasoning. For example, if Car A was more expensive than Car B, you could argue, ""Car B is better than Car A because it is cheaper and it is only logical that a family with a limited budget would purchase Car B instead of Car A.

, Analogy is a comparison. For example, if Car A was more high quality than Car B, you could argue, ""Car A is better than Car B simply because it is of better quality. You could compare this situation to somebody shopping for fruits. Car A is like the perfect, red apple at the top of the pile of apples and Car B is like the rotting fruit that's been sitting at the bottom of the pile for weeks. Any reasonable shopper would purchase the fresh, perfect apple instead of the rotting fruit that should be thrown out. Similar to the apples, few people would purchase a poorly-made car that might break down any moment on the highway.

,


Anecdotes It either happened to you or you know that somebody has done research on the topic. An anecdote could be, ""On January 1, 2000, my grandfather drove a car - it was almost identical to car B - and you know what happened? His brakes failed and he crashed off a bridge! However, my parents have been driving a car similar to car A for decades and nothing bad has happened. Any reasonable person would not want to end up like my grandfather - dead because of some really badly-made car!""
A study could be, ""Professor did a study recently on cars. In the study of 200,000 people, where 100,000 people drove car A and 100,000 drove car B, 10% of all people who drove car B died in a fatal crash and only 1% who drove car A got into minor accidents! It's obvious that from this, car A is better than car B"".

, Prove their logic is wrong. A possible refutation to my previous example could be, ""Yes, it is correct that someone with a limited budget may not be able to afford Car A, but think about the value of a life. Does a buyer really want to die? As we have all heard, life is priceless. You cannot buy life and it is therefore worth more than any amount of money! It is obviously better to be safe with Car A's quality than take the risk of dying by driving Car B.""

, Prove their analogy doesn't work, or is slightly tangential. For example, one could argue against my previous comparison of the fruit to the cars. One such refutation could be, ""Your analogy does not work. The apples are the same price each. The cars are not. You need a better analogy because the price of the cars can also be a factor, while the price of the apples is not.""

,


Anecdote. Question the validity of their anecdote, or challenge the significance of their anecdote. For example, a possible response to my anecdote could be, ""First, you cannot prove that is true, but let's assume it is. What's the probability that any random person who drives Car B happens to be on a bridge at the exact same moment when the brakes fail? You grandfather was just unlucky. That's all. Taking a tiny chance to save some money can turn out very helpful in the long run. Besides, we can logically deduce that your grandfather had a small budget because Car B is cheap. How do you know whether he got his brakes checked or not? For all we know, he could have been so cheap that he never bothered to go and get them checked."" (Notice, don't try to hurt your opponent's feelings if you can avoid it, although it's their fault if they brought up the anecdote and you just destroy it. This wasn't a true story for me, but if it were for somebody, they could be insulted if you insulted their grandfather who died in a tragic car accident.)
Studies. You can't prove these false unless they seem very unlikely, such as in a recent study, 100% of all people who drove Car B died in car crashes. You can only make the contention seem less important. For example, one might say, ""Blah! 10% of 100,000. That's only 10,000 people! It makes more logical sense to take your chances to save a ton of money!"" Also, emphasize the ""only"" in the last statement to make a stronger statement.

, You can make any statements you want - even if you personally think they are the dumbest comments in the world and absolutely disagree with them. Remember that you are only arguing for your side - not for what you actually think.

Call for in-depth conversations.,

Call to convey clear vocal cues.,
Call to communicate matters of business.,
Call if you’re unsure of your contact’s service plan.,
Call if your contact physically can’t text.",How to Decide Whether to Text or Call Someone1," It takes less time to speak words than to type them. If you want to tell your mom about your day or discuss weekend plans with your best friend, a call is the better choice. Calls to loved ones aren’t scripted and sound more authentic than text messages.;
, Some people feel compelled to answer calls more quickly than text messages. Person-to-person calls more efficiently convey exactly what you need to resolve the matter. If you’re the type of person who makes it a point not to disturb people with petty issues, your call will alert your contact that you need a response now.If no one answers the phone, leave a quick voicemail message like, “Hey, Susie! It’s Claire. Call me back ASAP. I need to talk to you.”

, You’re already at a disadvantage that your contact can’t see your body language. To make matters worse, text messages also lack the intonations that can make it clear what you want to say. If words alone don’t accurately communicate your intended message, opt for a phone call.This is especially important if you’re in a serious romantic relationship. Brief texts are still okay, but your voice is much better at conveying how you feel about your special someone., While texting is becoming more accepted in some places of business, traditional phone calls remain the preferred means of communication in most companies. In fact, not picking up the phone in the workplace can harm your company’s revenue.Conversations held on a more professional level should be calls, especially if it’s within your employer’s culture to do so.

, Never assume that everyone’s phone can receive a text message. As people of diverse age groups and economic backgrounds buy cell phones, service plans are becoming more adaptable to their needs. Maybe your contact cannot afford or doesn’t want a text plan. However, all phones can receive voice messages. When in doubt, call.

, Not everyone’s hands are in peak condition. Arthritis causes the joints to swell, making it painful or impossible to perform specific movements.Carpal tunnel causes pain and numbness in the hand and wrist, especially during long periods of repetitive movements.If Grandma’s fingers look gnarled or if Uncle Joe rubs his wrist after typing, it’s probably best to call them.

Close your debate with passion.",How to Perform Well in a Debate," The five canons of rhetoric were first coined by the Roman philosopher Cicero in the first century.Cicero laid out these five major rules of rhetoric, dividing skillful argumentation into more digestible parts. The first step of rhetoric is called Invention. It refers to the nascent stages of an argument, where you discover the pressing nature of your argument for your particular audience.You'll need to have an understanding of your audience's desires and needs, as well as how to best appeal to them.
When appealing to your audience, think about a balance of logos, ethos, and pathos.These three modes of persuasion will be used to convince your audience to believe in your argument. Each will provide a different reaction from a crowd, and you must change your approach to adapt to the needs of your audience.
A more logical approach, resting mainly on logos, might be appropriate when your audience wants factual evidence of how you'll improve their dire circumstances.
When trying to keep an even tone and seem unbiased, employ more ethos in your speech. This is good for a more formal audience, but one that you still need to empathize with you, or the situation that you're being faced with.
Pathos has the potential to become manipulative in the wrong occasion, but when done right, you can inspire particular strong emotions within your audience. These emotions have the power to drastically change the course of your speech.
Mastering the art of rhetoric will ensure that your prepared speech is as strong as possible. This will booster your ability to perform this argument.;
, The order that your audience hears your argument has a massive effect on how they'll perceive your speech.You've most likely come across the five-paragraph essay in your studies. While this format isn't appropriate for all speeches, the basic layout is based on Greek and Roman argumentative structures. The five steps are as follows:


Introduction. Express your message and why it's important to your audience, as well as yourself.
Statement of fact. Break down the general thesis of your argument into smaller parts. This is where you name reasons why the current issue exists.
Confirmation, or proof. Craft your main argument here, as well as reasons why your argument is a successful one.
Refutation. Acknowledge your opposition, giving some credence to their argument, before challenging their point-of-view.
Conclusion. Wrap up your main points of your argument and give instructions on what you want your audience to do or think.

, You don't want your argument to be riddled with cliches or tired language. Get creative with your speech, expressing salient points in a dynamic way.Ensuring that you are proud of your style will help you perform it with much more conviction.


You should also adjust your style to fit your audience. Make sure you express your ideas in a way that aligns with the moral and intellectual level of your audience.
You can make active use of various linguistic tropes when arranging your arguments.Also known as ""figures of speech,"" these tropes are tried and true methods in composing a sleek and compelling argument.
Antithesis will help you contrast ideas and phrases, as will skillful juxtaposition. Metaphor and simile are both nice ways to equate one idea to another. Any of these tropes will add spice to your writing.

, While it may seem fairly simple, it's good to remember that a memorized speech will always impress more than a speech read off a paper.It's worth noting that certain aspects of your debate will have to be performed on the fly. By memorizing the facts of your topic, however, you'll be able to recount these facts organically. This will help you grow more confident in improvising your speech.

, The final canon of rhetoric, Delivery, will lead your directly into mastering the art of performance in a debate. Focused primarily on gesture, body language, and tone, your delivery is key in impressing points upon your audience.Your facts may be completely accurate, but if you can't properly connect these points to an audience, much of your speech will be missed.


Delivery will also vary to fit your audience. When speaking to a smaller audience, you can make more eye contact, speak more directly to those listening to you. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's ""Fireside Chats,"" for example, were radio broadcasts intended to feel intimate for everyone listening in. His larger speeches, in contrast, felt more immediate and righteous, fitting the more massive scope of their subject matter.

, When your speech is riddled with ""uh's"" and ""'um's"" and other various aspirated sounds, you appear to know less than you actually do.Your verbal hesitations also suggest that you are taking time to find your next word. You want to avoid this in debate, as you're aiming to express mastery over your intended topic.


The ""uh"" sound usually takes less time to overcome in speech. It suggests that you've just finished one point, and you're taking a moment to move onto the next.
Your ""um"" sounds can be far more dangerous, as they suggest that you may be searching for completely unfamiliar information. You'll want to eliminate both from your speech patterns in formal debate, however, as both suggest a stalling in your thought process.
Try replacing your filler sounds with silence. This will give your audience time to stew on your last point, and it will also give you time to generate your stimulus for your next idea.
Remember that everyone needs time to process before moving to their next sentence. You aren't eliminating this thought process. You are, however, making it appear that you are thinking less than you actually are.

, It's easy to settle into overused words in phrases while debating, especially because a great deal of your speech will be founded in your research.There's a tendency for politicians to rest back on trite language, and you want to avoid falling into those traps while you debate.


When your work is highly researched, it runs the risk of becoming pedantic. If you're simply regurgitating facts from academia, your rhetoric can quickly become dull and overly intellectual.Look out for words such as ""capitalist"" or ""dichotomy."" These sorts of words, while thick with various meanings, have been dulled by overuse in the past few years.

, There's a tendency, especially among young debaters, to fire off facts in a rapid, nearly manic way. While you don't want to make your speech drag, there are many benefits to slowing down your speech patterns.When you slow down your speech, you give your audience and your adjudicator more time to process your strong points.


It's much easier to enunciate if you slow down the pace of your speech. You may be able to get through a larger quantity of points, but it's unlikely that all of them will be heard.
Try the ""pencil-in-mouth"" drill if you want to improve your articulation. Stick a pencil in your mouth, parallel to your forehead, and practice your speech while holding it in place. You'll have to verbalize around this obstacle in your mouth, working harder to enunciate your syllables.
When you remove the pencil, you'll find that your speech is far clearer. Keep that same level of enunciation when you're performing. When you blend enunciation with a slower manner of speech, it'll be easier for others to dissect your points.

, Before opening your mouth, take a moment to take a deep breath and calm down your mind.There's a lot of pressure riding on the rebuttal portion of the debate, especially as you have to connect your various points in an improvised fashion.


Boil your arguments into more specific points, mentally, before launching in. You won't win this portion of your debate by scattering new ideas into the air at the last moment.
Sum up your argument into one or two sentences. You'll obviously be extrapolating on these points, but it'll help you to have a logical home base to return to.
Focus on what you know you've done successfully. Don't be hard on yourself for taking the ""path of least resistance"" when going for the win.

, Using gesture can be extremely helpful in elaborating on your points. All public speaking is, after all, just an attempt to seem natural and accessible in front of a larger crowd.Remember the basic NODS rule of physical gesture, which dictate that all your movement should Neutral, Open, Defined, and Strong.


You generally have a large stage to inhabit while debating. Occupy this space fully. You don't want to be pacing nervously, but you do want to ensure that you look comfortable speaking in front of others.
Don't rely on gesture as a nervous tick. If you're releasing anxiety through gesture, then your gestures will not be strong. Instead, they'll add unnecessary motion, distracting from your speech.

, It's unlikely that you'll win your debate if you aren't making eye contact with both your audience and your adjudicator. In speaking in any public setting, the crowd will feel a trust in you if you can connect directly to them using the eyes. Even brief moments of connection will serve you well, as for that instance, one person will feel that you are speaking directly to them.


After you make eye contact with one person in the audience, deliver your next line or phrase to the next person. This way, you'll connect with a larger number of people in a one-on-one way.
You can also use eye contact to silence a distracting presence in your audience. If someone isn't paying attention to you, then a prolonged stare will make them feel uncomfortable. The hope, then, is that they'll quiet down, or at least attempt to be less distracting.

, No one wants to listen to a monotonous speaker, especially if you're being judged on your ability to craft a compelling argument.Changing your tone throughout will also highlight the breadth of your argument, as you should adapt for each section of your speech.


If you're speaking about grisly, violent details, you'll want to adapt a tone of disgust. When slipping in a mild joke or self-aware remark, a humorous or light-hearted tone can be very effective.
Above all, your tone should always have some level of urgency. This proves that you aren't avoiding the importance of the topic at hand. Diversifying your tone is very important, but you never want to forget the core of your speech.

, Any moment of stillness, in a debate, should feel important. Because so much of debate revolves around the power of oration, any break in the action will feel heavy.The dramatic and power pauses are the longest, and often the most successful. They come directly after and before large moments in a speech, respectively.


When done poorly, these major pauses can really tank an argument. Make sure that you've built up to this pause with a great deal of momentum. That way, your silence will be earned.
Pauses can range in their use, from dividing major points in a paragraph to allowing you to get a drink of water. Make sure that you're losing your pauses appropriately, as you don't want to break your focus with too much regularity.

, You always want to maintain immediacy while debating, but you want to make sure that you aren't letting your argument get away from you. If there's a time to relinquish some control, however, it's in your closing statements.Often referred to as a ""final blast,"" your closing remark takes familiar points from your speech and amplifies them with a final appeal to your audience.
You can achieve this with a heightened tone of voice, or you can allow your speech to move a bit quicker than it normally would. Poking small holes in your composure will amplify your power as an orator, and this last effort may be crucial in solidifying a win.

Text if your message isn’t that urgent.,
Text if you think your contact might be indisposed.,
Text to avoid disturbing those around you.,
Text a new romantic interest if both of you agree on it.",How to Decide Whether to Text or Call Someone2," A call that only lasts for a couple of minutes can leave you and your contact feeling awkward. Texts, on the other hand, get right to the point. If you just want to shoot the breeze with a friend in short bursts or ask a short question, a text is a safe choice., Messages that don’t require an immediate reply can be texted. This way, your contact can take time to relax from a long day, eat a meal, etc. without feeling forced to get back to you immediately. Examples of non-urgent messages include:


Asking the person you’re dating to get together Friday night.
Telling someone you’ll be somewhere in a few minutes.
Asking your significant other to pick up some bread on the way home.
Relaying any kind of message that doesn’t need a reply for at least two hours.

, Calls take your attention away from what you’re doing. A text message, on the other hand, can wait until you finish your work. If you think your contact might be in a meeting, teaching a class, or typing up a report, send a text.Give them a few hours to reply before retexting.

, Maybe you share an office with several other people. Maybe you live with a third-shift worker who sleeps during your waking hours. Situations like these call for courtesy. If your voice will distract others from their work or wake someone who is sleeping, opt to send a text message—and set your phone to vibrate for the reply., Texting is increasingly common among new couples who haven’t formed emotional bonds yet. However, advice columns vary from promoting textingto warning against it altogether.What should you do? Ask! It’s the best way to get a clear answer.


Something simple like, “So, should I text you, or do you prefer phone calls?” should do the trick.

Also make sure you read a lot of evidence THAT LINKS.",How to Win a Novice Policy Debate Round," The way to win a novice policy round is to convince the judge that not only is your plan will solve the problem, and the other team's plan is going to make the current situation worse.


The Affirmatives (most commonly referred to as aff. by most debaters) job in the round is to prove that their case works. Sounds simple right? Wrong. To win you have to have a strong, well-built case. Also you have to know the case inside and out. Make sure you know and can explain every one of your advantages and how your case solves (solvency). It seems simple enough until the Negative kicks in.
The Negatives (most commonly referred to as neg. by most debaters) job in the round is to prove that the aff.'s case either

Hurts the status quo (the current way things are going is a good simple definition for status quo)
Doesn't solve (this is called a solvency take-out)
Is morally wrong (this is called a kritik argument, which is uncommon in novice debate)
Prove you can do the case better or pass a better case. Now this is a lot to deal with so luckily you won't have to do it all, just choose your strong points and go for them.

,


The easiest way to do this is called flowing. Flowing is just a fancy way of writing down everything you have said and that your opponents have said against you. Though there is a universal way to flow just find the way that works best for you.

, This is very important because if you get up in your speech and read off a lot of evidence that doesn't go along with what the argument is then the judge will have nothing to evaluate you on and you will most likely lose.

, Nothing is worse than having several people not know what they are talking about. In order for a debate to run smoothly, tell your participants to please write some key points they would like to discuss.

, It is most common to have a spokesperson for each side of the debate, and to only allow them to speak on behalf of their respective side of the debate. To ensure that not only one person leads each side of the debate, allow for people on each side to switch out every five to ten minutes.

, The worst thing to do for a debate is for the debate to completely veer off track. This defeats the purpose of the debate, and as an organizer you should strive for the best results a debate can have.

, A debate should reach an end when both sides reach a conclusion or present all of their opinions and facts. A solution will not always be found, but a compromise or general understanding should mark the end of a debate.

, If the debate is still split, consider reorganizing at a later date and finishing on a more defined ground.

, Do not allow participants (or if applicable audiences) to interrupt your debate. Consider asking such persons to calm down, and if necessary, to leave. If things escalate to violence, consider contacting authorities.

Research the issue or problem.,
Decide on your position.,
Think of evidence or supporting details.,
Create an outline.,
Speak clearly and slowly.,
State your point, exactly as you had outlined it.,
Be aware of the way you speak.,
Listen carefully to the person you are talking with.,
Keep your cool, always.,
Respond in a structured way.",How to Make a Point," Spend some time grappling with the issue or problem. After all, if you don’t have a solid understanding of the issue or problem, you won’t be able to articulate a convincing point.


Read extensively about the issue or problem. For example, if you want to make a point about the problem of providing foreign aid, you should read as many newspaper articles, policy papers, and more about the subject as possible.
Talk to others about the issue or problem before you take a side.
Be open to different points of view on any issue or problem.;
, After you’ve learned about an issue or idea, you need to take a position. Taking a position on the problem will enable you to begin the work of honing your argument.


Make a concrete decision about it.
Your decision does not have to be black or white. You can take a subtle or complex position. For instance, if you're deciding to make a point about the problem of legalizing marijuana, you don't need to argue that it should or should not be legalized. You can argue that it can be legalized for some people, like adults over the age of 21 or for people with a certain medical condition.
State your point out loud to yourself in simple terms. Say something like ""Marijuana should be legalized for all adults over the age of 21."", You also need evidence and supporting details to effectively make a point. Supporting your point with evidence lends it strength and makes it more convincing.


Brainstorm and make a list of evidence that supports your point. For instance, if you're making a point about legalizing marijuana, you can list things like crime, health, and economic data.
Narrow down your evidence. Pick the top three pieces of support that seem the strongest. If you think that three economic statistics associated with legalizing marijuana are the most convincing examples you have, use these., After you’ve done some thinking on the subject, you need to create an outline. Your outline will include the basics you’ve already covered and a little more. Make sure to include:


A sentence or two that clearly and concisely states your point. Use simple terms, if possible.
Expound on your main point in a sentence or two underneath.
List your three supporting details underneath your main point.
Include additional support that you will hold back from your initial delivery of your point. This will be used in a rebuttal, if necessary. For example, if you think that crime statistics are very convincing (but not as convincing as economic data) for your point about legalizing marijuana, use these here.
Craft a concluding sentence. Your concluding statement should re-state your point, re-iterate important details, and be very persuasive. For example, write that ""Ultimately, when we take the economic benefits of marijuana legalization into effect, we find that our society will benefit immensely from ending prohibition."", Speaking clearly and slowly is an effective way to make a point. Not only does speaking clearly and slowly allow your audience to hear and process your words, but it will enable you to focus on your previously thought out plan.


State your point in a clear and unhurried way.
Focus on individual words instead of entire sentences or ideas.
Avoid jumping from one point to the next in a hurried fashion. Even if you have a limited amount of time to make your point, make sure you are moving through your thesis, supporting evidence, and conclusion in a deliberate way., When it comes to articulating your point, you need to stick to your plan. Make sure to state your point exactly as you outlined it. If you stray from your outline and talking points, you’ll be more likely to mess up.


This is when you say your point: ""Marijuana should be legalized for all adults over the age of 21 because it will stimulate the economy.""
Don’t rush. Take your time to articulate your thoughts clearly.
Avoid changing your point or your approach while you are making your point. This is likely to undermine your case. Don't change your argument at the last minute and switch to an argument about personal liberty. You have not prepared for this., Understanding how you speak – your level, intonation, pronunciation, and more – is very important in delivering your point. This is because your delivery greatly impacts how others perceive and understand what you are saying. Ultimately, if you understand how you speak, you’ll be able to take steps to improve your speaking.


Record yourself. Listen to recordings and then try to correct common problems. For instance, if you speak to softly, train yourself to talk louder.
Ask others to watch you or participate in debates with you. This is a great way to get feedback from people who care about you.
Consider things you might say a lot like ""uh,"" your intonation, and any awkward pauses that you may make while you speak. Work to correct these., After you’ve made your point, you need to listen carefully to any response the person you’re speaking with might make. This is important, as without listening carefully, you won’t be able to respond thoughtfully.


Be quiet as the person is speaking.
While it may be tempting to think about how you’re going to respond, avoid doing so.
If you need, make some mental or written notes about the points the other person is saying. If the person is making an argument to maintain marijuana prohibition due to crime, take notes. You may need to counter with your back up evidence later on., When you feel emotion, you'll be more likely to lose track of what the other person is saying and what you will say in a rebuttal. In the end, if you let your emotions get the better of you, you'll respond in a much less effective way.


Make sure you think before you respond.
If you get upset, always count to five before responding.
Don’t take anything the person says personally. If they try to provoke you and get you to lose your cool, don’t take the bait., After you’ve listened to your opponent’s rebuttal, you need to respond. Responding to a rebuttal is extremely important, as it will give you the opportunity to restate your argument, clarify any misconceptions, and provide additional evidence.


Make a statement that transitions you to a response. In an informal setting, consider responding: ""I see what you're saying, Toby, but I hope you will consider my argument."" In a more formal setting, consider responding: ""While I respect my opponent's perspective, I think the issue is much more complicated.""
Restate the position or point of the person you are talking to, and verify that you understood what they meant.
Restate your point in different words, before adding any new comments.
Provide additional evidence, to lend more support to your point. This is that opportunity for you to mention crime statistics associated with marijuana. This might put you over the top in making your point."
"
Pick the correct length of time.,
Decide how you want to handle questions.,
Identify the goal of your seminar.",How to Introduce Yourself Before Giving a Seminar1," Time allocation should conjure up images of Goldilocks. It has to be just right. Too long and you waste the audience's time. Too short and the audience is disoriented. In general your introduction should be under 30 seconds.


This is not a time to rattle off your entire resume. Or regale people about your weekend escapades.
Always remember your audience is made of busy people. They took time out of their day to come watch you talk. Respect that time by not wasting it.;
, Decide ahead of time and state in your introduction if you will allow interruptions during your talk, or if you would rather questions be held for the end of your seminar. Either way, make sure you budget your time so that there is time for questions. Budget about 10% of your allotted seminar time for questions.


This means that for an hour time slot, you should budget 10 minutes for questions and 45-50 minutes for the seminar.
For a 15 minute time slot this means that you should budget 1-2 minutes for questions and 13 minutes for your talk.

, Now before you can formulate the rest of your self-introduction you must identify the goal of your seminar. There are three main categories of seminars, 1) The Job Seminar 2) The Teaching Seminar 3) The Persuasive Seminar. Each of these seminars has very different goals. Identify which category your seminar fits in best:



The Job Seminar. Your seminar is a job talk. Where the goal is to look impressive, qualified and professional.

Teaching Seminar. Your seminar is primarily for educational purposes. Where the goals are to inspire, inform and educate your audience.

The Persuasive Seminar. Your seminar is a ""call to action"" or ""sales pitch."" Where your goals are to persuade, motivate and befriend.
Your seminar may fall into more than one category but there should be one that fits best. Identify it and the goals. We will discuss how to use these goals to choose material for your self-introduction below.

"
"
Use the introduction in your job seminar to impress by demonstrating you are well trained (emphasis on demonstrating, not telling).,
Quickly transition into introducing your talk after mentioning your background.,
Read this example:""Hi my name is Peter Gibbons.,
Note these things that the speaker did right in the example:


The speaker briefly stated his pedigree/credentials, ""Hi my name is Peter Gibbons.,
Write it up.,
Practice.",How to Introduce Yourself Before Giving a Seminar2,"


Interviews are also a time to assess your personality. And no one wants to work with a conceited braggart. Therefore, your self-introduction is not the time to brag and list every awesome thing you have ever done.
Awesome things that are okay to share are those immediately relevant to your seminar. But even with those, many should be subtly worked into the body of your talk.
It would, however, be an appropriate time to share your pedigree. You should share your name, you current work/school affiliations, and current training/educational state. If relevant, share about some past training.

, After all during an interview seminar most of the audience already knows who you are. What your interviewers want to know is what you can do for them, they want to know your skills. So get on with it and to the talk.

, I am from Initech. I trained under Bill Lumbergh. Recently I lead a team that designed and implemented new cover sheets at Initech that have increased productivity. Today I am going to talk about my work in this new cover sheet development, my methods for monitoring the adoption of the new cover sheet system and the outcomes of this new workflow method.""

, I am from Initech. I trained under Bill Lumbergh.""

The speaker incorporated some subtle bragging, ""Recently I lead a team that designed and implemented"".

The speaker then subtly shared some skills ensconced in an introduction of the talk. ""Today I am going to talk about my work in this new cover sheet development, my methods for monitoring the adoption of the new cover sheet system and the outcomes of this new workflow method."" Implied in this sentence is that the speaker knows how to develop and implement new managerial systems and monitor their adoption. Skills presumably his interviewers are interested in.

, Now that you have decided you are giving a Job Seminar and identified your goals, it is time to craft your own introduction. You can use the above example as an outline when writing your own. Of course you will have to customize it for your own unique background, qualifications and goals. Remember that your Job Seminar introduction is a good time to state your credentials and brag a little, just make sure it is subtle.

, Once written, rehearse your introduction for friends or colleagues. Enlist their honest feedback before the big day. Rewrite and re-rehearse your introduction as needed based on feedback.

Write it up.,
Practice.",How to Introduce Yourself Before Giving a Seminar3," Now that you have decided you are giving a Teaching Seminar and identified your goals, it is time to craft your own introduction. You can use the above example as an outline when writing your own. Of course you will have to customize it for your own unique background, qualifications and goals. Remember in your Teaching Seminar introduction to express your enthusiasm for the subject at hand.

, Once written, rehearse your introduction for friends or colleagues. Enlist their honest feedback before the big day. Rewrite and re-rehearse your introduction as needed based on feedback.

Designate a team leader.,
Analyze the topic or resolution (five minutes).,
Discuss the topic (15 minutes).,
Prepare speeches individually (15 minutes).,
Discuss your speeches (10 minutes).,
Make final revisions (15 minutes).",How to Prepare a Short Preparation Debate1," The team leader will make final decisions about definitions or arguments should there be disagreement in the group. He or she will also keep track of time to ensure that preparation is moving efficiently.This method requires you to work alone first, discuss as a group, and then work independently again. Decide if this is the right method for your team and topic.;
, Individually brainstorm the development of your team’s argument.


If your topic is, “Should abortion be legal?” you may begin by listing reasons for both sides of the argument. Think of what most intelligent people say about the topic.
Remember to focus on how your side will approach presenting convincing arguments and counter-arguments.

, Discuss your brainstorm as a team. Come to an agreement on how you will interpret the topic, how you will argue your general case, and what kinds of research you will include.Both teams must prepare a definition of abortion that is accurate. Remember that you should not create a definition that tricks the other team or that confines the debate to a specific place or time.Decide on an approach to the case. Maybe you want to focus on women's rights or family values. No matter the approach, remember that you'll need to assign specific arguments for each speaker.

, The first and second speakers should begin preparing engaging speeches. The statements should be backed up with research where possible. The affirmative team’s speakers might develop strong arguments for abortion that are backed by historical facts. For example, “Abortion should be legal because the U.S. supreme court declared it a fundamental right after Roe v. Wade.”.
The negative side may present moral arguments like, “Abortion should not be legal because it is murder and fetuses feel pain during the procedure.” The third speakers should take this time to look critically at the case. Determine weakness that the other team may find in your arguments. Prepare to defend your case accordingly.

The affirmative side might consider that some supreme court justices believe that Roe v. Wade should be overturned.
The negative side may find that a fetus is not considered a legal person since it cannot survive outside the womb.



, As a group, discuss your points and any new ideas that emerged in the writing process. Clarify how the new ideas will fit into the first or second speaker’s arguments. All speakers should share their main arguments. Other team members must bring up any flaws and how they can be fixed.
For example, someone may have remembered that some religious organizations support a woman’s right to reproductive choice. This may be an important point to consider for both sides.

, Use the last few minutes to clean up your case outline and main arguments. Clarify how the second or third speaker will respond to any opposing challenges to your main points.

Understand the basic debate format and terminology.,
Identify the type of debate you are judging.,
Enforce debate rules.,
Listen carefully.,
Choose a winner.",How to Judge a Debate," Debates are structured arguments or discussions. Teams alternate speeches, where they present their own arguments and refute those of the other team. While debaters may use emotion, they should not yell or be rude to one another or to the audience.


Each side must present and prove their arguments. Affirmative teams will be arguing for a particular issue or resolution. Negative teams will be arguing against it. Sometimes, teams do not know what side they will argue until the debate is ready to start.
Each side has a chance to present their own arguments, as well as to offer rebuttals to the other side's arguments. No new arguments or evidence can be brought up during a rebuttal.
Some debates include cross-examinations, in which one side can question the other side. There are no limitations as to the questions that can be asked, as long as debaters are courteous.;
, Examples include Lincoln-Douglas, Parliamentary, Public Forum, and Policy (Team) debates. Know which one you are judging so you can properly enforce its time limits and rules.


Lincoln-Douglas debates provide one team the opportunity to present their argument, and then the other team to cross-examine them. Then Team 2 presents their argument and Team 1 cross-examines them.
Parliamentary format is as follows: Prime Minister (constructive), Leader of the Opposition (constructive), Member of the Government (constructive), Member of the Opposition (constructive), Leader of the Opposition (rebuttal), and Prime Minister (rebuttal).
Public Forum debates alternate between teams presenting their arguments. Between rounds, however, there is a period called crossfire, where each speaker in the round is allowed to question the other speakers.
Policy debates (or team debates) allow each team two periods of time in the first half of the debate to present their arguments. The second part of the debate consists of two periods of rebuttals.

, Debates can take place as school competitions, speech tournaments, or classroom assignments. Each one may adhere to different rules and guidelines. Read those beforehand so you are aware of them. However, there are some general rules and responsibilities every judge needs to uphold during a debate.


Do not give any feedback during the debate. Share this information only after the debate is over. This is especially important if you are judging a competition or tournament.
Enforce time limits. Each segment of the speech has a specific time frame. Do not allow debaters to exceed their time limit. In some cases, debaters may finish their sentence when time is called, but they may not say anything more than that.
Debaters may not have outside help. Do not allow them to talk with others who are not on their team or to utilize electronic devices during the debate.

, Take notes of each side's arguments. Indicate strengths and weaknesses. In some cases, you will be given a worksheet or ballot to write on. Otherwise, bring your own notebook paper.


Note when a specific argument has been dropped. One side may bring up a weak point, but if the other side does not refute it, that argument has been dropped. In that case, the ""point"" goes to the team who used the argument, however weak it may seem.
Evaluate evidence. As debaters speak, they should cite the sources they are using. If any seem unreliable, irrelevant, or outdated, take note. In some cases, you may ask a debater to verify their evidence.
Identify any fallacies. Fallacies are arguments that sound logical, but really are not. If you are not familiar with different types of fallacies, do a little research before the debate to learn about them.

, Judging a debate is somewhat subjective. However, it is important that you do not allow personal bias or beliefs about the issue to influence who you choose as winner.


Decide who presented the most logical argument. Some teams have a solid reason for their side of the issue. If it is a strong reason, supported with the appropriate evidence, you can deem them the winner.
Determine who presented the most comprehensive argument and responses. In some cases, teams may not have a strong argument, but a set of smaller, more comprehensive reasons for their side of the issue. They may also have strong rebuttals to the other team's arguments. In these cases, you may deem this team the winner.

Select your premise.,
Find reliable sources that support your premise.,
Find reliable sources that support the counterargument.,
Introduce your argument.,
List evidence from strongest to weakest.,
Use deductive or inductive reasoning.,
Determine validity and soundness.,
Restate your argument in a conclusion.,
Avoid hasty generalizations.,
Avoid circular arguments.,
Avoid begging the claim.,
Avoid ad hominem arguments.,
Avoid red herring arguments.,
Avoid either/or arguments.",How to Make a Logical Argument," A premise, or thesis statement, is the theory you’re attempting to prove. Choose something that is debatable, and be as specific as possible. For example, instead of saying, “Pollution is bad for the environment,” which is not debatable, say, “To reduce pollution, the government should tax car owners more heavily.”Try not to be combative or confrontational in your premise. Don’t use words like stupid or evil, which can quickly alienate the people you’re trying to convince.;
, Seek out a librarian at your local library and ask them to help you find books and journals that relate to your research. You can also do much of your research online, but you’ll need to be careful about which sites you’re using. Some are more reliable than others.Government or university websites, peer-reviewed journals, well-known news publications, or documentaries are good places to start.
In general, social media posts, personal websites, and collaborative websites where anyone can make changes are not reliable sources to cite. These are, however, a good place to gain a basic understanding of a topic.
Avoid sources that are trying to sell you something, since their claims may not be completely honest.

, Research an opposing viewpoint so that you can anticipate the arguments someone else will make against your premise. This will also help you prepare for your response to the counterargument.Try imagining what someone who disagreed with you would say. For example, if you’re arguing for taxing drivers in order to reduce pollution, research the ways in which taxes can have a negative impact on society.

, Start with an introduction that explains what you’re going to argue. The introduction will include your premise or thesis, and it will give a preview of how you plan to prove it. This “preview” will essentially be a brief summary of your research findings.An example would be, ""By presenting the financial, cultural, and environmental changes in Pleasantville following the addition of their automobile tax, I will show that a vehicle tax is a realistic option for reducing pollution in our country.""

, Begin with your most compelling piece of evidence in order to begin convincing others of your viewpoint as quickly as possible. Then work your way down until you end with what you view as the weakest aspect of your argument.The best piece of evidence is usually statistical. For example, ""The number of cars purchased in Pleasantville went down by 8% after an additional tax was added to car purchases.""

, This is the path you will take to reach your conclusion. With deductive reasoning, you will start with generalizations and then make a specific conclusion. With inductive reasoning, you will start with specifics and then make a more general conclusion.Example of deductive reasoning: ""All cars run on gas. A Toyota is a type of car. Therefore, a Toyota runs on gas."" By this reasoning, if the first two premises are true, the third one must be true.
Example of inductive reasoning: ""My car has bad gas mileage. Some cars with bad gas mileage are banned in Pleasantville. Therefore my car will be banned in Pleasantville."" By this reasoning, if the first two premises are true, the third one might be true, or it might not. Inductive reasoning is typically used in cases that require some prediction.

, A valid argument is one in which, if all premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Soundness is whether the premises are actually true. Be sure that your argument is both valid and sound.For example, ""All cars are purple. Purple cars run on gas. Therefore all cars run on gas."" If all premises were true, the conclusion would be true, so it is valid. But obviously not all cars are purple, so the argument is not sound.

, Conclude your argument by again summarizing what your main evidence was and how it proved your premise. Do not repeat the thesis exactly; try to rephrase it in another way.For example, ""The success of the Pleasantville auto tax in reducing car purchases, and therefore decreasing the amount of gas emissions there, is why our country needs to add a car tax to our environmental efforts.""
You can use the conclusion as a chance to reemphasize why your argument matters, but do not introduce any new evidence or information here.

, This is a claim made without sufficient evidence. Don’t rush to judgement without having all the facts. Making assumptions about large groups of people will undermine your argument and potentially offend others.For example, “All people who own cars don’t care about the environment.”

, This is when you restate an argument while in the process of trying to prove a claim. Watch for statements in which you're basically just saying the same thing twice.For example, “Cars contribute to pollution by polluting the environment.”

, This is when you reword the claim as support for the claim. It's similar to a circular argument, though it may use more prejudicial language. Use specific evidence to help prove your point rather than biased descriptions.For example, “Poisonous gas fumes are polluting the Earth.” Prove how the fumes are causing pollution, rather than calling them poisonous.

, Don’t attack a person’s character rather than their arguments or positions on certain issues. A person's character is unrelated to the issue at hand, and it makes you look biased against that person.For example, “John’s plan won’t solve anything because he’s selfish.” This doesn’t address anything about John’s plan or how it affects the issue; it only attacks him personally.

, This is when you try to divert attention from something and, in doing so, avoid the key issues you should be addressing.For example, “Think of how much faster your commute will be if there are fewer cars on the road!” This doesn’t have anything to do with the environmental impact of cars or the economic impact of taxes.

, This oversimplifies an argument by insisting there are only two choices. There are almost always more than two options when facing a problem, so don’t assume yours is the only solution. Present a strong case for your argument rather than scaring others into thinking it's the only way.For example, “We can either tax car owners or destroy the planet.”

Designate a team leader.,
Brainstorm individually (10 minutes).,
Share your cases (10 minutes).,
Create your team's case (20 minutes).,
Write your speeches (10 minutes).,
Add the finishing touches (10 minutes).",How to Prepare a Short Preparation Debate2," The team leader will make final decisions about definitions or arguments should there be disagreement in the group. He or she will also keep track of time to ensure that preparation is moving efficiently. This method requires that everyone develop a full case and then collaborate afterwards. Decide if this method is appropriate for your team and the given topic.

, Have each member of the team quickly outline the entire case. This way, everyone puts their ideas to work, and no one dominates the initial thinking process.Use this time to create definitions or look for facts.
List arguments and counter-arguments if time allows.
For example, if the topic is abortion, start with a definition for abortion that is clear. Create a general case and list the main arguments that you think your team should use. You might focus a general case for abortion on the life of the pregnant woman. The first speaker could discuss reproductive rights and female empowerment.
The second speaker might give facts on the financial difficulties with unwanted pregnancies and highlight that women who are denied abortion can face psychological issues.
The third speaker may defend possible opposing arguments by focusing on historical cases, legal definitions of people, and medical advancements.



, Each team member now shares his or her outline from step one. Other team members should listen carefully and write down what is said.Sharing should be brief as details can be filled in later.

, Start with a blank paper and create your case together. Ideas from each team-member’s brainstorm will hopefully be included. Outline all elements of the case including the driving points for each speaker.


The goal here is to create all arguments as a team. Do not assign tasks to individual speakers.

, Use your group work to individually write your speech. Remember to include parts that are specific to your speaking role. This may include introductions, definitions, and defending arguments. , Gather as a team and have each speaker summarize his or her speech. Remember to bring up any potential weaknesses in your arguments, and discuss how they will be addressed. At this point, the team should ensure that everyone understands the path that the case will take. It may be useful to highlight goals and strategies to use during the debate.
As the development is primarily a group effort, the case may evolve quickly. An individual team member may have initially focused an abortion case on the rights of the mother, but the final group focus may be on developing healthy families.

Organize FOUR teams of TWO people.,
Decide which team gets to get to pick whether it will choose the topic first or the side to argue for.,
There are generally 3 topics and 2 sides.,
You and a partner receive your topic around 10 minutes before the debate begins.,
Points of information can be given to the opposing side when they are speaking.,
For every debate, the first and last minute are protected time, where you cannot make any Points of Information.

,
First the opening sides debate.,
One person on side government, called the Prime Minister, speaks first.,
One person on side opposition, called the Leader of the Opposition, speaks next.,
One person on side government, called the Deputy Prime Minister, speaks next.,
One person on side opposition, called the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, speaks next.,
The closing sides now debate.

,
The Member of Government now speaks.,
The Member of Opposition now speaks.,
The Government Whip speaks.,
The Opposition Whip is the last speaker in the debate.",How to Debate (British Parliament Style),";
, This is generally done by a coin toss and the winner will get preference over choosing the topic or the side. There are two government teams and two opposition teams. You will be versing not only your side's opposition, but also the other government team.

, The topics are random and the sides are called ""government"" and ""opposition"" or ""proposition"" and ""opposition"". Government is supporting the topic given and opposition is opposing it. The topic will always request government to argue for a change (argue to change something that currently exists), while opposition will argue against the change. Another type of motion does not require a change. This motion will have the word ""believe"" in it. Here, the government defends a view or belief while the opposition opposes it., You have these few minutes to prepare your speeches. This is often very nerve-wracking,, This is in the form of a .question, and cannot last more than 15 seconds. Be careful not to offer them more than every 15 seconds as this is called ""barracking"" and is perceived as extremely rude

,, There will be two opening teams - the Opening Government and the Opening Opposition.

, They must define every important term in the topic. They must define them carefully, because should s/he introduce fail to do so, side opposition may define those terms in any way that best suits it. (i.e., define the house, define the meaning of the resolution, etc.) Next, the Prime Minister will introduce any contentions (points you wish to use to prove your case) s/he wishes to do. It is imperative that the Prime Minister sets a clear and narrow resolution so that the debate is focused and no too broad. The time limit is generally 5 minutes.

, S/he must refute (prove incorrect) every contention the Prime Minister just made and introduce any contentions s/he wishes to do so. The time limit is generally 5 minutes.

, S/he must refute every contention the Member of the Opposition just introduced, rebuild (re-prove) the Prime Minister's contentions and introduce any additional contentions s/he wishes to introduce. The time limit is generally 5 minutes.

, S/he must refute every contention of side government, rebuild all of side opposition's contentions and introduce any additional contentions s/he wishes to add. Sometimes, it may be against the rules to introduce new contentions in this speech in the last minutes of the speech. It is also, generally, a good idea to summarize all the points of the opening opposition (the Leader of Opposition and his own points) in this speech, as the Leader of the Opposition is the last person of his side to speak. The time limit is generally 8 minutes.

,, S/he must present an extension to the debate that was done by the opening sides. That is to say, S/he must open a new side about the issue. This is 5 minutes.

, S/he was to refute the points of the Member of Government, as well as bring in another extension. This is 5 minutes.

, S/he is to refute the points of the Member of Opposition. Then, s/he has to sum up the debate and crystallize it to some main points. This speaker may not bring in ANY new points/extensions/case studies. This is 5 minutes. The whip speeches are very important, and it may seem that they have nothing to do during prep time, but they should always be thinking about their case as a whole.

S/he was to do the same thing as the Government Whip. This is 5 minutes. Whip speeches are like a biased newspaper report; they lay out their arguments in a way that makes it look like their team has won the whole debate.

Don't try to overdo it.,
Once you've qualified to nationals, relax!",How to Do Well in Congressional Debate (NSDA)," There are lots of roles to understand before you dive in:



P.O, or Presiding Officer, will be the student that runs the chamber. The P.O will be the student that recognizes others for speeches, questions, and motions.

Representatives and Senators are the students in the chamber, or room, with you. If you are in a house or senate, you will compete with and against representatives or senators, respectively.

Parliamentarians and Scorers will be the people judging the chamber. The Parliamentarian is in the chamber for the whole competition (typically 4 hours) and will rank, or score, all representatives and senators in the chamber. Scorers are typically in the chamber for one to two hours and typically rank the top eight competitors.;
, Motions are how things are accomplished.



Previous Question  - to bring the debate to an end, moves to vote on legislation.

Recess - to take a brief break

Point of Personal Privilege - to allow you to leave the room, move, etc.

Suspend the Rules - to do anything not traditionally allowed

Set an Agenda - this is what will be debated

, They'll come in handy particularly for understanding the order of events:



Docket and Legislation are the packet of topics you will debate. The packet is called a 'docket' and each individual topic is called 'legislation'.
The Agenda is the order which you will debate legislation. You won't debate the legislation in the order it is in the docket; rather, you will set an agenda with other students to be debated in that order.
An Amendment is any change to the agenda or legislation.

Authorship or Sponsorship is the first speech on legislation. This speech opens debate and discusses the criteria, purpose, and importance of the legislation.

Precedence and Recency determine who speaks next. Precedence is how many speeches a person has given, recency refers to simply how recent the speech was. This is kept by the P.O and is called speaker order. It is recommended that other members of the chamber keep track of this as well.

Cross Examination is the short period after a speech during which the chamber, or floor, can question the speaker.

, Making connections is an important part of competition. The only way you will have any pull in the chamber is if you communicate well with others to get help passing motions and amendments.

, Scorers and parliamentarians give ranks primarily upon speeches, but will also rank upon overall behavior in the chamber.

, You should speak once hourly, to make sure you come up on ballots each hour, and be active when you aren't speaking. This means asking questions as frequently as possible - not just on one or two speeches. Make a list of good, thoughtful questions beforehand.

, You can use quotes, short personal stories, jokes that relate to the topic, or anything else to catch the attention of the chamber, scorers, and parliamentarians.

, You only have three minutes, so you don't want to try cramming too much into one speech. Have a list of several points in case somebody else uses one you planned on discussing.

, Don't stand up and offer a bunch of rehash. Bring new arguments and add clash to the debate. Refute briefly points brought up by other speakers.

, This rounds your speech, bringing it 'full circle'.

, Think of answers to these questions so that you aren't taken by surprise by questions. Be sure to answer all questions thoroughly but briefly so that there is plenty of time for other questions.

, Be open about your intent to qualify - in some cases, other competitors in the qualifying chamber that don't care to qualify will help you out.

, Now is the most important time ever to master your speech style.

, Don't push yourself to give too many speeches. You should always be worried about quality over quantity. Don't try giving more than one speech each hour: this can hurt your position on speaker order.

, Congratulations! You'll have a few weeks before the new docket is released. Once the docket is released, research a lot. Write pro and con speeches for each piece of legislation, not just your favorites.

Understand what Lincoln-Douglas (more commonly known as LD) debate is.,
Define terms.,
Pick a value.,
Choose your criterion.,
Write your contentions.",How to Construct a Lincoln Douglas Debate Case," LD debate is not solely a value debate. That ship sailed with the realization that debating over ""values"" doesn't make sense a large portion of the time. This is because the way in which we categorize ""values"" is contingent upon things already valued. For example, someone may say a value is Justice because a just society gives that rights protection is important, appealing to utilitarianism. A common misconception is that LD debate is not evidence-intensive. You need cards (evidence from qualified authors)to back up most of your arguments. Blue. Green. Red.;
, This can sometimes be important as terms have different meanings within different contexts. This may require more than just your average dictionary, so look for cards from authors relating to the topic. This is not, however, a necessity as most things are usually assumed to be a certain way within debate. Most debaters tend to use American Heritage Dictionary. The most important thing though, is that you refrain from using definitions that contradict your case, but are still accurate definitions.

, The value of your case is a huge part of your framework. Your value should be drawn from the resolution. For example: ""A just society ought not use the death penalty as a form of punishment."" You may say that the value is justice because the resolution is attempting to determine whether or not an action is just. Your value is the basis for your arguments, though most times the value doesn't play a role in the debate. The primary issue within the framework (issues above contention-level arguments) is the criterion.

, Your criterion is comparable to a filter. For example, there may be many ways to achieve justice, but this is one way to achieve it (through an action of the resolution). Your criterion serves as a concrete way to achieve an abstract value, such as justice. For example, you can use ""maximizing individual rights"" as a criterion for the value social welfare. This is the type of ethical debate that most scholars have when considering philosophical questions. Most values such as Justice, Morality, and Societal Welfare are all ultimately determined by whether or not the revolutionary action helps or hurts the criterion. Essentially, your criterion is the way that you achieve your value. Remember that in Lincoln-Douglas debate, you do not have to explain how you are going to uphold the resolution, just why you should or shouldn't affirm.

, Contention is another word for a point. These points explain how the affirmative/negative action achieves your criterion. The contentions in your case must link back to your value/criterion (or your opponents). Usually it is unwise to have more than a maximum of three contentions as affirmative or 1 to 2 as negative. Go for depth of argumentation rather than breadth. It is much better to with one argument very clearly than muddle the debate on 3 different ones. Main arguments should contain claims (a thesis), warrants (reasons that the claims are true), and impacts (why they matter - usually in relation to a criterion). Also, make sure they don't conflict with each other. Use credible sources for your warrants and always cite your information.


""Create ""Blocks"""": a list of arguments you think your opponent will use and include ways to counter them. The more counter-arguments you can come up with, the more likely you are to encounter one in a round. If you encounter a new argument in a round, make sure to make blocks for it. If you create a good set of blocks, you will be able to anticipate attacks on your case and counter them accordingly.
When writing a negative case, have a ""counter plan"". This means that because you are negating the resolution, you ought to have something that you can do as an alternative, that will uphold the same moral standards and values as the affirmative without the negative effects. These usually aren't necessary in NLD (Novice Lincoln Douglas), but they can still give you an advantage above the affirmative because, unless they can prove why the resolution is the best and only way to go, their arguments don't weigh as much. At the same time, remember that within some debate circuits, counterplans are not acceptable and considered ""progressive"" or something that should stay in policy debate. If a counterplan is essential to a case, try to write an alternative negative case as well and make sure to ask for your judge's ""paradigm"" or judging preferences. If they say they are progressive and are perfectly fine with counterplans go ahead. If not, you may need to fall back on your ""traditional"" case, and place heavier emphasis on the framework (v/vc) debate.

Talk to the speech coach and current team members.,
Choose your event.,
Pick a speech or topic area from your event.",How to Get on the High School Speech Team1," They’ll tell you if there are particular speech categories that they’re looking to recruit in. They’ll also be able to tell you what it’s like to be on a speech team and provide you with specifics about practice and event times.

If you don’t know who the speech coach is, ask your classmates or a teacher.;
, There are eleven nationally recognized speech categories. They are: Dramatic Interpretation, Duo Interpretation, Humorous Interpretation, Program Oral Interpretation, Informative Speaking, Original Oratory, Extemporaneous Speaking, Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Policy Debate, Public Forum Debate, and Congressional Debate. Decide which event you want to participate it.Every event shares a few general skills such as public speaking ability, but they each require their own set of talents. For example, Humorous Interpretation requires an ability to make people laugh, while Extemporaneous Speaking requires an ability to come up with original speaking content in a short amount of time. If you’re planning to do a Duo Interpretation, you’ll need to find a partner, while a Policy Debate will require you to get the debate question ahead of time. Evaluate your own strengths and weaknesses in determining which event to focus on.
If you’re not sure which event you want to focus on, choose one that you think you’ll perform best in during your audition. Once you’re on the team, your coach will most likely allow you to change your event if another event appeals to you.
You can find a description of each event at the National Speech & Debate Association website.

, Depending on the category you choose, you’ll either need to pick a pre-written speech or write your own. For example, if you choose Dramatic Interpretation as your category, you’ll choose a scene from a play or a short story to perform. If your category is Informative Speaking, you’ll need to research a topic and write your own speech.The National Speech & Debate Association provides examples of past speeches for each of the eleven speech categories. Look through these examples to get ideas for your own speech.
Most categories require the speech to be ten minutes or less.

Research your topic.,
Narrow your focus.,
Write down questions as you research.,
Craft a thesis statement.,
Make an outline.,
Write your speech section by section.,
Incorporate source materials.,
Get feedback.",How to Get on the High School Speech Team2," Start with a broad overview of the topic you’re interested in. Read newspaper and magazine articles, books, and websites. For example, if you’re planning to write a speech about urban agriculture, find resources that broadly define the topic such as the Wikipedia page on urban agriculture.The goal at this stage is to absorb as much information about your topic as possible. Don't worry too much about your actual speech here—just read about the topic as much as you can.

, Once you have a broad overview of the subject of your speech, being to focus in on a particular area that interests you. For example, you might decide to focus your urban agriculture speech on permaculture in an urban environment. Once you’ve selected your narrow focus, read more about that particular topic., The goal of your speech should be to help your audience understand and appreciate the topic you’ve chosen. Start by writing down questions you have as your research your topic. These will likely be the same kinds of questions your audience would have. As your understand of the topic develops, write out answers to the questions.Depending on the topic, you might start with questions like Who? What? Where? When? and Why? For example, with the topic of permaculture in an urban environment, you might ask “Who is engaged in this activity?,” “What is permaculture?,” “Where is permaculture popular in the US?,” “When did permaculture become prominent?,” and “Why is permaculture valuable?” Answering these questions will go a long way towards fleshing out your speech.

, Your thesis statement is the question or statement the motivates your speech. For example, in the context of permaculture, you thesis statement might be “Permaculture is an effective way to live more sustainably in an urban environment.”If you have trouble coming up with a thesis statement, look back to the five W questions you asked and answered. They will help guide you to an interesting and effective thesis statement. For example, if your topic is the role of African American soldiers in the Union Army during the Civil War, you might find that most of the soldiers came from a particular state or area. Your thesis could then focus on why that area provided so many soldiers.

, A good speech consists of an introduction, a body with two-to-four major points, and a conclusion. For your outline, write out a one line description of each part of your speech. For example, you might write that your introduction will consist of a personal anecdote, the body will consist of one point that challenges the audiences assumptions and another point that asks the audience to consider historical examples, and your conclusion will ask your audience to imagine how the world could be different.Your outline doesn’t need to be detailed, but it can be. Use whatever method works best for you. At the very least, write out your one-sentence summaries of each section.

, Using your outline, develop each section of your speech one at a time, beginning with the introduction.The introduction to your speech should engage your audience and establish the importance of the topic.
The body should consist of arguments that back up your thesis statement. For example, if your thesis statement is that dinosaurs had more in common with modern-day birds than lizards, you should use the body of your speech to present scientific and historical evidence to back up this claim.
Your conclusion should restate your thesis statement and contain final thoughts that engage your audience.

, Once you have a draft of your speech, incorporate direct or indirect quotations from your research. If your school follows the National Speech & Debate Association guidelines, you’ll be limited to 150 words of quotes.Don’t feel like you have to incorporate quotes. Only do so if the quotes help flesh out your thesis statement.

, Ask a parent, teacher, or friend to read your speech and provide feedback. Revise your speech, incorporating the feedback you’ve received."

Read your speech out loud and make notes.,
Block out your performance.,
Memorize your speech.,
Perform your speech for family and friends.",How to Get on the High School Speech Team3," Even if your written product looks perfect, you’ll likely find that you want to make changes when you hear the words read out loud. As you read, take notes that indicate words or phrases you may want to add or delete. Use symbols to indicate where you want to take pauses.If your speech is original you can, of course, change the wording as much as you’d like. If it’s someone else’s work, you’ll need to keep the wording the same. However, you can still change the piece dramatically by choosing where to pause and how to emotionally emphasize certain words and phrases.
Use your first read-through to determine if your speech is too long or short. If it’s substantially more than ten minutes long, you might need to choose a different speech or cut large portions of it out. If it’s only a little bit longer than ten minutes, you might be able to use cut it down by speaking faster or eliminating pauses.
Keep reading your speech and taking notes until you feel comfortable with the material and have a good idea of how you want your speech to look and sound.

, Performing a speech is about more than just words. How you move your body on the stage can have as much impact on the audience as the words you say. Choose movements that emphasize the emotional state of your character or reflect the point you’re trying to get across.If your category is Policy Debate, you might emphasize a point by forming a circle with your hands or shaking your fist.
If your category is Duo Interpretation, find places in the speech when you and your partner will look at each or make physical contact.

, Tape your finalized speech, with blocking, to a wall. Practice performing your speech and only turn to the written speech when you need a reminder. This process will help you memorize the speech in the context of a performance. If you just sit down and try to memorize the words you might find that you forget them when you actually stand up to perform your speech.You should be familiar enough with your speech at this point that memorization will be like an afterthought.
If your category is one of the debate formats, you should still try to memorize your opening and closing, as well as any points that you’re sure will be brought up at the debate.

, Once you have your speech memorized and you’re able to perform it on your own with few mistakes, ask family members or friends to watch your performance. Having an audience will change how your perform your speech, so it’s important to practice this before you get on stage for your audition.Start out in an informal setting such as your living room. This will help you feel comfortable but still give you the feel for performing in front of an audience.
As you get closer to your audition, try to recreate the setting of the audition space when you perform for family and friends. If you can practice in the auditorium where you’ll be auditioning, do so. The closer your practice setting is to your audition setting, the more comfortable you’ll feel when you’re finally on stage.

, Compare other star signs to yours. Notice how many of them will have a general statement that will, most likely, apply to your individual situation. Nearly all daily newspaper horoscopes are not carefully constructed, or are in fact generated randomly.

, People interpret the same text in different ways to suit them best.


Star signs tend to reflect generalizations about regular human behaviors. Study the common generalizations about the signs and try to guess the signs of people you may know. Then, compare their real sign to the one you believed them to have. Are you correct?

, The most popular form of traditional Western astrology is sun sign astrology, the kind found in the horoscopes of many daily newspapers. If it were indeed accurate, its predictive value would be extremely high but, historically, that has not been the case, for societies following it would be using it in powerful ways, consistently, as that would be the true test.

, The term is also used to describe a map of the zodiac at the time of one’s birth. The zodiac is divided into twelve zones of the sky, each named after the constellation that originally fell within its zone (Taurus, Leo, etc.). The apparent paths of the sun, the moon, and the major planets all fall within the zodiac. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the equinox and solstice points have each moved westward about 30 degrees in the last 2,000 years. Thus, the zodiacal constellations named in ancient times no longer correspond to the segments of the zodiac represented by their signs. In short, had you been born at the same time on the same day of the year 2,000 years ago, you would have been born under a different sign.


In fact, there should be 13 signs, not 12. It is this fact of precession which has altered the very constellations from which masses ""derive"" their charts.
Precession of the equinox is caused by the fact that the axis of the earth's rotation (which causes day and night) and the axis of the earth's revolution around the sun (which marks the passage of each year) are not parallel. They are 23 l/2 degrees away from lining up; that is, the earth's axis of rotation is tilted. This tilt also causes our seasons, a fact that Ptolemy did understand but that many people do not understand even today. Ptolemy understood that the rotation axis of the earth was slowly processing , or moving in a circle, with an angular radius of 23 1/2 degrees with a period of around 26,000 years. He deduced this from comparisons of data taken by the ancient Sumerians 2,000 years before his time. He did not understand what was pushing the precession, but he did understand the motion. We now realize that the sun is rotating with a period of around 30 days and that this causes the sun to bulge at the equator, which causes a torque to be exerted on the top like motion of the earth's day and night cycle. There is also a small 18.6-year variation caused by the moon's orbit around the earth, and the moon also has a small effect on precession; however, the sun's equatorial bulge is the main cause of the precession of the equinox, which is why your sign listed in the newspaper, by Sydney Omar for instance, in most cases is removed by one sign from the modern, actual position of the sun at your birth.

, The modern signs as listed here are further complicated when their boundaries are those of the current constellations. A neater way of dividing the signs would be to divide the ecliptic into 30-degree slices, as Ptolemy did, but to keep the slices centered on the star patterns. This would make the time interval for the signs more nearly 30 days each and eliminate the sign of Ophiuchus, but your modern sign would still differ by one sign from the tradition designations.

, This was named after psychologist Bertram R. Forer, who demonstrated the propensity of people to believe that vaguely worded personality ""profiles"" (which could apply to anybody) were accurate, custom-tailored profiles.

, They both operate on the principle that a person's behavior is based on how they were born instead of who they are. Though most astrology readings are parlor tricks pointing out the most general positive qualities in a person, it does follow that if you believe that a person is introspective because they were born in December, then you can also buy into the foolish idea that a person is lazy because of the color of their skin.

, In a similar way, astrology tries to pawn itself off as science by its inherent vague methods.

Separate faith and science.,
Acknowledge evolution’s limits.,
Point to other creation myths.,
Accept that evolution and God do not have to be contradictory.",How to Defend Evolutionism Against Creationism1," Science tries to understand the natural world and how it works. Think of it as a method of inquiry, one that measures and gathers evidence in support of or against hypotheses. But science as it stands has no way to determine whether or not a deity exists. It can’t make a judgment on the issue.Make this key distinction, or you’ll get nowhere.


Point out that evolution tries to explain the growth of life on earth. It has nothing to say about the origins of life or the universe. Arguments like “something can't come from nothing” aren't relevant to the question at hand.
The central idea of biological evolution is that all life on Earth shares a common ancestor, just as you and your cousins share a common grandmother. Through the process of descent with modification, the common ancestor of life on Earth gave rise to the fantastic diversity that we see documented in the fossil record and around us today. Evolution means that we're all distant cousins: humans and oak trees, hummingbirds and whales.
Accept and ask the other person to accept that one of you is talking about science, which is supported by empirical evidence, while the other is talking about faith and non-science.;
, Both creationism and evolution are worldviews. They proceed from a certain account of the world’s origins and assume the world conforms to this account. In other words, the conclusion is already held to be true. Recognize that this worldview limits you, just as your friend’s worldview limits her.Be able to admit that you can’t disprove the existence of deities or with evolutionary theory, just as your friend can’t disprove evolution with arguments from faith. However you can debunk falsifiable hypotheses, including creation myths and if there was valid evidence against the theory of evolution, it would be accepted by the scientific community.
No one really knows the origins of the universe or where we came from. Make a goodwill effort to see things from the creationist point of view.
Don’t be afraid to admit that science cannot explain everything about the origin of life. At the same time, what we don’t know now may well be discovered in the future.

, Point out that most religious traditions have creation myths. The Judeo-Christian story from the Bible is not unique, but has parallels in Babylonian texts like the Enuma Elish (i.e., in the beginning, there was only undifferentiated water swirling in chaos). Many other religious traditions have their own stories, as well.The ancient Persians believed that the universe was created in a six or seven part series. First the sky, then water, the earth, plants and animals, and humans. Fire was the last creation.The ancient Greeks told the story of Gaia, the earth, who gave birth to the heavens, mountains, and sea. She later gave birth to the world-ocean and other primordial races.The Yoruba people say that, before the earth, the god Olorun lived with divine entities called orisha around a great baobab tree in the sky.

, People like to argue that science and religion, or faith and reason, are mutually exclusive. This is not so. The fact is that science is agnostic about God – it has nothing to say about a divine creator. This means that it is possible to believe in evolution AND in a divinely created universe.


Many religious people reject naturalistic evolution because they think it denies God’s role in the universe, especially in creation and providence (i.e., the idea that God actively intervenes on earth).
Evolution may contradict a literal reading of the Bible. But, people have read the Bible in other ways for centuries and many Christians accept the story as a myth or allegory, not the literal truth.
Point out that religious figures like Pope Francis believe in evolution, and say that evolution is not only compatible with a Creator but requires it."

Show up early.,
Dress appropriately.,
Slow down.,
Make eye contact.,
Keep up your energy.,
Don’t panic.",How to Get on the High School Speech Team4," Auditions are usually blocked out in ten-to-fifteen minutes segments scheduled back-to-back. If you’re late for your audition, there might not be space to fit you in.Showing up early will also give you time to relax and mentally prepare for your audition.

, The way your dress for your audition can be as important as how you actually perform your speech. Dress is an integral part of a performance as it reinforces the subject-matter of your speech.Remember: this is a performance. If you’re performing a comedy piece involving a used car salesman, you need to look the part. For example, you might wear a cheap, ill-fitting suit. If you’ll be going head-to-head with another student in a Congressional Debate, wear professional attire such as a dark dress or a tie and jacket.

, People often speak more quickly when they are nervous. Force yourself to slow down and maintain the same pace you used when you were practicing your speech., The goal of your speech is to engage your audience and get them interested in your topic. Making eye contact with the audience—in this case of an audition, the coach and possibly a few others—is one of the best ways to keep them focused on your topic without losing interest during your speech.Don’t look at just one person throughout your speech. Instead, maintain eye contact for three-to-five seconds with one person, then make eye contact with another person.

, Even though you’ve practiced your speech dozens of times and the topic is familiar to you, your audience is hearing if for the first time. Having high energy throughout your speech will engage the audience and make them feel like the topic is important and interesting., If you get stuck and forget a line from your speech or an argument you meant to make, don’t panic. Pause for a moment, take a deep breathe, and move on with your speech. It’s better to skip a line or a point than to linger on it and draw attention to your mistake."

Tell a captivating story.,
Ask a rhetorical question.,
State a shocking statistic.,
Use a powerful quote.,
Use a prop or a creative visual aid.",How to Begin a Debate1," This can be a personal anecdote about why you are passionate about the topic, an anecdote about another person who the audience can learn from, a wisdom tale, fable, or a historic event or anecdote that captures the key points of your argument.Your story should capture the essence of your debate. It could explore, for example, the challenges you have faced in relation to the topic, how you overcame these challenges, and the lessons you learned.
For example, ""As a person who suffers from seizures, medical marijuana was a saving grace. My family and I had to move across to the country in order for me to get treated, but it was worth the risk. My seizures decreased from five seizures a day to only one seizure per week."";
, When rhetorical questions are crafted and delivered well, they can persuade an audience to side with your position. You want the audience to answer the question for themselves silently, while directing attention to your topic. Ask a question that convinces your audience that you are similar to them and that your share their beliefs.You can ask, for example, “Would you like to see a loved one suffer for no reason at all?”

, Your statistic should be directly related to your argument's main purpose. The impact of the statistic can persuade your audience to side with your way of addressing the issue at hand.You can say, for example, “A billion tons of plastic are floating in the ocean right now. That is enough plastic to make an island the size of Hawaii.” Then, proceed to talk about the issue and explain to your audience why your resolution is the best one.

, Using quotes in a speech reinforces and adds credibility to your ideas. Quotes also demonstrate that your are knowledgable about the topic. Your quote should be related to the topic, and relevant to the audience. Also, try to quote well-known people, or people your audience knows.For example, imagine you are giving a speech on why you think higher education is unnecessary for succeeding in life. You could open with, “Mark Twain once said, ‘Don’t let school interfere with your education.’”

, For example, a picture, video, or an object that captures the essence of your argument. A creative visual aid increases comprehension of the issue, adds aesthetic appeal, and engages your audience's imagination. It will also make the message more memorable.For example, if you are arguing that climate change is real, show a before and after picture of a glacier that has been affected by excessive amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Familiarize yourself with creationist claims and how to refute them.,
Urge your friend to understand the philosophy of science.,
Reiterate that evolution is sound science.,
Calmly and clearly rebut other claims.",How to Defend Evolutionism Against Creationism2," Young Earth Creationists raise some common objections, which are fairly easy to handle. Be ready for these and offer honest, straightforward answers.Some objections are philosophical or ethical, i.e. evolution is atheistic or immoral, evolution means life has no meaning, natural selection is might equals right, or even evolution itself is a religion.
Don’t feel the need to reply to these claims. As said above, they are moral rather than scientific issues.
More sophisticated creationists will try to undercut the science or scientific consensus behind evolution. I.e., evolution is only a theory, evolution hasn’t been proved, there are gaps in the fossil record, mutations are harmful, or evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics.

, Try to make sure he can explain the scientific method and what “theory” means. Science builds its theories to fit observed facts. It is theoretical and open to revision, as fact dictates. This does not mean that it’s unsupported by evidence.Dispel misconceptions about the word “theory.” A theory is an idea that is supported by evidence, whereas a hypothesis is a proposition to be tested. While theories like evolution, plate tectonics, and relativity are open to revision, they are supported by vast amounts of evidence.A good scientist will reject or revise evolutionary theory based on the facts that are presented. In fact, evolutionary theory has been revised many times and will continue to be tweaked in the future.
If you must, explain that revision is not a weakness but an example of the scientific process at work. Scientists take almost nothing for granted and are ready to change their minds when new information is discovered.
Impress that there is, in fact, near total consensus in the scientific community. Evolution is accepted by 99% of biologists..

, Some creationists claim that the theory of evolution is not sound for two reasons: it is not testable or falsifiable. It makes claims about things that were not actually observed and cannot be recreated. Be patient and make your case.This claim does not account for the difference between micro- and macro-evolutionary theory, i.e. changes in species over time and changes in groups above the level of species.
Scientists have plenty of observed evidence for evolution on the micro level, with studies of fruit flies, cells, and Darwin’s study of Galapagos island finches, for example.
On the macro level, it is true that we can’t test past conditions. But we can study physical evidence like the fossil record and make informed inferences. We would expect humans to have evolved from a series of earlier hominids, for example, and this what fossils show. We do not find hominids in dinosaur-era strata.
The idea that evolution can’t be falsified isn’t true. It could easily be falsified if we found evidence for, say, a static fossil record or the spontaneous generation of a species.

, Young Earth Creationists have a whole supply of pseudo-scientific arguments. Be prepared for false claims having to do with mutation, fossils, genetics, and entropy. Reply patiently, but realize that you may never actually convince your friend.Challenge doubts about natural selection. Do children look like their parents? Do they inherit traits genetically? And can we notice any trends over time - for example, people's feet are bigger today than they were 200 years ago.
What about animals? Animals and people inherit different colored skin, hair/fur, and dimensions from their ancestors. These differences can be advantageous (for example, a giraffe with a longer neck can eat more leaves, be healthier, live longer, and reproduce more.)
Some creationists will points out gaps in the fossil record – where are the “transitional” species we should see with evolution? In fact, there are many transitional fossils. Point to Archeopteryx: still a dinosaur, but with light bones and feathers. Most people know that it has birdlike features, so point out that it has many more that are fully reptilian.Some also say natural selection can´t explain different species. But animals move to different places with different conditions. A good example is the Darwin finches, which had the same origin but evolved on different islands. They have different beaks and are biologically distinct species.
One thorny claim is about entropy, the idea that systems tends toward disorder. How can we account for complex life in an entropic universe? This is actually a misunderstanding. The Second Law of Thermodynamics only says that the whole entropy of a system can’t decrease. Local complexity does not contradict the law. Otherwise, things like mineral crystals and snowflakes would be impossible."

Note that Intelligent Design (ID) is not science.,
Undercut claims about complexity and function.,
Deal with the argument from chance.,
Attack ID’s central logical problem.",How to Defend Evolutionism Against Creationism3," Recently many deniers have attacked evolution with a pseudo-scientific theory called “Intelligent Design.” This is the idea that the physical and biological systems in the universe must come from the ‘’’purposeful design’’’ of a creator. It’s more complex than Young Earth Creationism, but it’s no more scientific.In a nutshell, ID states that the universe is really complex and has things that are well-suited to their observed function. Think the human eye. This functionality and complexity can’t be chance, it states. It must be the work of a designer, i.e. God.
Many supporters of ID also accept microevolution, i.e. the idea of development in existing species.
Sound good? Not so fast. Scientific theory has to have evidence that excludes all other possibilities. It also needs to make predictions that can be tested and confirmed or denied.
The problem is that ID can’t be empirically tested. It also doesn’t exclude other explanations: biologists have shown that complex things, like blood clotting, for example, could have developed from earlier, simpler systems.ID fails to predict new things, as well. This is something scientific concepts should do.

, ID doesn’t deny that life forms in the universe can progress from simple to more complex states. But it quibbles. Its supporters argue that the ‘’’fact’’’ of evolution could not have occurred only through natural processes. They point to the complexity and patterns we see in nature, and also to how animals are well-adapted to environments.As said, evolution is an alternative explanation for complexity. ID can’t disprove this, and it has no way of testing its own claims.
ID also claims that functionality proves the hand of a creator – that a creator designed animals to be well-adapted. However, evolution also explains function. Be sure to point this out.
Functionality does not have to come from design. In fact, scientists argue that evolution is blind. Species that survive are not perfectly adapted but “good enough,” and live long enough to reproduce.
Use the example of dinosaurs. Why would a designer have to create so many species that went extinct? What was the purpose of these animals?

, Supporters of ID like to argue that the evolution of complex forms is improbable. It is unbelievable that life could arise all by itself, because the odds are so small. What are the chances of a working car emerging from a “junkyard tornado”? Slim to none. Therefore, they point to an intelligent plan. This argument is also not very good.The “junkyard tornado” is not a sound analogy with life. Supporters of ID ignore the fact that there are laws of interaction in the universe, natural forces acting between particles, and other considerations.
Point out that the odds are not stacked against the natural origin of life (abiogenesis). The probability of the simplest building block forming is about 1 in 10 to the 40th power. This is a huge number. But billions of trials would happened at every moment on primordial earth.Cite the infinite monkey theorem. Say a monkey or group of monkeys are randomly mashing keyboards. The odds that they will type something comprehensible are near zero at any one moment. BUT, if with enough time or enough monkeys the long-term odds are near certain.The odds for abiogenesis are similar.

, ID is based on a key flaw: the idea of a designer, or that design requires a designer. This is a logical fallacy, one you should point out to your friend.Poke holes in the assumptions. ID relates complexity and pattern with intelligence, for one thing. We look at things around us – chairs, cars, computers – and assume they have a designer.
Shouldn’t we suppose other complex things in the universe need a designer? Actually, no. This is a “fallacy of incredulity”: you assume something did not happen because you can’t understand how it could happen.
Point out slippery definitions, too. ID confuses the meaning of the word “design.” Design can mean (1) a structure or pattern that is functional, stable, or seen as beautiful or (2) the act of purposefully making such a structure. Note that “design” in the first sense can, in fact, arise accidentally or randomly.

Explore what policy debate is.,
Find out the resolution.,
Understand what you need to look for in cards, and where to find the information.

,
Research and find evidence.,
Get definitions.,
Consider the actual problem the case will resolve.,
Most teams discuss ADVANTAGES instead of harms.,
Move onto INHERENCY.,
Form your plan.,
THUS THE PLAN: United States federal government should invest in a national high-speed rail system.

,
Now address SOLVENCY.,
Note: There are many ways to put together an affirmative case (the type listed above).",How to Construct a Policy Debate Case," Briefly, policy debate is debating a policy. All policy resolutions start out with ""Resolved: That..."" and then usually in educational debates, ""...the United States Federal Government should..."" To truly understand policy debate, watch a few rounds, maybe go along to a debate tournament as a timekeeper for a judge.;
, This is the first thing you read when you are presenting your case in a round. The 2017-2018 NFL policy debate resolution (or topic) is:


Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its funding and/or regulation of elementary and/or secondary education in the United States.

,, Each piece of evidence you find will need to be cut into a CARD. Standard card format is as follows:


STATE WHAT YOUR CARD IS SAYING(the TAG or SIGN POST)Remember, powerful, but it must be accurate to what the card says.
Who said it-their qualifications-when they said it. Only read the last name and the year, e.g. Zizek '01
A cut-and-pasted piece of evidence. UNDERLINE the good parts of the evidence and only read those underlined parts. Most debaters also highlight them down even further, so that one can read more cards.

, Now, you will not actually read the definitions in your case, however, it is good to have them. When you present your case, do not read them, but include them on the paper. Instead of saying them, just say ""As the affirmative team we reserve the right to clarify any definitions throughout this round.""

, First, you will start with HARMS. Harms are what is wrong. Most cases have no less then three harms.

, However, whether addressing HARMS or ADVANTAGES or both, it is a regional difference across the country. ADVANTAGES are fairly self-explanatory. This is basically any advantages your plan will create.

, This is why your harms are not being solved in the system, the barrier. You don't need a lot of these cards, you may only need one. However, it is good to have more.

, The most common form of a plan is fairly simple. Just say explicitly what the United States Federal Government should do. We reserve the right to clarify""

,, This is how your plan solves for its harms. This also needs evidence, and it MUST correlated directly to your harms. If say, one of your harms was AIDS in Africa is getting out of hand. You need to have a solvency card that says your plan will decrease AIDS.

, Methods vary with what you want to emphasize, what your team works well with, and different strategies.

"
"
Establish definitions.,
Summarize your position’s case.,
Define a policy.",How to Begin a Debate2," The key terms in the debate need to be explained and defined by the first speaker. Also, define key terms that the audience might not know very well.Identify the key terms in your argument and look up their definitions in a range of dictionaries. Choose the most appropriate definition for each word. You want to pick a definition that is neutral and conventional.Your definitions can be literal, as well as contextualized. Contextualized definitions add examples of how the concept applies to the real world. For example, a contextualized definition of money would show that money is used to buy services, such as food and gas., After defining the key terms, you need to tell the audience what you and your group will be arguing and why. Reinforce your arguments by reiterating your position in various ways.For example, “My team and I will show you the need, practicality, and benefits of medicinal marijuana. Together we will show that thousands of patients, including young children, who suffer from seizures, find relief in medicinal marijuana. Studies show that medicinal marijuana reduces instances of seizures by 80%. Furthermore, the side effects of medicinal marijuana are not as severe as the side effects that come with conventional forms of medication used to treat seizures, particularly for children. We will show that medicinal marijuana is a practical, safe, and cost effective solution for patients and their families.”

, Your team's argument should include a proposition on how to address the problem you are debating about. Debating teams do this by defining a policy they wish to enact. The first speaker should outline the core component of the policy, as opposed to a detailed explanation of it.In order to demonstrate that your team's policy will work, use policies that have already been enacted as the basis of your policy. For example, you can highlight that a ban on using cellphones while driving is similar to the ban on drinking while driving.
Try to focus on three important reasons for why the policy is needed or needs to change."
"
Greet the audience.,
State what your side is arguing.,
Make eye contact with audience members.,
Speak slowly and clearly.",How to Begin a Debate3," You should always greet your audience. Greeting your audience shows that you are confident and serious about the topic you will be debating about. It also shows that you respect your audience's opinion.Greet your audience by saying, “Good morning faculty and staff. The topic of today’s debate is student parking,” or “Good morning teachers and students. Thank you for taking the time to come to this debate. Today, the topic is student parking.”

, After you greet your audience, concisely state your team's argument. The audience can become distracted or lose interest if your statement contains too many words. Also, explain to your audience the speakers' roles.State what your side is arguing by saying, “We believe enrolled student’s should not have to pay for a parking pass to park on campus,” or “We believe enrolled students should pay for a parking pass to park on campus.”
Explain the speakers' roles by saying, “As first speaker, I will be defining key terms and outlining our main argument. Our second speaker will explain the supporting reasons for our argument, and our third speaker will summarize our argument.”

, Try to make eye contact with individual persons in the audience. By making eye contact, you can gauge their reactions by reading their facial expressions. Also, you will be able to connect with audience members on a more personal level, and thus, make your argument more persuasive.Remember to maintain eye contact with an audience at the end of a sentence.
Hold eye contact with an individual for only three to five seconds, then move on to someone else.

, Slow down your speaking by remembering to breathe while you speak. After you finish a sentence, take a deep breath, and then move on to the next sentence.Also, remember to take pauses. Pauses allow you to catch your breath and plan what you will say next. They also allow your audience to process what you have just said.

Decide on a position you would like to argue for, and become well-informed about that position.,

Respond to objections.,
Build on your opponent's objections.,
Attempt to resolve each point before moving ahead to the next issue.,
Remain calm, rational, and reasonable at all times.,
Have patience.,
Use effective speech and grammar.,
Ask questions.,
Be willing to lose.,
Don't take too much pride in being right (or winning the debate).",How to Win Informal Arguments and Debates," Ideally, this will be something you really believe in, because it is much easier to make convincing arguments for ideas you are enthusiastic about. Make sure you understand not only your own position, but the opposing position as well. This will allow you to anticipate objections and respond more effectively.

, Before proceeding, however, you should familiarize yourself with the concept of ""impossible people."" In order to have any chance of winning a debate or accomplishing anything productive, you need to be arguing with someone who is basically reasonable. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and find someone more reasonable to debate with.

, This is just a brief statement of your position and your reasons for holding that position. Example: You might say ""I believe the Moon was once of a part of the Earth for the following reasons,"" followed by a quick summary of why you believe that. Try to use evidence-based premises, if possible. For example, ""Geological data shows that the Moon's rocks are quite similar to those found in Earth's early history"" is much better than ""The Moon being blasted out into space by a collision is just a really cool idea.""

, In most cases, your opponent will respond to your thesis by objecting to one or more of your premises, which are the reasons you have given to support your position. If you are well-informed about your position, most of the objections should already be familiar to you. Use logic and evidence to show your opponent why his or her objections do not work. You can refute objections by two major routes: showing that the evidence does not support them, or exposing a logical flaw in the premise of the objection.


To refute the idea that refined white bread is healthy because it is processed, you might state that a study showed rats fed a diet of white bread alone all died. This would be an evidence-based response.
You might state that ""The fact that white bread is processed does not mean it is healthy. There is no established link between highly processed food and better health, so your objection does not follow from your premises."" This would be an logic-based response.

, If possible, don't stop at refuting them - turn them around and use them against your opponent's position.


Example: Your thesis might be that lab rats should not be used in painful experiments. Your opponent might object that rats cannot experience pain in the same way humans can. You might use evidence to refute this objection by referring to studies which show the same type of brain and nervous system function in rats and humans under stress. Instead of stopping there, show your opponent how his or her attempted objection actually supports your position. Continuing the example given here, you might say something like ""since you have made the issue of the ability to feel pain the basis of your objection, doesn't the evidence I've shown you suggest that performing experiments on lab animals is unethical?""

, If there are unresolved points about which you and your opponent cannot agree, it will be difficult to accomplish anything productive, because the unresolved points will continue to come up over and over again. Ultimately, this will lead to a situation where there is no choice but to ""agree to disagree,"" which is usually not an ideal outcome.

, You may feel that your opponent is totally failing to understand your position, but if you become too agitated, you opponent will take this as a sign of weakness and conclude that he has you on the ropes. Rather than helping to convince your opponent, shouting or insulting remarks will only serve to make him more confident in his position. Emotional behavior is no substitute for rational arguments.

, As long as both you and your opponent are debating in a reasonable manner, be willing to spend some time explaining your position and your premises. It is not easy to change someone else's mind. There are a variety of reasons for this, but the most powerful among them is the simple fact that no one enjoys discovering that he is mistaken. It's not a particularly easy thing to accept, so be patient. You won't convince him with your very first point.

, You don't need to pretend you are a university professor, but if you want to be effective and convincing, you should use decent English. Don't try to use big words in order to sound more intelligent, because most people can see through such an act. On the other hand, don't be afraid to use the right word for the task. If a big word is called for, use it. Most importantly, try to speak (or write) clearly and confidently. Make your point using no more and no fewer words than you need.

, Most people assume that the person with the most knowledge of a topic will win in a debate. This, however, is not true. If you are able to ask questions you can easily even any playing field. The idea behind this method goes back to Socrates. Socrates would ask the men, who thought of themselves as wise, question after question until they could no longer give a response without demonstrating a logical fallacy or proving his point. Remember that many people like to hear themselves talk, this can be used against them. Also, do not use questions that they can have multiple answers for, if they respond with an ""um...(pause)"" and contemplate the idea to make up their mind you will go nowhere because once you have completed the questioning period all they need to do to avoid your conclusion is to go back to that question and change their mind. Using the debate example previously mentioned (the pain-response of rats) a way to debate using the Socratic Methodwould be to ask ""How do humans feel pain."" The logical answer would be through nervous-system impulses. You will most likely get an answer much simpler but with that basic idea. You then might ask if a nervous system is responsible for those impulses. They will answer yes, and then you ask if rats have a nervous system. The logical conclusion is yes. Therefore, if rats have a nervous system and a nervous system is responsible for pain, rats can feel pain.


Another method to argue that same point is to ask how you know someone else is feeling pain. They are likely to respond that the person will say ouch. You then ask them ""Well, babies don't say ouch, does that mean that babies don't feel pain?"" They'll most likely change their answer to be a bit broader (always try to get them to concede the broadest definition for an idea (i.e. murder, life, pain), this allows for you to make your point part of that definition). They will most likely retract their previous statement and say that if a person cries out then they are in pain. You then point out that rats squeal and try to escape when they are most likely in pain.

, A skilled debater understands that sometimes, the other person's arguments will simply be stronger than one's own. If you find yourself cornered and unable to refute an opponent's points, be honest and reasonable enough to concede defeat. Do not become stubbornly determined to keep objecting even after you have been proven wrong. Anyone who has engaged in debate regularly has experienced a number of losses. Congratulate your opponent, learn from your mistakes, and move on. Every experience (win or lose) makes you better equipped for your next encounter. Just because you lose a debate doesn't mean you are obligated to change your opinion. Just learn from it, and move on.

, It makes it harder for your adversary to admit to being wrong which, in an informal clash of opinions, should be your primary goal.

Plan on when to accept POIs during your argument.,
Acknowledge your opponent when they raise a POI.,
Finish your sentence or thought before addressing the opponent’s POI.,
Decline the POI if you believe a disruption will undermine the effectiveness of your argument.,
Accept the POI by saying “Accepted,” “Yes, please,” or “Go ahead.”After you accept the POI, your opponent typically has no more than 15 seconds to raise their objection or question.,
Answer the POI.,
Keep your response within the scope of your original argument.,
Question the credibility of the POI’s facts.,
Anticipate your opponent’s counterargument.,
Remain confident even if you don’t know how to respond to a POI.,
Address the audience and judges.,
Do not walk towards your opponent as they deliver their POI.,
Respond to the POI concisely.,
Make a note of where you are in your speech when you accept a POI.,
Transition from the POI to your argument smoothly.",How to Answer Point of Informations In a Debate," Before giving your argument, determine where in your speech will be the best times to address POIs and only accept them during those times. The best time to accept POIs is during the parts of your speech where you are most confident and knowledgeable.Most debate formats will require you to take at least two POIs during your argument. There are advantages and disadvantages to taking both POIs at the beginning, at the end, or spreading them out.Taking both POIs towards the beginning of your argument will get them out of your way, allowing you to focus on the substance of your idea for the rest of your time without worry of being interrupted. However, taking both POIs early can delay getting into the substance of your ideas and may create problems if you don’t manage your time well for the rest of your speech.
Waiting until the end of your speech to accept both POIs can be an advantage because they will come during the strongest times in your argument, giving you a position to answer them. However, delaying acceptance of any POIs until the end may discourage your opponents from asking them, leaving you with no POIs to answer.
Spreading POIs out between the first and last parts of your argument will demonstrate to the judges that you are comfortable addressing POIs at any point in your argument. However, don’t forget to address the second POI in the latter half of your time.;
, How your opponent will raise a POI will depend on what style of debate you are using. There are many different styles of debate; however, they have many commonalities.Most often, your opponent will raise a POI by standing, raising their hand, and/or saying “Point of Information,” “POI,” “On that point,” or another accepted phrase.


You will usually have a period of time at the beginning and the end of your argument during which your opponent is restricted from raising POIs. The amount of time is determined by the style of debate you’re using.

, Even when a POI is raised, remember that you are still the one in control. Do not let the opponent derail your argument by raising a POI. Address the POI once you’ve completed your sentence or idea., If you are in the middle of a strong and passionate section of your argument, do not let a POI ruin your momentum. Also, do not accept a POI during a particularly weak section of your argument, which could be easily attacked by your opponents.To decline a POI, you can verbally tell them you will not accept a POI at this time by saying, “No, thank you,” or “Not at this time, thank you.” Alternatively, you can wave them down by waving your hand in a gesture towards the ground. How you decline a POI is determined by your personal preference, but waving an opponent down may be less disruptive to the flow of your argument., If your opponent speaks for longer than the allotted time, ask them to sit down.POIs may be posed as a pointed question, a rhetorical question, or a concise statement.POIs commonly challenge an argument in one of three ways:


Pushing the premise of your argument to its logical extent. This strategies tries to force you to defend extreme examples.For example, “If you approve of advanced interrogation techniques, then you must approve of the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture.”
Questioning the credibility of a fact. In instances where your argument is dependent on certain facts, a POI that undermines the credibility of that fact could undermine your entire argument.This type of POI may be structure like this one: “You argue that lowering tax rates is effective in increasing a state’s overall tax revenue, but Smith showed that states which lowered tax rates had diminishing tax revenue.”
Proposing a baited contradiction. Common practice of this strategy takes the form of an opponent asking you to take a stance on an issue that he knows will be contradicted in his own or one of his teammate’s upcoming speeches.Such as, “Are you okay with lifting the embargo on Cuba?”

, Once you’ve decided to accept a POI, you must respond to it, even if your speech will address the issue later in your time. Don’t dismiss the POI by saying “I’ll get to that later.”The argument you have planned may not directly answer the POI, or you may forget about it altogether. Instead, address the POI succinctly and say you will expand on those ideas later in your talk. How you respond to the POI should be dependent on the strategy your opponent used in posing it.

, If the POI pushes the premise of your argument to its logical extent, remind your audience that the proposed scenario is beyond the scope of your argument. You could respond, “We are not talking about extreme forms of torture. Extended interrogation hours is acceptable within the guidelines of humane interrogations.”

, If the POI questions the credibility of your facts, you may choose to respond to calling into question the opponent’s own sources. A response to this type of POI could be, “Smith’s study of tax revenue was soundly discounted by many leading economists, including Wilson, Lee, and Jones.”

, When responding to a potentially baited contradictions, keep your answer within the parameters of your argument and expect that your opponent’s counterargument will address this issue. You could say something like this: “Yes, the embargo against Cuba should be lifted, but only if and when the Cuban regime agrees to our terms.”

, You will likely face a time when you are unable to respond to a POI because you do not know the answer to the question or cannot think of an adequate rebuttal. When possible, reiterate the positive aspects of your argument. Alternatively, point out the shortcomings of the question.When you’re attacking the shortcomings of the POI, you could structure your response like this: “Your implication that extended interrogation hours is equivalent to waterboarding is ridiculous and totally blown out of proportion. We’re not talking about torture. We’re talking about giving police the necessary tools to acquire the most information about a crime as possible in a timely fashion.”
Don’t appear flustered by stalling with phrases like “Um” and “Uh, well, maybe.” Even a faulty POI can look strong if you become nervous and agitated while trying to respond., When you are asked a POI, remember that you are still speaking to the audience. Don’t turn your attention to the opponent asking the POI. You are not having a private side-conversation with the opponent. Keep your body posture and voice level consistent with delivering the main body of your argument., Approaching your opponent while they are speaking can be perceived as an aggressive act, and the audience may believe you are trying to bully your opponent.Instead, maintain your position and focus on the content of the POI.

, You have a set amount of time for your argument during a debate. Do not allow the opponent to knock you off your rhythm by giving a lengthy response to a POI. Address the point clearly, but briefly so that you can return to your prepared argument.

, If you have a pen in your hand, mark the point in your speech where you stopped to address the POI. If you do not have a pen handy, place your finger on the appropriate spot in your notes, or make a mental note of where you left off. This will help you quickly resume your argument, and you will not be fumbling with your notes trying to find where you left off., Remind the audience and the judges how the POI connects back to your argument at hand. Use transitional phrases like, “This connects back to what I was saying before,” or “I’m going to return to this idea in a moment.” Transitioning back to your ideas places the emphasis on your own argument as you move forward in your ideas."

Explain what evolution is.,
Explain the discovery of fossils which are layered in decreasing complexity.,
Explain that contrary to the idea of intelligent design, evolution fits with history when it shows that no species is 100% suited to its environment.,
Refute the idea that evolution is ""a theory.""",How to Defend Evolution Against Intelligent Design," Evolution does not state that humans evolved from monkeys anymore than monkeys evolved from humans. Instead, humans and monkeys share a common ancestor who lived millions of years ago. Humans and apes have been shown to have many similarities both in their appearance, genes, and behavior. When parents have children, they pass on unique genes to their children. Sometimes, genes also mutate (a flaw in the DNA occurs during replication or translation). Evolution can occur because of natural selection, whereby animals with mutations that enable it to survive in its environment are able to reproduce, and animals that are unable to survive are unable to reproduce., Fossils found further down the rock layers appear to be simpler specimens of fossilized organisms near the surface. Reveal that the fossil record shows a gradual specialization of organisms.For example, the fish Eusthenopteron shares so many characteristics with the amphibian Icthyostega that there logically is a connection between the two.

, In fact, an intelligent designer (like a human) aims for the simplest work that functions.For example, the laryngeal nerve in a giraffe has an illogical pathway which makes a big long loop instead of directly connecting where it should which would shorten the nerve significantly. In addition, major changes in the species composition of Earth as a result of mass extinctions do not support the idea that intelligent design made all creations perfect to live on Earth. , A theory is not a hypothesis, as many people assume, but it is rather an accumulation of observable facts and evidence that support a larger idea. Theories, in fact, only become accepted once they stand up to considerable scrutiny from the overall scientific community.

Follow the form, if debating formally.,
Keep calm.,
Speak clearly.,
Explain your logic.,
Be respectful and fair.,
Act confident.,
Use arguments based on logic.,
Use arguments based on emotions.,
Use arguments based on authority.,
Do your research.,
Look for logical fallacies.,
Look for weaknesses in their argument.,
Keep the topic on track.",How to Be a Good Debater," If you’re going to be debating in a formal setting, such as for a class or for a club, you’ll want to be sure you know how a debate actually works. Formal debates follow a formula, and you’ll want to know that formula like the back of your hand so that you’re prepared. It’s also important because breaking from the formula can lose you points.


Usually there is a statement and two or more teams or single debaters will be assigned to either agree or disagree with the idea. You’ll then take turns making your points according to a set period of time.
There are a couple of different debate styles (which determine the rules and how the debate works), so you’ll need to know which one you’re using in order to be clear on the rules. It’s a good idea to look into this well in advance and do some research online. Look for words like “competitive debate”, “Parliamentary debate”, or “Oxford debate”. These are some of the styles of debate you might encounter.;
, When you debate, stay calm. Don’t start shouting or get angry. This will show weakness to your opponent. Instead, keep your voice even and keep your facial expression neutral. This makes it much harder for your opponent to find what buttons they can press to make you trip up.


If you’re having trouble staying calm, try focusing on your breathing for a minute or two.

, When you talk, speak clearly so that people can understand you. Speaking clearly also makes you sound smarter and more confident. Speak clearly by using a loud enough volume that people can hear you and then enunciate your words. Don’t mumble or slur your words but say each word deliberately and say each syllable carefully.


It’s easy to catch poor enunciation when reciting tongue twisters. Try this one: “How can a clam cram in a clean cream can?”, When you explain to someone how you arrived at the conclusion that you came to, deliberately and step by step, you’re forcing their brain to think in the same way that yours does. As long as your reasoning is at least good on the surface, this can be one of the most effective ways to bring someone over to your side of the argument.

, When you argue with someone, be respectful. Don’t insult them, talk over them, or judge them. Doing this can be seen as a sign that your argument isn’t very good, plus it makes people defensive and much less willing to listen to you or want to agree with you. You should also be fair in an argument. Don’t distort the facts. Use evidence against them that is recent and directly related, not old and “water under the bridge”.


A bad example of debating would look like: “Why should we listen to you? You broke the system last year when you were in charge of the project. You’d probably just ruin this too.”
A good example of debating would look like: “I know you’re really excited about this project but the situation is very sensitive. It would be better to use someone with more experience so that it can be done more efficiently.”

, Although you don’t have to actually be confident, acting confident can make you and your argument much more appealing and believable. When you don’t act confident, you communicate (even if it’s not true) that you don’t think your argument is a very good one. You can do some simple, easy things to make yourself appear more confident, though. Make eye contact with your opponent, as well as people in your audience if you have one. Don’t fidget, instead using your hands to talk or keep them pinned in front of you. Speak clearly and with purpose, avoiding filler language like “umm” and “ahh”. Just a few adjustments will have you seeming much more sure of yourself.

, Arguments based on logic, sometimes referred to as “logos” in the study of arguing, use examples and ideas which are rooted in simple, direct reasoning. These kinds of arguments are especially helpful when debating with someone who considers themselves smart and logical. They are also good for topics that are “serious” in nature, like politics and economics.


Try to use facts, statistics, and real life examples to make logical arguments.An example argument would be: “Evidence has shown that rates of teen pregnancy have decreased as more comprehensive sex education has become mandatory in schools. You can see in this chart….”

, Arguments based on emotions, sometimes referred to as “pathos” in the study of arguing, use appeals to people’s heart and emotions. These kinds of arguments are especially helpful when debating with someone who is prone to strong emotions (showing heightened joy and easily visible sadness). They are also good for topics that are “human” in nature, like arguments about social justice, discrimination, or current events with great tolls on society (like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict).


Try to draw on people’s hopes and fears. Use personal stories and try to make a personal connection with either your opponent or your audience by comparing the situation to something that is close to them.
An example argument would be: “Backing out now would pose an infinitely greater danger to us than if we stayed and tried to fix the problem. Untold lives could be lost if we leave but if we stay, then we can save lives.”

, Arguments based on authority, sometimes referred to as “ethos” in the study of arguing, use appeals to your authority and credibility or that of another who supports your ideas. These kinds of arguments are especially helpful when debating with someone who is not as experienced in the field or who has a particularly weak argument. They are also good for topics that are “academic” in nature, like arguments about medicine, science, or history.Try to establish your credentials and elaborate on your experience when using arguments like these. Make sure ahead of time that your opponent is not significantly more experienced than you.
An example argument would be: “I’ve taught for over 30 years and I’ve seen all of these practices first hand. I know what works in the field and what doesn’t. Ideals and real life are two very different things.”

, The more prepared you are for a debate, the better you'll do. If you really want to guarantee a win as much as possible, do your research. When you know a topic backwards and forwards and from all angles, you'll be much better prepared to counter any argument your opponent might dream up. It's especially important to know the most common arguments for and against both sides of the issue. When you know what your opponent is likely to emphasize, you'll be able to explain why that's wrong.


Avoid making websites like Wikipedia your main source of information. It's a good place to start but you should fill in your facts from sources that are experts in whatever topic you're trying to cover. For example, if you're going to debate about economics, don't quote a Wikipedia fact. Quote Alberto Alesina, one of the economics professors at Harvard and co-editor of a major academic journal on the topic.

, Logical fallacies are when the line of reasoning that someone uses is wrong. Even though the conclusion might be right, the way of getting there is wrong. This can be used to shed doubt on their conclusion, making your argument look better. There are lots of different kinds of logical fallacies and you'll want to study each one individually in order to learn to recognize and counter it.


One of the most common examples of a logical fallacy is called ""ad hominem"", and is about attacking the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. This is often seen in politics. Think of it like ""this guy is a jerk"" vs. ""there is no evidence that this plan will work"".
Another common logical fallacy is called ""black or white"". This is when an argument is presented as having only two options, with the outcome they want being presented as the best one. This ignores middle ground and other routes, which may make more sense. Think of it like when you mom says, ""You can get married and have children or you can die old and alone."" There's probably some wiggle room in there, right?

, There are lots of ways in which someone's argument can be weak. If you find those weaknesses, you can point them out, making your argument look stronger by comparison. Try:


Look for places where they've not thought their course of action through to its logical conclusion. An example of this is the recent Supreme Court decision that companies can have a religion and that employees should be subject to the rules of that religion. That's maybe more acceptable if the company is traditional Christian than if it's outrageous Pastafarians, right?
Another sign of a weak argument is if they skim over a crucial point and use very little evidence to back it up. This is usually an indication that there is no evidence and they're mainly drawing the conclusion that they want to draw. For example, someone arguing that guns prevent mass shootings and only using one example in favor of their argument is clearly missing how many examples go in the opposite direction. You want to lock in on that and talk about the evidence they passed over.

, This is when your opponent starts arguing about a subject separate from the topic you're supposed to be debating. When a debate gets off track, that can be a sign that your opponent is running out of solid reasoning and beginning to break down. Keep an argument on track and you'll be more likely to win. Ask yourself if the current argument ties directly back to the topic you're supposed to be dealing with. If it doesn't support one side or the other, the the argument is off track.


An example of this would be if you are arguing about whether guns prevent mass shootings and they start arguing that anyone that doesn't like guns is racist.
Be forceful in turning the argument around. Call them out for changing the topic. This will point the behavior out to your audience and can make you look more confident and correct.

Learn Kritiks or Ks.",How to Be Good at Policy Debate," When you attend a debate tournament, it is not uncommon to dress nicely.


For the guys, this means a button-up shirt with some slacks or khakis and probably a tie. As for shoes, it is wise to wear black or brown dress shoes. The more professional you look, the better chance you have at winning the ballot.
For the ladies, you may want to wear a nice dress, slacks or a business skirt. As for shirts, you could wear a button-up one with a tie, or go for a dress shirt with a black cardigan or suit jacket. It all depends on what you feel comfortable in. A good majority of female debaters wear heels but flats look just as presentable and won't hurt your feet as badly.
When you walk into the debate round, if you look nicer and more presentable than the other team, you already have a better chance at winning the ballot.;
, It is always a good idea to find a spot in the room where you can see how the judge is reacting to the speaker. It isn't as important that you see the speaker. Most judges react to what the speaker is saying, so you can tell what they are thinking. After you pick the spot you are going to sit within the round, you need to greet the judge.


Shake their hand and smile before you sign the ballot.
After you sign the ballot, greet the other team and shake their hands also.
Then you and the other team need to agree on a place to speak from. It is always a good idea to make sure it is easy for the judge to see and hear you while you speak, so keep this in mind when picking where you are going to speak from.

, Shake your opponents' hands and tell them good gob. Never leave the room before the other team, especially if the judge is still present. If you leave before the other team and they are left in the room with the judge, it is likely that they will talk to the judge after the round and it could result in you losing because of something they said. It is always a good idea to remain in the room.

, The speaker order is as follows: 1AC- 2N CX, 1NC- 1A CX, 2AC- 1N CX, 2NC- 2A CX, 1NR, 1AR, 2NR, 2AR.

, However, at its most basic, be aware that every year the debate community is presented with a resolution. The affirmative team has to follow this resolution and present a way that the status quo could be improved within the resolution. The negative team then argues back, stating how the status quo is better and if we should/should not do the affirmative's plan that they present in the 1AC.

, You have to know what kind of arguments you have and which ones to use. Every argument you make in the debate round should have the potential to win you the round. If you present your evidence and explain it well to the judge, then they are more liable to vote for you.

, As the affirmative team, there are many things you have to do in order to win the debate round. First of all, you have to be topical. Topical means you follow the resolution. You also have to include the five stock issues in your 1AC.


The first stock issue is Topicality. Making sure you follow the resolution.
You also have to include inherency. Inherency is whether or not the status quo is doing the affirmative plan and if it is an improvement to the status quo.
Another thing is significance. You have to prove that the flaws in the status quo are big and you can fix them.
One more thing you have to have is solvency. You have to prove that your affirmative plan can solve for you advantages (harms)
Demonstrate harms. You have to prove that the problems are so big they are going to cause an impact that is really big (such as extinction, war, or economic collapse).

, After you give the 1AC speech you will then be CX(ed) or the other team will ask you questions. You then answer things such as how much money is your plan going to cost? How long will you take to solve for your harms? How are you going to solve for your advantages? And so forth.

, Being negative can be really fun or it can be really awful. It depends on how you approach the round. As the negative team, you can do pretty much whatever you want. The affirmative has a little circle that is known as the affirmative ground (the resolution), the negative has all of the grounds outside of the little circle. As the negative team, it is difficult to win if you don't come prepared. As the negative team, you can run arguments such as Disadvantages, Kritiks, Counterplans, etc.. One big thing you should run every round on negative is Topicality, even if the affirmative team is topical. You should also have something to say about their advantages and prove they don't include all of the five stock issues.


It might seem silly to run topicality even if the affirmative team follows the resolution. However, it can win you a round if the other team fails to answer your argument. Remember that silence is compliance. So, if the other team drops or fails to answer the arguments, you present, then they concede or agree with you. Well, at least that is what it means within the round.

, Since the affirmative has the very first and very last speech the negative is granted the ""block"". The block is after the 2AC when the 2N gives their constructive speech. Right after this constructive speech there is a CX and then the 1N has a 5 minute speech that is referred to as a rebuttal. This allows the negative to split the block. When you split the block, it means that the 2N talks about a certain set of arguments and the 1N talks about all of the ones the 2N didn't get to. This allows for the negative to make up lost time since the affirmative has an infinite amount of time to write the 1AC.

, Topicality is the most common argument the negative runs. It has to include the following:


Definition of the word the affirmative violates.
The violation taking place
The Limits or Standards the affirmative is violating
Two reasons (usually fairness and education) why you should vote for the negative.

, These are the second most commonly run argument. These arguments say that by doing the affirmative plan, it is going to cause something bad to happen. For example, if the U.S.A. explores the ocean, China is going to feel excluded and get mad at the U.S.A., resulting in a war. So, to sum it all up, you have to convince that the affirmative changes the status quo and that is bad because it triggers the impact. The impacts in debate are usually huge, such as war, nuclear war, extinction, or economic collapse (which leads to war). Disadvantages have four parts:


Uniqueness: This means that what is happening in the status quo is good. Using China as an example, China and the U.S.A. are working together right now.
Link: The link is how the disadvantage applies to the affirmative case. An example using China would be China wants to work with us exploring the ocean.
Internal Link: This is how the link applies to the impact. For example, if China sees that we are excluding them, then they will be frustrated and alienated.
Impact: The impact is the bad thing that is going to happen. The example is that if the U.S.A. excludes China, the U.S.A. might have a war with them.

, These are the third most popular arguments in a debate round. These usually say that what the affirmative team is doing is bad for some reason. They include three parts:


Link: What is the affirmative doing that is so bad?
Impact: How is the affirmatives representations going to cause a problem?
Alternative: What we should do instead of the affirmative's plan.

"
Start a debate by asking questions.,
Understand the other person's position.,
Introduce your counterargument.,
Offer rebuttals to the other person's argument.,
Respond to any of the other person's rebuttals.,
Spot logical fallacies.,
Be laid back about it.,
Don't rehash the same arguments over and over again.,
Wrap things up amicably.",How to Debate1," By probing with questions, you can gradually reveal an argument. Since you're not engaging in a formal debate, you don't really know what side of the argument the other person is going to take, or what they necessarily believe in. Ask questions to narrow things down.


To get a sense of someone's interests and expertise, probe them with a detailed question like: ""So do you believe that the gap in the fossil record says anything serious about Darwinism?""

Ask directly for their opinion. ""So what's your position when it comes to affirmative action?""
;
, Ask them to clarify any confusing areas. Nobody's worldview is perfectly coherent, but it's hard to debate someone when they're all over the place. Try to gently get them to adhere to one line of arguments that are more or less consistent.


If you're not sure about what their argument is, help them out in a non-threatening way: ""So, if I understand what you're saying, you mean that the penny should be abolished because it costs more than a penny to produce a penny?""


, After you've respectfully echoed what they say, introduce your counterargument. Explain the gist of what you believe and how it runs contrary to their argument. Try to think of an idea as solid as theirs is. Don't just say they are wrong: think of a thing you can really argue for that is itself a solid belief.


For example, if they say the government should give tax breaks to hybrid car owners, don't just say, ""What I believe is that you're wrong and that's a terrible idea.""
Instead, counter their idea with another: ""I think the government should focus on building citywide transit--it's better for the environment if we dismantle car culture altogether.""
Offer examples along with your thesis for why you hold a particular belief.

, After you have stated your counterargument, try to rebut their argument with supporting arguments as well as evidence that supports those arguments.



""Does it really make sense to say that any form of government — municipal, state, or federal — should legislate sexual morality? It's not a question of ""could"" — they're more than capable of doing it; it's more a question of whether it's right for them to say how we should treat our own bodies in the privacy of our own home. Where does it stop if we let them get a foot in the door?""


, More than likely, the other person you're debating will take issue with some of the things you are saying. Remember their rebuttals and tackle them when the other person has finished speaking.


Because this is an informal setting, you won't be taking notes as you go. Use more casual methods to remember your friend's points. For example, you might keep track on your fingers of the number of points you want to address.
Fold down one finger for each point, and release one when you have rebutted a point.
If that doesn't work for you, just ask your friend to remind you what they said. They'll enjoy repeating it.

, When someone makes an argument that isn't sound in structure, catch it and gently correct it. Common logical fallacies include slippery slope arguments, circular reasoning, and ad hominem attacks.Say your interlocutor says, ""If we let war refugees into our country then pretty soon we'll have to let anyone suffering a manmade disaster into our country and then we'll have to let in anyone suffering a natural disaster and then we'll have to let in anyone who is suffering in any way at all and then our country will be completely overwhelmed!""
You might respond, ""I understand that concern, but I think there's a flaw in your logic. One thing doesn't necessarily lead to another—saying so is a slippery slope fallacy.""

, Don’t pursue a topic your friend or acquaintance doesn't want to pursue. If you are both enjoying the debate, be sure to express friendliness and stay relaxed throughout. It pays to be nice to the other person, even if you're debating them. Don't:


Hog the conversation. It's an informal debate, which should mean a free-flowing exchange of ideas, not you rambling on and on about why you're right and they're wrong.
Assume the other person means ill. They might misspeak or the debate could get unintentionally heated. It's best to assume that the other person is coming at the debate expecting only some friendly verbal sparring, and isn't out to hurt you.
Raise your voice or let things get heated. Try not to get so wrapped up in the debate that you lose your cool. A debate should be civilized and enlightening, not a lesson in browbeating.

, Some debates come full circle and then keep on going because neither party is willing to admit defeat. If you become involved in a debate that never ends, don't push it. Just say: ""I respect your opinion. I don't agree with you, but maybe I will in the future. Give me a little bit of time to think it over?""

, No one will want to debate you if you're a sore loser or if you refuse to treat your sparring partner with respect. However heated the debate might have been, try to be friendly as you wrap things up. You may disagree with someone, but that doesn't mean you can't be friends.

Listen for single rings.,
Check the area code.,
Check for a message.,
Watch out for charges on your phone bill.,
Call the numbers you know.",How to Call an Unknown Number1," Be suspicious if you hear your phone ring once. A single-ring missed call could be the work of a ""crammer"": someone who is trying to get you to call them back so they can charge you. If you only hear one ring, don't call the number back. If it wasn't a crammer, it was probably a wrong number.Telemarketers are required to ring at least four times, or for at least 15 seconds, before they hang up.;
, If the number is displayed, look it up online. Crammers call from countries with the same international code (+1) as the USA, so they look like domestic calls. However, if you search the numbers, you can identify them as foreign by their area code.


A good rule of thumb is that if you don't recognize the area code, don't answer.
Many of these calls come from the Dominican Republic (809), Jamaica (876), British Virgin Islands (284) and Grenada (473).There are also services online that allow you to look up numbers. Search for ""reverse lookup"" or ""find out who called me.""

, Someone trying to call you about a serious matter will either leave a phone message or contact you by other means. If you get a missed call from a number you don't know, or a blocked number, it probably isn't important. Don't call back!


If they do leave a message, go ahead and call them back.
Crammers will never leave a message, because they are operating on an extremely limited profit margin and can't afford the international call.

, If you notice mysterious charges, especially for something undefined, like ""special services"" or ""premium service,"" on your phone bill, call your phone carrier and let them know there are unauthorized charges. They will typically reimburse you.If you have called back an unknown number and have found yourself listening to a recorded message, be extra vigilant with your phone bill. If you called and found yourself listening to an ""adult services"" recording, expect unauthorized charges.
Don't be embarrassed asking your phone carrier to reimburse you. Scam calls are an everyday problem for them.

, Sometimes scammers will leave a message with a number for you to call. If you get a voicemail or text message from someone who claims to be your bank, your cell phone provider, or a hospital, try calling that entity by the number you have for them, rather than tracing the call.

Know what aspects of the debate you will be judged on, if appropriate.",How to Debate2," While rules will vary situation to situation, many standards are common to most debates. Come dressed to play the part of a serious debater, and bring an attitude to match. For important formal debates—really for any debate you want to win—wear a suit or equally formal wear. Dress like a politician or like you are going to a funeral. Keep your suit jacket on at all times, and your tie if you are wearing it.Don't wear anything tight or revealing.
Face the judge when you speak, and speak standing.
Read full citations when you are quoting.
If you're not sure if what you are doing is professional, ask the judge's permission. For instance, if you want to leave the room for water, ask.
In team debates, avoid prompting your partner unless they are immediately jeopardizing your chances of winning. Try not to do it at all.
Keep your cell phone off.
Do not curse.
Limit jokes to those that would be appropriate in a professional setting. Don't tell jokes that are off-color or that rely on insensitive stereotypes.

, In British Parliamentary, for instance, one team must debate the ""affirmative"" stance, and the other must debate the ""negative"" stance. The team that agrees with the topic is called the affirmative, while the team that disagrees is called the negative.


For Policy Debate, the affirmative team proposes a plan and the negative team argues that it should not be enacted.Both teams will be seated near the front of the room they are to speak in — affirmative team (Government) on the left, negative team (Opposition) on the right.
The chairperson or adjudicator will start the debate, and the first speaker will present their speech. The order of the speakers is generally affirmative, negative, affirmative, negative, and so on.

, Debating ""That the death penalty is a just and effective punishment"" is probably already pretty clear, but what if you're given a topic like ""That happiness is a nobler trait than wisdom?"" You might need to offer a definition of the topic before you proceed.


The affirmative always gets the first and best opportunity to define the topic. To define well, try to mirror the way an average person on the street might define the topic. If your interpretation is too creative, the other team might attack it.
The negative team is given an opportunity to refute the definition (otherwise known as challenging the definition) and offer their own, but only if the affirmative's definition is unreasonable or it renders the negative's position obsolete. The first negative speaker must refute the affirmative's definition if s/he wishes to challenge it.

, Keep your eye on your watch, and set a timer for a minute before your time is up so that you can look over your argument before you are done. Your allotted writing time will depend on the style of debate. For British Parliamentary, for instance, seven minutes is likely. To write efficiently, get your main points down first, then fill in evidence, additional refutations, and any examples or anecdotes you are choosing to include.


Depending on what position you argue, you must follow certain protocol such as defining the topic or presenting a main argument.

, If you say ""I think the death penalty should be abolished,"" be ready to prove why this is the best course of action. Provide supporting arguments, and give evidence for each. Make sure your supporting arguments and evidence truly relate to your stance, or your opposition may co-opt them or ask for them to be thrown out.Your opposing arguments might be ""The death penalty is more expensive than life in prison,"" ""the death penalty provides no opportunity for redemption,"" or ""the death penalty makes us look bad in the international community.""
Evidence can include statistics and expert opinions.

, If you don't know it, don't debate it unless you have no other choice. If you don't know much about the topic, try to at least come up with some vague, ambiguous information so that your opponents will have a hard time refuting your contentions.


If they don't understand it, they can't refute it. Keep in mind that the judge probably won't understand you so well either, but trying is probably better than saying, ""I know nothing. I give the case to my opponents.""
Don't use rhetorical questions. Always give a clear answer to every question you ask. Leaving a question open-ended gives your opponents room to refute.
Use religion only when appropriate. Things that are written in the Bible, Torah, Quran, etc, are not usually sound resources to use to prove your argument, as not everyone takes these sources to be the truth.

, Be passionate in your speech—a monotone voice will cause people to drift off, and they may miss the point of what you're trying to say. Speak clearly, slowly, and loudly.


Make eye contact with whomever decides the winners of the debate. While it's okay to look at your opponents every once in a while, try to direct your argument at the judge.
Give a layout of your argument before you make it. That way, your audience will know what to expect and your judge won't cut you off unless you run way overtime.

, Since teams take turns debating, it's always possible to offer rebuttals unless you are the first affirmative speaker. For British Parliamentary, for example, both teams might organize their debate strategy thus:



1st affirmative:

Define the topic (optional) and present the team's main line.
Outline, in brief, what each affirmative speaker will talk about.
Present the first half of the affirmative's argument.



1st negative:

Accept or reject the definition (optional) and present the team's main line.
Outline, in brief, what each negative speaker will talk about.
Offer a rebuttal of a few of the points presented by the first affirmative.
Present the first half of the negative's argument.


This will continue into second and third affirmative and negative arguments.

, When rebutting a team's argument, remember:


Offer evidence for your rebuttal. Do not rely on vigorous assertion alone. Show the chairperson why the other team's argument is fundamentally flawed; don't just tell.
Attack the most important parts of their argument. It's not very effective if you pick bones with an obscure part of the opponent's argument. Go for the crux of their argument and pick it apart with the ruthless efficiency of a surgeon.
For instance, if they are arguing for an increase in the military budget, but they also make a casual assertion about citizens being ungrateful for what the military does, you can dismiss the latter with a calm ""I beg to disagree"" and focus on the problems with increasing the actual budget.
No ad hominem attacks. An ad hominem attack is when you criticize another person instead of their ideas. Attack the idea, not the person.

, The more you talk, the more you'll convince the judge. Note that this means you should come up with many examples, not that you should ramble. The more the judge hears about why you are correct, the more inclined s/he will be to believe you.

, For the most part, debates are judged on three main areas: matter, manner, and method.Matter is amount and relevancy of evidence. How much evidence does the speaker marshall to support his/her claims? How strongly does the evidence used support the argument?

Manner is eye contact and engagement with audience. Don't stare at your cue cards! Speak clearly. Accentuate your arguments with volume, pitch and speed to highlight important parts. Use your body to emphasize your arguments: stand straight and gesture confidently. Avoid stammering, fidgeting, or pacing.

Method is team cohesion. How well does the entire team organize their arguments and rebuttals? How well do the individual arguments mesh together, as well as the rebuttals? How clear and consistent is the team line?

The entire debate lasts only 20 minutes., One fun way to prepare for a political future (or just interact with many other debaters) is to do a debate that simulates a real political decision making process.



Do Congressional Debate. Congressional debate is a popular NSDA format that follows the conventions of the United States legislature. Ten to twenty-five debaters participate, and an elected presiding officer runs the show. At the end, everyone votes to pass or block a resolution.
Check out British Parliamentary Debate. This format is popular in academic settings and is used worldwide. It consists of four teams of two, two of which represent proposition and two opposition. One speaker represents each team, meaning the actual debate is still two-on-two."

Gain the person's trust.",How to Convince Anyone of Anything," Make sure you understand your own viewpoint, whether it's a subjective issue like whether or not Goodfellas is better than the Godfather or whether you're trying to convince your parents to let you stay out later, or whether you're arguing about a moral issue, like capital punishment. Find out the facts first, without making any assumptions about the other person's point of view.


If you are selling something, like a car, you will need to know all there is to know about the car you are selling. Likewise, you will need to know all about the other cars that are in competition with your vehicle.;
, For certain arguments you may need to know more than just the facts. Don't waste time arguing about whether or not the Eiffel tower is pretty if you're trying to establish that it's iconic. Define your terms. Is it a moral issue? An aesthetic issue? An issue of personal rights and freedoms?


For example, if you wanted to convince somebody that the Statue of Liberty was prettier than the Eiffel Tower, you will need to know enough of about architecture and aesthetics to argue about that subject, as well as the facts, like how tall each structure is, who designed each, and what set of criteria should be used to weigh the options.

, Making a good argument is like building a table--you want the main point to be held up by supporting reasoning like a table being held up by its legs. If you don't have that supporting reasoning and evidence, your table is just a piece of wood. Just as in an essay you'd craft a thesis statement, you need to define and articulate the main point you're trying to make and assemble supporting evidence that backs it up.


If your main point is ""Modern art is boring,"" what are your reasons for this proclamation? Are you basing your argument on the motivation of the artists? The inscrutability of the work? On the lack of popularity among ""regular"" people? Come up with your reasons and your point will be stronger., You need to use memorable and striking details that will illustrate your points for you. If you want to convince someone the Beatles are the greatest band of all time, it'll be tough going if you can't remember the name of ""that one album"" you like, or if you can't listen to any of the music to provide a common reference while you're having the discussion.

, Accepting one lesser point from the other person and showing that you can change your mind, and that you have mutual agreements in the matter will open up the other person to your side of things. If you're willing to concede certain points in the discussion to win the overall argument, you have the stronger position.


The difference between discussions and arguments is that an argument has escalated past rationality and is driven by ego. One of you doesn't want to be wrong and you've decided you're going to keep pissing on the other's feet until one of you slips.

, We're drawn to confidence, and there's nothing you can do to bolster your point of view more than presenting it with conviction and the presumption of proof. No matter what you're trying to prove, if you believe it, you'll help your cause.


Being assertive doesn't mean being unwavering and aggressive. Let yourself be confident in your side of the argument, but be open to alternatives.
Cast yourself as an expert in the subject by using good examples and solid reasoning and make it easy for the other person to believe you. To convince someone that your perspective about the Beatles is valid, you're going to have to first make it seem as if you know what you're talking about when it comes to music.

, While anecdotal evidence can be considered a logical fallacy, appealing to someone's sense of empathy and pathos by telling a personal anecdote related to the topic can be quite convincing.It doesn't necessarily ""prove"" what you're saying, but it might be enough to be convincing.


If you want to convince someone that the death penalty is ""wrong,"" you're going to have to appeal to their sense of morality, an inherently emotional argument. Learn stories of wrongfully-imprisoned people on death row and tell their story in a harrowing way, emphasizing the inhumanity of the system.

, Raving like a lunatic is a poor way to convince anyone you're right. Being confident in the facts that you're presenting, in the evidence you're using to support your claims, and in the perspective you're bringing to the table will make it easy for anyone to be convinced of your points.

, The person who talks the most doesn't necessarily win an argument, or convince anyone of anything. Learning to listen courteously is the most underutilized way of constructing arguments. While it may not seem like an active way to be convincing, taking the time to learn someone else's points will allow you to convince them of alternatives. Learn to recognize their goals, beliefs, and motivations that guide their point of view.

, Maintain eye contact, use an even tone of voice, and remain calm throughout the discussion. Ask questions and practice active listening while the other person is talking. Never interrupt them in the middle of a sentence and always be courteous.


Establishing mutual respect is critical. You will never convince anybody of anything if they believe you do not respect them, so show the person you respect them and be good enough to gain their respect.

, If you know what another person wants, you are more likely to be able to give it to them. When you've identified the motivations behind their point of view, rephrase your beliefs in a way that the other person is better able to understand.


An argument about gun control may be focused on larger issues of freedom and personal responsibility. Discuss those issues instead of the particular. Ask questions of your opponent to get them to see the same gaps in thinking that you're noticing.

, Empathize and relate to their point of view, conceding points where necessary, but keeping your eye on changing their mind. If you work them into a corner of logic they can't escape from, you'll have convinced them, and they'll have accepted that it's ok to agree with you and change their mind, if you're a courteous conversationalist.

Overcome common errors.,
Learn to organize your thoughts.,
Involve the listener in the conversation.,
Practice persuasive communication.,
Ask questions.,
Use compassionate communication.",How to Communicate to Evoke Admiration," These are the some of the pitfalls to avoid and manage in order to evoke a response and admiration from listeners:


Self-consciousness. To be a good conversationalist, be a great listener. Be genuinely interested in what the other person has to say, ask the right questions (because we genuinely want to know more) and presto, people will laud you as great communicators!
It’s often your own self-consciousness that makes you tongue-tied and awkward. When you are so preoccupied with what intelligent idea to share next, you can barely concentrate on listening to and understanding the other party.
Non-empathy. The other block to good communication is non-empathy. If you are sometimes so intent on putting your ideas across, you may forget to be sensitive or empathic toward the other person. Is the person in a rush, or does he or she have other matters on his or her mind?
Lack of clarity. This comes from a lack of clarity in your thoughts as well as your verbal communication. It starts from your thoughts: are you quite clear in your mind as to what the message is that you wish to convey? From there, move on to effective choice of words. Some people may have a language problem: they may be thinking in their mother language, say Mandarin or Punjabi, and trying to express their ideas in a language they are not comfortable with, say English.;
, Before making an important presentation, list down the points you want to make in a logical sense. If language is a challenge, then write your ideas down in proper sentences and ask a friend to go through these for you. That's not to say you should read from your paper or memorize the “speech” but just writing it down and reading it a few times will help you a great deal in putting your message across.

, It should be about what he or she wants to listen rather than what you want to convey. Many people think as long as they speak fluently, they are good communicators. Not so, as those of you who have had to listen to someone go on and on about themselves, will testify. They may be such eloquent speakers, and even entertaining at times, but there’s only so much we can take in a one-way communication. Some of you have probably been in a situation where you just wish you were somewhere else after 20 minutes!

, This takes place when the person we are communicating with, understands what we want to say, feels what we are feeling and is then motivated to take action on what we have said.

, One skill that can help you move from effective to persuasive communication is that of asking questions. This is a powerful skill that once mastered, will indeed help you see immediate results in your daily communication – be it sales, presentation of ideas, talking to your friends or simply getting your child to do what you want.

, Give your full attention to the person or persons you are with. Listen carefully to what has been said. Summarize back in your own terms. Seek, most of all, to get to the heart of what the other person is saying and conveying; things left unsaid are also part of the conversation. What is the other person really trying to say? What perspective are they coming from, what about it makes you feel other or different, and how can you compassionately reconcile your two positions? Remember that everyone does it tough some of the time, and it may just be that you're dealing with someone going through things that makes it hard for them to listen well but they will appreciate your ready understanding.

Look approachable.,
Be friendly.,
Lighten the mood.,
Practice regularly.",How to Become Popular by Using Good Communication Skills1," When you are in public or at a social event, you want people to feel comfortable initiating a conversation with you. Avoid isolating yourself in the back of the room or staying on a cell phone the whole time. Instead, acknowledge the people around you by saying ‘hello’ or smiling when they notice you. You should also make an effort to keep your arms and legs uncrossed, as crossing them makes you look protective and unapproachable., Simply being polite is not the same as socializing. You need to actively move the conversation forward. Engage others beyond just saying ‘hi’ or introducing yourself. Ask them questions about themselves and answer any questions they have about you.For example, if you meet someone at a social event and exchange introductions, you could follow that introduction with a question like “So, what brings you here tonight?”

, When you are nervous, it is likely that the other person (or people) that you are talking to are just as nervous. You can ease the tension by using some light humor, or even pointing out that it’s uncomfortable. If you do tell a joke, make sure that it is a friendly, non-offensive joke.For example, jokes that single out or make fun of a particular group of people or ideas is likely to offend someone around you.

, The best way to get good at socializing is to practice. Start with close friends and family, and then slowly move outside your comfort zone. The more time you spend socializing with other people, the more confident you will become in your ability to do it well.For example, start by socializing with your friends at school. Then, move to having a conversation with someone in the cafeteria that you don’t know that well. Finally, you could move to having a conversation with a stranger at something like a school basketball game.

Talk about the good old days.",How to Communicate With a Person With Dementia1," If your loved one seems confused about your identity, give your name and explain how you are related.

For example, “I’m Annie, your granddaughter. Your daughter Sue is my mom,” is better than just “I’m Annie.”;
, Speak slowly and clearly. Use simple words and short sentences. Break long actions into smaller steps.Saying “We’re going to the grocery store to pick up a few things, then we’re going to the park across the street from the school, then we’ll see a movie at the mall” might be confusing. You might change it to “First we are going to the grocery store.” Give them a moment to process before proceeding. “Then we will go to the park.” Pause again. “Then we’ll go to the movie theater and see a movie.”

, Give the person some time to respond to questions. It takes dementia patients longer to process you are saying., Word retrieval (finding the right word to identify or describe) can be difficult for people with dementia. They may not be able to find the right word or understand what your word means. Encourage them to use gestures to describe what they are trying to say, and you can do the same.If your loved one is not understanding what you mean when you say “Wash your hands,” you can pantomime rubbing your hands together, or even take go into the bathroom and demonstrate.

, Not only does it increase everyone’s stress level, but people with dementia often genuinely feel confused. They may not remember asking the same question ten times, and they may not know where they put their medication. Remember, it is the disease, not the person, causing this behavior.

Going along with their stories, even if you know they are false, can help keep the peace. Do not feel like you need to correct them.If you find yourself getting frustrated and ready to argue, take a break. Give yourself a timeout.

, Be respectful.Give as much independence as possible. Let them make the decisions they are capable of making.

Depending on the intensity of the dementia, your loved one may not be capable of making many decisions, but be sure to give the opportunity as often as you can. Even small choices like, “Which shirt do you want to wear today? The blue one or the white one?” can help improve quality of life.

, Losing one’s train of thought is common with dementia patients. They may forget what they were talking about mid-sentence.Pay attention to what is being said and help the person get back on track, and do not make a big deal out of it. Say in a lighthearted tone of voice, “Oh, you were just telling me about the dog you had growing up! Can you tell me more?”

, Take the person’s hand, give them a hug or kiss if you (and they) are comfortable. Physical touch has been shown to have many positive benefits for people with dementia., Find a photo album of old pictures to share. This can help jog memories and start good conversations. You can learn more about your loved one’s life and family history, too."

The most important thing is to believe that you are responsible for yourself.,
Express your emotions clearly.",How to Communicate in an Assertive Manner," Avoid using You, as this stops you from allowing control of the listener. Using omniscience removes control of the speaker, you, because ""You"" is only used to express indecisiveness.;
, You should be staring at your listeners' eyes when speaking. Averting your eyes constantly or having no eye contact altogether will show timidness or discomfort.


Eye contact should not be a 'staring contest'. Breaking eye contact during unimportant parts during a conversation presents a natural environment with you and your listener. Staring without natural break in the eye contact may be interpreted as hostility.

, Think of yourself stretching from your head to your toes, sitting or standing. Pay attention to the neck, shoulder and upper back regions. Keep your back upright and your shoulder pushed back naturally. You should not be tense, but you should be mindful of your body and its composure.

, Make gestures that give a sense of warmth and openness on your behalf—open palms, circular arm movements, smiles, wrinkles of the nose, hugs, etc.

, Explain yourself thoroughly and try not to create obscure responses.

, Learn to be comfortable with silence and use pauses. This is also useful for public speaking.


If you tend to say Umm, You know, Like, Yeah, or elongate the last word preceding an unintended pause, practise using pauses instead of muttering. People who subconsciously say auxiliaries tend to dislike silence.
Speak clearly. Mumbling, muttering, and circular sentences do nothing to further communication.

, Do not swear or talk rudely. Obscenities do not show assertiveness—it shows crude behaviour and irresponsibility of your understanding.


This method of understanding propriety is called savoir-faire.
Be careful about the tone of your voice. Keep it moderated.

, This deep breathing will calm you in as little as four to five breaths.

, If you are too soft, the other person will think you are trying to hide yourself and may ignore you. If you are too loud, the other person may become scared or intimidated by your voice. The person you are speaking to may even get annoyed and retaliate, or interpret hostility, which is more aggressive than assertive.

, No one else is responsible for your behaviour and your personality.

, Focus on how you feel.

, Do you want your catch-phrase to be simple, or complex? Is it to be a silly word, or a sarcastic remark? Will you say it often or use it sparingly? Decide these, and other details, now.

, Now that the purpose and details are outlined, find a paper, pen, and write down any ideas you get. Don't worry about the quality yet - just organize your ideas.

, After you have enough catch-phrase candidates, start to work on an elimination process. Is this catch-phrase potentially offensive? Does this catch-phrase sound good, but is unlike my first intentions? Choose the good ones, and eliminate the rest.

, Now that you have a catch-phrase (or possibly more), try to say it for a few days to different people and observe the results. Do you feel comfortable saying it? Do you get the responses you expect? If not, try another candidate from your list.

, When you finally have that special saying of yours, don't change from one to another every other day! It takes time for people to recognize it as your catch-phrase, and it takes even more time for them to appreciate it. Just say it every now and then, if it is appropriate to do so.

If you are speaking to a crowd, try looking to their foreheads if direct eye contact makes you uncomfortable., Back straight, head up but relaxed is a good way to show confidence. If you feel better, you will communicate with more confidence., These telegraph your nervousness. Constantly adjusting your clothes, for instance, is distracting to a listener or someone speaking directly to you. Relax and listen to what the other person is saying., Often when people speak, their sentences are peppered with filler words like ""um,"" ""like,"" ""I mean,"" ""you know,"" and so on. This can be out of habit, or a way for the person to buy time as they think of what they are going to say. No matter the reason, this can make you come off a hesitant and unsure. Instead of saying ""Umm..."" next time you need a second to collect your thoughts, just allow yourself to be silent for a moment.


It may feel awkward at first, but you'll appear more like you're carefully choosing your words than panicking because you don't know what to say.

, A confident smile (even if you might not feel it inside) will project confidence to those around you. The added benefit is that it will make you start to feel better and less nervous as well.

, This shows your own confidence. Even if you don’t feel assertive, eye contact can be a great way to also gauge how your conversation is going. Project confidence, and you will start to feel it.

, Be clear about what you are asking the other person. Whether it’s your spouse or your boss, sometimes we just don’t tell them exactly what we are thinking. To be more assertive, tell people in a polite yet honest way what you need from them.For example, you may say, ""I know it’s convenient for me to be available over email during weekends, but I can’t do that any more. I need time with my family. I hope you understand that I need to focus on them during those days.""
You may also say, ""I’m feeling overwhelmed by cooking dinner every night after coming home from work. Could you choose two nights that you would be willing to take over dinner every week?""
Another example dialogue might be, ""I’m really sorry, but I won’t be able to volunteer at school this year. I got a new position at work and am working much longer hours.""

, It’s terrible to feel attacked in conversation, but there are steps you can take to turn the tables. You should be assertive without being aggressive and try to move the conversation into a more productive area. Try using “I” statements to help become more assertive.For example, you may say, ""I disagree that this is a bad idea,"" ""I feel you’re being too negative about this,"" or ""I believe this can work.""

, This technique helps to defuse negative and aggressive conversations. You turn part of the criticism back onto yourself (essentially agreeing with some of the other person’s characterization of you) and show concern for them.For example, your coworker may say, ""You missed the project meeting and don’t have any way to make it up. I am seriously considering moving you back to the packing department.”
You may then respond by saying, “I realize I missed the meeting because of poor time management on my part. I knew you would be upset.”

, Sometimes, a situation might call for constant repetition of your problem. This often seems to be the case when dealing with customer service, either on the phone or in person. The broken record technique can help you keep the conversation focused the way you want it to be.For example, a customer may say to you, “This fan worked for one day and broke. I need a replacement.”
You may then respond, “I’m so sorry, but our sales are final,"" or “Once an item leaves the store, we can’t guarantee how you’ll use it so we can’t get you a new one.""
If the customer continues to get upset, you may calmly say, “Let me get the manager to explain it to you.”

, If someone is trying to get you to do something you don’t want to do, stand up for yourself.For example, you may say, ""Thanks, but I don’t want to go have a drink with you,"" ""Thanks for telling me, but I still don’t agree with you,"" or ""Thanks, but I just don’t think that I am comfortable with that.""

, Make the points you want to convey strongly and without going off on tangents. Start with your main point -- don’t bury it. Use carefully chosen words to make your point., Make strong points. Avoid words like “could” or “perhaps.” Use strong declarative sentences -- these show confidence in yourself and your ideas.

, Make sure that the vocabulary you use is appropriate for the people who will be listening or reading your work. Don’t use complicated words for elementary school students, and don’t shy away from complexity for college students, for example.

, Don’t assume everyone will know what you’re talking about if you use the vocabulary of a particular subject or job. If you’re using such vocabulary, explain it the first time for your audience so they can understand.

, Some people are very comfortable speaking without any guide in front of them, but that often takes a lot of practice. To communicate with confidence, you need to feel comfortable with your material, and that often requires thought beforehand. Write down what you’re going to say.

, Before you get in front of an audience, say your remarks to yourself. Once you’ve read through them and are comfortable, do it for a family member or friend. Ask for help conveying confidence, and any other suggestions they might have to make your presentation better., Decide if you want to have the full text in front of you, or if you’d rather use notecards to make your presentation. Some people might even want to memorize their remarks, but this takes a great deal of practice (and the foreknowledge that you won’t freeze up and forget it in front of people). It’s probably best to not go up without any papers or cards -- you need something that can help you get back on track if you’re nervous.

, If you’re writing a paper, show your knowledge of the relevant information and then how your work fits into it. Mention the authors that you’ve been working from to acknowledge their contribution, and that you’re building on what they have done.

, After you have made your point, write clearly about the evidence that backs it up. Explain why you are confident in the evidence you have found -- you might want to detail how you did your research.

, Part of communicating with confidence is giving credit where credit is due. If your ideas and evidence are from another person’s work, make sure to cite them."

This will show that you are confident and approachable.Being confident will show people that you like yourself. This makes them feel like they can trust you and that they will like you, too.

, Another clear sign of confidence is the ability to maintain eye contact with another person. When you are speaking or listening to someone, look them in the eye. Avoid distractions like cell phones or other people walking by. If you are speaking to multiple people, make sure to make eye contact with each person.For example, if you ask your teacher a question, make eye contact with them.
If you are speaking in front of your class, make eye contact with each person before you are finished speaking.

, To speak in a confident way, you will need to speak loud enough for anyone listening to hear you. A conversational tone is perfect if you are speaking to one person across the table, but if you are speaking to a crowd you will need to project your voice. Use concise sentences to get straight to your point and avoid filler words like “Um” and “Uh.”An example of a concise sentence would be “I think that everyone should ski at least once.” Something like “Well, skiing is fun, but I don’t know if people really know that,” is not concise.

, To be confident, you need to feel comfortable in your own skin. Practice good hygiene habits such as regular bathing and brushing your teeth. Be sure that you dress appropriately for the occasion, as well. Being over or underdressed can cause you to feel uncomfortable around others.For example, you wouldn’t wear a suit and tie to a Superbowl party with friends (usually). You also wouldn’t wear a T-shirt to a wedding (usually).

Listen to other people.,
Offer help.,
Ask for help.,
Avoid spontaneous reactions.",How to Become Popular by Using Good Communication Skills3," When someone else is talking, you should be paying close attention. Focus on what they are saying and the meaning behind their words instead of thinking about what you want to say next. Maintain eye contact with the person, and give subtle gestures like leaning forward or raising your eyebrows to show that you are interested.This is known as active listening. A key component is to listen more than you talk.

, One good way to make connections with people is to help them. Making yourself available to someone else is a great way to bond with someone you don’t know. This is crucial to being popular, since you will need to expand your circle of friends quite a bit to reach such an elevated social status.For example, you could offer to help a new friend clean up after their birthday party.
You could also offer to help someone study or let them see your notes from a class.

, In addition to helping other people, you can bond by letting them help you. Avoid being needy or pushy, but ask someone you’ve met recently to help you with a small task. They will feel valued and appreciated by the request.For example, you could ask a new acquaintance to help you move your desk around the room.
Avoid asking for money. This can make people question your intentions.

, Connecting with other people requires thoughtful, considerate communication. This means that you should really think about what you are going to say to the other person, especially if you are upset for some reason. A spontaneous reaction to a comment or action by the other person could make them upset with you. It could also make other people feel like you are too quick to fly off the handle.For example, if someone says something you find insulting, you should not immediately start screaming at them. Instead, take a deep breath and explain to them calmly why their comment was inappropriate. You might say something like “I think that you should consider how something like that might make other people feel. I was very uncomfortable with what you said.”

"
"
Deal with repetitive questions.,
Cope with anxiety and delusions.,
Be prepared for frequent phone calls.",How to Communicate With a Person With Dementia2," People with dementia often don't remember what happened to them just a few minutes ago. Their short-term memory loss means they do not remember having asked the question in the first place.

Try changing the subject to make them stop asking the question. For example, you might say something like, ""Do you remember how we went to the choir concert? Did you like the concert?""You will often find that their long-term memories are still quite good, so changing the subject to a well-remembered past event may work to end the line of questioning. You might ask, for example, “Where were you the day Kennedy was shot?”

, Your loved one may believe people are “out to get” him/her, believe someone is stealing from them, or other beliefs that create suspicion. This is common with Alzheimer’s and dementia.Believing they have been robbed is a common delusion. Provide reassurance that they and their possessions are safe, perhaps taking a few minutes to help locate the “stolen” object.
Consider having your loved one seen by a primary care physician or a psychiatrist to find a medication that will alleviate anxiety.

, If your loved one has been placed in an assisted living facility or nursing home, you may receive calls at all hours of the day and night, possibly one after the other. This can be extremely draining and require some management.


Don't pick up the phone every single time. Consider putting your phone on silent at night.
Listen to your loved one’s concerns and give assurance that you will help take care of the problem.
If it is not an emergency, you do not need to drop everything to attend to the person all the time. Speak to the nurse at the nursing home if you are concerned there is a real problem that needs to be addressed.

"
"
Look for a support group.,
Find respite care.,
Talk to your family.,
Talk to your loved one’s care team.",How to Communicate With a Person With Dementia3," Look for a support group for caregivers of those with Alzheimer’s and/or dementia. You can contact your local senior services agency for suggestions, or try searching for one through the Alzheimer’s Association: http://www.alz.org/apps/we_can_help/support_groups.asp

These groups can give you suggestions for ways to communicate with your loved one, as well as offer you comfort and reassurance. They are a great way to avoid feeling isolated, as many caregivers frequently do.

, If you are your loved one’s primary caregiver, you will need a break now and then. Taking care of a person with dementia can be exhausting and all-encompassing, and you need to take care of yourself in order to effectively care for your loved one.Here are some options:

In-home care. You can have someone stay with your loved one at home while you get out of the house for a while.
Senior day center. You can drop your loved one off (or, in some cases, have them picked up) for a few hours of activities and socializing.
Residential facility. This can be an option if you need to have your loved one taken care of overnight, or for a few days if you need to go out of town.

, Other family members involved in your loved one’s care can be an invaluable support. You can talk to them about the highs and lows of day-to-day care, suggest caregiving strategies, and blow off some steam., The doctor, social worker, or nursing home staff may have suggestions in effective communication methods. Opening the lines of communication with others involved can only help improve the care they receive, because you will be a helpful source of information for these professionals as well!"

Think before you speak.,
Deflect negative comments.,
Start with a positive comment before giving negative feedback.,
Choose your words carefully.,

Decline invitations politely.,
Don't reveal too much personal information to people you don't know very well.,
Make sure your body language reflects your words.,

Consider cultural differences and try to act in a sensitive way without being asked.,
Be discreet.,
Be gracious even when you're irritated.,
Have empathy for others.,
Be an active listener.,
Be respectful.",How to Be Tactful," Allow yourself a pause to consider how your words could be perceived, and to prevent yourself from making hasty comments. You may have an immediate gut reaction to something your boss or friend is saying, but take a moment to gather your thoughts before you come right out and say what you want to say. Ask yourself if it's the best time to present your ideas, if you should spend some time finding a better way to say what you want to say, and if people will be receptive to your comments right then.


Though speaking with your gut can lead to a lot of interesting ideas, it can also help to take a few minutes to formulate your thoughts first. If you instantly disagree with something your boss says, for example, you're better off thinking of concrete examples for why you disagree instead of just blurting out that you think it's a bad idea.
Notice the people around you. You may want to make a comment about how excited you are for your wedding, when one of the people there is going through a bitter divorce. Though you don't have to hide your enthusiasm forever, you may be better off finding a better time to make your comment.;
, If people are making negative comments around you, you should avoid getting wrapped up in them if you want to be tactful. This is especially true if you're in the workplace and don't want to be part of the office politics. There are several ways in which you can deflect negative comments and take the high road in testy situations. Here are some ways to do it:


Gently correct gossip. Example: ""I'm sorry you heard that about Jane Doe. When I spoke to her, she said that it was just a rumor about her getting fired.""
Say something non-committal. Example: ""I've never met John Doe, so I wouldn't have a clue about his drinking habits.""
Say something positive. ""Mary Sue may be late a lot, but she does really good work."" Or, ""Bill Jones has always been civil to me personally.""
Change the subject. ""You know, your comment about the boss reminds me of something. There's an office party coming up, right? Are you bringing anyone?""
Remove yourself from the situation. If people keep being negative and the situation isn't letting up, then you can excuse yourself and say you need to get back to class or work. You should make it seem unrelated to the conversation at hand.
Ask the person nicely to stop. Say ""I'm really not interested in gossiping about our neighbor,"" or ""I'd prefer not talk about that in the office.""

, If you have to give negative feedback to someone, whether it's a coworker or your best friend, you should couch it in a way that makes the person the most receptive. This doesn't mean you should lie to the person if things aren't going well, but that you should start off with something positive so the person sees that you care about him or her. Here are some ways to do it:


If you want to give negative feedback to a friend, you can say something like, ""I think it's so sweet of you to always want to set me up with the single guys you know. But when you try to do it every time we go out, it kind of makes me feel pathetic.""
If you want to give negative feedback to a co-worker, you can say something like, ""I really appreciate how hard you've been working on the new project. However, I think the project can be even better if you let Mary help you out a bit more.""

, When it comes to being tactful, one of the most important things to keep in mind is that you should be aware of the words you use to express your ideas. You can still say what you want to say without offending people or coming off mean or like a know-it-all. When you're getting ready to state an opinion, ask yourself if the words you're using are biased, hurtful, patronizing, or just all wrong for the occasion. Then, find the words that will help further your ideas without offending anyone.


For example, if you want to talk to a coworker about how she needs to get her work done faster, don't tell her she's ""slow""; instead, ask her if she can think of ways to be ""more efficient.""
For example, if you're telling your boss you're leaving your job, you don't have to say something like, ""I am just way too smart for these people""; instead, you can say something like, ""This company isn't the best fit for me.""

, When it comes to being tactful, having great timing is half the battle. You may have something perfectly nice to say, which can ruin a social situation if you say it at the wrong time, and can lead to hurt feelings without you meaning to do any harm. Before you make a comment, ask yourself if this is the best time to make the comment, and if everyone there will be receptive to it. Ask yourself if it would be better to wait to get a more positive response, even if you're dying to say what you want to say.


For example, if your friend Linda is excited to tell all of her friends about her recent engagement, then you may have to hold off the news that you're pregnant for another week, so Linda can enjoy the spotlight for a bit longer. You don't want her to feel like you trumped her big day.
For example, if your boss is wrapping up a long presentation at the end of the work day, this may not be the best time to ask your question about an unrelated report. Asking the question now will only lead to confusion and your boss will be focused on the presentation and won't have the energy to address your concerns; if you wait until the next day, your boss will be happier to discuss the issue with you.

, If someone asks you to do something, you should find a way to politely decline it, even if your gut is screaming, ""Heck no!"" Whether you're being asked to attend the baby shower of a person you barely know or to stay late at work on a Friday night, instead of immediately saying no and looking angry or upset about it, you should take the time to say how much you would like to do it and then give a brief explanation or apology about not being able to do it. This will still get the same message across, but you won't offend anyone in the process.


For example, if your boss asks you to take on another project and you just don't have any more time on your hands, you can say something like, ""Thank you so much for thinking of me for this opportunity. Unfortunately, I'm still wrapping up those two other projects you asked me about and I won't be able to take on the extra work. But I would love to help out on something similar in the future.""
For example, if your friend invites you to go hiking but hiking isn't really your thing, you can say something like, ""Your weekend trip to the Redwood forest sounds amazing, but I'm going to take it easy this weekend — I've had a crazy week at work and need to decompress. How about we catch up over drinks next Friday?""

, Another thing that people who lack tact tend to do is to go about announcing their business to every person on the street. If you want to have tact, then you can't go around telling anyone within earshot about your latest breakup, your new rash, or all of your personal problems. Telling people you don't know well all your business will only make them uncomfortable and won't lead to any new friendships; have tact and be aware of when people would like to hear more and when enough is enough.


This also goes for revealing personal information about other people. If you're with a close friend and a few less-than-close friends, don't pick up on a private conversation you had with that friend in front of the other people; your friend might have been happy to talk about his complicated relationship with his mother with you, but he may not want the world to know about it.

, It's great if your words are sending a friendly and polite message, but if your body is telling people something different, then they'll quickly get a different picture. If you're telling someone something important in a delicate way, then you should make eye contact, face the person, and not hunch over or look at the floor. Give the person your attention and show that you actually care. It'll be hard for them to take you seriously if you're telling the person that he or she is doing great at work while you're looking in the other direction.


Actions really can speak louder than words, so make sure that your body isn't sending a different message from your mouth.

, Another part of having tact is being able to understand where another person is coming from. Though voicing your own ideas is important, it's also important to understand that another person may not see things the way you see them. If you let the person know that you understand where he or she is coming from, they'll be much more likely to listen to you and to take your ideas seriously.


For example, saying something like, ""Mary, I understand that you've had a lot on your plate recently..."" can make it easier for you to ask Mary to help out with another project. If you just say, ""Hey, can you stay late to finish up a new report for me?"" then Mary is likely to think you're insensitive.

, There are many cultural differences that should be acknowledged in our world, which are based on where people are from, how they were raised, what their race and backgrounds may be, or even what generation they are coming from. What may be perfectly acceptable in one culture can be considered rude in another, so ask yourself if you're being sensitive to the different cultures around you before you make a comment.

, You may find that you need to correct something a co-worker said during a presentation, or that one of your friends has a giant chunk of spinach in his teeth. Instead of pointing this out in front of everyone, you should try to pull the person aside to let them know about the situation. Showing discretion is a big part of having tact, because it will help you know what should be said under what circumstances. It's an important skill you should have in the professional and the social world.


For example, if you and your partner got a raise but no one else in the company did, it's best not to brag about it in front of everyone. You can have a private celebration later.

, Keep your cool and speak kindly and sincerely. Assume the best. Though you may be dying to tell your friend what you really think of her behavior, or you really want to yell at your co-worker for ruining a project, you should hold your tongue and be as kind as possible until you find a time to state your true feelings. There's no point in saying something you'll regret just because you're irked in the moment.


For example, if someone gives you an ugly sweater, say: ""Thanks so much for the present. I'm touched you thought of me.""

, Look around you before you make a comment and see how the other people there will receive it. It's important to know where people are coming from before you blurt out your political, religious, or other personal opinions. Though you can't completely know where every person is coming from when you speak, it's important to have a sense of the mindset and experiences of the people around you so you can avoid offending people.


For example, if you just got a raise and Bob got fired, this may not be the time to brag about it.
If one of the people around you is a devout Christian, then it's not the time to talk about how you think religion is pointless.
If someone around you is exhausted after a long day, don't expect the person to help you resolve a huge emotional conflict. Have patience.

, Being an active listener is a crucial component of being tactful. There's a difference between what someone is saying to you and what that person is really thinking, so you should really look and hear the person out to get the real message. If your friend is telling you that she's over her break up and totally ready to go to a party with you, but her eyes and gestures are telling you otherwise, then find a way to kindly tell her that it's okay if she's not ready to go out.


Paying attention to how people are really feeling as they're speaking can help you respond to them in the most tactful way possible. For example, if your co-worker is really struggling with a project but is afraid to ask for help, listen for cues, such as nervousness, stuttering, or repetitive speech to see if he or she is trying to reach out to you.
Actively listening can also help you see if a person has shut down and doesn't want to hear any more about a subject. If you're giving feedback to a coworker who is already upset by it, you can tell by his or her words that he may not be ready to hear more; you should gracefully end the conversation and pick it up later.

, Being respectful goes hand in hand with being tactful. If you want to have true tact, then you have to treat other people with respect. This means letting them finish talking instead of interrupting them, giving them your full attention when they are trying to tell you something, and asking people how they are doing before jumping in to deliver some bad news. Treat each and every individual with care and kindness and understand that it's important to make people feel that they are treated fairly, even if they may not be your favorite people on the planet.


Being respectful is a matter of common decency. Don't curse in front of your elders; don't use lewd language in front of people you don't know well. This will come off as very tasteless, and therefore lacking tact.

Train your mind.",How to Be Observant," Part of being more observant is being aware of what your body is telling you. This can’t always be described in a logical fashion – it just means listening to your gut. Do you feel like you’ve walked into an awkward situation but you don’t know why? Do you suddenly feel danger when you’re on your way to your car? Chances are, your instincts are right, and you should listen to what you feel internally, even if you can’t quite explain why.


Many people aren’t observant because they ignore anything that they can’t clearly see or prove. You may have a sense that you are in danger – don’t ignore it just because you can’t see the bad guy.;
, Another part of being observant is being able to know yourself and to be aware of who you are, how you act, and how you come off. This doesn’t mean that you should obsess over yourself, but it does mean that you should have a sense of the kind of energy you give off; do people see you as shy, outgoing, friendly, or mysterious? Knowing yourself first will help you observe others and have a better sense of what’s going on in the world.

, This is something that you’ll have to do to shift your focus outward. A lot of people aren’t observant because they’re so self-conscious that they’re busy worrying about how they look or project themselves in every possible interaction. If you’re always thinking about your own every move, then how will you be able to really notice something about your friends, teachers, or colleagues? It’s important to be self-aware, but if you cross the line over to being self-obsessed, then you’ll miss off on many key observations.


Check yourself the next time you talk to a new friend. Are you worrying about what to say or do next the whole time, or are you too busy listening to what the friend has to say to really care about yourself?

, Though you shouldn’t ask yourself so many questions that you’re not living in the moment, you should keep your mind active when you’re observing something so you have the best sense of what’s going on. Ask yourself, how is this person really feeling? What is the difference between what he is saying and what he is really feeling? How many people in this room are in a good mood? How many people are wearing black? Keep your mind busy and keep prodding yourself to discover what’s really happening in a situation.


As you practice your observational skills, you’ll be able to keep questioning the situation while paying complete attention. At first, switching to this inquisitive mode of thinking can be a little bit distracting.

, The reason that most people aren’t observant these days is because of the infinite amount of distractions all around us. If you're in a social setting, don't play around with your iPod. If you're studying for a test, put away your magazines. Put away anything that's keeping you from focusing and noticing whatever is in front of you.

, Spending all of your time on your cell phone is the easiest way to be completely unobservant, to annoy the people around you, and to have absolutely no idea what’s going on. What’s more, if you’re texting while walking, riding a bus, or generally hanging out in public, you’ll be much more likely to get your stuff stolen or to walk right in to a dangerous situation because you had absolutely no clue about what was actually happening.


If you’re having a real conversation with a friend, put the phone away and stop having a text conversation with a different friend. If you really want to observe what’s going on, then you should just focus on one conversation at a time.

, Being a good listener is different than just being a listener. When a person is talking to you, pay attention to that person’s words, emotions, body language, and gestures to get the full picture. Don’t interrupt the person or just wait for him to stop talking so you can start sharing your own opinions. Nod when it’s necessary, make comments when the conversation asks for it, but don’t say, “that’s so true” every two seconds or the person will get distracted.


If a person is telling you about a problem he or she is experiencing, don’t jump in and offer advice right away. Sometimes, the person may just want to talk – and may just want you to be there to listen.
Pay attention to the details a person reveals about his life so you can refer back to them in the next conversation. If you see a casual friend who says he’s going up to Tahoe to ski for the weekend, the next time you see him, ask about his big trip.

, Being observant means more than just listening to the words a person says – it means checking out how a person looks and acts for insight into how he is really feeling. Your friend may be telling you that she’s getting over her break-up just fine, but her eyes may be red and puffy; your boyfriend may tell you that he’s not so stressed out at work, but he can come home with his nails bitten down to the quick. People may say one thing and feel another, so pay attention to their appearance for more insight into what’s really happening.


Let’s say your boss came in with bags under his eyes on the day you wanted to ask for a raise. If he’s acting and looking worse than usual, then you may want to wait until the next day, when he’s back to being his usual self. Being observant here can help you benefit yourself.

, It’s hard to say exactly how to categorize a person’s moods, but be on the lookout for changes of behavior to see how your friends or acquaintances are really feeling. To see if there’s a change in a person’s mood, you have to recognize the norm first. If your friend is usually grumpy in the morning, then it means nothing if she’s grumpy when you see her before school; but if she’s a morning person and looks groggy and like she hasn’t slept, then something bad might have happened to her.


A mood is like an aura that surrounds a person; be observant to feel out the “vibe” you get. A person can be upset, excited, nervous, angry, bitter, confused, frustrated, elated, or disappointed without saying a word about it.

, Engage all of your five senses when you're in a conversation with someone, or even just when you're observing others. This is the ultimate way to be fully observant. Here are some things that you can do:


Use your eyes to observe and scan your surroundings and people's behavior wherever you are.
Use ears to pay attention to all the different voices. You should be able to distinguish voices from a lot of noise.
Use touch to know the mood of people. For example, if someone shakes hands with you and you find the person's hands sweaty, then the person may be nervous.
Use your nose to detect any smell that is out of the ordinary, like a sudden change in aroma of the area.

, What a person tells you is just as important as what he or she doesn’t say, so pay attention for what’s absent as well as what’s present. For example, if your friend is always gushing about how amazing her boyfriend is, and suddenly, he doesn’t come up at all in the course of a long conversation, then maybe something is up. If your mother has been really excited about a big promotion at work, and then she comes home and only wants to talk about your schoolwork, then maybe things didn’t work out.


Often, people don’t want to mention the disappointments in their lives – or the things that they want to keep private. Be observant to see what’s missing in a conversation.

, Body language can be another strong indicator of what a person is really thinking and feeling. If a person is standing up straight, looking straight ahead or like he’s ready for the next big thing, then chances are, he’s in a good mood and ready for success. If someone is slouching, hunched over, fidgeting with his hands or looking at the floor, then maybe things didn’t go so well for that person today.


But of course, if that’s how the person always looks, then the body language may not mean as much – but if you notice something out of the ordinary, then it may indicate a change in mood or emotion.

, Don't just pay attention to people. Notice how many cars are in the parking lot along with yours. Notice what kind of birds are flying around the beach that day. See which fruits are being sold in the grocery stores, and notice whether the prices have gone up or down since the last time. Keep your eyes and ears open at all times, and look for anything out of the ordinary, even if you're just walking down the street.


You can practice noticing your surroundings when you're on your own, and then become more aware of your surroundings when you're talking to people.

, Painting classes will greatly improve your observational skills because you will have to paint whatever you see in front of you, whether it’s a beautiful landscape or a bowl of fruit. You’ll have to understand lighting, proportion, and other key elements that will help you see what is really in front of you and to analyze it as well. You don’t have to be naturally gifted to take a painting class. Even if you don’t come out a stellar artist, your observational skills will reap the benefits.

, Situate yourself in a coffee shop or a park, get your latte, and watch what people are doing. Pay attention to body language, moods, conversations, and actions. You can look at them in general, or you can look out for specific things – unhappy couples, career-oriented women, best friends, people who are nervous, etc. This will help you hone your observational skills and get used to observing people from a distance.


Just make sure you don’t look like a creeper. Don’t watch children on a playground or do anything that would arouse suspicion. Try to be discreet by bringing a book or something to do while you watch.

, Puzzles help you pay attention to all of the little details and to see that every little piece is slightly different and can only fit into one place. Spending time alone working on a puzzle can sharpen your mind and memory and it can also help you notice the beauty in the details of many different objects. On a larger level, this can help you see that while many people around you are similar, no two people are alike, and that the differences are worth noticing.

, Meditating helps build awareness of your mind and body and will help you develop your observational skills in the process. Take the time to sit down for 10-15 minutes every morning and/or evening, make sure you’re comfortable in a quiet room, and listen to the breath rising and falling out of your body. Focus on relaxing one body part at a time until you find yourself in a state of real relaxation, and are able to notice all of the little things around you while keeping your eyes closed.

, Yoga builds awareness, and therefore, observational skills. Doing yoga makes you quiet your mind, focus on the moment, and be aware of what your body is doing and feeling at every possible moment. Practicing yoga just a few nights a week will make you a more calm, aware, and reasonable person. Being more in control of your mind and body will make you more observational because you will be able to get rid of distractions more easily.


Doing yoga, like meditating, takes practice. Don’t be frustrated if you don’t get in the zone right away.

, If you know a little bit of a foreign language, or even if you’ve taken the language for a year or two, try watching a film in that language without turning on the subtitles. Sure, some of the plot will be lost to you, but try to watch the characters and to read their body language, moods, as well as the situations they find themselves in to pick up on the context and try to figure out what’s going on.


If you really want to see how well you did, watch the film again with subtitles and see how many things you got right.
This will help you focus on more than just the words in any given situation.

, Taking notes isn’t just for class. You can take notes anywhere you go to help improve your powers of observation. If you are taking notes in class, have a separate sheet where you write down the stuff you don’t have to know for your exams – note what people are wearing, what the teacher’s mood is that day, if there are any birds near the window, or what the general mood in the room is. If you’re at a cafe, take notes on what other people are reading, eating, or discussing.


You can be sneaky about it. You don’t have to stare at people and furiously jot things down in a small notepad. Write in a larger notebook and keep a textbook or novel handy so people think you are taking notes on the reading material.

, Taking a dance class will improve your powers of observation because you will have to watch how the teacher’s body is moving and mimic those movements with your own body. This won’t be easy, and you’ll have to put your mind to work as well as your body. You’ll have to isolate the movements and see how they all come together to understand what’s really going on. Mimicking any process will improve your own observational skills, even though it won’t be easy to get the moves right on the first try.

, Do logic puzzles. Play “Where’s Waldo?” Play the game where you have to look at two nearly-identical pictures and figure out what’s different about them. Start an account on Lumosity.com and improve your brain power. Make the effort to keep your senses sharp, to notice new things, and to always question whether or not there is a better way to do something.


Putting in just 15 minutes a day into doing some mental math can help you become more observant – and more committed to continuing to improve your powers of observation.

Unplug from technology.,
Write your thoughts in journal.If the people around you seem increasingly disinterested in what you have to say, write it down in a journal.,
Meditate for self awareness.Meditation doesn’t have to be an intense yogi experience where you sit in absolute silence with your back against the wall as you ""om"".,
Be an observer of your surroundings.,
Be aware of the differences between listening and hearing.,
Know that listening is all about the other person.When you quiet your talking and place less focus on bringing attention to yourself, you free your focus up to the person you’re talking to and for better listening.,
Observe body language and tones.Picking up changes in baseline behavior like a person’s voice, face, or body language is something good listeners are great at doing.,
Practice being accepting and non-judgmental.,
Check yourself on whether or not things should be left unsaid.,
Show your willingness to listen.When the other person hints that they want to talk, do something to show that they have your full, undivided attention.,
Think before you respond.,
Refrain from interrupting people when they talk.,
Talk when it is appropriate.",How to Be Less Talkative," A lot of times, the need to talk is a reaction from being so overly stimulated by things you find on Twitter, a viral video on YouTube, a snap from Snapchat, etc. Spend some time away from those distractions and reconnect with yourself.


Find joy in by unplugging and replace mindless distraction with something constructive like arts and crafts projects. Use your hands and draw something.Practice the art of not having a reaction to any and everything that is brought to your attention. Harness that energy and focus it on cutting and pasting things with your hands from scratch.;
, Learn to express yourself while maintaining self restraint in how you impose your thoughts on others.


If you’re having trouble trying to find where to begin, keep in mind that journaling meant to be a free flow of thoughts – whatever that is to you. It doesn’t have to make sense or have a rhyme or reason, etc. Google journaling prompts online to help act as a starting point if need be.
Journal in the traditional way with a paper and pen or write your thoughts in an empty document on your PC.

, Take five to ten minutes out of your day to use meditation as a tool to become more aware of your thoughts and appreciative the art of being quiet.


If being in absolute silence intimidates you, meditate in other ways and in other areas. Meditate in the shower and center yourself in your thoughts there or allow music to act as soundtrack in those moments.
The more you practice, the more at ease with yourself you will become and you will start to realize that you don’t have to beg people to notice you through talking. You will realize your power is in your presence and the overcompensation will lessen dramatically.

, Often the key to being quiet in an organic way is to insert yourself in situations that demand your attention in a healthy way. The best way to accomplish this is to be one with the things that surround you everyday.


Take ten to fifteen minutes of your day to go outside and admire the way the sun feels on your skin or the breeze through your hair.Admire the clouds in the sky, their shapes and sizes.
Take a walk down a busy street and pay attention to all of the sights and sounds as they pass you by. After a while, see if you can isolate which sounds come from where: a car honk in the distance, a baby crying right next to you, a text message alert, etc.

, Hearing is strictly an auditory process. Listening is whole, involving not only the ears, but also the heart, mind, soul, and body.Find genuine interest in being present with people you’re speaking with. Give attention, show concern, and prepare yourself to learn something from people you interact with.
Put yourself on the back burner and listen without expectation or need to fill space with talks about yourself.

,


Good listening is 80% being patient and listening to the other person without interruption and 20% reflecting and following up for more information.Be fully present in those moments, without thinking about the past, future, or your intentions, focus solely on the person speaking to you.

, Adapt to those changes accordingly as you listen.


If the speaker, your friend, has tension in their voice, face, or body language suddenly, it’s up to you to appear non-confrontational and relaxed to mellow out the situation.If the speaker, or your friend, seems emotionally charged and is raising his or her voice suddenly, nod your head in concern or cross your arms to make the person feel like they have support in their emotions.

, When you listen to someone without being judgmental in your responses, you prevent them from shutting down and help them feel a sense of freedom and acceptance. You also gain acceptance from them too.Show respect to the other person and contribute to the conversation instead of rebuking them for beliefs you might not ordinarily agree with. Keep in mind that facial expressions like a visible wince, eye rolls, or body language that shows tension speaks as loudly as any verbal judgmental response would.
Accepting someone’s ideas does not necessarily mean you agree with them. Keep in mind that understanding through listening does not mean your opinions become mutual in sync with one another.

, Rationally decide when it is okay to listen and when it is okay to respond and ask follow-up questions. Timing and restraint is everything.Think of the outcome of talking, will it affect the conversation and relationship positively or negatively? Never let your desire to impress ruin how you relate to people.
Use the following question as a guideline to help you talk less: “Am I wanting to talk to add true content or am I just trying to fill up space?”

, Close the book you’re reading or put down your phone.


Make sure your body language reads fully engaged. Lean forward slightly and maintain eye contact as they speak to you.Smile softly if the tone of the conversation calls for it and give an occasional nod to show that you’re listening without talking to interrupt.To show that you understand what’s being said, talk your summary of what was said to you by paraphrasing., Always try as much as possible to think twice before you speak. Listen to others, understand the topic, and be sure of what you want to contribute.Avoid saying way more than you have to be by taking a moment to reflect after the speaker asks you for your opinion.
Pause for a beat, even say aloud the words “Give me a minute to think about it”. Reflect, exercise restraint, and then add your two cents to the conversation., Interrupting looks like talking over someone or putting your thoughts into the conversation before it was your turn. Let the person talk, you will get your turn to contribute and avoid making the other person feel invalidated in the process.If you're trying to interrupt someone while they're talking, try bookmarking it as a mental note until they're done. If you'd rather have something tangible, use a notepad or your phone to jot down your thoughts and talk about them when it's your turn to speak.Try to catch yourself in moments where you interrupt the other person. Look at them for facial cues, like an eye roll or a glance to the side, to keep you alert about your actions. Once you catch yourself, just say, ""Oh, I'm sorry, go on."" or ""My bad, go ahead."", Try to stay on topic. Discuss what makes sense and try to stay away from examples that may seem irrelevant, unreasonable, and ambiguous. Give simple facts and clear logic that will help the listener to gain some sense.


Use natural breaks of silence in conversation and the context of the conversation as guidelines of when to talk. If someone is venting to you, it’s probably not a great time to talk about a rave you have been trying to attend for weeks.
If you don’t know what you want to say, ask more investigative questions, such as what does this mean? Who can we hold responsible, how and why? This encourages the person to speak more."
"
Be educated.,
Create more stories to share.,
Be engaged with what you do.,
Get to know new people.,
Be open-minded.,
Take up hobbies.,
Have a unique sense of style.,
Be yourself.",How to Be Interesting," The more you know about what is going on in the world, the more you can contribute to conversations. Interesting people are the ones who can bring something new to a conversation and share fun facts rather than just sitting there nodding. The more you learn, the better conversationalist you will become.


Keep yourself educated by reading books and staying up-to-date with current events in the news and pop culture.
Watch documentaries, and attend lectures on various subjects.
Remember that not all knowledge has to be gained through a formal institution. Seek out new topics on your own.;
, Interesting people always seem to have a lot going on in their lives. The more you do, the more stories you will have to share with others. The best way to accumulate interesting stories is by travelling, constantly meeting new people, and putting yourself in new and interesting situations.

Get in the habit of saying ""yes"" to unfamiliar opportunities that arise. If somebody invites you out to a party where you don't know anyone, accept the invitation. You never know when a seemingly uneventful night can turn into a crazy story!
You don't have to travel to a different continent to get an interesting experience. Even taking a two hour road trip to visit a friend in a neighboring town can turn into an exciting adventure.
Document the trips you go on, the parties you attend, and the sites you see, so that you can share these pictures with others.

, Though it may not seem like it, being interesting is the same exact thing as being interested. If you constantly act bored or distracted, people will eventually become bored with you, and you will become bored with your life. Think of yourself as a sponge, and each and every day, absorb as much as you can of what is happening around you.


If you are having a conversation with somebody, give them your undivided attention. Make eye contact, and avoid texting or talking on the phone when you are with others.
Start to notice small details in your daily life that wouldn't normally pay attention to. Admire the architecture of the buildings when walking down the street, notice the way the wind rustles the leaves on a tree, and pay attention to the artwork in the cafe you are sitting in. Little things like these add up and make you feel more connected to the world around you.
Learn how to listen to other people when they talk. Sometimes, people who try to be interesting end up talking too much without giving others an opportunity to talk. Despite your best efforts, though, this comes across as being self-centered. Conversations should be balanced so that each person spends equal time talking and listening.

, Expand your social circle by striking up conversations with anyone and everyone. You never know when a stranger can turn into one of your new best friends! Give everybody you meet a chance to show you who they are, and welcome them into your life.


Talk to people at parties, bars, and clubs. If you see somebody interesting, then go over and talk to them. You have nothing to lose!
Strike up a conversation with the waitress in a restaurant, cashier at the convenient store, or driver on the bus.
Meet friends of friends. Mutual friends are a great way to meet new people. Consider organizing a party and inviting all of your friends, and tell your friends to bring a guest or two.

, Try not to be overly judgmental or sensitive, and people will be much more inclined to spend time with you and talk to you. Remember that everybody is entitled to his or her opinion. While there's nothing wrong with engaging in a friendly debate every now and then, you should try to be open-minded and accept others' opinions, even if they differ from your own

, Join a local sports team, pick up an instrument, or learn a new craft. Hobbies not only keep you busy and help you meet people, they also allow you to identify your skills and talents. Some of the most interesting people in the world are the ones who have a unique talent.


Examples of interesting hobbies include mountain climbing, photography, golfing, cooking, singing, ballroom dancing, horseback riding, volunteering, reading, crafting, and painting.

, Being interesting isn't just about what you're like on the inside; your physical appearance can dramatically change the way you are perceived by others. In fact, before people even meet you, they will already have made a judgement about how interesting of a person you are. If you tend to follow the standard fashion trends, then try to at least put a unique spin on these conventional styles.


Accessorize with hats, scarves, or intricate jewelry.
Shop at thrift stores. If you buy a garment secondhand from a thrift store, you will be guaranteed to be the only one wearing it.

, Remember that even though you may feel uninteresting, you are one-of-a-kind. Don't try to get attention by imitating others or pretending to be somebody you are not, because eventually the truth will come out and you will seem like a phony. Instead of hiding who you are, learn to highlight your positive attributes and downplay your negative ones.


Put a positive spin on things when sharing aspects of your life with others. Instead of complaining about how bad your week has been going, tell the person about all of the good things that have been happening to you lately, in both the short and long term.

Thus, the specific steps you’ll need to take in order to become an arbitrator will be specific to the state in which you intend to practice.For example, a number of states, including Georgia, Illinois, and California, require arbitrators to be attorneys who have practiced for a certain number of years. Other states only require bachelor’s degrees.Theoretically, an arbitrator’s decision is supposed to be comparable to the decision a judge would render, and arbitrators who are registered with courts are invariably current or former attorneys.;
, Educational requirements to become an arbitrator are different from state to state. In all states, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree. In most states, you’ll need a graduate degree (typically in law or conflict resolution).In some states, you’ll need additional certification in ADR to enter practice as an arbitrator. This certification can usually be obtained through a law school or university ADR center.
Many types of arbitration are industry specific, such as labor arbitration, insurance arbitration, or financial arbitration. Arbitrators seeking to practice in a specialty area should seek training or certification by an industry accrediting body, including the American Bar Association, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or the National Academy of Arbitrators (whose members handle workman’s compensation disputes). You can find a listing of training centers at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/2011_build/dispute_resolution/usa_training.authcheckdam.pdf.

, Many cities and towns have community mediation centers. Although mediation is distinct from arbitration, they are both forms of ADR, and getting involved with community mediation centers is a good way to introduce yourself to your local ADR colleagues. You can find a listing at http://www.nafcm.org/search/custom.asp?id=1949


Most community mediation centers will sponsor free or low cost mediation for citizens in the area. Shadowing an experienced mediator or volunteering to mediate a decision under the supervision of an experienced ADR professional is a good way to gain the experience you will need to secure employment in the field of ADR.

, There is no one way to find employment as an arbitrator. There are very few large firms practicing arbitration and nothing else. More commonly, an arbitrator works for a law firm, another group work for governmental agencies, while a smaller group work directly for insurance companies.Most solo practice arbitrators are registered with a court—whichever type of court would hear cases in the arbitrator’s specialty, usually a state civil court. These courts often impose their own requirements for arbitrators independent of the state requirements. If you plan on getting work through court sponsored referrals, be sure to check with the court for any additional requirements they may impose.

, Many arbitrators operate independently or in partnership with one or two other arbitrators. While some arbitrate full time, many are in fact practicing attorneys who arbitrate disputes part time.One of the best ways to advertise your services is by taking out a listing with ADR organizations, like mediate.com. These are like reverse employment classifieds. Instead of the employer advertising for an open position, the arbitrator offers their services.

, Arbitration is basically a legal field, so it is important that a new arbitrator concentrate on a specific area of practice, such as insurance, labor-management relations, or family law. Since it is impossible to be an expert in every area of law, arbitrators who hold themselves out as general practitioners are less likely to find success than specialists., Most of the arbitration specialty areas have their own professional organizations. These organizations uphold ethics standards, best practices, and offer certification and continuing education. Additionally, joining a professional organization is a great way to develop and expand your professional network.


Some examples of specialized organizations include the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA), or the National Academy of Arbitrators (NAA). General professional associations for arbitrators include the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and the National Academy of Distinguished Neutrals (NADN).
Since arbitration is a new profession, it lacks a universal governmental credentialing process and has few established national guidelines. Therefore, joining professional organizations and developing extensive personal networks of colleagues in the field is even more important than it is in a typical profession. Unlike an attorney, for instance, there is no bar exam an arbitrator can take to prove his or her qualifications. For practical purposes, the arbitrator is only as qualified as their fellow arbitrators say they are.

, Some organizations, like the AAA and the NADN, only allow attorneys to join or be nominated. Others only allow individuals who have been arbitrators for a certain number of years and who have arbitrated a certain number of cases to join. Other organizations, such as FINRA, have more relaxed entry requirements, but mandate that all members take a course and a certification test. While you might have to wait several years before you can join more prestigious organizations like the AAA, your career prospects can certainly improve when you do. If possible, start by joining a specialist organization with looser entry barriers, like FINRA, and use it to build your portfolio., Since there is no national consensus with respect to an arbitrator’s qualifications, there are numerous organizations offering to “certify” students as mediators or arbitrators. It’s up to you, the prospective arbitrator, to make sure these organizations are worth joining. Some qualities to look out for include:Size. Unless the professional organization is extremely specialized (by subject or geography), it should have more than a few dozen members. Since one of the biggest reasons to join a professional association is to develop a diverse professional network, joining a small organization is will have dubious value.
Educational opportunities. Most professional associations offer Continuing Legal Education (CLE) classes to their members at discounted rates. Research the CLE opportunities the professional association offers and compare them with CLE opportunities at other professional associations. There should be a diverse array of useful classes that are offered both in person and online.
Reputation. Finally, ask fellow arbitrators, mediators, and attorneys if they consider the prospective organization a worthwhile one to join. With the advent of online message boards, it’s easier than ever to get the opinions of a wide array of people, but don’t neglect asking around locally. There might be reasons specific to your jurisdiction diminishing the value of joining a particular organization.

, Try breathing in through your nose and down into the lower depths of your belly. Then, while you are exhaling, say “hello.” Listen to the pitch and depth of your voice. To compare, try the same exercise but breathe into your chest or your throat. It should sound very high pitched when you breathe into your throat, medium pitched when you breathe into your chest, and deep when you breathe into your lower diaphragm., Breathe deep into your lower diaphragm. As you exhale, say something you want to say. Your voice will sound deeper if you breathe into your lower belly. Open your mouth quite naturally, in order to speak normally. Do not purse, cup or shape your lips or cheeks.

, Stand up straight and tall. Hold your chin up. Then, say your name and listen to how it sounds. Alternately, you can read a passage from a newspaper or a book. Consider the volume, tone, breathiness and especially the pitch of your voice.The pitch of your voice is determined by how much your vocal chords vibrate.If your voice sounds high or has a high pitch, it means your vocal chords are vibrating at a high frequency.If your voice sounds low or deep, it means your vocal chords are vibrating at a lower frequency., When you try to speak lower than normal, your voice is less likely to crack. Aim to relax your throat as much as possible, so that you do not tighten your vocal chords.Moisten your voice box and keep it sounding clear by working up a little extra saliva occasionally and swallowing.

, Choose a passage from one of your favorite books or articles. Practice reading the passage slowly and with a low voice. If you find yourself reading too quickly, you may notice your voice will loose its timbre. Keep your chin up, breathe through your belly and read the passage., There are a variety of mobile applications available for smart phones or tablets, which you can use to train your vocal chords on your own time. These applications allow you to train towards specific goals and to monitor your performance. For instance, you could try one of the following applications: Vocular allows you to measure how deep your voice sounds. It tells you how deep you are speaking and even lets you compare your voice to celebrities with similar sounding voices.Eva is designed for transgender users who are currently transitioning and want to change the sound of their voice, such as pitch, tone or breathiness., Hum deeply from your throat, with your lips parted and your chin pointed down toward your chest, to warm up your voice. Humming is an excellent warm up for musicians and singers, as well as anyone who wants to improve their speaking voice.Raise your chin slowly while humming and then begin speaking directly from that humming voice, so that it sounds deeper.

, Instead of speaking through your nose, you should speak through your mouth. Although you can have a deep voice that is nasal, it sounds better to have a deep voice that does not have a nasal quality.Avoid using an overly airy, soft, smooth, too hollow-resonance or echo-like sound that you can feel in your chest (called a chest voice).

, Learn to talk so that you hear your voice out in front of yourself. Don't hold your stomach in while learning this technique. Breathe from your diaphragm. You should feel your breath moving from your belly upwards through your chest and then out of your mouth.

, Avoid making harsh efforts to change your voice, so as to prevent any straining of the vocal cords. At the start, only work your voice out for short periods of time, and do so only a couple of semitones below your normal pitch. Over time, carefully lower your practice pitch, and allow yourself extra time.


Have fun and experiment with friends and family to see how they react (they're more likely to be forgiving). Try funny voices and odd tones to learn better control. And keep aiming to ensure that your voice sounds as you prefer it.

, Good posture will help you maintain a deep and authoritative voice. Instead of letting your head fall down or to the side while you speak, you should try to keep your head up straight and your chin up.Your posture is important for achieving a good speaking voice.

, One trick to attain a deeper voice is to do a swallowing motion just before you speak. You don’t need to actually swallow anything. Imagine you are swallowing something and then say the words. Your voice should be slightly lower than usual., Try speaking slower than usual. Lower your voice at the beginning of a sentence and then just speak slowly. If you find you want to speak too quickly, it could raise the pitch of your voice., This practice can damage your vocal chords. It could also be a symptom of a medical condition such as strep throat. Avoid smoking. Although smoking can give you a raspy or breathy voice, it will do long term damage to your health, including your vocal chords and lungs. If you have a raspy voice that does not go away, you should seek medical attention.

Take slow, deep breaths before your speech.

,
Wear a favorite piece of clothing, or carry a lucky object.

,
Find several other people in the audience that appeal to you and ""speak"" to them.,
If you are allowed to move around during the speech, plan out where you will walk.,
Before you speak, do a ""hokey pokey"" in the privacy of a bathroom and shake out your hands too.,
Eat a healthy meal before your speech, but not too much.,

, Watch for things like eye contact, or nervous gestures like running a hand through your hair, or foot tapping.

, When you are focused on explaining a prop you will ""forget"" about the audience and be less nervous. But be careful, and don't talk into the object. Keep projecting your voice into the audience so that they can hear you.

, Knowing the territory, and testing out how loud you must be in order to be heard is an advantage.

, Instead of staring into many pairs of eyes, find something like a window with a view, preferably a calming one.

,,, If they can give you a thumbs-up, or an encouraging smile, it can help unimaginably.

, Choreography will help take your mind off the audience. If you will move during the speech, check out anything that might make you trip.

, This will loosen you up. Vocal exercises that can help the voice are good, as well.

, If you already feel nervous, having a full-to-bursting stomach is not good.

, It will appear as if you're making eye contact. This way, you will not have to stare into critical eyes, if there are any.

, An online search for the presence of a cause-specific advocacy group in your geographic location will help you to locate the names, contact information and scope of already existing organizations.


Contact local organizations to learn more. Speak to administrators of existing advocacy groups to find out if they are already performing the work you intend to do. You might decide to join their efforts or fulfill a need not met by their activities.

, Speak to your social network, professional colleagues, community leaders and others who are interested in helping you organize advocacy group activities.

, If you are interested in improving the nutrition of school lunches, for example, reach out to other parents who want the same for their kids.

, Contact community centers, libraries, churches and other organizations that might offer a free meeting spot. Remove all obstacles to meeting attendance by choosing a location that is centrally located and easily accessible with ample parking.

, Take into account the schedules of your attendees. If you are targeting mothers of young children, for example, you might schedule your meetings while their children are in school.

Write a speech.,

When it finally comes down to that moment, take a moment to breathe deeply.,
Search the crowd for a buddy or family member.,

Be sure to add emotion to your speech.,
Have fun with it and enjoy it.",How to Speak In Front of Large Groups of People," Write down little notes about what you'd like to include in your speech. Is there a certain subject you have to speak about, or is it your own thing? Research it! Find interesting facts about your topic to include. Add in special effects in your speech. Make the audience think! Put pauses in your speech where there would be points to really think about something, like a past experience, an answer to a question, or an opinion. Write down sentences or paragraphs that make the audience visualize something. ""Imagine..."" or ""What if..."" there are two ways to start of something like that. Maybe add in a little humor to your speech. A little joke every now and then will keep a person interested in your speech.;
, Make sure there aren't things you are embarrassed to say, or are not positive of the pronunciation. It will also help to not use words you don't know the meaning to, so you don't use a wrong word or don't give it the right emotion. And also, if you use too many words that people don't know the definition of, that alone might make them not care for your speech, considering the fact they would be awesome have a clue what you were talking about. Make it seem like you're writing an essay for school, and go through grammar, spelling, punctuation, and so on. Even the slightest mistake could mess you up. And finally, have a friend or two read over your speech. Ask their opinion on it, for things you could improve, and ask questions about it to see if they got the point about what the whole thing was about. See if they actually learned from it. Using those pointers, make one last speech, making it the best you can make it.

, The more secure you feel about it, the less likely you will be too nervous. If the crowd throws you off, just imagine you're in your room (or where ever you practiced) just doing one last practice.

, Don't write something in this whole business like form just to try to impress. Add a little something to make your speech say ""This is me, saying my speech, not that other person over there"". The more ""you"" you make it, the less work you'll have to do, which means the less you'll have to worry.

, They are a lot easier to use than searching your speech when you don't remember the next point of discussion. Try not to put a lot on one card. Usually, one card per point works, but if there is a lot of information for one, move onto two or three cards, anything to limit the amount of looking you do. Don't write down full sentences, just write down simple notes and ques for you to remember what going on. This also helps you keep eye contact.

, Not just a little 1 second inhale, exhale. Inhale for 10 seconds and exhale for the same amount, and be sure you breathe in so that your stomach area moves out, and your shoulders don't move up. If it doesn't work the first time, do it again, and again, until you feel relaxed and ready. This alone could throw away enough nervousness to get you through the speech.

, Use them as a motivation to be the best speaker you can be. If you can't find them, just remember that they are out there and they see you, even if you don't see them.

, Wait, begin to speak, s l o w l y! What you think is too slow is perfect. What you think is just right is too fast usually for the people listening. Articulate everything! It's funny how a word can change into something totally different from your subject because you didn't use the right sounds, but it won't be that funny for you! Keeping this in mind, speak. Usually, after a paragraph or so of speaking, you begin to realize ""Hey, this ain't half bad!"" and it's easier to continue. If it doesn't click in then, just give it a little more time.

, How often do you actually listen to a speech made by someone who is monotones or sounds like they are just reading through a paper. Boring! Pretend you are a movie actor/actress. Everyone sees what you are doing, and you want to make a lot of money for the movie, and not get fired. If you can, move around, use hand gestures, if you really want to dig deep, act out a part of your speech while you say it. If that doesn't get people's attention, nothing will. In the middle of your speech, stop and ask an audience member a question to get an opinion on a point you are about to make, then prove them right or wrong. Try getting an opinion from someone who seems to be drifting off, just to get their attention back. Some people will be listening and start thinking ""good point"",""that's true"", or, if they are more child-like, ""Ha ha! You were wrong!"" That shows that people are paying attention. Make sure you ask question and add pauses. Do anything to make the people think! And be sure to have eye contact with the whole audience (or look right above the crowd if you don't want to look right at them).

, If you hate it, the audience will hate it. But if you have fun with it, it will show in your words, and the audience will have fun, too.

,
Be aware that keeping in touch with people online can be really hard.",How to Communicate Online,"

Did you know that everything we say to someone via updates on social media sites is a request for a response?
When you want to share a status think what kind of response you'd like. Here are some of the responses you might be looking for:

A connection like ""Me too!""

Understanding such as ""I'm glad to know that about you.""

A reaction like ""Ha Ha :)""
""'Advice such as ""Have you tried ____""


A response of what they think, such as ""I think that's nice""

An action like ""I will do that.""

Sympathy such as ""Poor You :(""

Empathy with something like ""I understand your pain"".


Think about what you think you are looking for. Write with the response you're seeking in mind. Make it clear what kind of action you want the readers to take if you're looking for something specific.;
,

Less is more most of the time. Unless you have a huge fanbase and you're trying to sell something or have something exciting happening in your life (such as going into labor), limit your updates to one a day or even less.
Someone who updates multiple times a day gives the image of being bored, lonely, depressed or selfish. Now, those things might be true about you but if you really need connection with others, don't make it a negative one. Show them that you care about them and they'll reciprocate.
A well thought out status every once in a while gives the image of a wise, insightful person who has a fulfilling life offline.

,

Be responsive. Just as everything you say is asking for a response, everything your friends say is looking for a response, verbal and non-verbal.
When you read someone's status ask yourself: What is this person asking of me?
Of course, it isn't always clear what the person wants. One way to figure it out is to put yourself in their shoes, figure out what you know of their situation, and decide what you'd like in the same situation. Another way is to send a private message. ""Are you looking for advice?"" is a good message to find out what they might be asking. They'll likely say ""No. I was just putting it out there (understanding/connection)"" or ""Yes. What do you suggest?""
Once you think you know what they want, give it to them. Here are some examples of what you might write if they are looking for:


Connection: Really? I know. Same here. I remember...

Understanding: Tell me more. What happened? How's it going now?

A reaction: LOL! ROFL! I just threw up in my mouth. TMI! ""Like""

Advice: What worked for me was... My mom tried... Whatever you do DON'T..

What you think: I love it! That does not appeal to me. That reminds me of...

Action: I just clicked on the link. I'll repost. (ignore if you're not going to do anything)

Sympathy: Poor guy! That must have been disgusting! Get well soon.

Empathy: I've had that before, no fun. I can tell this is really bothering you.

Show your friends that you care about them when you post a photo album by:

Limiting the photos to the very best of the series.

15 interesting photos is more pleasurable to look than 120 random ones.


Write captions on all of the photos to describe what is going on.
Take time to tag people - it shows you care.


If you went on a fabulous vacation, your first instinct may be to share every glorious detail, which can be interesting to some people, but if you really want to make your friends less envious, tag them in specific photos and tell them you thought about them when you were there.
If you did something adventurous, go crazy and show as many photos as you want - just add captions. People love living dangerously through you in the comfort of being behind their computer screen.

, If there is a particular person that makes your blood boil whenever you read their posts, you have three choices:


Block/unfriend them
Ignore them
Empathize with them: Ask yourself what might they be needing by writing this post? Although you might want to avoid commenting on their posts, your attitude may change.

,

If you're not a descriptive enough writer to express your tone with choice of vocabulary alone, opt to use emoticons.
Simple ones include - : + )= Happy, :+(=sad, ;+)=joking, <hug>= hug.
Don't overdo it. For some people, too many emoticons is a sign of immaturity. Less is more.

Life gets busy on both sides. One thing that really helps is not looking at it as e-mailing, Facebooking, Skyping, or calling when you have some free time. Schedule the person in, no matter how you are going to communicate, as if you were going out with that person for dinner, catching up for coffee, or going to their house. You have to treat them as you would if you were getting together in person. That time is their time and you can really give yourself to them.

(You will have a scary story in the end. This is preparation for steps two and three.) Here are some helpful articles if you're having trouble having inspiration:



Decide on Your Novel Writing Structure--this article is just basic plotting.
Plot a Story

Write a Short Story--this one describes a little more.

, You can do this by changing just about everything to its horrified opposite. For example:


A pretty fairy princess turns into a zombie sprite.
A best friend turns into a certain hooded figure armed with a chainsaw.
Flowers turn into carnivorous, huge dark plants.
A lawn gnome turns into a tiny zombie/vampire.
A pony turns into a big, looming shadow horse with red/yellow eyes and a flaming mane...the list goes on and on.

, Do the exact same thing as you did in step two, but with anything that isn't a noun. Examples:


Bravely turns into carefully.
Happy turns to livid.
Peaceful turns into unspeakably/unspeakable evil.
Skipped turns into dragged/crawled, with joyful/longing singing/moaning.

, It should be very scary. This is the reason you wrote a super happy, peaceful story, so that when the words were flip-flopped, it turned spooky.

, Your story has changed so much, there may be things you want to eliminate.


Look for words that are candidates for ""shouldn't be there"". For example, ""The serious thin man""-- (Horrified version of the silly chubby lady) --serious doesn't have to be there. It might be taking away from the essence of your story. (However, you may have it there if you think otherwise, it's your story.)

, This will help add a ""well known legend"" effect.

, Say something like ""Hey, did you guys hear about the legend of...?""


Most people enjoy hearing news they didn't know before. Make it sound like a rumor or big news. Humans are usually very curious.;
, This is very important as you don't want your audience to wander off to the little shack next door.


It helps to motion your audience to come by using hand gestures.
You could even say something such as ""Gather round, young ones, and listen here...""

, It is very important to use hand gestures here. This is optional, but it is recommended.

, Repeat the last two steps as necessary.

, Make a twist ending, like ""But this is only a legend... or IS it...!""

, Are you nervous? Terrified? Totally calm? Indifferent? Whatever emotion you're feeling will affect the quality of your speech. This is why it is important to clam yourself and set those emotions aside.

, You will develop more confidence as you do this, and less confident when concentrating on ""how you feel"" in this new situation. If you are too fearful of presenting it, then you will not be able to get your message across to the group effectively.

, An invitation to speak indicates that your message is meaningful to your audience. Do not try to be someone you're not and speak words that are not yours or use an unnatural tone. Be yourself, smile and have confidence in yourself.

, This is if you have time, of course. If not, simply practice in front of a mirror, with family members and friends. The mirror will help you learn how to relax yourself, and a live practice audience will tell you how to improve, if necessary.

, Do not focus on what not to do. That would be like playing a ball game and watching for where the ball isn't. Think about all the things you are supposed to do. Certain websites can help you find tips on public speaking.]

, From time to time things happen to make you feel less confident. It's about being aware of this and getting back on the task of delivering the message as best you can. This awareness will come with practice and allow you to become a better speaker.

, However, there are some tricks that can help you avoid the nerves associated with looking out over the audience.

, It provides a small sense of security while you're in the spotlight. Whether you are holding piece of paper, the podium or a book. Practice will make this less noticeable and will look more relaxed to the audience. The more relaxed you appear, the easier it is for the audience to become engaged in your topic.

, Toastmasters, for example, is a well-recognized group where you can learn speech skills. Look up local speech groups in your phone book or internet. Find one that suits your personality the best. These groups can make a huge difference in your speech capabilities.

Breathe.,
Face the crowd (look front and not up, towards the stars!),

Try to relate what you are going to speak on with things that you already know.,
Your mind is a huge database, take the trouble of accessing it!

While speaking, visualize.,

, Looking at the crowd face to face makes most people nervous and confused (in most cases the mind goes blank), now here is where you use the Deyali technique.


Deyali technique explained: Look at the crowd but think about the topic that you are going to speak on. When you do this you will not be able to see the crowd as you will be lost in your thoughts. While thinking learn to look straight as this will give the impression to the people in the crowd that you are looking straight into their eyes (gives you the confident look) .







,, Before starting your speech, mentally structure your speech as to how you will begin.

, This is very important to get the crowd's attention(you don't want people to chat while you speak).

,(try to be very resourceful).

,, Linking is an art, practice it with great creativity.

, This will give great structure and content to your speech. If done correctly you will not be able to see the audience most of the time (that pretty much takes care of your fear of facing the crowd). This may not make you a great orator but will definitely help you take care of your presentations at schools,offices etc..

, It helps and if you also admit your fear, it sometimes helps you to get rid of the fear.

You may be too sad, and you can't laugh it off if you forget what you were going to say. Write a small page of notes, or type up the whole thing and read from it.


If you're having trouble getting started, brainstorm. Set a 15 minute timer, think about your loved one, and write down anything that comes to mind.
Use photographs, scrapbooks, and other mementos of the person to inspire you as you write.;
, Most speeches are around 2-10 minutes long. If many people are speaking, err on the shorter side. If you are the closest relative or the only speaker, you may go longer.A five minute speech will be around 650 words long.

, The focus of your eulogy should be the departed. You are telling stories and describing them in a way that helps the audience members frame their own memories. Therefore, focus on the exact qualities of your loved one.


You might list their best qualities, their most particular quirks, their fervently held beliefs.Say what you'll miss about the departed, but don't talk too much about how devastated you are. Your feelings are relevant, but they are not the primary focus of the speech.

, Illustrate your statements about your loved one with true stories that show them in their best and most endearing light. These can be from the childhood and the adulthood of your loved one, and they will have the most oomph if you witnessed them yourself.For instance, if your loved one always stuck up for the underdog, you might tell a story about the time they stuck up for someone. If they were exceptionally clever, you might tell a story of the time they got the two of you out of a bad situation with quick thinking.

, Let your audience know what your loved one experienced, and how they changed over the course of their life. What were their loves, and what were their struggles? Don't dwell on the negative, but acknowledge any defining difficulties, such as a long illness or a tragic loss.


Identify struggles that they faced and conquered. For example, if they lost someone close, talk about that loss and how it affected them.
Describe the important relationships of the departed, including your own relationship with them. For example, you can talk about how much they loved their daughter.
Talk about their passions, hobbies, and talents.

, If there is a text that you associate strongly with the departed, you may quote it during your speech. This is not required! However, if there was a poem, or a religious verse, or some song lyrics, or even a joke the departed truly loved, it may be appropriate to quote it briefly.The quotation should not take up more than a minute of your speech—your words will ultimately be more meaningful.

, Practice reading your speech aloud with a timer. Make sure you are reading at a slow, natural pace. Try to get it slightly under the time you will actually speak—you might cry or have another interruption when you try to deliver it during the funeral., Go over your speech so that you're sure of exactly what you want to say. When you read, you may find it hard to remember, or conversely you may find it easy to remember but hard to understand your own notes. To memorize, simply read aloud many times until you feel like you might be ready to read it without the page.


Next, say your speech without reading, though you may glance down whenever you forget what's next.
Do this many times. Focus on areas where you forget what to say, and practice them extra.
You aren't required to memorize the speech, and it might even be more natural if you didn't.

, You may get emotional while you read, or you may suffer from stage fright in front of the assembled mourners. It is OK to show some emotion, but to make sure that others can hear you, practice calming yourself even when you already feel calm.


Take deep breaths.
Drink water.
Look at a friend or family member in the audience for support.
Command yourself by name. Giving yourself short mental commands while addressing yourself by name helps you stay in control. If you start to lose it, think ""Patricia, calm down.""

, To ensure that your speech is concise, appropriate, moving, and that you deliver it well, practice in front of an audience. This can be one to several people you love. Ask them to listen and give you notes on your presentation.

, Stand tall and face the mourners. Straighten your shoulders and pretend there is a string from the ceiling to the nape of your neck. Put your notes on the podium, if there is one, or hold them at your waist.


Don't stare down at your notes or at the podium.

, Remember to speak to the front row—the ones who loved the deceased the most and are the most saddened by the death. They are listening to you attentively, and the rest of the room is also witnessing your speech to them.When you talk about someone, look at them.

, As you speak, notice how you feel. If you feel nervous, tell yourself to slow down. You may be speaking more quickly than you think. Project your voice—don't yell, but breathe from your stomach, and try to hit the back wall with your words.


Speak in a conversational tone. There's no need to pitch your voice for drama—the situation will speak for itself.
Speak more slowly than you normally would. Not only will this help the audience understand you, but it may keep you calm as well.

, You may cry. Keep going unless you are choking up. If you are choking up, use your calming techniques that you planned. The audience will not be shocked if you cry—they will be sympathetic."

Decide what your goal is.,
Think about going to a number of meetings before you ever speak, if you intend to become active in civics.

,
Decide on a topic or area that interests you, and watch what is happening in the meeting.,
Determine if you will be just making a speech or if you will have to answer questions from the board.,
Get in front of a mirror and practice, then after that get a friend or two to listen to the speech.

,
At the meeting, have a copy of the speech with you, but try not to refer to it.,

Keep it short.,
Give just enough background so that your listeners understand why you are there and what you are talking about.,
Make sure any exhibits you plan to use are organized and big enough for your audience to see.

,
Be sure your topic is appropriate to the board you are speaking before.,
Be polite, do not be sarcastic, do not use a joke unless it is really hysterical.,
After you finish your remarks, ask if there are any questions, answer them if you can.,
Once all questions are handled, thank the board for its time, and return to your seat.",How to Speak at a School Board Meeting," Are you interested in one particular issue, or are you planning to go on to become active in the community and are using the meeting as a stepping off point for a career in politics or civic participation?;
,, Follow the bi-play on the topic and ascertain who on the board shares your views, who is against your position and who can be persuaded.


If you are only interested in one topic, and you need to make an impact, you must know the topic as well as you can. One of the best ways to overcome fear is to be completely prepared.

,


If you are making a speech, and you are new at it, write it down, then practice it until you have every breath of it memorized.

,, You will want to make eye contact with your audience and reading a speech from a prepared script is not the way to accomplish this. If you absolutely have to read the speech, build in stop points where you can lift your head to make eye contact and then go back to reading.

, Speak slowly, and with enough sound to know that the audience can hear you. vary tone and timing so as to keep yourself from speaking in a monotone and monotonous voice.

, No one wants to hear a long speech. Most boards limit the time for public comment, finish within your time and if you have more to say, tell the committee you will send the rest of your comments to them in the mail.

, Do not give a minute by minute description, it is boring.

,, Do not ask the city council to fix something the school board should be on and do not ask the school board to debate a war resolution.

, Even then, leave it out and you will have a far easier time of it.

, If you cannot answer a question, tell the questioner you will submit an answer in writing after checking out the issue. DO NOT MAKE IT UP ON THE FLY. More importantly get back to the board with the answer as soon as possible.

, Do not leave until there is a break or the meeting ends unless you have a very good reason, You want to hear follow up and you may be called on again if a question on the issue you presented comes up.

Michael Hall, author of Secrets of Personal Mastery, advises, ""Give yourself permission to be gloriously fallible!""


The way to recover from a mistake is to observe it dispassionately, take whatever corrective action is appropriate, regain your composure, focus on what to say next, and get on with it. Dwelling on an error and feeling bad about it only adds to your confusion. Leave the mistake behind and move forward.
You can't please everyone in your audience. Sure-some listeners may think you are a moron for making a mistake. Some won't even notice it. Others may admire the way you recover so easily. Some may be relieved to know you are human. Some won't care one way or the other.
Mistakes can provide excellent feedback for improvement. Mistakes often promote single-trial learning, so it's almost certain you will never make the same mistake twice. Ask yourself ""What is the worst that can happen if I make a mistake during this speech?""Making a mistake does not carry a death sentence.;
, They see themselves fumbling clumsily with notes, stammering, becoming mute, turning red, possibly crying, horrifying audiences with their stupidity, and slinking away to live out the remainder of their miserable lives in exile, reviled as a social reject. Psychologists call this method of preparation ""negative anticipation.""


STOP IT! Each time you engage in this mental flagellation, shake yourself out of it. Say ""STOP"" loudly to yourself. Do anything to get your mind out of the failure trap. Sing, whistle, recite poetry, walk around the block, or talk to a friend. You can even make those scary images seem silly and laughable, by imagining your audience in clown costumes, or seeing your performance in fast motion.
In The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, author Steven Covey tells his readers to ""begin with the end in mind."" Visualize yourself giving that speech the way you want to. If you anticipate success, you are more likely to get it. Mentally rehearse that you are speaking confidently with a smooth delivery to an appreciative audience. Hear the words coming out of your mouth in a flowing cadence. See yourself with an erect posture, breathing free and easy. By visualizing this way, you are programming your mind and body for the results you want.

, You have something important to say and others want to hear about it. If you can, pick a subject you enjoy. Speak on topics you know well. Even if you are delivering dreary statistics about last year's crop failure, put something of yourself into your speech. Include an anecdote, or a quotation. Bring in the human interest perspective. Practice and preparation are easier if your subject matter is important and/or enjoyable to you. If you think your material is interesting and meaningful, your audience will catch your enthusiasm and appreciate your sincerity.

, Now there is a defeatist presupposition, if I ever heard one! It had never even occurred to me to think of my students in that way! ""I am confident,"" I answered, ""because I don't think that way. I assume my audiences are friendly. I assume they are here because they are interested in what I have to say. I love my audiences and I assume they love me."" You get back what you put out---and nowhere is this adage more true than in public speaking. If you want your audiences to like you, you have to like them first.

, Such events can be highly traumatizing for children (and not a joyride for adults, either) and can cause life-long, paralyzing fear. If such an incident is the basis of your fear, visit a therapist or counselor who specializes in phobias. Phobias are nothing to be ashamed of. Researchers estimate that 80 percent of the population has at least one in a lifetime. Contrary to popular belief, many phobias can be cured, usually in three or four therapy sessions.


Maybe your fear isn't a true phobia, but still relates to past flops and embarrassments. Remember: All good speakers started out as not-so-good speakers. They improved because they resolved to do better the next time.

, If you have trouble falling asleep, drink some warm milk (yes, it does work), and think some pleasant, relaxing thoughts. It may help to listen to a relaxation tape or soft music, or do some light reading before going to sleep. If you can, clear your calendar of stressful events that could interfere with your ability to concentrate and speak confidently and sincerely. In other words, don't schedule a job interview, a dentist visit, or a meeting with your ex-spouse's lawyer on the same day you are going to deliver that all-important speech!

, They do it to pep up or calm down. Mood-altering substances are an emotional crutch you don't need. The problem is that you can't regulate the dosage. You don't know how much is too much. Once it is in your bloodstream, there is little you can do about it. Your relaxation may turn to sluggishness. Your pep may turn to jitters. It's best to avoid these substances altogether.


Additionally, eat lightly, or not at all, one hour before speaking. A full stomach can lower your energy level and concentration, because your body is busy digesting food. Any nervousness can make digestion difficult. You don't want a belch or a gurgling stomach interrupting your speech!

, Polish your shoes and comb your hair. Wear attractive, flattering, professional-looking clothing. When you look good, you feel confident. If you aren't sure what looking good is all about, do what professional speakers do. Have a few sessions with an image consultant to learn about the colors and styles that look best on you. Women can get personalized advice on hair and make-up. A good image consultant can tell you how to look fantastic without spending a fortune.

, With a restricted airway and without enough oxygen, your voice can come out as a squeak! Deep breathing, on the other hand, sends oxygen to the lungs and brain and expands the throat and chest, promoting relaxation. As you approach the platform, take a deep breath and relax.

, Find friendly faces and focus on them. Smiles and approving nods will give you extra encouragement.

, Yet, vastly more casualties and fatalities result from traffic accidents than from public speaking. Fear is a natural survival mechanism. It can motivate us, or stop us in our tracks. In situations that pose a threat to life and limb, fear motivates us to be careful. On the other hand, fear is a problem when it interferes with our goals and achievements. These ten tips will help you progress toward confidence on the platform. Ultimately we succeed when we conduct ourselves according to the rewards we want, rather than the things we fear.

Lacking knowledge can make you anxious and uncertain when you're speaking and that will come through to your audience.Preparation is key. Take your time when you are planning your speech to make sure that it flows naturally and logically. You'll also need to make sure that you know how you're coming across while giving the speech and heighten your good qualities while downplaying the less good qualities.
Even if public speaking is something like having to answer a question in class, you will still need to make sure that you know your subject. This can help you feel and present as more confident, which will make a good impression on your listeners.;
, While speaking in public isn't like running a race, there are still things you can do to make sure that your body cooperates with you. This goes beyond not shifting your weight from foot to foot while you're talking (hold your toes still and you won't find yourself doing this). It has to do with breathing, with projecting and making sure you're speaking properly.Speak from your diaphragm. This will help you to project clearly and loudly so that your audience can hear you without seeming like you're straining or shouting. As an exercise, stand up straight and put your hand on your abdomen. Breathe in, and breathe out. Count to 5 on a breath and then 10 on a breath. You'll feel your abdomen start to relax. You want to be breathing and speaking from that relaxed state.
Modulate your tone. Figure out what the pitch of your voice is. Too high? Too low? Going into registers only dogs can hear? Relaxing, standing in a comfortable (but upright) position and breathing properly will help you find a more comfortable and more pleasant tone.
Avoid throat breathing and upper chest breathing, as these both can add to your anxiety and tighten up your throat. In consequence, your voice will sound more strained and uncomfortable.

, People speak a lot more quickly when they're just having a conversation, but that sort of speech doesn't work when you're speaking in front of a group. Your audience needs to be able to follow along with what you're saying and be allowed time to process the speech.


Try to speak more slowly and more carefully than a typical conversational tone. Make sure that you allow for pauses between different ideas, or especially important themes, so that your audience has time to understand and reflect on what you just said.
Practice proper articulation and pronunciation. Articulation is when you're pronouncing sounds. Focus especially on enunciating these sounds: b, d, g, dz (j in jelly), p, t, k, ts, (ch in chilly). For pronunciation, you want to make sure you know how to pronounce all your words and that you've practiced pronouncing the more difficult ones.
Eliminate the 'um's and placeholder words such as ""like."" When public speaking, these words make you sound as if you don't know what you're talking about. If you need to gather your thoughts, you can always pause — doing so will appear deliberate.

, Knowing your speech is just as important as knowing the subject you're giving the speech on. There are also different ways of giving speeches, so you'll need to pick the way that works best for you.


To give a speech, you'll need to either have some sort of note cards or outline. Or you can do it from memory, if that is something that you do well (don't try this if you aren't super confident you can do it).
You don't need to write down every single thing on your note cards (leave a little room for improvisation), although it can be helpful to make notes of things like ""pause after this information"" or ""remember to breathe"" so that you actually remember to do those things.

, While you don't necessarily have to memorize your speech or talking points, it can be a great way to help you appear confident and easy in your subject matter. Make sure that you have enough time set aside to do this, however.Write out your speech over and over. This method helps you to remember the speech. The more you write it out, the easier it will be to recall it. Once you've written it multiple times, test yourself on how well you remember it. If there were parts you couldn't remember, write those specific parts over and over again.
Break your speech down into smaller parts and memorize each of those parts. It is really hard to memorize an entire speech in one go. The best thing to do is memorize it in small chunks (start with each bullet point, and then move up to memorizing your 3 different main points, etc.)
Use the loci method. Break down your speech into paragraphs or bullet points. Visualize a picture for each bullet point (like imagining a Harry Potter if you're talking about J.K. Rowling's influence on children's literature). Determine a location for each of the points (like Hogwarts for Rowling, a meadow for Stephenie Meyer, etc.). Now you'll progress through the locations (you fly on a broomstick from Hogwarts to the meadow, for example). If you have multiple things to say about each specific point, then put them in specific places around the location (like a point about Harry Potter's popularity in the Main Hall, or the effect she had on revamping the genre in the Quidditch field).

, You need to know who you're giving your speech to, because things that might go over well with one type of audience are going to anger or bore another type. For example: you wouldn't want to be informal during a business presentation, but you might be informal with a group of college students.


Humor is a great way to loosen yourself and your audience up. There's usually a type of humor that fits most public speaking situations (but not always!). It's good to start off with a little humor to lighten the atmosphere and give the impression of confidence. Telling a funny (and true) story can be a good way to do this.
Figure out what it is you're trying to get across to the audience. Are you trying to give them new information? Rehash old information? Are you trying to persuade them to do something? This will help you focus your speaking around the main point that you want to get across.

, This is hugely important if you want your speaking in public venture to go well. It's not enough to know your material and what you're trying to get across. You need to have done it enough times that you feel easy in it. It's like breaking in shoes. The first few times you wear them you're going to get blisters, but soon they'll be comfortable and fit you well.Try to visit the space you'll be speaking in and practice there. This will give you greater confidence because you're more familiar with the area.
Video your practicing and find your strengths and weaknesses. Although it can be daunting to watch yourself on video, it's a great way to see where your strengths and weaknesses are. You'll notice what your nervous physical tics are (shifting from foot to foot, running your hands through your hair) and you can work on eliminating them or keeping them to a minimum.

, The 3 types of speeches are informative, persuasive, entertaining. While there can be overlap between the different types, they each have a specific function that they fulfill.An informative speech's main purpose is to give facts, details, and examples. Even if you are trying to persuade your audience, it is still about the basic facts and information.
A persuasive speech is all about persuading your audience. You will employ facts, but also emotion, logic, your own experiences, etc.
The purpose of an entertaining speech fulfills a social need, but often uses some of the aspects of an informative speech (like a wedding toast, or an acceptance speech).

, You've definitely heard the speech that opens with ""when I was asked to give this speech, I wondered what to say..."" Don't do it. This is one of the most boring ways to start a speech. It rambles all over the place through the presenter's personal life, and is almost never as entertaining as the presenter thinks it is.


Start your speech by giving your main, overarching idea, and the 3 (or so) main points you have to support and elaborate on it. Your audience is going to remember your opening and your closing better than they remember any other part of the speech.
Open it in a way that gets your audience's attention right off the bat. This means offering up a surprising fact or statistic, or asking a question and blowing your audience's preconceptions out of the water.

, To avoid having a speech that ends up all over the place, you will need to construct a clear format. Remember, you're not trying to overwhelm your audience with facts and ideas.Have one overarching idea. Ask yourself what are you trying to get across to the audience? What do you want them to take away from your speech? Why should they agree with what you're saying? For example: if you are giving a lecture on national trends in literature, consider why your audience should care. You don't want to just spit facts out at your audience.
You'll need several main points that back up your overarching idea or point. The best number is usual 3 main points. For example: If your overarching idea is that national children's literature is becoming more diverse, have 1 point showing the new trends, have a second point showing the reception of this new diversity by the public, and a third point talk about why this new diverse children's fiction matters.

, Language is incredibly important in writing and in giving a speech. You'll want to stay away from lots of really big and unwieldy words, because no matter how smart your audience is, they're going to lose interest quickly if you're hitting them over the head with the dictionary.


Use striking adverbs and adjectives. You want to enliven your speech and your audience. For example: instead of ""Children's literature offers a range of diverse perspectives"" say ""Children's literature offers a new range of exciting and diverse perspectives.""
Use images that make your audience sit up and take notice. Winston Churchill used the phrase ""the iron curtain"" to describe the secrecy of the Soviet Union. Striking images linger in your audience's consciousness (as seen by the fact ""the iron curtain"" has become a household phrase).
Repetition is also a great way to remind your audience why your speech is important (think of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I had a dream..."" speech). It hammers home your points and makes it so they can't forget the overarching theme.

, You want your audience to be able to easily follow your speech and to remember when you're finished. Not only does that mean having striking images and surprising facts, it means that it needs to be simple and to the point. If you meander into the quagmires of tangentially related subjects, you're going to lose your audience.


Use short sentences and short phrases. These can be used for great dramatic effect. For example the phrase ""never again."" It is short and to the point and packs a powerful punch.
You can also use short, pithy quotes. Lots of famous people have said funny, or powerful statements in a very short amount of space. You can Try to make your own or utilize ones that are already in place. For example: Franklin D. Roosevelt said ""Be sincere; be brief; be seated.""

, Pretty much everyone gets a little anxious before they have to get up in front of people and talk. Hopefully, you're already prepared with your speech and you know how to give it. Fortunately there are some ways to make those jitters more manageable.Before getting up and speaking, clench and unclench your hands several times to deal with your adrenaline rush. Take 3 deep, slow breaths. This will clear your system and get you ready to breathe properly during the speech.
Stand confidently in a relaxed and upright posture, with your feet shoulder's width apart. This will trick your brain into thinking that you're confident and make it easier to give the speech.

, Smile at them as they come into the room (if you're out there) or smile when you get up in front of them. This will make it seem like you're confident and ease the atmosphere both for you and for them.Smile even if you feel like hurling (especially if you feeling like hurling). This will help trick your brain into feeling confident and at ease.

, Speaking in public, of any kind, is all about performance. You can make your speech interesting or boring depending on the performance you give. You need to have an onstage persona that you use while you're speaking.Tell a story. Part of your performance is giving the speech or speaking like you're telling a story. People love stories and it will make it easier for them to connect with you, even if you're talking about something factually based. use your overarching theme or subject as the basis of the story. Why should the audience care about your topic? What's the point?Try to have a balance between your rehearsed speech and some spontaneity. People don't want to sit there and watch you mumble through your note cards. It's a good idea to give yourself space to expand on your subject free of the note cards and to add a few side stories to give interest.
Use your hands to help you make points. You don't want to be flailing about onstage, but neither do you want to be standing stock still while you talk. It's good to use controlled gestures to make points as you speak.
Vary your voice while you're speaking. Your audience will be asleep in 10 seconds flat if you only speak in one long monotone. Get excited about your subject and show that in your inflections.

, You want to make sure your audience is in your power, which means engaging them in the material no matter what it happens to be. This comes down to being an interesting speaker more than it comes down to an interesting topic.Look at your audience. Mentally split your room up into sections and make eye contact with one person in each section on a rotational basis.
Ask your audience questions during your speaking. You could open up each different section of your speech with questions that you have people Try to answer, before you show them your information. It will make them feel as if they are part of your speech.

, One of the things people fail most frequently in while trying to speak in public is by talking too fast. Your normal conversational speed is a lot faster than the speed that you'll be using for your speech. If you feel you're going too slow, you're probably going just right.


Take a drink of water if you find yourself whipping through your speech. It will help give your audience a second to catch up and it will let you take a moment to slow down.
If you do have a friend or family member in the audience, arrange a signal with them so they can let you know if you're going too fast. Glance their way occasionally throughout your speech so that you know you're on track.

, People remember the beginning and the ending of a speech, they rarely remember the middle bits. Because of this you want to make sure that you have an ending that they will remember.


Make sure that your audience knows why this subject is important and why they should have this information. If you can, end with a call to action. For example: if you're giving a speech about the importance of art classes in schools, end by giving your audience something that they can do about the fact that art electives are being cut.
End with a story that illustrates your main point. Again, people like stories. Give a story of a way this information benefited someone, or the dangers of not having this information, or how it specifically relates to your audience (people are more interested when things are about them).

Each time you see a punctuation mark, such as a comma, give the listener a moment to mull over what has been read thus far.When you read something in your head, you can skim and rush over words and your mind gives it no second thought. However, speaking something out loud at the same pace you would read it in your head doesn't work well. Your sentences might get faster and faster until you have to stop and heave for breath. Don't let your hastiness to continue hinder your ability to speak clearly.;
, Give the listener time to comprehend what has been said and give yourself proper intervals to keep your head from getting muddled. You may think you are speaking too slowly when really you appear to be thoughtful and intent.Try to pace yourself. If you are reading a short poem it's fine to move along at a slightly quicker pace. On the other hand, if you are reading a novel out loud, reading too quickly can easily misconstrue the action and confuse the listener.Don't overdo it or you will risk boring your audience. Speak with firmness, but with a light tone.

, Reading aloud can dry out and fatigue your vocal chords. An easy way to help this is by taking small sips of water periodically while you are reading. Any time you start to feel like your throat is dry or you feel the need to clear your throat, take a tiny break from reading out loud just long enough to take a sip of water. Then resume your reading., Sometimes if you're concentrating too much on speaking nicely, you may suddenly find that your breathing is uneven, or your throat is sore. If you are sitting or standing with poor posture or holding your chest high, those kinds of issues may arise.


Relaxing your ribcage doesn't mean you can slump your shoulders. Instead, pull them back.

Good posture is key. However, good posture doesn't mean sitting rigidly straight. Your posture should be the same as if you were holding a book in front of your chin, and tilted towards the ceiling. Don't hunch over to look at the pages, because that will reduce your lung capacity.

, Your inhalations should expand both your chest and diaphragm. This means that you should be breathing from the chest and not just from the stomach. Take care not to over-think your breathing, however, because you might breathe too much., If you want to practice beforehand, try starting with a sonnet. These can cause difficulties because of the even rhythm and the rhyming. But it is a good starting point because sonnets are, as a rule, very short. So you can practice reading a sonnet out loud and begin to check the pace of your voice, the pauses you take, whether you are stiff, etc.


As you get more comfortable reading something short (like a sonnet) out loud, you can gradually increase your time reading aloud by choosing longer pieces and reading out loud for longer periods. This step-up method will help you get better at reading out loud by practicing over time.

, Caffeine will dehydrate your throat which makes it harder for your vocal chords to perform properly. Too much caffeine intake can also contribute to losing your voice if you overuse your vocal chords.Try drinking water instead. Hydrating your throat will have a much more beneficial effect than dehydrating it with caffeine.

, Any kind of citrusy drink will dehydrate your throat and make it harder for your vocal chords to perform well. Citric acid also causes your throat to create a type of mucus that can lead to coughing and poor vocal performance.This includes lemonade and orange juice.
Instead, try drinking pineapple juice. It doesn’t have the citrus content that orange juice does, but it still contains the vitamin C boost you’re looking for. Pineapple juice can also be very soothing for your throat.

, The act of whispering constricts your vocal chords and forces air past these constricted muscles. This causes your vocal chords to work harder and feel the extra stress of this added work, leading to more frequent vocal fatigue., Vocal rest is an important part of being able to read aloud without tiring your voice. If you have to speak or read out loud for long periods of time, you’ll also need to allow your voice to rest for long periods of time.


Avoid talking unnecessarily. Don’t call your mom for a long chat right before you need to read out loud for a long period of time. Let your voice rest until you need to use it.

, Having relaxed vocal cords will help your voice sound more pleasant to your audience and it will keep your voice from tiring for longer. This means that you will be able to speak/read out loud for a longer period of time. Try the following steps to help relax your voice:When you are in a standing position, place your hands on your throat and speak normally so that you can notice any tenseness that occurs during your regular speech. Also pay attention to any tightness in your jaw.
Open your mouth wide and yawn. As you finish yawning, say out loud “ho-hum,” drawing out the last syllable of the phrase for a few seconds. Let your jaw hang as loose as it can with your mouth still closed and move your jaw from side to side while you continue humming with your lips closed.
Repeat the yawning and humming. Pay attention to how your throat muscles feel. They should be more relaxed and feel less strained.
Hold on to this feeling of looseness and move on with the vocal exercise by repeating the following words: “hang, harm, lane, main, lone, loom.” Exaggerate your mouth and jaw movements as you say the words. Open your mouth wide and drop your jaw as loosely as possible.
If your throat feels tired, stop the exercise and yawn again.
Knead the muscles in your throat with your fingers to help get rid of any residual tightness.
Drop your jaw and relax your throat as you repeat the following sounds: “nah, nay, nee, no, noo.” Exaggerate the length of the sounds.

, Vocal warmup exercises are important because they help your voice and throat muscles prepare for the work they are about to do – kind of like how you would warmup your body through stretching or exercise before starting some kind of long distance marathon. Practice the following steps to help your vocal chords warm up:Take a few minutes to hum a tune. It can be a silly one like “The Wheels on the Bus” or any song of your choosing.
Run your voice through some scales – like “do re mi fa so la ti do.”
Imagine you are chewing gum and take your mouth and jaw through the motions. Chew slowly and softly to help loosen up your jaw muscles.
Swish your tongue around inside your mouth. This can help loosen your tongue and relieve some of the tension that often builds up in the back of your tongue.

, Breathing exercises are important for speaking because they help you strengthen the foundation of your voice – your breath. Perform the following steps to help practice better breathing:Exhale all of the air from your lungs and continue pushing the air out even after you feel like it’s totally gone. When you can’t exhale anymore, your body will automatically inhale. Breathe in deeply and notice how the air rushes in. Repeat this step three more times.
Exhale normally and take a typical inhale breath, but one that does not fill up your lungs completely. Hold the air in for fifteen seconds and then exhale slowly. Repeat this exercise several times.

As you continue with this exercise over a period of weeks, gradually increase your holding time from fifteen seconds to twenty, then to thirty seconds. You can even go up to 45 seconds if it is not too uncomfortable for you.


While standing upright, inhale five times with short gasps through your open mouth. This will force you to use your diaphragm. Exhale in five quick puffs of air. Repeat this process, but inhale and exhale the gasps of air through your nose.

Use a public phone.,
Ask to use a friend's phone.,
Consider speaking through a proxy.",How to Call a Person That Has Blocked Your Number2," Perhaps the simplest solution is to call this person using a number that they have not blocked. This way, they won't expect that it's you on the other end of the line. If they hang up, they hang up – but you should at least get through the call-block screening. Be aware that this will likely only work once or twice before the person stops answering calls from unknown numbers.


If there are payphones in your area, spend a few coins and make a hard-to-trace call.
Check into a hotel room and make the call from the hotel phone.
Use a school phone or a work phone. Ask to use the landline at a shop or restaurant.

, Explain the situation to a friend, then ask if it's okay to use her personal phone to call this person. Be considerate of your friend's property, and do not use the phone to harass or threaten someone. If you take the situation too far, you may make your friend complicit by using his or her phone.


As with public phones: if you continually use the same friend's phone to call someone who's blocked your number, the call-blocker will probably stop answering calls from that number. He or she may even block your friend's number.

, If the person is going to hang up as soon as they hear your voice, write your friends/relatives a script and get them to talk instead. It helps if the proxy is a mutual friend – someone that the blocker trusts. This might be a good way to say what you need to say without making the blocker feel directly threatened. Make this clear in the beginning of the script.


For example: ""Hey, Allie. This is Joe McAdams, calling on behalf of Billy. I just want to pass along a short message, and then I'll let you go about your day. He says; ''. Sorry to bother you!""
You can also use a voice changer to disguise your voice. If the person has blocked your number, however, there's a good chance that there is history here – and that they will quickly identify you.

Think before you call.,
Be aware of the consequences.,
Find another way.",How to Call a Person That Has Blocked Your Number3," This person probably blocked you for a reason. Make sure that you're not harassing the person in any way, or you may exacerbate the problem. Carefully consider the ""why"". Ask yourself whether this call will actually resolve anything tangible, or whether it's just a way for you to make your presence known.


Be considerate. If you are truly making this person uncomfortable, you should give them space. Things resolve themselves in their own time – but pushing the situation too far might erase that possibility.

, If you continually call someone who doesn't want to be called, it may be grounds for them to take legal action against you. If it happens often enough, it may constitute harassment. This person could take out a restraining order and make it illegal for you to contact them, period. Consider whether this one phone call is worth it.The Caller ID Act of 2009 made it a crime to use Caller ID spoofing for harming or defrauding someone. If you use a service to block or change the way that your phone number appears, be very careful about how you use this power., Consider why you need to reach this person, and whether you can fill this need in a less invasive way. It can be very tempting to call someone and say what you need to say – but this may not be the most productive tactic if the person in question feels invaded by the prospect of speaking with you on the phone.


If you simply need to express your feelings and get closure, try writing a letter or email to the person in question. The person may feel less threatened if he or she has more time to read and respond to your words.
If it's an emergency and you legitimately need to reach or find someone: reach out to mutual friends, or contact the police. Seek out someone neutral who can help you reach this person.

Prepare the speech well in advance.,
Rehearse the speech.,
Get a good night's sleep and a proper breakfast before the speaking event.,
Find a place where you can go into the zone.,
Focus on your breathing.,
Remind yourself that you know your subject-matter and speech material before going out in front of the audience.",How to Psych Yourself Up to Give a Speech," Having the speech written and placed onto note cards or in whatever other format works for you provides a huge confidence boost that lets you relax, knowing that the content aspect has been taken care of.


Write your speech points on cue cards, or at least have a paper that has your speech written on it.;
, If you're new to presenting speeches, nothing beats rehearsal beforehand. This gives your the opportunity to test your speaking style, to play around with intonation and to watch your stance and posture in the mirror. You could record yourself on video and see what your demeanor looks like when played back. Make the most of rehearsal time to adjust the rough edges and to give you a confidence boost.


It's not recommended that you over-rehearse though; a little spontaneity helps the speech to sound more authentic, coming from your heart. Rehearse mainly for the sake of experience at speaking and getting your posture and movements accurate.







, This will ensure that you're well rested and can think straight when standing in front of the audience.

, It can be hard to cope if people are around you as you wait to give the speech. At some point, this cannot be avoided. However, try to find a spot where you can take yourself to self calm and avoid distractions for at least a few minutes prior to giving the speech. This could be a quiet corner, a separate room or even a stall in the bathroom. Use this time to breathe deeply, remind yourself that you're well prepared or know the subject matter well and to bolster your confidence.


Be aware that distractions can cause you to focus on things that are not related to your speech.

, Breathe deeply and notice your breathing pattern consciously. If you catch yourself breathing quickly or in a shallow way, deliberately make a choice to breathe more slowly and deeply, as this will help to calm you down.

, It is easy to blank when panicking or feeling anxious, and this can increase the worry. You were asked to give this speech for a reason, be it for learning, for teaching, for sharing information––so focus on the opportunity it is presenting you as much as for the audience.

Make sure the situation requires 911 assistance.,
Call if you aren’t sure.,
Dial 911 from any phone.,
Answer the dispatcher’s questions.,
Follow the dispatcher’s instructions.,
Combat the bystander effect.,
Follow through if you call by mistake.,
Don’t call 911 for the wrong reasons.",How to Call 9111," 911 is meant to help in situations involving medical emergencies, fires, or crimes in progress. If someone is hurt, injured, or facing another emergency, don’t waste time, but do think about whether or not you need this type of assistance. Times when it makes sense to call 911 include (but are not limited to):'


A fire has started and is out of control.
A burglary, assault, or other crime is in progress.
There has been a car crash or other accident.
Someone is seriously injured (bleeding severely, in shock, etc.)
Someone has suffered a medical emergency (like a heart attack, stroke, or seizure);
, 911 should not be used for non-urgent situations, because EMTs, police, or other responders may be needed elsewhere. However, if you aren’t sure if your situation requires 911, go ahead and call. It’s better to be safe than sorry., To speak with a 911 dispatcher, simply punch in the numbers “9-1-1” on any working phone and stay on the line. You can even use an unactivated cell phone to place the call.

911 works in the US and Canada. If you are in another location, you will need to call a different emergency number.
Text capabilities are growing, but still severely limited. If you need to contact 911, you should still to place a call rather than text.
If you ordinarily use special access services (like TTY) with your phone, contact your service provider for information about the best way to contact 911 in an emergency., The dispatcher will ask you to describe the emergency. Stay calm and answer any questions they have. Be assured that the dispatcher is actively working to send help to you. Even if it feels like they are wasting, the questions are meant to get you the help you need as quickly as possible. You may need to provide information like:Your address or other details about your location
Your phone number
A description of what happened
Clarification about who needs help (you, someone you are with, or a stranger)
Details of the problem (e.g., whether or not an injured person is unconscious or bleeding)
Whether you are safe or still in danger

, You should always stay on the line until the dispatcher tells you it’s ok to hang up. They may give you instructions about what to do. Follow these carefully--they can prevent further problems, and even save your life (or someone else’s). The dispatcher may give you instructions on things like:Giving first aid
Performing CPR
Moving to a safer location

, If you are helping out at the scene of an accident, injury, or other issue, crowds of people may gather and watch. If you are assisting someone and cannot call 911 yourself, point to a specific bystander and tell them to call 911.Just generally telling the crowd to call 911 will probably not work, due to the “bystander effect.” This means that people will assume that someone else is making the call, and they don’t have to.
Delegating the call to someone specific will snap them into action.

, If you or someone else (like a child) accidentally call 911, don’t hang up the phone. If you just hang up, the dispatcher may assume that an actual emergency is going on and send assistance. Instead, stay on the line and calmly tell the dispatcher that the call was a mistake., When a genuine emergency is at hand, you shouldn’t feel shy about calling 911. However, using 911 for non-urgent situations bogs down the system and keeps responders from potentially helping others who really need it. Examples of non-urgent situations include:The power is out (get in touch with the power company instead)
A fire hydrant is broken (call a fire station’s non emergency number)
A pipe has burst (call a plumber or water company)
When you need a ride to a doctor for an appointment (call them first and ask about transportation options)
Pet problems (contact a vet instead)
As a prank or just to see what happens

Depending on your situation, it may also be useful to have numbers for things like suicide prevention, addiction recovery, mental health care, or other services that you may need.

, An “In Case of Emergency” (ICE) contact is someone you would like contacted in the event you are injured or in another serious situation. If responders find this information, they can get in touch with the contact and let them know what has happened.You can label a card (“In Case of Emergency, Contact”), write down the information for your contact, and then place the card in your wallet.
You can also store the information in your phone.
If you usually lock your phone, you can save a screenshot of the ICE information and use it as the picture for your lock screen. That way, responders can still access it.

, 911 service is provided throughout the US and in Canada. If you are in another location, you will need to know the emergency number that services that location. For example, the common equivalent number in Europe is 112.

Get to the phone and answer before the third ring., While you want to move quickly when answering the phone, you should be patient enough to actually get the mouthpiece to your face. Make sure you don’t start talking until the phone is right up against you so that the person on the other end doesn’t miss any information., Once the phone is up to your face, take a deep breath before giving your introduction. This will help you keep calm and controlled, making it easier to speak slowly and collect your thoughts., You want to make sure the other person on the line has called the right place and person, so make sure they know who you and your company are. Make sure you lead with the business name.You may want to give yourself a scripted greeting so that you don’t have to think about what to say when the phone rings. This message will change slightly depending on your circumstances.


If you are a receptionist, it is important that you identify the whole company, as you are the caller’s gateway to whatever they need. Something simple like “Hello, this is wikiHow Enterprises, Nick speaking. How can I help you?” is good. This lets the caller know who you and your business are, and gives them an opening to continue talking.If you are a personal receptionist, identify the person you are working for (“This is Mr. Miller’s office, Nick speaking”), as that is the person your caller is trying to reach.If you are part of an office, let the other person know what you do so they know what kinds of questions they can ask. Identifying yourself by saying “Hello, this is Jessica in Accounting” lets the other person know if they have reached the office or person they want, and if they should talk to someone else.

, This will let you jot down information quickly if the person want to leave a message or give you other information. You don’t want to keep your caller waiting while you search for something to write with.

, Even if you aren’t in a good mood, putting a smile on your face and faking it can help you sound more pleasant to the person on the other end. It will probably help your mood a little bit as well., This is a professional setting, and it is important that both you and the other person understand each other clearly and precisely. Speak slowly and enunciate your words to make sure your information gets across.Avoid slang words like “Yep,” “Sure,” or “Nah.” Instead speak with clear words like “Yes” and “No.” You don’t want any confusion between you and the caller over what either person said. Don’t forget common polite phrases such as “Thank you” and “You’re welcome” when appropriate.
If you need to give someone specific numbers or letters, say passing along a name or phone number, it can be good to familiarize yourself with the phonetic alphabet. That way you can avoid confusion over letters that sound similar, like “B” and “V,” with helpful hints like “V as in Victory.”

, Use the person’s title (“Mr. Jones”) and not their first name, especially if you do not know the caller personally. Make sure you remember his name, and address him with it during the conversation.It may be helpful to write down the person’s name after you get it in order to help you remember.

, If someone is calling you at work, he probably has a specific problem or issue he needs resolved. If you don’t know how to answer a question or concern, don’t try. Instead, offer to transfer him to someone who can help. This also shows that you are interested and willing to help solve your caller’s problem.Many office phone systems will have a way to transfer calls. Make sure you know if your office does, and how it works. If not, get the right person’s number, and pass that information to your caller.
Be as polite as possible when doing this, and offer the transfer. Say something like “I’m afraid I can’t answer that. Would you like me to transfer you to Brian, who can help you?” Make sure the person on the other end agrees before changing the call.
If someone else isn’t available, offer to take a message. Just remember to pass that message along.

, A clear and polite “Thank you” or “Good bye” lets the other person know that the conversation has finished and she can hang up. There shouldn't be any confusion over whether or not the conversation should continue.Let the other person hang up. She initiated the call, so you want to let her finish whatever she needed when she called in the first place. If you hang up when the caller isn’t ready, it can appear rude, or you might miss important information.

Keep it professional.,
Focus on the conversation.,
Always identify yourself.,
Answer with an appropriate level of decorum.,
Be prepared to take a message.,
Be wary of information-gathering calls.",How to Answer the Phone1," When you're answering the phone at your office, you don't always know who's on the other end of the conversation. Answering the phone professionally will start whatever conversation you are about to have get off on the right foot.


When in doubt, answer with a simple ""Hello, this is Carl.""
Even if you have caller ID, it could be your boss calling from a colleague's phone! Answering the phone with ""Yeah, what?"" may give people a negative or overly-casual impression of you.;
, Be absolutely present. Stop whatever you might be doing and take a brief moment to prepare.


Wear the face that you want to project before picking up the phone. It makes a difference: whether you're smiling, frowning, or bored to tears, your caller will hear that in your tone.
Refrain from clicking around on the Internet or distracting yourself during the call. If you aren't engaged, the caller will be able to tell.

, In business situations, it is appropriate to answer the phone with your name and company: ""Good morning, thank you for calling XYZ. This is Carl. How may I help you?""


If it's an internal call, and you know it, you can answer with your department and name: ""Hello, this is WebDev, Carl speaking. How can I help you today?"" This will let your caller know they've reached the right person, and that you are ready to assist them. Keeping a friendly, personable tone will make the call much more pleasant for everybody.
In many office situations, there are guidelines for answering the phone that all employees must follow. Always project sincerity, no matter how silly the canned lines might seem—the customer will be able to tell the difference if you are enthusiastic, versus just reading the cue card: ""Welcome to Good Burger, Home of the Good Burger!"" will sound totally ridiculous if you don't say it with conviction.

, Be patient, respectful, and upbeat. Do your best to be helpful. Try not to speak too informally until you know who the caller is.If the speaker does not introduce themselves, say, ""May I ask who's calling?"" It's important to know who's calling in case you need to contact them again or transfer them to another line. This gesture also lets the caller know that he or she is being treated personally, and by extension that he or she matters. It's important to build positive working relationships with people that contact you more than once.
Try not to be rude, even if you're frustrated. Remember that in a work setting, your words and actions reflect directly upon your company. If you reflect poorly upon your company, you may drive away business--and your supervisors may not take kindly to the trend.

, If someone is calling to speak to your supervisor or co-worker, but you're the only person available to take the call, politely ask who's calling and ask them to state their purpose. Listen carefully and record as much relevant information as you can: If the person they are trying to reach is not available to speak, tell the caller, ""I'm sorry, but Mr. O'Halloran is not available right now. May I take a message?""
Be sure to record the person's name, phone number, and reason for calling. Gauge how urgent the call seems--does the caller seem like they need something taken care of within the next two hours, or just within the next week? If it is an important business call, you'll want to deal with the issue as quickly and efficiently as possible--so be sure to pass the message along as soon as you can.

, If you don't recognize a caller, and he or she requests details about you or others, be careful not to give away too much about the inner function of your company.


Even if the caller gives a name and identifies his or her company, you should be wary unless they are a trusted contact. If you aren't sure, put the caller on hold for a minute and ask a co-worker for advice: ""Have we done business with someone named Dave Neal before? He's asking a lot of questions about our processes and capacity, and I want to make sure that I can trust him.""
In a business situation, state ""I'm sorry, sir/madam. Company policy is that I am not permitted to give out that information. May I have more details on why it is required?"" and make your assessment from there.

Start with a sentence that names your company.,
Remember to always smile and seem like you are happy.,
Once you have finished the call,or you have passed on the person to the correct department put the receiver down carefully.",How to Answer Calls in Businesses," Remember to smile as you answer as that will sound much better than someone sounding like they have been there for to long.;
, It probably is a good idea to say 'Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening'. If you have numerous connections and you know that they will not want to stay talking to you say 'what department would you like to speak to'.


Here is an example of a good answer at the start of a phone call. 'Good morning, Bobs Jeans. What department would you like to speak to?'

, Even if the person at the other end of the line is annoying you. There is nothing more annoying then someone who is speaking in a low,bored monotone.

, There is nothing worse than having the phone slammed down in your ear.

Tailor your greeting to whoever is calling.,
After you say ""Hello?,
Personalize your greeting.,
Set up a voice-mail message for the times that you can't answer the phone.",How to Answer the Phone2," If you know who's calling, based on caller ID and experience, feel free to greet that person as you would face-to-face. If you don't know who's calling, answer more formally and wait for the caller to state their purpose.


For a standard, internationally-accepted greeting: say, ""Hello?"" Answer with a slight upward inflection at the end of your greeting, as though you were asking a question. ""Hello?"" This will prompt the caller to respond, and in most cases they will go on to explain why they're calling.
If a friend is calling, greet them casually: ""Hey, Tom! How's it going?""
If a supervisor, an acquaintance, or a potential employer is calling, greet them more formally, but with an air of familiarity: ""Good evening, Mr. Lynch. How are you?""
If you do not know who's calling, revert to a simple ""Hello?""

,"", wait for the caller to respond. When you say ""Hello?"", you prompt the caller to introduce him or herself. Review the following example, with your words in bold and the caller's words in italics:


""Hello?""
""Hey, Carl, it's Tom.""
""Oh, hey Tom! What's up?""
""I'm just calling to see if you're around later. I was thinking about going to see the new Star Wars movie.""
""Heck yeah, I'm down to see the new Star Wars movie!""

, As you become more experienced at answering the phone, you may begin to develop greeting patterns and specific phrases that you use over and over.


Consider identifying yourself with your greeting: ""Hello, this is Carl."" or ""Carl speaking.""
Consider experimenting with informal variations of ""Hello?"": ""Hey!"" or ""Hiya!"" or ""Hey, what's up?"" or ""Hey, how's it going?"" These informal greetings are best suited to friends and non-professional acquaintances.

, Anyone from friends to parents to employers might wind up hearing your voice-mail message, so make sure that it's polite and direct. Avoid joke or prank voice-mail recordings unless you're absolutely sure that only your friends will be calling.


Say, ""You've reached Carl's voice-mailbox. I'm sorry that I can't make it to the phone right now. Leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.""
Consider setting up a family recording if you're using a home phone. Say, ""Hi, this is the Rogers family. Sorry we can't come to the phone right now, but leave us a message and we'll call you back as soon as we can!"" Feel free to have fun with family recordings--try having your whole family speak as a chorus, or have each family member say part of the message.
Consider asking directly for caller details, instead of just asking callers to leave a message: ""Please leave your name, number, and purpose for calling, and I will return your call as soon it's convenient."" This more specific approach may be most appropriate for a number at which you expect to receive a lot of professional calls.

"
"
Consider who might be calling you.,
Be on the lookout for prank calls.,
Be wary of telemarketers.",How to Answer the Phone3," If you are expecting a call from anyone--a new acquaintance, an organization, or a potential employer--answer the phone with this in mind. Gauge whether the situation calls for a slightly-more-formal or a slightly-less-formal greeting--but err on the side of formality, just in case.


Answer politely and semi-formally, in this case. A simple ""Hello?"" will do. You do not need to identify yourself immediately--if the caller knows you personally, or has your name on a list, he or she will ask: ""Hi, may I speak to Carl?""
If the call is listed as ""unknown,"" or ""blocked,"" you need not feel obligated to answer the phone. Answer, if you like, or simply wait to see if the caller leaves a voicemail. You can always call someone back, if it's important.

, If you answer the phone and the call quickly becomes ridiculous or offensive, you may have been prank-called. Some prank callers are vulgar and obvious, but other prank callers will try to trick you into thinking that it's a legitimately important call. Deal with prank callers as you would deal with bullies: if you stay on the line and play into their prank, it will only encourage them. It may useful to stay on the line and play along, however, if it gives you insight into who is calling. Some U.S. phone companies offer a call-tracking service: if you dial *69 once you've hung up the phone, an automated message service will give you any public information about the last number that called you., If you answer a call from an unknown number, and the person on the other end of the line begins to ask you questions about yourself, they may be trying to get your money.


Telemarketers call dozens of people each day, and many of these people are not interested in what they're selling. Don't feel bad about saying, ""Thanks for calling, but I'm not interested. Have a great day!"" and hanging up. Don't waste your time or theirs.
If you don't want to receive any more calls from this particular company, ask the telemarketer to place your number onto their ""Do Not Call"" list. Many companies will comply with your request, and they won't bother you anymore.
If you're interested in what a telemarketer is selling, feel free to stay on the line and listen to the pitch. Bear in mind that the longer you stay on the line, the more they'll try to sell you!
If they ask for you or another member of your household, ask them for their name and organization before you tell them anything—the last thing you want to do is give telemarketers too much information! If they're cagey or won't say who they are, remember—you're under no obligation to continue speaking to them.

Check your assumptions.,
Be courteous.,
Check for understanding.,
Follow up.,
Understand body language.,
Listen closely.,
Avoid interrupting.,
Ask questions.,
Organize information.,
Use fewer words.,
Focus on one topic.,
Get right to the point.",How to Avoid Miscommunication," Thinking about your words allows you to organize your thoughts and prepare to say something meaningful. Especially if you’re about to have an important conversation, make sure your words are organized so that you can say what you mean.


Remember that your attitude and tone can communicate quite a lot. Keep your focus narrow and try not to get off topic.
If you have trouble saying what you want to say, write down some bullet points to make sure you cover all you want to say.;
, Having a person's attention means making sure they are listening and understanding the words you say. Make eye contact and check in to make sure they are listening. If the other person is distracted or in the middle of doing something else, either get their attention or try another time. If they seem distracted by other things, ask for their attention by saying, “I need to make sure you understand this” or, “I’d appreciate your full attention.”If the person seems distracted, say that you’ll talk later when they are more available.
For example, if you need to talk to someone yet they’re in the middle of something, let them know that you need to talk and want their attention.

, You might assume that people understand what you’re saying or asking them to do. However, clarify anything that the person might be unsure about. For example, if you’re giving directions, clarify anything the person might need to do as prep-work. You may over- or under-estimate the amount of knowledge or ability someone has, so it’s best to ask.This is especially true if you’re talking to someone from a different culture than yourself. You might assume they understand slang or other speech, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. If someone looks confused, try explaining it better.

, Being courteous in your communication means being open, honest, and kind. You don’t say anything that might be passive-aggressive, sarcastic, or jabbing toward or about the person you’re talking to. Focus on being friendly and saying what you mean in a way that’s easily understood. If you're interrupting other people, being rude, and disrespectful, you will not communicate effectively.Sarcasm is something that can be easily misunderstood. If you use sarcasm as part of your humor, make sure you indicate that you’re being sarcastic by grossly exaggerating your statements. Otherwise, people might think you are mean.

, Check in with the person to make sure they have understood you. This can be as simple as saying, “Does that make sense?” or, “Do you have any questions?” This gives them the opportunity to voice any concerns or problems they have.This can help people feel comfortable to ask questions or seek clarification.
If you’re giving directions, ask them to be repeated back to you to ensure understanding.

, Follow-up with the person you’re communicating with to make sure you communicated clearly. For example, if you sent an email, send another asking, “How is everything going? Do you have any questions?” if you spoke to someone, ask them a day or two later, “Just checking in. Everything okay?”If you think you may have miscommunicated, use this time to communicate clearly and clear anything that may be confusing.

, Much of communication is nonverbal. Pay attention; it can be very important. Maintain eye contact and notice any changes in your eye contact or the other person’s eye contact. Notice a person’s posture and facial expressions and see if there are any inconsistencies. If you do notice differences, ask a question again or seek clarification., Give your full attention when someone is speaking. Many people try to think about what they will say next, but stay engaged with the person who is speaking. People appreciate feeling heard and understood, and one of the best ways to do this is through actively listening. Turn your body toward them and lean in. Don’t turn to distractions (like cell phones) and stay present with the person.Don’t just hear the words the person is saying, listen for information and how they are communicating. For example, the person’s voice might change when talking about something emotional or when they feel uncomfortable.

, If someone else is speaking, do your best not to interrupt them. Let them complete their thoughts before adding to them or saying something else. This shows that you’re listening and care about what they are saying. If you tend to interrupt people often, they may feel frustrated in talking to you and may not communicate all they wish to say.Letting someone complete their thoughts means that you’re fully listening and are not preoccupied with your own words. This way, they will feel more comfortable in sharing everything and won’t miss something they meant to say because the conversation got sidetracked.

, If anything is unclear or if there is anything that you do not quite understand, then make sure to ask a question about it. Try saying something like, ""Would you mind clarifying what you mean by ___?"" or ""I'm not sure I understand ___. Can you elaborate?""

If the person is still talking and you don't want to interrupt them, jot the question down so that you do not forget to ask them about it.

, If you're trying to communicate information, you need to be sure the information gets to the person effectively. For example, if you're planning an event, you need to give important details, like place, time, and what people need to bring. Spell out any directions or steps people need to take and make sure the information is clear.


Before you send the information or invitation, check to make sure it has all the information necessary.

, When communicating through texts or emails, use fewer words. A lengthy or wordy email can convolute what you’re trying to say. For example, if you’re making a request of something, get right to it and make your request. You might say why you need the request done, but don’t go on and on. Simply state what you need and end the email shortly after.If you tend to write lengthy emails or texts, people will likely skim them instead of reading them thoroughly. If you can’t get away from your long letters, consider putting the most important things at the top.
Keep in mind that it can be hard to express the tone in an email, so you might want to include emojis to help convey the tone.

, Keep the message as simple as possible. Don't ramble or go on to a lot of extra details, and avoid addressing several topics in one email. It’s best to focus on one item or topic at a time instead of lots of things in one email. If you have several things to address, talk about one at a time per email. That way, the person can delete each email as they address each topic and not forget to do something or address something.If you insist on addressing several topics at once, delineate them clearly. Use bullet-points or other organization to help clarify the content.

, While it’s okay to start your emails with, “How are you?” or another pleasantry, don’t spend too much time talking about something unrelated from what you want. Zero in on your request or information you want to share with the person. Don’t dance around it or provide a lengthy lead-up. Instead, get to the point of what you want to or have to say."

"
Understand the environment you're in.,
Try to identify who's calling.,
Should you choose to answer the phone, say, ""Hello."",
Listen to what the other says and act accordingly.,
Keep your surroundings and your situation in mind.,
All calls end.",How to Answer the Phone Correctly," Are you at work? Are you at home? Are you outside? Where are you?


This is an important part of answering phones, because if you're at work, chances are there's a protocol to follow or there are calls you probably shouldn't be taking (such as those from a friend or family member, seeing as the phone should be restricted to customers or clientele). You might not want to be too loud, and of course, a professional manner is a given.
If you're at home, it's a different story, but there are still things to consider. Is it loud? Is it your cell phone or home phone that's ringing? You may need to take the call outside to make sure both parties can hear each other, especially if you want to be courteous to the one calling and those around you. If it's your home phone, and you have family or friends or otherwise living with you, the call may not necessarily be for you. If everyone is out and you happen to know the call is for your mother or your roommate, take the call if you have to, but evaluate on your own whether answering the phone yourself is wise.
If you're outside or in a building, then the situation can greatly vary. If you're in the middle of having a conversation, decide quickly whether the call is worth the disruption. If you're somewhere where silence is key or answering the phone is impolite, try to turn off the volume and put off answering unless absolutely necessary.;
,


First is the caller ID. Sometimes it simply says ""Unknown,"" or gives a name or business you don't recognize, but it may also be familiar. Is it a friend? Is it your internet service provider or your work?
Second is the phone number itself. If the caller ID didn't give you an idea, then does the number? Have you changed phones recently, and forgotten to add this person to your contacts? Is the area code local, or is it the area code of a distant family member or friend who might be calling? Is it a number that has been calling you a lot recently?
It's also true that over-thinking it isn't necessary. An in-depth study will only let the call go to voicemail. Quickly look over the ID and the number, and decided whether or not you want to answer. Sometimes it's best to answer quickly, such as for business or because you know that person only calls when it's an emergency, and sometimes you might want to let the caller wait a second longer for tactical or situational reasons, such as trying to not appear overly eager or because there is something you have to do first.

, If you've got a form to follow, of course, you might say, ""Hello, you've reached the So-and-So Business, how may I help you?"" Starting with a greeting is the right way to go. You don't need to provide information about yourself right off the bat. Also, asking direct questions as soon as you pick up isn't good, either--for example, asking, ""Who is this?"" or ""What do you want?"" may alienate the caller, and if not, are rude nonetheless. You haven't necessarily had the time to figure out what the other person wants. If you give them the chance, they'll probably tell you.

,


Judge the situation. If your friend needs help with something, work towards a solution. If it's about something that's been misunderstood or about something you might've done wrong, clear up the problem. If it's a solicitor that has been calling every day, and you recognize the pattern as soon as they start to talk, politely decline any suggestions or advertisements and ask to be put on the Do Not Call list--unless you are genuinely interested in what they're saying and you're certain it isn't a scam.
Decipher the caller's emotions and control your own. Sometimes you're angry with the person calling, or they're angry with you. Sometimes they're sad and seeking comfort. Sometimes they just want to have a fun conversation. How you respond is all about basic social skills. Don't antagonize someone who's angry, and don't disregard someone who's sad. If you're mad that someone is plaguing you with phone calls, calmly request that they stop calling, or report the harassment if it doesn't end.

, This is critical as related to several factors.


Think about how long the call should go on. If you're keeping someone waiting, or you're in the middle of something relatively important, it doesn't mean you can't be polite with the caller, but it also means you can't let the call take away precious time. Try to steer the conversation in the right direction if need be. If you have work obligations or something else you really need to be doing, even though the caller may be a friend and the conversation is enjoyable, you still have responsibilities that you need to fulfill, and it's important not to forget them.
Think again about where you are, just like you did before you took the call. Have you ever encountered someone who you think is obnoxious because they won't get off the phone? Maybe they're in your way, or you have business with them--the point of the matter is, what you want or need is being obstructed by this person on the phone. Try not to be that person. Make sure not to stand in front of doorways or entrances, because people might want to get by, and if you're in a setting where someone might approach you for help or consultation, or just to talk to you in general, be polite to both parties. Don't make people wait too long; whether they say it or not, most don't like waiting, and become frustrated. This leaves a bad impression.

, You've already decided who's calling, you've learned their purpose and rolled with it, and you've balanced your time and kept an eye on your surroundings. When the call ends is usually up to you, although not always. The key is to how you end it.


Wrap things up. Make sure all questions have been covered, all necessary information gained or given. If you or the caller want to schedule another call or a meeting, this is generally the time to do it. Share and solidify plans so there's no confusion. Are you going to consult this person again at a later date? Do you have a reason to meet with the caller? Maybe you want to schedule a dinner, or discuss who's going to be taking care of your mother that weekend, or confirm when you are supposed to come in for a shift at work. This is the time to make things clear.
End the call, hopefully, on a positive note. Hanging up suddenly might miff the other person, especially if they're prone to get easily irritated. It's simply rude, and though sometimes you might want to be rude, it's best just to stifle the urge. Say ""Bye"" or ""See you then"" in more informal situations, but sometimes a ""Thank you for your time"" or ""I look forward to speaking with you again"" are more appropriate. Sometimes being wordy and spending a second or two longer in ending the call is the right way to show you care.

""I'm sorry, I think I misheard you...""
""I'm a bit unclear with that explanation...""
""I think I might have missed something while I was taking notes here..."";
, State something that you do understand about the topic. This will show that you understand something about it and make you sound smarter.


""...I understand that King Henry wanted to split with the Catholic Church so that he could get a divorce....""
""...I understand that the job includes benefits...""
""...I understand that intake is up across the board...""

,


""...but I don't understand how that led to the creation of the Church of England.""
""...but I'm unclear on whether or not you include dental in that.""
""...but I think I missed why we're responding this way.""

, You want to project the idea that you're perfectly smart and you were totally paying attention, there was just some communication mix up.

, If they respond and tell you that the information was plainly stated, have a response ready to make yourself seem smarter.


""Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said something completely different and thought it seemed a bit off. I didn't want to be rude and presume you were wrong. It's my fault, I apologize."" And so on....

, When you talk, use proper English with a reasonable vocabulary and good grammar. Do the best that you can. This will go a long way towards making you and your question seem more intelligent.

, When asking questions of a potential employer, you want to show that you think really hard about how you work and how you'd work well in that particular environment. Show them that you're in line with their company values and policies. Ask questions like:


""Can you please describe a typical week in this position?""
""What opportunities will I have for growth and advancement?""
""How does this company manage its employees?""

, When asking questions of an interviewee, you should be looking for signs of what type of employee they'll be. Avoid the standard questions, as you'll get a pre-packaged response rather than pure honesty, which is more likely to come out when you ask unique questions. Try asking questions like:


""What types of work would you not want to do in this position?"" This question reveals weaknesses that you can expect.
""How do you think this job will have to change in the next 5 years? 10?"" This question reveals how they respond to change and whether they can plan ahead.
""When is it okay to break the rules?"" This question is great at evaluating their ethics and whether or not they can adapt to complex situations or remain rigid.

, People will be most likely to answer your online questions if they are, in fact, reasonable questions. People don't want to answer something that you could have found out for yourself with 2 minutes and a Google search (or a wikiHow!). To increase your chances even further, read the sections below. In the mean time make sure to:


Always research first. Do basic research to try to answer your own question.
Keep calm. Getting angry of flustered and having that show in writing will generally make people either ignore or make fun of you.
Use the best spelling and grammar possible. This will show that you're serious and expect a serious answer. If you aren't sure about your spelling or grammar, try typing it into Word or Google Docs to get a quick spelling and grammar check.

, Questions asked in business meetings can vary widely, depending on the business and what role you play. If the previous and following sections don't help, you can at least follow these basic ideas:


Ask questions that move things forward and solve problems. Ask questions about whether or not the meeting is on task. Figure out how the discussion topic relates to problems that the company is facing.
Get to the point. Don't ramble. This will make people tune out and be dismissive.
Look to the future. Ask questions about how the company needs to adapt in the future and what major hurdles will need to be overcome in order to succeed.

, The most important thing, to ask a question intelligently is to have as much information to start off with, know a bit of what you're talking about, and to not be asking a dumb question. Generally there is no such thing as a dumb question, but if you could have answered it yourself with a quick Google search, then that is pretty dumb. Read below to really perfect your question before you ask it.

, You need to decide what the intended goal of your question is. What will the answer help you accomplish, really? This will be helpful in deciding what information you require from the person you’re asking. The more specifics you know about what you need, the more intelligent your questions will be and the smarter you will appear.

, Before you ask, think about what you do know about the topic and what you don’t know. Do you have a lot of information and only need small details? Do you know almost nothing? The more information you know about a topic, the more intelligent your questions can be.

, Examine what you know about the topic and what you’re confused about. Are you sure about the things that you do know? Oftentimes what we think we know creates questions that don’t really have answers because our initial information was wrong. It may be a good idea to do some basic fact checking, if you can.

, It may be possible to answer your own questions, by looking at the problem from all sides. A new approach may help you see something you couldn’t see before, resolving any problems you had on the issue.

, If you still have questions and the opportunity is available, you should do your own research before asking the question. Knowing as much as you can about the subject before asking the question is the most important part about asking a question intelligently. That you are acquainted with the subject will show when you talk about it.

, Once you’ve done your research, you will be better informed about exactly what information you need. Consider this and, if possible, write it down so you don’t forget anything when you’re ready to ask.

, Another major component of asking a question intelligently is making sure that you’re asking the right person. Being informed about the issue will help you be better prepared for this, but under certain circumstances you still might want to be sure that you’re contacting the correct person (if you are trying to contact a particular department or otherwise asking someone you do not know for help, for example).

, When you ask your question, use the best grammar and pronunciation that you can. Speak clearly and enunciate. This will not only make you appear more intelligent, but it will help make sure that the person you are asking can understand you and what you want to know.

, Try to be as specific as you can and use specific language. Don’t use hyperbole, and make sure to ask about what you really want to ask about. For example, don’t ask a business person if they’re hiring at all, if you’re really only interested in a particular position. Similarly, don’t ask if they have a position open, but instead ask if they are hiring for the position you’re looking for or would be qualified for.

, You are seeking information to fill a gap in your knowledge and here is the person who may have the answer, so be polite! If appropriate, if you do not really feel comfortable with the response or feel that it does not respond to what you have asked, proceed gently by asking how they know this information. Ask what the general trend is that would short cut a path to that knowledge, meaning that you are seeking the tools to answer the questions yourself from this point onwards.

, Don’t ramble or explain anything more than what is needed to understand your problem and answer the question. Extra information can be distracting and may cause you to get an answer for an entirely different question that what you wanted to ask, if the person you’re asking misunderstands your purpose.


For example, don’t tell your doctor all about your day leading up to your health problem. They don’t need to know that you got on the bus late that morning. What they do need to know is that you ate a different breakfast than normal and now your stomach hurts.

, Depending on the situation, you my want to be sure you’re asking either open ended or closed ended questions.When you need a specific answer or a firm yes or no, try to use closed ended questions. When you need as much information as possible, use open ended questions.


Open ended questions usually start with phrases like “why” and “tell me more about”.
Closed ended questions usually start with phrases like “when” and “who”.

, Sound confident when you ask. Don’t be apologetic or self-deprecating. This will make you seem like you are more intelligent and make someone less likely to judge you on what you’re asking. This is more important in some situations than in others. If you’re asking a teacher a question, don’t worry about this. If you’re asking a question in a job interview, however, it’s probably a good idea.

, Filler language is language like “erm”, ”um”, “uh“, “ah”, “em”, “like”, etc. These are words you put in a sentence while you’re looking for the next word you want to use. Most people do it completely unconsciously. Use as little filler language as possible if you want to appear more intelligent, and want your question to seem more well-thought-out.

, If it helps and the situation allows, you should consider explaining why you’re asking or what your eventual goal is. This may help clear up misunderstandings and may help the person you are asking to give you information you didn’t even know you needed.

, This indicates that you are only asking the question to prove to the other person that you are right and they are wrong, meaning that you are argumentative and not open-minded. Ask because you are genuinely interested. Otherwise, you will receive a defensive and less than helpful response.


Don't ask: ""Isn't it true that more people would be well-fed if we ate grains directly rather than feeding it to animals and eating their meat?""
Ask: ""Many vegetarians argue that there would be more food available if society didn't invest in meat production. The argument seems to make sense, but do you know of any arguments on the flip side?""

, The most important part of asking a question is to just ask! There is essentially no such thing as a stupid question so you shouldn’t be ashamed to be asking for help. Asking questions is what truly smart people do! Also, the longer you put off asking, the more difficult your problem may become.

, If you find the information provider is beginning to feel uncomfortable and maybe out of their depth, do not press the issues. Unless you are questioning in a professional capacity as a journalist, senator, or lawyer, it is rare that a public grilling amounts to any good under most situations. As a member of the public or a student in class, you are seeking information, not a roasting. Back down and thank them. Often there will be time afterwards to chase them down and discuss things privately. Even if you are trying to extract information in the public interest, you have to realize that a delicate approach may be necessary to get real answers.

, If you want to get the most from the answer you are given, you need to start by listening to what the person has to say.Only intervene if they have clearly misunderstood an important piece of information and do so politely.

, It may seem like they’ve neglected an important piece of information but don’t probe for more until they’re done talking. They may not have gotten to their full answer yet or they may be waiting to get to that part of the answer because there is other information you have to understand first.

, Think through all of the information they just gave you. Think about how the answer applies to your problem and if all of your questions were addressed. Don’t just take the information at face value, either. If something seems off, you might have gotten bad information! Just because you asked someone a question doesn’t mean they’ll have the right answer.

, If the answer they gave you doesn’t make sense or there is something about it that you don’t understand, don’t be too embarrassed to ask for further clarification. This will help keep further problems from arising because you did not get all the information you needed.

, Ask more questions if they come up until you have as complete an answer as possible. You may find that you bring up questions and information that didn’t occur to you originally. Asking more questions will also show the person that you’re asking that you’re really processing and appreciating the information they’re giving you.

, You can also ask for general advice in the area you’re asking about, if the person is an expert. They have a lot of information you don’t, but they’ve also been in a position where they had to learn all this information. They probably have some pro-tips that they wish someone had given them.

Make sure to listen.",How to Ask Open Ended Questions," Before you can start effectively asking open-ended questions, you need to know what that is. An open-ended question is a question that requires a full answer using the subject's own knowledge or feelings. These questions are objective, don't lead the person being asked, and result in an answer with many words.Examples of open-ended questions are:


""What happened after I left?""
""Why did Jim leave before Susan?""
""Tell me about your day at work.""
""What do you think about the new season of this TV show?"";
, A closed-ended question is answered in a short or single-word answer. They are used to obtain facts and specific pieces of information.Examples of closed-ended questions are:


""Who will you choose?""
""What brand of car do you own?""
""Did you speak to Bob?""
""Did Susan leave with Jim?""
""Did everyone finish all the cake?""
Closed-ended questions bring conversations to a halt. They don't invite people to elaborate, talk about themselves, or give the questioner any information about the questionee.

, Sometimes, people think they have asked open-ended questions when they haven't. To successfully ask open-ended questions in conversation, be knowledgeable of their characteristics.


They require a person to pause, think, and reflect.
Answers will not be facts, but personal feelings, opinions, or ideas about a subject.
When using open-ended questions, the control of the conversation switches over to the person being asked the question, which begins an exchange between the people. If the control of the conversation stays with the person asking questions, you are asking closed-ended questions. This technique makes it feel more like an interview or interrogation than a conversation.Avoid questions that have the following characteristics: answers provide facts; they are easy to answer; and answers are given quickly and require little to no thought.Questions that reflect these things are closed-ended.

, To make sure you actually ask open-ended questions, you need to understand the language involved. Open-ended questions begin in very specific ways.


Open-ended questions begin with the following words: why, how, what, describe, tell me about..., or what do you think about...
Although ""tell me about"" does not begin a question, the result is the same as asking an open-ended question.
Closed-ended questions also have a specific language. If you want to avoid closed-ended questions, don't start questions with the following verbs: are/was, did/did, will, won’t, didn’t, aren’t, would, if.

, One of the main reasons to use open-ended questions is to obtain deep, meaningful, and thoughtful answers. Asking questions in this way invites people to open up, because you are showing that you are interested in what they have to say.


Don't use closed-ended questions when you want meaningful answers. These questions can bring a conversation to a screeching halt. One word answers make it hard to build any kind of conversation or relationship. Closed-ended questions also usually provide inadequate answers as well.
Ask open-ended questions when you want detailed explanations to build off of.
Use open-ended questions to expand the conversation after asking a closed-ended question to gather a fact or one word answer. Take the fact or one word answer, and build an entire conversation of open-ended questions from there., Open-ended questions can be too open sometimes. Wording is very important when asking open-ended questions, especially if you are looking for a certain type of answer.If you're trying to set a friend up on a date, you might ask them, ""What are you looking for in a person?"" They might answer with physical characteristics, when you wanted them to talk about personality. Instead, ask a more specific question with parameters: ""What personality traits are you looking for in a person?""

, For this method, start with narrow, then transition to broad and open. This method is good if you are trying to get specific details from someone. It also works if you are trying to get someone interested in a topic, or trying to get someone to feel more confident.If you're struggling to get the person to open up with broad open-ended questions, try narrowing the questions first and then make them broader after getting them into the conversation.An example of this would be when talking to your kids. You might ask a question like, ""What happened at school today?"" ""Nothing"" is the response. Follow-up with something like, ""What writing assignments are you working on?"" More than likely, this will spark a conversation.

, Use open-ended questions as follow ups for other questions. These follow ups can be asked after open or closed-ended questions.


Ask ""why"" and ""how"" to follow up and gain a lengthier answer after asking a closed-ended question.
When someone has finished talking, ask them an open-ended question that refers to what they just said, or is related to what they just said. This keeps the conversation flowing in an open and engaging way.

, Open-ended questions are one of the best ways to connect with someone through conversation. Unlike closed-ended questions, open-ended questions encourage deeper, more meaningful exchanges between two people. Open-ended questions indicate the questioner is interested in listening to the questionee's response.


Ask these questions to find out more about a person. Many times, open-ended questions encourage people to talk about themselves. By asking follow up questions, you can continue discovering things about the person.
These questions can demonstrate care, compassion, or concern for someone else. Open-ended questions require more involved, personal answers. By asking ""How are you feeling"" or ""Why are you crying?"", you invite a person to share their feelings with you. Asking ""are you okay?"" just requires someone to answer ""yes"" or ""no.""
Ask open-ended questions to generate conversation with quiet, nervous, or new people.It could help them feel at ease and encourage them to open up.
Use open-ended questions to avoid pressuring, tricking, or influencing a person's response. Most open-ended questions are neutral questions. The way that closed-ended questions are worded can cause a person to feel pressured to answer a certain way.For example, a leading question might be, ""Don't you think the dress is cute?"", while a neutral open-ended question would be, ""How do you like the dress?"" Tags such as ""isn't it?"", ""don't you?"" or ""can't they?"" can turn questions into leading questions, suggesting that the person you're talking to agree with you. Don't use them with open-ended questions.
Be careful not to ask people questions that are too personal or require too much personal information. Gauge the questionee's comfort level when asking questions. If you ask a question that is too personal, just ask another, less personal question.

, Open-ended questions are great for discussions. They encourage different answers, opinions, and solutions. They also encourage creative thinking and validate people's ideas.


Open-ended questions engage language skills in a sophisticated way. You can use open-ended questions with children and new language learners to help them stimulate their thinking and improve their language abilities., Conversation is an art many people have trouble with. Talking to new people can be scary, but open-ended questions can help you encourage others to talk.

, Open-ended questions can be probing questions. There are two different methods to ask probing questions:


Probing for clarity. If you ask an open-ended question that results in a general answer, ask another open-ended question for clarity. For example, if you ask someone ""Why do you like living here"" and she responds, ""because of the scenery,"" you can ask her an additional question for clarity, such as, ""Which scenery?""
Probing for completeness. Once a complete, clear answer has been given to an open-ended question, you can ask more questions to get additional information. Examples of questions that probe for clarity are ""What else do you like?"" or ""What other reason did you have?""Don't use ""Is there anything else?"" This is a closed-ended question, and can result in a simple ""no"" answer.

, One of the results of open-ended questions is creativity. Certain types of open-ended questions require answers that encourage people to expand the limits of their thinking.


Some open-ended questions require predictions. Questions like, ""Who will win the election"" or ""What effect would this candidate's election have on our state?"" require people to come up with possible scenarios.
These questions also sometimes make people consider consequences. By asking someone, ""What would happen if..."" or ""what would happen if you..."", you are inviting them to think about the cause and effects of a given scenario., This makes the conversation more even, and helps you take part in the conversation in a way other than asking questions. To get someone to ask you questions, try not giving all the details of a story or opinion at once., Asking the right questions is pointless if you don't listen. Sometimes we are guilty of formulating the next question without paying attention to the answer to the first. You miss great opportunities for follow up questions if you do this. Make an effort to listen to the answer you asked for.

Think about the situation or occasion.,
Identify your goal.,
Know your audience.,
Consider the method of your communication.,
Watch your words.,
Be intentional with your body language.,
Pay attention to the other person's feedback.",How to Adapt the Way You Communicate to Different Situations," The context of your communication makes a difference both in the way you engage with others and in the way they interpret your communication.


Remember that time and place matter. A joke that would be a hit with your friends may not be appropriate at the office. Similarly, pouring your heart out to a dear friend is different from doing so with a young child.
Identify the level of formality. Formal occasions like ceremonies and business presentations require more formal language and dress. Informal occasions like hanging out with your family or friends allow you to be more relaxed and casual.;
, Know the purpose of your interaction so you can adapt your communication effectively. For example, if you want to build a friendship with a colleague, you may invite them out for a cup of coffee or ask them to join you for lunch. But if you want to keep your work and personal lives separate, you will probably keep your communication polite and professional.

, To adapt your communication effectively, you need to understand who you are talking with. See things from their view and tailor your communication to them as much as possible.


Recognize your relationship with the audience. With a good friend, you will probably be able to be more upfront and blunt. With a supervisor, you will want to speak with respect. With a cashier, you may want to be friendly, but conservative.
Acknowledge differences in personality. For example, extroverts like to communicate face-to-face, over the phone, and in large groups. They tend to think aloud. Introverts prefer to talk through emails, text messages, and in one-on-one conversations. They often need time to reflect before answering questions.
Conduct an audience analysis. Look at the age span, gender, education level, values, cultures, family structures, and background experiences of those in your audience. This is especially helpful when giving speeches to unfamiliar audiences.

, Each method of communication has advantages and disadvantages. If you are able to choose, pick the method that would be most effective for your audience. Otherwise, work within its existing structure.


During meetings, participate by sharing ideas, but also take the time to listen. Do not monopolize the discussion.
When giving a speech, realize that you are the only one talking. Anticipate questions your audience may have and try to address those in your communication.
When engaging in social media, you can be more relaxed. Communication often occurs in one- or two-sentence segments. Be casual, but concise.
Email and text messaging require a conscious choice of words. Be direct. Express tone through your words or the use of emoticons (smiley faces).

, Be intentional with the language you use. Words can help you quickly connect with someone, but they may also offend them.


Choose words based on the age, education, and literacy level of the person(s) you are talking with. Use words they understand and can connect with.
Use technical words only if you are communicating with people who know what they mean. If you must use jargon, take the time to explain what it means.

, Body language can be interpreted differently in different situations. Adapt your nonverbal communication to the situation at hand.


Eye contact is generally a good way to connect with the person you are talking with. However, if it is an extremely sensitive situation, sitting side-by-side with someone can remove the pressure of having to look someone in the eyes and thus make the other person more comfortable.
Personal space varies both by culture, by individual, and by relationship. With your significant other, you may sit close enough that your legs or shoulders are touching. However, when you sit near a supervisor or complete stranger, you want to leave some distance between you.

, Some people may offer verbal feedback by asking questions. You can also watch their nonverbal communication -- crossing their arms, looking away, yawning, nodding -- to see how they are responding to what you are saying.


If they seem nervous, make sure you are in a place where they feel comfortable. Engage them in small talk to help them calm down. Ask questions to get to know them better.
If they seem confused, explain it again in different words. Ask them what part confuses them. Find visuals, metaphors, or illustrations to demonstrate your point clearly.
If they seem upset, listen to them and try to understand why. Wait to voice your own thoughts or attempt to persuade them differently.

Stay positive and take action according to the situation.,
Evaluate your overall job satisfaction.",How to Answer a Phone Call from Your Boss," Answering the phone too early can make it seem like you’re not too busy, while waiting too long before answering makes it seem as though the caller isn’t a priority.


In a professional setting, you should do this regardless of who’s calling you. Don’t reserve this or any point of phone etiquette for when your boss shows up on your caller ID, since every co-worker, client, and vendor will be more receptive to a professionally polite demeanor. Plus, you can never know for sure when your boss might be calling from another line.;
, When you answer the phone, strive to be professional and pleasant. For example, if incoming calls are generally from other co-workers in your organization or if you know your boss is on the other end of the line, say, “This is John Smith. How can I help you today?”


For larger organizations with multiple departments, you might also wish to include your department in your greeting: “This is John Smith in Sales. How can I help you?”
When answering a phone call from an outside line, you should state the name of your company, even if you suspect your boss might be the one calling. For example, you might say, “Good afternoon! This is ABC Widgets, John Smith speaking. How can I help you?”

, It’s best to do this before you answer the phone, but if you are unable to do so in time, your next option is to complete the action in as quiet and discreet a manner as possible. Talking with food or gum in your mouth can make you sound unprofessional, and can often be detected by the caller on the other end.

, This prevents miscommunication between you and your boss, which can cause problems down the road. Also, your boss may become frustrated if he or she has problems communicating with you due to muffled talking and poor audio quality.You should also try smiling as you answer and talk on the phone. Most callers, including your boss, can hear a smile through your voice and tone. This can reflect favorably on your boss, especially if you work in industries associated with sales and customer service.

, When your boss is on the phone, make sure you pay attention. Stop whatever you're working on--even if it's an assignment your boss gave you earlier--and be prepared to listen to what your boss says.


As a general rule, avoid responding to external distractions when your boss is talking with you. For instance, if a co-worker walks into your office while you're on the phone, politely gesture to the phone in your hand to indicate your current inability to speak.

, This helps you stay prepared in the event your boss gives you important information such as times, dates, addresses, or directions for a specific task. This also allows you to jot down any questions you might have for your boss in return.


Consider keeping a notepad and pen on your desk or in the top drawer, where it will be readily accessible. Having a notepad nearby will allow you to take notes for both planned and unplanned phone calls.
If you don’t have a notepad available but you’re sitting at your computer, you can open a blank note or word processing document and take notes using that. Be aware, however, that your boss will be able to hear any loud typing you do; you’ll need to take extra care to demonstrate active listening, so that your boss will be less inclined to wonder if your keyboard clicks are truly related to the conversation.

, Take a few quiet, deep breaths, and take a sip of water if needed to help you stay calm. Symptoms of anxiety can be heard over the telephone, especially if you’re breathing hard, or your voice sounds nervous and shaky. Staying calm also helps you feel and sound more confident and in control.


If you know your boss is about to call, try taking a short walk beforehand to release nervous energy. Even a walk around your office or department can help. Just make sure you're back with plenty of time to spare for your boss's phone call.
If you need to calm down immediately before or during the call, try some deep breathing. Inhale as quietly as possible through your nose over a span of four to five seconds; hold for another three seconds, then exhale quietly over another four to five. The increased oxygen should help release tension and clear your mind., Since your boss isn’t speaking to you in person, it’s important that you clearly understand everything he or she tells you over the phone. Don’t be afraid to ask your boss to repeat and explain things you didn’t hear or understand correctly the first time.


In fact, it might be a good idea to ask for clarification or to confirm details periodically, even if you have a clear understanding of your boss’s instructions. This might be as simple as summarizing the instructions in your own words before hanging up. By demonstrating active listening, you assure your boss that you were paying attention and present an overall professional demeanor.

, This conveys preparedness and allows your boss to get to the root of the call with few distractions. In most cases, your boss is busy, and likely just wants information pertaining to the reason he or she called. Unless your boss specifically asks for all the details, try to deliver exactly what your boss wants.Again, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ask for clarification as needed. Your boss is likely busy, but it is usually better to spend an extra 60 seconds now asking your question than forcing yourself or your boss to spend hours correcting your mistakes later on. If you have more questions than time allows, consider asking your boss if there’s another co-worker or a set of written instructions you can refer to for additional clarification.

, Verbal head nods are statements such as “yes,” “okay,” “I understand,” and “I see” -- all of which indicate you’re listening actively to your boss.


Of course, these verbal head nods should be placed appropriately within the conversation. Wait for a pause after an instruction or explanation before making this sort of remark.

, Having a positive, can-do attitude shows your boss that you’re confident, competent, and not afraid of taking on challenges associated with work. For example, if your boss calls to talk about a problem, discuss possible resolutions you can implement.Even if your boss is critiquing your work or behavior, be as receptive as possible. Acknowledge the criticism by summarizing it in your own words, then discuss possible solutions to that point of critique. You can voice any honest concerns you have about going forward, but you should avoid making excuses for past mistakes or issues.
When you have to raise concerns or explain past problems, make “I” statements instead of “you” statements. This prevents your boss from going on the defense, and responding with angry or negative statements. For example, if your boss calls to speak with you about a project you didn’t finish on time, say “I ran into problems gathering resources” instead of “You didn’t give me all the resources on time.”

, Although your boss called you, and not the other way around, thanking your boss for calling you is a great way to express appreciation for his or her time. For example, say “I know you’re having a busy day; thanks for taking time to call me.”This is true in nearly any phone call with your boss, but it is especially important if your boss was calling to explain a project, express a concern, or critique your work. The goal is to demonstrate your eagerness to do a good job on the tasks given to you, and thanking your boss for his or her time acknowledges that your boss’s call will make doing a good job more feasible.

, If your boss calls you after hours, you should answer the phone as long as doing so does not interfere with non-work priorities. This is especially true if you started this job within the past six months.Willingness to communicate with your boss after normal work hours will demonstrate your dedication to the company and to your position.
If you are unable to answer the phone, however, you should respond to your boss as soon as you're able to. Ideally, this means listening to any voicemail left and calling your boss back within a few minutes. Depending on company culture and the nature of the call, you might be able to get away with a quick text or emailing explaining the delay if a phone call is impossible.

, In some companies, your employer may expect you to remain within contact via phone and email regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. While this may seem unfair, you'll need to accept it as part of your company's culture if you wish to keep working there.If you aren't sure what the protocol is, consult with your co-workers. You may learn that it's perfectly acceptable to delay response for a few hours, or you may discover that everyone else answers immediately. Find out what the expected response is and follow through.

, You should always be polite and positive when listening to your boss, even during an after hours call. That being said, you'll need to take a look at each situation individually before determining the right response to it.


If your boss is offering a general critique or set of instructions, for instance, take notes during the conversation, but feel free to resume your previous non-work activities after the call ends. You can usually save the action for your normal work hours if the matter isn't urgent.
On the other hand, if your boss calls you about an emergency, you'll need to handle the emergency immediately and according to your boss's wishes.

, Your boss can't reasonably expect you to be available 24/7 -- however, there's no guarantee that your boss will have reasonable expectations. If your boss routinely calls you after hours and this causes you significant unhappiness or anxiety, it might be time to think about looking for another job.You can try turning off your cell phone when you know your boss is making an after hours call, but unless your workplace is unionized, you're probably an ""at will"" employee who can be terminated at any time. Your boss may back off after getting the message that you won't answer after hours, but it's also possible your boss will respond by firing you.

Observe yourself: Take note of the circumstances when what you say is not what you, upon reflection, would have wanted to say.,
Recognize your situation: After you determine what circumstances might be most likely to produce this unwanted effect, try to be very observant about when those conditions appear to be manifesting.,
Observe the conversation.,
Observe the people: Who is speaking and how do they communicate?,
Formulate responses: Not just one, but consider your options.,
Consider the information: Is what you want to say Effective, Necessary, Accurate, Timely, and Appropriate (ENATA)?,
Gauge the reaction: Is the information you’re going to present formulated in a way to make a positive impact?,
Be thoughtful about your tone: How you say it is, in many ways, as important as what you say.,
Communicate: You now know what you’ll say, why it’s ENATA, how you’ll say it and the most likely reaction.,
Observe yourself again: While you’re talking, consider what you’re saying and keep a close watch on the reactions as they emerge.",How to Think Before Speaking," Does it happen mostly with one particular person or a particular group of people or just groups in general? Is it most often in arguments or debates? Is it when you’re ""on the spot"" and pressed to supply information? Try to find a pattern. It might be helpful to start a journal of events so you can compare these at your leisure.;
, The more skilled you become at recognizing this, the better you will be at changing your approach.

, Now that you know you’re in one of ""those"" situations, the goal is for you to process information. Often when we respond in a less than appropriate way, it’s because we didn’t fully comprehend what was being said. This is the time to sit back and listen to what’s going on around you. Don’t start focusing on what you’re going to say; just absorb. Your mind will process this information in the background.

, Some people are very literal and some people use examples. Some people use a lot of facial expression and body language to augment their conversation, whereas others rely on complex verbiage. How people convey information is a very good indicator of how they best absorb information.

, There are many different ways to say things. and your goal here is to find the best way to convey what you want to say in a way that has a positive impact. Communication is primarily a function of the recipient so you have to communicate based on the listener.

, If you are just responding because other people are talking, then it’s possible your communication doesn’t fit the ENATA model. If not, then sit back and continue to listen. You want what you say to have impact, not just make noise.

, Creating a negative atmosphere will guarantee failure in communications. You want people to understand that you are contributing rather than detracting. It only takes once to ruin your ability to communicate during that time. Identify how the listeners will react.

, Tone of voice can convey enthusiasm and sincerity, or it can rebuff and show sarcasm, and as most people have experienced, what we say can be taken in the wrong way. The most likely reason is that the tone of voice, what was said, body and facial language, as well as content, were not all thoughtfully combined to integrate with the listener’s most effective method of communication.

, Wait for an appropriate break in the conversation and speak. It’s usually best not to interrupt, although there are occasions when that will work best. When to interrupt is beyond the scope of this document.

, After the conversation is over, review the whole process again in your mind and note what you might have done differently and why. This is an ongoing process. Over time, you will refine and improve – you will become a better communicator and people will accept your responses with a more open mind.

Be willing to ask.,
Have a clear purpose in mind.,
Ask relevant and appropriate questions.,
Ask the right person.,
Ask the question as soon as it comes to you.,
Word your questions carefully.,
Keep it brief.,
Listen attentively to the answer.,
Ask follow up questions.,
Request specific information.,
Find out someone’s thoughts or opinions.,
Ask open-ended questions.",How to Ask Better Questions," Many people are hesitant to ask questions because they’re afraid it will make them look uninformed. When you request an explanation or clarification, however, it only furthers your understanding. Think of good questions as tools for making sense of the world around you.If you're embarrassed to ask a question in front of others, consider doing it through an impersonal format like email, or wait for a time when you can do it privately.
Asking the right questions at the right time is a characteristic of strong leaders.;
, Before you pose a question, consider what you hope to gain by asking. Are you gathering information in order to make a critical decision, or looking for feedback on something you’ve done? Thinking about exactly what you want to accomplish will help you refine your line of questioning, which will in turn result in more satisfying answers.Ask yourself, “What do I hope to learn by asking this question?” This will help you formulate the question more effectively.

, There may be certain times when it’s better to keep your questions to yourself. It may be that the question could cause confusion or offense, or that the answer is something you could figure out on your own with the right context clues. Mull your question over carefully and consider what, if anything, it will add to the conversation.If the question you’re about to ask is one you wouldn’t feel comfortable answering yourself, it might be better to let it go.
Redundant or obvious questions can distract from the big picture, and may make it seem like you’re not paying attention.

, Not everyone has the same feelings, experiences or expertise. If the answer you receive is to be of any use to you, it needs to come from an authoritative source. Address your question to someone who you think might be able to offer the insights you’re looking for, or who has a direct connection to subject you’re inquiring about.You wouldn’t ask your spouse how to treat acute bronchitis, just as you wouldn’t ask your doctor how you can be a better listener during arguments.
By directing your questions judiciously, you stand to make the discussion more enriching for both parties.

, It’s usually best to get your question out there while it’s still fresh on your mind. That way, you won’t forget it or feel bashful about asking later. You’ll also be given a chance to clarify key information before moving on to other concerns.


In most cases, you can simply raise your hand or wait for a pause in the conversation to fire off your question.
If you’re not in a position to ask a question immediately (such as late at night or in the middle of a presentation), make a note of it so you can bring it up the first chance you get., Ideally, they should be phrased in such a way that they point to the information you’re lacking. You might know what a thing is, but not how it works or why it’s important. How you frame the question can determine the kind of response you get.Stay away from complicated jargon or overly technical terms. Aim to speak in a way that anyone can understand.
Avoid influencing your listener with your own judgments. Rather than asking, “Isn't David a great candidate?” try the more neutral, “What did you think of Mr. Miller's proposal?”, Don’t use any more words than are strictly needed to articulate your question. If you ramble on at length or add lots of qualifications or other extraneous details, your listener can easily get bogged down. For the sake of clarity, each question should boil down to one central theme or idea.If you need to touch on multiple points, do it in follow up question.In general, it’s best to stick with short sentences that don’t beat around the bush. Otherwise, your listener may be forced to guess at your meaning.
Even a question as difficult to unpack as, ""How can we create a more tolerant society?"" can be phrased in a simple, straightforward manner.

, As you’re receiving an answer, be respectful and focus on what the person is saying without interruption. Let them finish explaining themselves before you present a rebuttal or ask a related question. Any uncertainty you feel will likely be cleared up by their response.Maintain eye contact, nod or offer a vocal agreement periodically to let the person know you’re listening.Now is not the time to interject with doubts or opinions. After all, the whole point of asking was to find out something you don’t already know.

, The answer you receive may raise further questions, or it may hint at new information. Once you’ve asked your initial question, you can zoom in to get a clearer sense of the ideas that are being conveyed. Give the other person a chance to explain their viewpoint more thoroughly, or shift the discussion from stating facts to coming up with practical solutions.It can be advantageous to approach the topic from different angles. If your first question is, “What is the biggest obstacle facing this project?,” the next one could be, “How can we resolve the issue quickly and efficiently?”Narrow down subsequent questions as you deliver them—start by presenting an overview of the subject, then work your way into the nitty-gritty details.

, When there’s something you need to know, asking directly is often the best way to find out. Your question might be as simple as, “What time is it?” or as complex as, “How is ribosomal RNA produced?”, but in either case, you’ll be better off once you ask.Arriving at the right answer promptly will be most useful in situations where your ability to succeed depends on having all the facts, like when you’re studying for an exam or in need of directions.
Developing a habit of asking thoughtful questions every day is one of the first steps to becoming a lifelong learner., Sometimes, our most striking ideas are the result of other people’s observations. Whenever you can, encourage your listener to give you their reading of a particular issue or event. Asking someone how they feel allows them to share their unique perspective, which could bring things to your attention that you hadn’t previously considered.Asking inclusive questions that get the people around you involved and thinking is essential for building camaraderie, whether they’re a coworker or a casual acquaintance.These types of questions also have a positive effect on relationships because they show that you care about what the other person has to say.

, Try not to limit your questions to a set of prescribed options (“Is holistic medicine a good or bad thing?”). It’s better to keep them abstract to make room for a wider range of possible responses. Open-ended prompts are useful for sparking deep discussions that have the potential to lead to enlightening breakthroughs.Whereas “Did you like my painting?” invites a simple “yes” or “no” response, “What did you think about the exhibit?” invites the listener to elaborate on their impressions freely.Abstract questioning challenges listeners to draw their own conclusions rather than being guided toward a conventional answer.

Refrain from using “like” to make approximations.,
Avoid using “like” before a quote.,
Refrain from using it to modify adverbs and adjectives.,
Use the word properly.","How to Stop Saying the Word ""Like""1"," Instead, use about, roughly, approximately, around, and other similar words to make approximations. Try to omit approximations when they are unnecessary.Instead of saying, “We spent like $500 at the mall today,” say, “We spent around $500 at the mall today.”
Instead of saying, “You need, like, a wetsuit to surf,” just say, “You need a wetsuit to surf.”;
, Replace “like” with said, yelled, whispered, shouted, or exclaimed when recounting what someone said. These words are much more descriptive and will get your point across better.For example, “She screamed, ‘Happy Birthday’ at the top of her lungs. It frightened me more than surprised me.”
For example, ""He whispered, 'I love you' into her ear.""

, Sometimes we use the word “like” to emphasize a point we are trying to make. However, this is an unnecessary use of the word like. Additionally, by omitting the word “like,” you can actually strengthen your sentences and speech.Instead of saying, “He was, like, so angry,” say, “He was very angry.”
Instead of saying, ""The sky was, like, so blue,"" say, ""The sky was a deep blue color.""

, The proper way to use “like” is when you are expressing enjoyment or comparing two similar things. If you are unsure about when to use the word “like,” then look the word up in the dictionary. The dictionary will give you a definition of the word and how to use it properly.Use it to express enjoyment, for example, “I really like chocolate.”
Use it to convey similarity, “He acts like his father.”

Think before you speak.,
Pause and take a breath.,
Practice saying phrases slowly at home.","How to Stop Saying the Word ""Like""2"," It is ok to take the time to think before you answer someone’s question, or before you move on to the next point. Before answering a question or moving on, give yourself five to eight seconds to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. This will enable you to be more articulate and descriptive, and you can avoid using the word “like.”, Do this instead of saying “like” in between phrases or at the end of sentences. Instead, pause and take a breath when you are speaking. This will allow you time to think about what you want to say next.For example, when you feel yourself about to say “like,” instead, pause. Then continue your sentence or start a new sentence.

, Do this if thinking and pausing before you speak are not helping you slow down your speech. Stand in front of the mirror and repeat phrases out loud to yourself. While you are saying the phrases, focus on enunciating syllables and vowel sounds. Practice this for 10 minutes each day.Phrases you can practice saying are, “I like to speak slowly,” or, “Speaking slower is more fun.”
Alternatively, read a book or magazine article out loud to yourself. While you are reading, focus on saying the words slowly and prolonging the vowels. Practice this for 10 to 20 minutes each day.

Read more books.,
Keep a thesaurus handy.,
Play word games.","How to Stop Saying the Word ""Like""3"," Reading books is a great way to expand your vocabulary, especially literary works and novels. When you encounter new words, try to use the context of the sentence to determine the meaning of the word. Then look up the word in the dictionary to see how close your guess was.Reading magazine, newspaper or journal articles will also help you expand your vocabulary.

, When you encounter a new word, use your thesaurus to find words that are similar to it. Write down the word and its synonyms in a journal. A couple times a week, go back and review your list of words. This will help solidify the words in your memory, as well as motivate you to learn more words., Word games like Scrabble, crossword puzzles, anagrams, and Boggle are a great way to learn new words while having fun. You can also download word apps onto your phone or computer. These applications usually have a “Word-of-the-Day” game and other word games to help you expand your vocabulary.Some great word applications and websites are freedictionary.com, dictionary.com’s “Word-of-the-Day,” wordplays.com, and vocabulary.com.

Make eye contact when you want to prove a point.",How to Look People in the Eye," As with anything else, the more you think about what you're doing, the more self-conscious you'll become and the more awkward you'll feel. Your nervousness can then be misinterpreted as dishonesty, and you'll lose ground on the good progress you've made.


Typically, making eye contact is more difficult as the person you're talking to is more authoritative or intimidating. Unfortunately, these are also typically the times you'll need to show confidence in order to gain the full attention of your audience, making it more important than ever to relax.
If you're going into an important conference or interview, do some breathing exercises beforehand to get your heart rate to slow and let the oxygen relax you. A few big, full, deep breaths can do a lot to calm you down.;
, It's actually physically somewhat difficult to keep your eyes locked on both of another person's eyes. It's more common to actually focus on one, or on a spot on the face, rather than trying to look at both eyes at once.


If it helps, try moving back and forth between the two eyes, rather than staying focused on one. Keep focused on one for 10 seconds or so, then switch to the other.

, Looking at the bridge of the nose, an eyebrow, or just below the eyes will give the illusion of eye contact, without the intimidation of making actual eye contact. The other person won't be able to tell the difference, and you'll be able to focus on more important listening skills to be a good conversationalist.

, You need to break your gaze every now and then, and it helps to be making another gesture when you do, rather than just looking away because you feel uncomfortable. It's good to break eye contact when you're laughing, or to nod and smile. This looks natural and comfortable, as well as providing you a needed break if necessary.

, It's one thing to look while you're listening, but it's much more difficult to keep eye contact while you're also trying to think of things to say. Don't be afraid if you have to break your gaze occasionally, but try to keep your face and eyes forward and up as you're talking.


Looking up when you're talking is sometimes thought to suggest that you're lying, while looking down is sometimes thought to signify confusion on your part. For this reason, it's usually best to look straight ahead, even if you're feeling uncomfortable and can't keep your eyes making contact. Look at the other person's ear, or chin, or anywhere but up or down.

, A big part of making eye-contact is just remembering that you're supposed to. If your natural inclination is to stare down at your shoes, try to practice when you're alone to realign your natural response to gaze down by focusing your eyes on faces. This can be done on television, in the mirror, or in a variety of other ways.

, One of the most readily available ways of practicing your eye-contact is to do it when you're alone, watching television. Focus on making eye contact with the characters on the screen and practicing the same skills to transfer them to your real-life conversations.


Obviously eye-contact with faces on television will feel very different than making eye contact with real people. The point of the exercise is to practice the skill, not to approximate the feeling.

, If you don't have a television, try looking up YouTube vlogs and other videos in which people make eye-contact with the screen. This can make the eye-contact feel a lot more real. These videos are widely available and free, and are actually somewhat better at approximating what it's like to make eye contact during a conversation.

, If you have a close friend who you enjoy talking to, try using Skype or use another type of video chat to practice your eye contact. This is usually somewhat easier than in person, since you've got a computer screen between you.

, Again, it won't feel the same as making eye contact with another person, but you can practice training your eyes to drift toward the eyes you see back in the mirror, rather than deflecting them, if you practice looking at your gaze in the mirror. Just taking a few minutes before or after a shower can help you train yourself to make eye-contact, rather than avert your eyes., Autistic people, people with anxiety disorders, and others may find eye contact frightening or overwhelming. Don't sacrifice your ability to have a pleasant conversation.


Look at an area near their eyes, such as their nose, mouth, or chin.
If they notice that you aren't making eye contact (which is unlikely), say something like ""Eye contact is difficult for me. I find that I can listen to you better if I don't have to look directly into your eyes.""

, You don't have to transition from feeling awkward and as if you've got shifty eye contact to suddenly drilling eye-lasers into the people you're having conversation lists. In fact, this can actually be somewhat disconcerting. You're probably already making some degree of eye-contact, but if it's something that you're trying to work on, take it slowly.


If you make one extra effort to lock eyes during a conversation each day, call it a success. You don't have to sit through extra-long conversations made up entirely of locked eyes to feel like you're making progress., During the conversation, if you focus completely on what that person is saying, you can worry less about making eye contact correctly. Nodding, repeating important bits of information, using open body language, and other active listening skills are just as important to a conversation, if not more so, than good eye contact. To listen actively, it's important that you:


Sit forward in your chair
Nod along
Listen closely and repeat important information
Process what's being said
Don't just wait for your turn to speak
Respond accurately to what is said

, When you are listening, you should have eye contact for 80% of the time and the other part should be short breaks and a little head movement to say without saying that you are listening. Be calm and don't over think it to keep things as natural as possible.


Avoid staring. Eye contact is good, but a dead-eyed, laser-locked gaze is just creepy. Stay relaxed and don't stare. Remind yourself that you are hoping to have a pleasant conversation with this person, and there will be no need to be anxious or worried.

, Try not to look away instantly when something else calls for your attention. If somebody calls you, don't look away as if you just got rescued from a boring conversation. Instead, slightly hesitate before looking at your caller.


Looking away then quickly looking back is also a good idea. Remember though, important disruptions such as dangerous or priority interruptions warrant instant attention.

, Keep your eyebrows relaxed, or your eye contact can look suspicious or intimidating, even if you're doing a good job remembering it. Try to keep your eyes open as much as possible, avoiding a squint, which can communicate that you dislike what the other person is saying, or a furrowed brow, which can communicate anger..


Go to the mirror and look at your eyes while you smile, and while you frown, or grimace. See the difference in what your eyes do? Practice keeping your eyes like you're smiling, even if you're not.

, Eye contact and good listening is especially important when you are at a job interview, but also any time you want to communicate attentiveness and respect. Potential employers might think that you're hiding something or you're not confident if you struggle to make eye contact, which can hurt your chances.

, Eye contact communicates interest and respect, two things that you want to make sure you establish on any good date. When you're out with someone you're interested in, try making eye contact as much as possible. Windows to the soul.


Making eye contact can also be a great way of judging your partner's interest, but don't jump to conclusions. If you see your partner struggling to keep eye contact, it might be because they can't wait to go home, or because they're just as nervous as you.

, If you're having an argument or other heated discussion, it can be tempting to want to avert your eyes. This communicates a lack of confidence, or a deferral to the person you're having the conversation with, which is something you hope to avoid. If you're in any kind of disagreement, locking eyes is an assertive gesture that helps you to communicate the confidence that what you say is true.If someone is trying to intimidate you, they want you to look away. Frustrate them by refusing. Stare right back.

Avoid techniques like torture and severe intimidation.",How to Interrogate Someone," Studies and empirical evidence have consistently shown that the best way to get a confession from a subject is to make them feel comfortable with you. They need to trust you. You will not get this if you act like the evil Nazi in some Hollywood movie or a Bruce Willis style cop. Act like someone who's generally easy going and just trying to do their job, and you'll be much more sympathetic to the person you're interrogating: the first step in getting them to trust you.;
, This doesn't mean ruling with an iron fist. It just means that you need to appear professional, organized, confident, and like you're calling the shots. This lets your subject think that you're the one with the power to get them out of trouble...or into worse trouble if they get on your bad side.

, Allowing the subject to see you angry or distressed communicates that he or she can affect your emotions. Don't allow that to happen, and strive to appear calm and collected in all your interactions with the subject.

, This is a well known technique, common to media, and people will be able to see what you're doing. This will raise their suspicion, which you don't want to do. Sticking to Good Cop-Good Cop will get you a lot further.

, Have you heard the story about the terrorist that gave up information just because his interrogator gave him a special cookie (he was diabetic and couldn't have normal cookies)? This is not an isolated case. Be polite, kind, and at least appear genuinely invested in their comfort and well-being. This will make them more willing to open up.

, Talk to your subject about casual topics that don't have anything to do with the investigation. This can give you the opportunity to bond and understand each other more, making the more willing to talk and helping you to understand how they think and what they value.


For example, ask them about where they grew up and then say you always wanted to travel there. Then ask them questions about what it was like, what they'd recommend, etc.

, Ask them questions about themselves and generally get them to talk about what they like, what they think, and what matters to them. This information will similarly make them more open and give you leverage.

, Identify an unrelated need that they have that you can fulfill in exchange for information. Maybe their kid needs medical help and you can help them file for government assistance. Maybe their little brother is doing poorly in school but your teenager is an ace academic and could provide tutoring. If you can identify something that is more important to them than the information, then that's all you need once they trust you.

, Getting someone to talk about their opinions on related subjects or on the investigation itself can reveal how they think, but it's also easy to get them to slip and give up more information than they realized. Ask them things like who they think caused the problem or what they would do in your position. Ask them what they think about stealing or whatever your investigation is about. If you're good at reading between the lines, you'll be surprised about how much you can learn.

, They need to see you as the person that's going to protect them and do the best thing for them, but only if they can give you what you need. I mean, you still have to do your job, right? So if they just give you the information so your boss gets off your back, then you can start helping them figure out how to reach the best outcome. This means letting them see the threat of a worse outcome, and offering them a better one. Threatening them and ""pulling rank"" will instantly undo or prevent the use of this extremely useful technique.

, Closed questions can only be answered with yes, no, or a specific answer. If someone is trying to avoid answering questions, use these sorts of questions and insist on a direct answer. Closed questions sound like:


""Who did..."", ""What did..."", ""When did..."", ""Did you..."", ""Can you..."", etc.

, Open questions are questions that cannot be answered with a ""yes"" or ""no"". These types of questions are useful in getting people to say more, possibly slip, and certainly in getting more details or a fuller picture of a situation. Open questions sound like:


""Explain how..."",""Why did..."", ""What happened..."", ""How did..."", etc.

, Funnel questions start broad and seem fairly safe to answer but slowly narrow down to the information you really want. You can often start funnel questions with questions you already know the answer to. This type of question gets someone into the rhythm of answering and makes them more likely to slip.


For example: ""Did you know about the theft last night?"", ""Who was at the office last night?"", ""When did they leave?"", ""When did you leave?"", etc.

, When you ask certain types of questions, like when you're trying to get details about a situation or catch someone in a lie, use descriptive language. Use words like ""tell"", ""describe"", or ""show"" to get person telling a story and giving specific details. The recollection of details tends to allow information to slip out.

, Questions that ask someone how they think about something beyond the surface level can not only cause them to uncover information, it can also help you understand how they think and ways that you might be able to coax more information from them. Ask them questions like ""Why would someone steal those files?"" and read into their reactions.

, These questions betray your assumptions about what happened and can lead your subject to give untruthful answers just to please you or get out of trouble. This may seem helpful, but you want the truth. If you're interrogating or discussing someone who's actually innocent, you'll end up hurting your own investigation and prolonging the problem.


For example: ""Laurel is very untrustworthy, don't you think?""

, Silence can be a powerful tool. Drop silences in after then answer some questions or if they're being tight-lipped, and just look at them. Conjure up that face your mom used to give you when you did something wrong and she knew. Just..stare at them with that face and wait. Most Westerners are conditioned to be uncomfortable during silence and will end it by saying whatever they can, sometimes letting information slip.

, This is a somewhat shady technique and can get you into trouble with the law if you're caught using it, but use things like full file-folders, photo negatives, plastic bags with swabs in them, SD cards, video tapes, and other props to make your subject think you have evidence that you don't. Don't say anything about the props, just let your subject see that you have them and then give them the chance to confess. They will think it's in their best interest.

, One technique is to make your subject think you already know everything. Go in with some basic information, the more the better, and tell them that while you have everything you need to complete your investigation, you are required to hear them confirm the details. Ask them questions you already know the answer to, and phrase it with the answer in the question (""You were in the office at 9:10 am on the 17th, correct?""). Then lead to the information you don't know and leave the the opening to fill in the gaps (""Now, what I just don't understand is the information I have here about the files you handed over. Can you explain why you did this? I feel like you must have had a good reason."").

, You should at all costs avoid the techniques that are more common these days, where interrogators use threats, severe intimidation, or what can amount to torture in order to get the info you want. These techniques actually have been show to affect you as much as them, and you want to avoid long-term psychological issues.

Understand stuttering.,
Talk to the stuttering person normally.,
Listen with attentiveness.,
Be patient.,
Speak up if you didn't understand what was said.,
Speak to a stuttering child in a supportive way.,
Be encouraging.",How to Talk With a Person Who Stutters," Stuttering is a speech or communication disorder. Speech is disrupted at various points, such as the start, the middle, or at various intervals during the conversation. It can also be accompanied by facial movements such as trembling lips or jaws, rapid eye blinking, or other facial movements as part of trying to speak.Stuttering has possible developmental, genetic, and neurological causes, although the precise mechanisms behind stuttering are not yet understood.


Some situations can worsen or set off stuttering, such as being in public, speaking in front of people, talking on the telephone, etc.;
, Unless they have a hearing problem, there is no need to raise your voice or slow down your own speech.


Use normal eye contact. There is no need to stare concertedly (be careful if this is what you're doing when you concentrate!), or to avoid their gaze.






Don't be embarrassed. If you're not used to talking with somebody who stutters, it might be a surprise the first time. But the embarrassment for you is short-lived; consider the reality that the stutterer has to endure such reactions regularly. Realize that your facial expressions will betray your surprise and embarrassment; if you feel this has occurred, simply apologize briefly and ask them to continue talking.






Don't assume a stutterer is shy, nervous, or disabled. Their mental abilities are still in top form!And don't be super unnaturally nice; just be your usual self around them.

Relax! The more relaxed and undisturbed you come across, the more likely the person stuttering will relax in your presence and feel less anxious.







, Focus on the content, not the delivery. Ensure that your body language reflects your listening interest. Don't turn to the side, cross your arms, or fidget with fluff on your clothing.


Use active listening techniques, in which the stutterer is actively encouraged to keep talking by your genuine interest and lack of judgment. It's interesting that some stutterers are able to talk to pets without stuttering;it may well be that the pets' inability to judge underlies this!

, If you're used to rushing through conversations, or you're not well versed in listening skills generally, it can be tempting to try to rush a stutterer to finish what he or she is saying. However, not only is this impolite but it will increase the person who stutters' impression that people are unwilling to listen or simply want to ""take the words right out of their mouths"".


Don't interrupt or discard what they're trying to say. Let them finish before having your turn.
Resist the desire to suggest that the stutterer to slow down or relax. This can increase the anxiety of the situation and is also demeaning. If you think that being calm and relaxed would help, be so yourself and this will set the tone for the rest of the conversation.Don't try to finish their sentences or fill in words for them. It can be tempting but it's a sign of impatience and the stutterer knows what he or she wants to say, it just takes longer to get there. It's also a dangerous assumption to make; while you might think you know where they're headed, you don't necessarily know that, and it could give the impression that all you want to do is rush off.

, Feeling shy or uncertain won't improve the communication flow. Try to press past your feelings of discomfort to explain that you didn't understand something. Your openness will be appreciated.Be at ease asking about the subject of stuttering. Provided you raise it politely and with a genuine interest in understanding, most stutterers will be happy to answer your questions about stuttering.It can be a good chance for the stutterer to talk openly about their experience.

, Given that the majority of those suffering from stuttering are children, it is important to talk to children with the same care and attentiveness you'd grant a teen or adult, to help them realize that they are loved and cherished.


Don't hurry a child's talking. Set aside times when you're free to just sit and listen to what your child has to say. As mentioned earlier, avoid completing your child's thoughts.
Avoid criticizing stuttering, or making it into something negative. The more supportive the home environment, the more the child will find his or her own space to develop confidence and focus on all aspects of development, not just speech.
If you're concerned about the reaction of other adults to your child's speech, speak to them away from the child. Let them know that it's important to relax and not to insist that the child ""overcome"" this impediment.
Be honest with your child about the topic of stuttering. Discuss the facts and make it known that you love your child the way he or she is.

, If you have a friend, sibling, or someone else you care about who stutters, try to be their rock when it comes to speaking publicly. Help them to feel at ease about speaking in public. Things you can do include taking them along to public speaking events designed to help stutterers, and even encourage and be there for them when they speak at school or other functions.

Don't fidget or slouch.,
Use appropriate facial expressions.,
Don't interrupt.,
Ask questions.,
Don't be critical.,
Have an honest response.",How to Listen," The first thing you should do when someone starts talking is to put away anything that might distract you from his or her words. Turn off the television, close your laptop and put down anything else you are reading or doing. It's very difficult to hear and understand what someone is saying when you are surrounded by other sounds or activities vying for your attention.


Whether the conversation you are having is over the phone or in person, it can help to move to a room that is free from distractions. Go to a place where you won't be interrupted by other people.






Many people find it easier to have deep conversations outdoors, where there are fewer distracting screens and gadgets. Try going for a walk in the park or in your neighborhood.





;
, When the other person speaks, focus on what they are saying. Don't let your mind jump ahead to what you think you should say in reply. Watch the person's face, eyes and body.What is the other person really trying to say?


Part of staying focused and really listening involves interpreting a person's silences and noticing his or her body language, too. These nonverbal ways of communicating are just as important as words.

, Many find it hard to concentrate during conversations because they feel self conscious about how they appear to the other person. It may help to know that if someone is speaking their mind to you, it isn't likely that they're judging you at the same time. The speaker is grateful that you're lending a listening ear. Part of being a good listener is having the ability to stop thinking about yourself during the conversation. If you're busy thinking about your own insecurities or needs, you aren't paying attention to what the other person is saying.

, Another key to listening is being able to put yourself in the other person's shoes. If someone is confiding in you about his or her troubles, step outside yourself and imagine what it's like to be him or her. True communication happens when people understand each other. Find common ground with the person who is speaking and do your best to see things from his or her point of view.

, You're probably heard it said that there's a difference between hearing and listening. Hearing is a the physical act of sensing sounds, while listening is the ability to interpret those sounds as a way to understand the world and other people. The nuances in what you hear should inform the conclusions you make as a listener. For example, a person's tone of voice can indicate whether he or she is joyful, depressed, angry or scared. Ultimately, honing your sense of hearing will make you a better listener.



Work on your sense of hearing by paying more attention to sounds. When was the last time you closed your eyes and let your sense of hearing take the wheel? Stop once in a while and just listen to your surroundings so you can better appreciate the knowledge that can be gained by hearing.






Listen to music more carefully. We are so used to having music in the background now that we don't often make it the sole focus. Close your eyes and really listen to an entire song or album. Try to pick out individual sounds. If many elements are present, such as in symphonic music, try listening to a single instrument as it travels through the flow of the entire orchestra.







, This simple body language indicates to the person speaking that you are interested in hearing more.Your body should be facing the person who is talking, and your torso should be at a slight forward angle. The lean doesn't have to be over pronounced to be effective.

, Making eye contact during a conversation also indicates that the person to whom you're listening has your undivided attention. Eye contact is a very important way to establish open lines of communication. However, you don't want to sustain eye contact for a prolonged period of time, because that can make the person speaking feel uncomfortable.


Research shows that during one-on-one conversations, most people make 7-10 seconds of eye contact before looking away., Nodding your head is another effective way of showing people you're talking to that you're right there with them. You can nod in agreement or as a way of nudging the person to say more. Just make sure you nod during appropriate points in the conversation; if you nod when someone tells you something disagreeable, they may feel you aren't really listening.


You can also encourage the person to keep going with short verbal comments, like ""yes,"" ""I see,"" or ""uh huh."", Make sure your body language conveys interest, not boredom. If you're busy picking your nails, tapping your feet, crossing your arms or leaning your head on your hand, most people will end the conversation quickly so as not to bore you out of your mind. Sit up straight to show that you're engaged in the conversation.


If you are disabled and need to fidget in order to listen, find discreet ways to do so, such as wiggling a foot or squeezing a stress ball with your hand resting on the table. If it's not right in front of their face, they probably won't mind. If your conversation partner mentions it, explain that this helps you listen, and ask them to continue.

, Remember that listening is active, not passive. It's important to react to people's words - otherwise, they may as well be writing in their journals. Show you're interested by smiling, laughing, frowning, shaking your head, and making other expressions and gestures that are right for the moment.

, It's rude to interrupt someone while they're talking, because it shows that you aren't really listening - you're too eager to make sure your own two cents are heard. If you tend to jump in with your opinion before the other person has finished speaking, make a point of quitting your habit of interrupting. Wait until a person has finished his or her thought before you speak.


If you do interrupt (everyone does it from time to time), it's a good idea to apologize and ask the person to please continue what he or she was saying.

, Keep other people talking by asking questions that indicate you've been listening and would like to know more. You can ask a simple leading question, like ""What happened next?"" Or something specific to the topic at hand. Chiming in with phrases like ""I agree!"" and ""Me, too"" can also help to move the conversation along.


You can repeat what someone is telling you as a way to clarify his or her point.It's up to you to decide how personal your questions should be. If your questions are interpreted as crossing a line, the conversation will quickly shut down.

, Be open to understanding the other person's point of view, even if you're discussing a subject upon which you disagree. Criticizing the person for saying something you found inadequate or silly is a sure way to keep the person from confiding in you again. A good listener stays as nonjudgmental as possible. If you have a counterargument, wait until the person is finished making his or her point before stating it.

, When it's your turn to speak, respond honestly and openly - but always politely. Offer advice if the person requested it. If you want the relationship to grow, and you trust the person to whom you're talking, be willing to share your own opinions and feelings in return. Contributing something of your own to the conversation brings the act of listening full circle.

Pay attention.,
Show the other person you are ready to listen.,
Make eye contact with the speaker.,
Use your voice to convey attentiveness.",How to Actively Listen1," Focus your attention entirely on the speaker. This will not only help you remember the conversation, but it will help your listener feel more comfortable sharing more personal information. We are more likely to delve more deeply into a conversation if we believe the other person is hearing us.


Have your conversation in a quiet area where there are no distractions. Put away your phone, or turn off music.
Active listening can be draining, as it requires much more focus than the usual listening we do on a day-to-day basis. Focusing your attention so closely on someone for a long period of time will likely leave you depleted at the end of your conversation. It is a skill that takes practice!;
, Maintain a physical stance that makes you appear open and receptive to hearing what the other person has to say. To help you remember what open body language looks like, think of the acronym SOLER:Squarely face the person. This shows you are present and attentive, and will also help you best read nonverbal cues.

Open your posture. Keep your arms at your sides or in your lap. Avoid crossing your arms or turning your body away.

Lean towards the sender. If you’re sitting, sit up tall and lean forward on your chair.

Eye contact while listening.

Relax while listening. Avoid fidgeting or moving around while engaging in active listening. It may make the other person feel tense or distracted.

, Eye contact is an easy way to indicate to the other person that you are paying attention to them. Sometimes eye contact feels uncomfortable, but force yourself to do it. It will get easier with practice.


It's okay to break eye contact -- you don't need to stare them down. Too much eye contact can be unnerving. Natural breaks would include watching their hand gestures, looking where they are pointing, or looking away as though you are deep in thought.
If you find making eye contact with another person uncomfortable, you could try looking somewhere on their face instead, like their forehead.
You can also nod while you make eye contact with the other person, to encourage them to continue speaking.

, Sometimes important conversations happen over the phone or in the car, or other places where it may not be possible to show attentiveness with your body language. In this case, convey you’re listening by interjecting minimal encouragers. These are vocalizations to let others know you are listening.For example, you could say things like “mm-hmm,” “yes,” “uh-huh,” “I see,” or “oh.”
You can also use minimal encouragers in person, though attentive body language is more effective in conveying presence and willingness to listen.

"
"
Develop empathy.,
Pay attention to your own emotional reactions.,
Take note of the speaker's body language.,
Figure out the tone of the conversation.,
Be nonjudgmental.,
Avoid giving advice.",How to Actively Listen2," Empathy is the act of understanding, imagining, and/or feeling what the speaker is feeling. Empathy is the feeling of “putting yourself in someone else’s shoes.” It’s important in active listening because it helps you to name and identify the other person’s feelings, which helps validate the other person and help them know you are listening to and understanding them.Empathy does not mean agreement. Empathy is more like an understanding. You don’t necessarily have to agree with what the speaker is feeling, but you should be able to understand what it is they are feeling, and perhaps why they feel what they do.
You can develop your empathy by imagining what the other person is feeling. How would you feel if you were that person?
Reading works of literary fiction helps you increase your empathy skills.
Working cooperatively with others, perhaps in a volunteer capacity, helps you better understand the people you are working with and/or serving.
Make the effort to meet other people who are unlike you. By getting to know those who are different, you learn that we all share common ground, building emotional connectedness and understanding., When you are listening to another person, you may begin to feel or intuit the other person’s emotions. You may be mirroring the person’s emotions, or perhaps you are reacting to their emotions. Sensing what another person is feeling is known as affective empathy.For example, you may feel excited when you watch your sister share news of her job promotion, or you may begin to feel tense or anxious when your friend shares bad news with you.
It is helpful for the listener to name what they are feeling to indicate empathy and understanding. For example, you could say, “Wow, just hearing you tell that story made me feel really tense. You must be under a lot of pressure at work right now.”

, This will give you clues into the meaning, feeling and purpose behind what the speaker is saying, helping to generate empathy. Many researchers believe we convey more of our true thoughts and feelings through our body language and tone of voice than through the words we use. Here are some things you can look out for:Facial expressions. For example, are they genuinely smiling when they are conveying happy news?
Tone of voice. Listen to the way their voice sounds when they speak. For example, “I’m thrilled for you,” could be said in a way that sounds truly excited and happy for the other person, or it could be said sarcastically.
Gestures. Gestures can convey many emotions. Think about clapping your hands or bouncing up and down when excited, or crossing your arms in front of your chest or putting your hands on your hips when angry.
Body position. Watch how a person uses the placement of their body to convey feeling. For example, if someone moves closer to another person when talking to them, it likely conveys a closeness of relationship.

, Use your empathy to determine what kind of tone you should take with the speaker. By observing body language and listening carefully, you can decide if your conversation is more lighthearted or serious in nature.


The other person may begin the conversation with “Can we talk about something?” or “I have something to tell you,” which gives you a clue that the subject matter is probably serious.Observe body language. With a more serious conversation, you may possibly see fewer gestures, a more protective posture (like arms across the chest), or less eye contact. The speaker may be trying to “protect” their vulnerability.
More serious conversations will also likely be in a lower, quieter tone of voice.
Conversations that are less serious will likely be louder, with more hand gestures, smiling, and eye contact.

, It is important to listen without judgment when you are engaging in active listening. Use empathy to understand where the other person is coming from, and why they made the decisions that they did. Remain open-minded by giving them space to talk without your interjections.Listen with the goal of understanding. Fully focus on what the other person has to say, then think of a response during a pause in conversation.
Don’t jump to conclusions about the person. Avoid stereotypes. For example, an unemployed person receiving government food assistance may not be lazy. Save your opinions for after you hear their story., Unless the speaker specifically asks for advice, don’t offer it to them. Focus on understanding where the other person is coming from instead.If the speaker asks you, “What do you think I should do?” you could say, “You know, I need to think about that. Can you tell me more about what happened? Maybe we could figure out some next steps together.”

"
Paraphrase.,
Reflect back.,
Allow for silence.,
Name your own feelings.,
Ask open-ended questions.",How to Actively Listen3," On its simplest level, paraphrasing is echoing back the speaker’s statement using different words. If the speaker says, ""I could fall asleep right here,"" you could say, ""You're really tired."" Paraphrasing in active listening can be simple restating to let the person know you are listening, or you can take the paraphrasing a bit deeper to help the other person clarify their thoughts or feelings.For example, if the speaker says, “My mother is mad at me because I told her I have other holiday plans this year. She always wants us all to be at her house,” you could respond, “It sounds like you think your mother is very set in her ways.”
Allow the speaker to further clarify if you misjudged their statement. The speaker could say, “No, my mother doesn’t like to travel.” Paraphrasing gives the speaker an opportunity to correct the listener without making either party feel defensive--an incorrect paraphrase can still lead to greater clarity.

, Reflection takes paraphrasing to a deeper level, by paraphrasing and naming feelings you are hearing the other person say, both verbally and nonverbally. This requires you to develop your own empathic abilities, so that you are able to identify and name feelings you see in the other person.Phrases that indicate you are trying to reflect what the other person is saying include, “What I’m hearing you say is…” or “It sounds to me like....” When you are finished with your reflection, you could always ask “Do I have that right?” to make sure you are understanding them correctly.
For example, the speaker could say, “I’ve been feeling really depressed since my father died. We didn’t have a good relationship, but I miss him anyway. Part of me is glad he is dead, but then I feel guilty I think that.” You could respond, “It sounds to me like you are grieving your father, but it was a complicated relationship so you are dealing with a lot of emotions right now. You’re sad, but maybe you’re also relieved.”

, Many people are very uncomfortable with silent gaps in conversation. Instead of looking at them as spaces to fill, consider looking at them as opportunities to engage in processing what was said. Give yourself and the speaker time to think before continuing.When you are formulating a response while listening, you are not listening fully to the speaker.
If it is your turn to speak in the conversation, but you do not yet have a response, you could say, “Give me a minute, please. I want to think about how to respond.” Most people will appreciate your taking the time to develop a thoughtful response.

, When the speaker has finished talking, you could describe how hearing what they said made you feel. This can be particularly helpful if you are speaking with a child, or a person who doesn’t have a great grasp on being able to identify their emotions.


A good phrase to remember when utilizing this technique is ""When you said this, this was how I felt….""
For example, you could say, “When you told me about how your mom left you alone while she drank, it made me feel very sad. I would feel very lonely, helpless, and scared if I had been in your shoes.”

, Ask questions that encourage the speaker to provide more than a yes or no answer. Ask questions that encourage a thoughtful response, allowing the other person to describe their thoughts and feelings. Some examples of open-ended questions include:How did you feel when that happened to you?
What was it like to experience that?
How do you feel when you retell that story?
How do you think this experience changed you?
How did you come to believe what you do?
Who has influenced you the most and why?

Be aware of the person's health issues.,
Be attentive to the environment in which you are communicating.,
Speak clearly and articulately, and make eye contact.,
Adjust your volume appropriately.,
Use clear and precise questions and sentences.,
Employ visual aids, if possible.,
Take it slow, be patient, and smile.",How to Communicate With Older Adults," Older adults may have health problems that add difficulty to speaking and understanding. Be sure you consider the person's health before you engage in communication. For example, they may have hearing problems, speech problems, and memory loss. These factors complicate communication. And remember, chronological age is not always a true indicator of a person’s health (see Warnings).;
, Be sure to evaluate the environment in which you are communicating, which might have an effect on hearing and speech problems. Is there any disturbing background noise? Are many people speaking in the same room? Is there any intrusive music? Are there any distractions that could affect your communication? Ask the older adult if the environment is comfortable for them. If you sense any disturbance, try to move to a more peaceful and quiet location.

, Older adults may have trouble hearing. It is important to articulate your words and speak clearly. Direct your speech at the individual's face -- not to their side. Do not eat your words: move your mouth and pronounce each word carefully and precisely. When your tongue “dances” inside your mouth when you talk, you articulate more clearly. If your tongue “sleeps” and plays a passive role, you are more likely not articulating as well as you could.

, There is a difference between enunciating and talking loudly. Learn to adapt your voice to the needs of the individual. Evaluate the the environment and how it relates to the person’s hearing abilities. Don't shout simply because the listener is older. Treat the individual with respect by articulating and speaking at a comfortable volume that is suitable for both of you.

, Do not hesitate to repeat or rephrase your sentences and questions if you sense there is an absence of comprehension. Complicated questions and sentences may confuse older adults who have short-term memory or hearing loss. Clear and precise constructions are easier to comprehend.


Use direct questions: ""Did you have soup for lunch?"" ""Did you have salad for lunch?"" Instead of: ""What did you have for lunch?"" The more precise you are in your language, the less difficulty the elderly have in understanding.
Reduce the ""noise"" in your sentences and questions. Limit your sentences and questions to 20 words or less. Don't use slang or filler words and phrases. (""Like,"" ""well,"" and ""you know"" are a few examples.) Keep your sentences brief and direct to the point.
Avoid the confusion of mixed ideas and questions. Try to define your ideas and questions logically. If you mix ideas, it may be confusing for the older adult to understand. Express one idea and message at a time. For example, ""It is a good idea to call John, your brother. Later, we can call Susan, your sister."" A more complicated construction would be: ""I think we should call your brother, John, first, and then later we could call your sister, Susan.""

, If an older adult has a hearing or memory problem, it is important to be creative. Visual aids help. Show the individual what or who you are talking about. For example, it may be better to say, ""Is there any pain in your back (pointing to your back)? Is there any pain in your stomach (pointing to your stomach)?"" instead of simply asking ""Do you have any pain or discomfort?""

, A sincere smile shows that you are understanding. It also creates a friendly environment in which to communicate. Remember to pause between sentences and questions. Give the individual an opportunity to understand and digest information and questions. This is a particularly valuable technique if a person has memory loss. When you pause, you show respect and patience.

Talk to him.,
Be open to hearing his side of the conversation.,
Show him what it's like from your point of view.,
Tell him what you wish he did.,
Don't play games.,
Be patient.,
Don't expect perfection.",How to Get Guys to Communicate More Clearly," Be direct. It's the best plan for really getting any man to change his communications approach, because chances are, he has no idea he's doing anything wrong. Many men don't tend to expend energy trying to understand subtle hints, so being direct and saying exactly what you need to say will eliminate the need for months of frustration without results. After all, nobody is a mind reader. Tell him that you think it's annoying and rude that he can't take the time to communicate clearly and it's hard for you to understand what he's saying sometimes. Explain to him that by being so direct with him, it means that you're really keen to make things clearer between you.


Give them examples of what it means to both communicate well and to communicate badly. Making sure he understand what habits exactly are annoying and frustrating you is vital to change. Take note of some factual examples of things he has said that caused you to simply scratch your head––jot down these examples in a notebook if you can't remember them exactly in your head.
Give him examples of times outside your private life where you think that communicating with greater clarity could benefit him, such as in work life or in any tough situation. Talk to him about how passive aggressiveness, subtle hints and other communication habits can cause trouble for him.;
, Maybe he has issues with your communication methods. You can't assume that you've got it down perfectly and often miscommunication is caused both ways. Either way, hearing what he has to say on the matter will help both of you and show him that this isn't just a case of bossiness.

, If the guy is one who grunts a lot, treat him to a dose of grunting just when he's trying to have a meaningful conversation.


Instead of talking back, go ahead and make the same grunting sounds he makes, until he's annoyed. Then tell him that what you go through every time you try to talk to him is very similar.
If he's the kind of guy who shrugs a lot, next time he asks you an important question, just shrug.
If he is always giving you one word answers, spring several one word answers on him during ""a talk."" For best results do these things during a time when he's trying to have an important conversation with you.

, Once you've told him to stop certain things, he may be at a loss for what you'd like him to do instead. Help him out a little, in small steps and be prepared to remind him for a while until he can get it sorted by himself. If he asks you, just tell him. Don't be afraid to tell him exactly what he should say. Giving a guiding hand in the beginning will show him that you mean what you say, and shows that you care enough to make sure he follows through.


Give him friendly reminders when he's not communicating clearly. Instead of giving up and letting out an exasperated sigh, take a deep breath the next time you can't understand him and let him know directly that he's not communicating clearly.
Some guys may do better when you let them know they are communicating clearly or getting better/improving on that.... Let them know you appreciate this effort on their part. This is an effective tool if you are in place of feeling genuine/sincere. ""I noticed and saw this..."", if you feel it and notice... Look for the good parts and bring that to attention. You know your guy. Some do better with the ""oh i notice this and like this moment"" or ""feels like we're going in right direction.""
Some guys will balk... And acting out their behavior back is something you may have to resort to, if/or after, praise and attention don't work.
Find ways to cultivate good communication outside of your private talking. Leave him notes reminding him to speak clearly at his business meeting, remind him to communicate well when out to dinner with friends and encourage him to make choices like ordering food.
Cultivate good communication skills in yourself. Ask him if there's anything about your communication that gets on his nerves. If so, the both of you can benefit from hearing each others' issues and can work together to overcome them.

, Don't try to get him to guess what he's supposed to do or say by using body language or giving him vague and unhelpful hints. When it comes to guys, the best way to do anything is always directly. By playing games with him, you can cause him to think that that's all you want. It can make you seem like the bad guy, when you're just trying to help. Don't let yourself become the one at fault––instead, be clear, kind and assertive. If you do play games with him he will get fed up and annoyed and the progress he will have been making will deteriorate.


As previously mentioned, make sure that you're not speaking hypocritically. If he has issues with your communication habits, he may be resentful that you want him to change but aren't aware of his wanting you to change. You need to come to the table with making changes too.
If you have a habit of playing games, understand that this in itself is a form of bad communication. If you're not willing to break that habit, why should he be willing to break his?

, It may take a while for him to realize you really mean it, and then even longer for him to change. Stay calm and only help him if he asks for help. Just wait it out and eventually one day you'll realize he's communicating more clearly with you.


Don't pester him about it. Once you've told him you wished he'd stop, he's probably going to try to do just that. If he does messes up occasionally, don't point it out and make a scene. Let it slide, it was a mistake and unlearning takes time.
Remind him if he doesn't seem to be making any progress. Just kindly bring it up, but don't get angry or scare or threaten him.

, He's not ever going to communicate perfectly, so don't expect him to. All you should be shooting for is improvement, not a complete turn around. Don't set yourself up for disappointment just because this guy is still shrugging on a rare occasion. Perhaps your own expectations are too strict but also, perhaps it is just that he will need some slack in how he communicates because that is just who he is.


Continue to work towards perfect communication, but settle for better. Over time you can continue to cultivate good communication between the two of you, even after you're both happy with your current habits.
In time, you will probably understand more about what he is communicating without having to get complete clarity but this requires attentiveness on your behalf and a willingness to let go of your own preconceptions at times.

Realize it for the habit it is.,

Don't stumble over giving constructive feedback or criticism.",How to Give Praise Instead of Criticism," Criticizing people is a shortcut way of saying ""I want my perspective of the world to dominate and I really don't want to know or learn about how you see things."" It's often a refuge for hiding hurts, naivety, and a lack of knowledge (and an unwillingness to acknowledge this). A constant need to criticize can also arise from having a sense of superiority over others, whether or not one has the expertise to justify such an attitude. Or, there is argumentative Annie, who sees the need to be negative and to stoke the embers of the ""never good enough"" fire because seeing people dissatisfied and confused is a comfort zone for her. The point is that when we are happy, we seldom criticize anybody, rather we appreciate, uplift others, it feels far better. Ultimately though, whatever the reason behind a constant tendency to criticize is one simple thing – habit. It's about forming a way of thinking that has become so entrenched that it seems appropriate, even when it's not, and is a fall-back that soon grows to fit many situations beyond the one in which the critical personality initially arose.


For example, someone expert at a particular work skill may have begun criticizing lower level staff's work practices out of the knowledge born of experience; however, the temptation to extend this critical self across to other situations, such as family life, friendships, or socializing interactions becomes overwhelming and it soon starts to infiltrate everything. At that point, being a constant criticizer is a curse of a habit and it requires changing.
Realize that time is ever changing and that everything moves on. The constant criticizer risks stepping into the unknown when he or she refuses to keep up with the times but bases critical comments on what he or she knew in the past. While what you used to do in the past may have been the one and only method for getting it right then, at least get your facts straight about the present. In many cases, you may just find that the world has moved on and that you're clinging to an old view that no longer persists but your criticism is sourced from that old view. This will merely set you up to look like a fool.;
, Deliberately start appreciating small and big things in your life, things you are grateful for. Know that we treat others the way we treat ourselves. Make peace with yourself, be kind to yourself, and gradually you will feel the shift happening, you will stop enjoying criticizing others, instead you'd start enjoying seeing good things in them, positive traits you'd have otherwise missed, plus when we uplift others, we do the same for ourselves. Soon you'd be a positive influence in their life. We teach best through example, by being the inspiration we wish others would receive in their life.

, Negative criticism consists of telling another person that something they've done, or even who they are, isn't good enough by some standard and is put across in such a manner as to belittle, silence, distress, or distance someone – or even to put them into disrepute with others. If this criticism is constant and persistent, then it can be incredibly debilitating for the recipient. Constructive feedback or criticism, on the other hand, is criticism aimed at letting another person know that something they've done could be improved upon with issue- or fact-specific examples (not generalizing) and it can also be about informing that person about what they've done well.And praise is a deliberate action to find and celebrate the favorable, the good, and the desirable in what someone has done; it is also possible to cultivate this attitude as a habit, the habit of looking for what is good in others, looking for their strengths, and encouraging them to empower themselves.


Sometimes people mistake never-ending negative criticism for being helpful in a ""tough love"" kind of way. Certainly, sometimes people do need to hear a very raw truth in order to be redirected from a very unhealthy development path, but harping on about something or doing it without compassion, support, and kindness behind the intent will damage your relationship with the recipient. Focusing on kindness when delivering very tough criticism will help you to avoid coming across as superior and irreproachable.

, This is akin to ""forced praise"" in which poor performance or behavior is given praise in the hope that mediocrity will be ironed out by a huge boost in self-esteem.If only it were that easy but such praise does a disservice to the recipient because they aren't motivated to improve their performance or to gain mastery over things they find challenging. Praising others is not about replacing accurate, reliable, and truthful feedback with unrealistic and misleading pats on the back for poor performance, attitude, or behavior. The key element to avoid ""boosterism"" is to link your praise to good effort and/or good results that are evident and quantifiable.


This is not to say that is wrong to tell someone the generalities of what you see as good in them. For example, to tell a person that ""I love how thoughtful, kind, and caring you are. I have seen you help people on so many occasions that I feel as if you're always there when things go wrong for other people"" is pointing out generally that you do appreciate these aspects of their personality. On the other hand, to say to someone that ""I think you're a very clever problem solver when you put your mind to it and we'll ignore the previous six months of math test fails"" is pretty unrealistic and unhelpful!

, Sometimes the speed with which you respond says much more about yourself than about the other person; the more visceral your reaction, perhaps the more you're reacting to something within, such as jealousy, anger, a sense of despair, or annoyance that you weren't the first to think of it or do it, or that you haven't got the same talent, or that you tried and failed and have a distaste for anyone else who does succeed. Ask yourself:


Do I want to criticize this because I'm not a fan of what I want to criticize?
Do I want to criticize this because I dislike this person?
Do I want to criticize this because I can't see anyone else doing so?
Do I want to criticize because if I don't, then there won't be a decent discussion to double and triple check that this is the best way?
In each case, your answers will help you to locate the reason behind your criticism. Think of other questions you might ask yourself whenever you feel the urge to criticize.

, You've clarified to yourself why you don't like something or someone and why you think criticism is justified. Now think of what you do like about the situation, the outcome, or the person. If you need a reason to dislike something, you must have a reason to like something. Maybe the person didn't do so badly after all and a deep gnawing feeling within is telling you this reality but you're more comfortable not acknowledging this truth. Think about this from the start of the upwelling of a desire to criticize, so you aren't caught off guard and end up feeling as if you have to make up lies about what you like about something. You can still find something to praise amid your negative feelings.


If it's a person, look for at least one good thing that you do like/trust/admire (however begrudgingly) in that person. And focus on that.

, This takes away a whole reason for you to dislike them or their ideas! If you think, ""I'm going to criticize because I hate this person!"", stop yourself immediately. Say to yourself: ""No, that's not a good enough reason"" and think of a better one. Do this every time and soon it will become your new habit. The greatest realization as you change criticism to praise is that encouraging another person is a way of building trust and respect, and it displays belief in them, even if they're not yet at their point of performing their very best. By encouraging them, you demonstrate that you care for their success and well-being rather than trying to drag them down and alienate them.

, Simple logic makes it clear that people respond more positively to a pleasant approach to them than a negative, criticizing one. The secret behind this is to be concerned about respecting others, avoid negativity, and motivate others to feel more positive about themselves.


Before criticizing, think about what you would like to hear. Would you like to hear that someone hated you and that's why they criticized your efforts? Pretend it was you, and if you were that person, think about what you would want to hear.

, Initially, focus on your integrity of thought and action and move from this point. If you're not able to work out what to say, spend some time reading words related to praise, lists of praise phrases, and other people's suggestions about giving praise. The more you read about this approach to thinking, the more it will infiltrate your own thinking and you'll begin to see a change of perspective within yourself, especially when you put it into practice and see people's positive responses. Think of praise as encouragement, motivation, and facilitation, and you'll soon start to feel more comfortable with it.
Some great praise messages include:


""You did a good job of...""
""You have improved in...""
""You're telling me you can't do it. But I think you can.""
""I'm sure you'll be able to handle it.""
""Keep trying!""
""Don't give up. Sure it looks like a mess but you've always managed to clear the hurdles before and I know you can now too.""
""I think your style/approach is fascinating. It's not one I'm used to but I'm open to learning more.""

, As discussed earlier, all praise and no feedback can result in mediocrity. If you do have a better grasp of a situation, and have genuine suggestions for helpful improvements that will motivate the other person to achieve their best self, don't hold back. Just be sure to couch your feedback in terms that help, not harm.


Give hints. If you're having trouble with praise, think of what you could tell them to help them. Telling them to work on it a little isn't mean-spirited, and they shouldn't take it personally as long as you aren't pointing it out in a rude or uncaring way. For example, if you were reviewing a person's singing ability, you could say, ""A little flat, but not too bad."" or ""You flubbed the lyrics a little, but not too badly.""
Think about how you phrase negative messages. Being inclusive can help a great deal, such as ""How do you think we should deal with...?"", or ""What is your opinion?"", or ""Tell me what you feel about it.""
One way of dealing with something pretty negative that has happened is to say: ""I like/believe in you. I just don't like/believe in what you did/said/produced. You are so much better than that.""
Be open to being given feedback in turn. If you can dish it out, you can certainly accept a portion back to help you to learn and grow too.

Keep good posture.,
Breathe deep.,
Release your jaw.,
Drink warm liquids.",How to Warm up Your Voice1," In order to have the best air flow and therefore the best sound, you need to have good posture. This goes for when you're both sitting and standing. Imagine a line at the top of your head, through your back, holding you up.


If you're standing, keep your feet flat on the floor, shoulder width apart. Balance equally on both legs. Keep your head up and shoulders back. Every part of your body should be in the same line.
If you're sitting, follow the same recommendations as you would for standing, but also keep your back off the chair, sitting toward the edge of your seat.;
, Most people have a bad habit of only using the top of their lungs. Doing this though doesn't employ the diaphragm and doesn't let you use your full power.


If you are tense at all while breathing, it will resound in the muscles of your vocal folds. Breathe normally, but be conscious of keeping your shoulders low and your chest relaxed. Concentrate on breathing lower staying loose throughout your core. If you need to, place a hand on your stomach to remind yourself that that's the part that should be moving up and down -- not your chest and shoulders. Hold an ""s"" sound (like a hiss) when you exhale to control the amount of air that you can expel., Any tension at all will keep you from your best sound. Your jaw is the instrument your voice comes out of -- you have to take care of it, too. The best place to sing from is your diaphragm, so stick it out to breath there.


Massage your cheeks with the heel of each hand. Push in and down right below your cheekbone and rotate in a clockwise motion. Your jaw should open without you even thinking about it and be forced to relax. Do this several times., Ice cold water will just clam up your vocal folds, very literally. It's also best to avoid caffeine and nicotine, too. All these things constrict your throat and keep you from sounding your best.

]

Warm teas or room temperature water are your best bets. You definitely want your vocal cords to stay lubed up, but you don't want to freeze or scorch them! If you do choose tea, make sure it's not scalding hot."

, This needs to be related to the coaching you're going to give, and needs to be reasonably close in time. If, for example, all the white clothes came out of the washer pink because a red shirt was thrown in, well... ""I really appreciate your helping with the laundry!"" might be a way to start the conversation.

, Pause just a second to let that feeling solidify, then lead directly into the coaching. Avoid using the word ""but"" as in ""but next time"" since that can create the defensive atmosphere that you're trying to avoid. Be direct and firm, but never angry and never demeaning. Communication is a science and if you want positive results, you have to be very... scientific. ""I'm going to work with you on how to sort clothes so we don't end up with pink socks again.""

, Do not leave that in place; it has to be removed quickly, but correctly. Project a positive outcome of future efforts. The natural conclusion is that there was a good base to start (the initial praise), there are ways to improve that base (coaching), and combining those will produce even better results. ""It's great to have another set of helping hands and everybody will have more time for those after-dinner Wii battles!""

, The objective is to anchor the positive nature of the change in the mind of the individual. If you just let things drop, your coaching might be forgotten. Without consistent reinforcement, a process called ""extinction"" sets in: The desired behavioral change will not materialize.

Select the accent you wish to mimic.,
Listen to native speakers.,
Study the slang.,
Chat with a native speaker.,
Mimic the sounds and shape of the vowels.,
Practice in front of a mirror.,
Read aloud.,
Work with a qualified coach.",How to Use a Convincing Accent," There are many reasons why you may wish to learn how to speak in a different accent. Perhaps you love the sound of an Irish accent, or maybe you are auditioning for a role that requires that you speak with a Russian accent. Decide what would be the most interesting, useful, and fun accent or dialect to learn and develop. Learning a new accent can be fun, but it can also be a helpful tool for a job or for school!


If you are a linguistics student, understanding how language works and how various dialects and accents develop is important. Learning how other accents function and understanding how particular sounds are made can help you thoroughly understand your subject.
If you are a theatre student or a professional actor, you have most likely performed in or studied a Shakespearean play. To prepare to audition for the part of Romeo or to land the part of Ophelia, try practicing a British accent.;
, After you have chosen an accent to study, listen to native speakers to develop a thorough understanding of the accent’s unique sounds, patterns, and nuances. Search online for video and audio samples. Listen to interviews or radio broadcasts and watch movies or television shows. Surround yourself with various media produced by native speakers so that you can become familiar with how the accent should sound.Spanish that is spoken in Madrid and the northern part of Spain is called Castilian. Castilian has unique sounds that differentiates it from other forms of Spanish, which includes pronouncing ""ci"" and ""ce"" as ""th"" When you say ""gracias"" in Madrid, for example, it sounds like ""gratheas.""Listen for this sound next time you hear a native Spanish speaker conversing!
When watching a video of a native speaker, pay close attention to the way in which the speaker moves their mouth. The shape that their mouth makes will influence the sound.
Listen for particular sounds that are often repeated.

, Each regional dialect or accent has its own unique set of jargon that its speakers use in day-to-day interactions. Become familiar with your chosen accent’s colloquialisms and incorporate those terms into your speech. Being aware of and properly using the everyday slang and vernacular will make your accent seem more authentic and believable.The U.S. has a wide variety of accents and slang terms across its many regions. Speakers in the Appalachian region, for example, may use the term “reckon” to mean “to suppose” or “to consider.” A person may say, “I reckon I could come over for dinner this evening.”Find out the slang terms used in your chosen accent or dialect and discover how they are used in commonplace conversations.
In Scotland, the word “bonnie” is often used to describe something that is pretty or lovely. Incorporate popular and frequently used words into your speech when you are practicing your accent.

, Chatting with a native speaker is a great way to learn about the subtleties and nuances of a particular accent. Your brain will pick up on the unique sounds of the accent and, before you know it, you will be mimicking some of those sounds without intending to. The human brain subconsciously notices and reproduces the accent and speech patterns it hears as a way to empathize and bond with the speaker.The more often you immerse yourself in conversation with a native speaker, the stronger you will become at mimicking their accent.

, When practicing your chosen dialect, pay close attention to the vowel sounds. Vowel sounds are created by the flow of unobstructed air moving from the throat through the mouth. Different vowel sounds are created by the shape a person’s mouth makes while speaking. Each language, dialect, and accent has unique ways of shaping its vowels to produce its unique sound. Try to reproduce the sounds of the vowels by altering the shape of your mouth when speaking.


A Bostonian accent is an American accent where the vowels are often manipulated to produce unique sounds. For example, the vowel “a” is often described as sounding broad precisely because that is what the mouth does to create that particular sound. To get the long “a” or “ah” sound, stretch the corners of your mouth to the sides as the air passes through your lips.

, Watch yourself in the mirror when you are practicing your accent. Pay attention to the way your mouth moves to create vowels and how various shapes can influence the sound. Try to mimic the movements and expressions of a native speaker.

, Practice your accent by reading various written material out loud. Read through the material silently and imagine how the words would sound if spoken in a particular accent. Once you are familiar with the passage, read it aloud to yourself. Make notes when you struggle with a particular word or sound.Record yourself when you are reading aloud. Listen to the recording once you have finished, and pay attention to sounds that may need improvement.

, If you wish to hone and perfect your accent, consider hiring a qualified dialect or accent coach.Searching online can help generate a list of coaches in your area. Theaters often employ dialect coaches for particular productions. See if the local actors and directors in your area have recommendations for a coach.


Depending on your location, a dialect coach can cost anywhere between $85 to $300 per hour or session."

Follow up on the issue.",How to Give Advice," The first, most basic step in giving good advice (or any at all really) is to not judge the other person. No one should be thought of as less or as bad for a single decision that they made. We're all playing with a different set of cards and what you have in your hand and what you managed to do with it doesn't have anything to do with what someone else has.


Keep a straight face and remember what your mother taught you: if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.;
, We of course all have our own opinions on what is and isn't right or what someone should do, but when you give advice, the idea is to give someone the tools to make their own decision, not make the decision for them. Try to remove your own opinions from the conversation and just focus on helping them come to their own conclusion.


For example, if your friend is considering an abortion but you don't believe in it, don't spend the whole time telling her how bad it is. Instead, talk her through the arguments that you know of for and against it, in equal balance.
Only when someone asks you ""What would you do?"" should you let your own personal opinion shine through. Just make sure that you give the reasons why you have the opinion that you do, so that they can understand your logic.

, Let them know if you're not an expert. You don't have to be a lot of the time, since all they really need is a sounding board. But it's important that you don't give them the impression that you're an authority when you're not.


It's okay to not say ""I know how you feel"", too. Instead, say something like ""You're right to be upset about that"" or ""I can see how that would make me feel neglected"".

, Sometimes all someone needs to make the right decision is to know that someone believes in them and that someone thinks that they can do the right thing. Be that person for them, especially if no one else can be. Tell them something like, ""This is a really tough decision, but I know you want to do the right thing. And I know you will do the right thing. You just have to let all that bravery that I know you have shine through.""

, An intervention is when you give someone advice that didn't ask for it and probably doesn't want it. This can often be done with several other friends and family members of that person backing you up but it can also be done just on your own. Of course, it's important to know when you should and shouldn't intervene and give someone advice that they don't want. Generally, you should reserve this only for when you are worried that someone is a danger to themselves or others.


If it's just something like keeping a boyfriend you don't approve of because of his personality or religion, that's not a good reason. However, if you're worried that your friend is being physically abused by the boyfriend because she shows up to school with bruises, this is a good time to get involved.
Sometimes a firm hand is what is needed to get someone to make the right choice but often this can make someone more defensive. This is a very tricky situation and you might be gambling a bit.

, When someone is talking and trying to get your advice, start by just listening. A lot of the time, all someone needs is a sounding board. They need to be heard. This gives them the chance to sort out issues for themselves and come to accept a situation in their own mind. Don't talk until they're done, unless they seem to need a direct response. Sometimes if you listen to the whole story you can easily pinpoint the problem.

, If they ask for your opinion part-way through the story, give evasive answers and ask to get all of the information first. This is because you need to form a full, informed opinion before you can really give them good advice. They might manipulate the story and try to get an answer from you before you have all the facts, in order to get the answer that they're really hoping for.

, After they tell their story, ask them questions to get more information. This lets you develop a more full, informed opinion, but it can also help them to think about things that they hadn't considered, like alternatives or other points of view. Ask questions like:


""Why did you say that?""
""When did you tell him that?""

, One good habit is to ask them if they even want advice. Some people just want to talk and they don't want to be told what to do. If you feel they really need to hear your advice however, let them know it's just a suggestion, and you don't expect them to do it. If they say that they would like advice, give it. If they say no, then just say something like, ""Well, if you keep having problems I'm here and happy to help you through it.""

, If you can have a day or even a few hours to think about their problem and possible solutions, take that time to really think about every possible solution or way of approaching the problem. You could even take the opportunity to ask someone else for advice, if you know someone who's more knowledgeable on the issue. However, a lot of the time people need immediate help by the time they actually ask for advice, so you might just have to respond to the best of your ability and follow up later.

, Go over with them what that difficult parts of the situation are and why those things pose a problem. Something that they see as an impassable barrier might actually be easy to overcome, with a little outside perspective.


""So, you want to move but you're worried that it's impossible. What are the things stopping you from moving? You need to find a job first, right? Okay. What else? You can't leave your dad alone here? Right.""

, Sometimes peoples can't, as they say, see the forest for the trees. They have a hard time seeing the entirety of their situation or even possible solutions because they're so fixed on a few small problems. Help them take a step back by going over the big picture, from your outsider's perspective.


For example, if your friend is worried about bringing her new boyfriend to a party because he's older than she is and she doesn't want to be judged, you could point out that she probably won't know anyone at the party anyway so what difference does it make.

, Walk them through all of the options that they've thought of. Then, try to think of some new options that they haven't thought of and give them those as well. In this early stage, it's important to try to keep them from crossing out any options, so that all options can be weighed equally and in light of the others.


When they're dismissive of options, try to find out the real reason why. Sometimes they my object based on false understandings.
Say something like: ""So you want to tell your husband that you're pregnant again but you need to do it carefully because money is tough right now. You can wait to tell him until after you find out about this new job or you can tell him now so that he can have more time to look into other options. Have you considered seeing what assistance programs you might qualify for and then talking to him?""

, Once everything is on the table, walk through all the options with them and brainstorm the pros and cons together. Between the two of you, you should be able to come up with a less biased picture of what can be done to solve the problem.


""Telling your boyfriend that you want to get married is an option but knowing him it will just make him feel like you're judging him. Another option would be to double date with me and James. James can have a man-talk with him and maybe try to find out why he's so hesitant.""

, If you have any advice from experience or even just more information about what they might expect, give them that information once the options have been discussed. They can then use that extra information to solidify their feelings regarding the options.


Again, remember to try to keep bias and judgement out of your voice and words when you give them this advice.

, Most of the time people need a positive but motivational pep talk. Sometimes, however, people really need to hear it how it is. Sometimes, people just need a serious kick in the pants. You have to learn to gauge when it's one vs the other, which is tricky. There's no set formula. Generally, when someone is really just hurting themselves and not learning their lesson, that's when it's time to intervene.


However, if you don't have a good relationship with this person or if they tend to handle criticism very poorly, telling them what they need to hear might not do your relationship any favors in the short term.
Even when you do give someone this helpful nudge, it's important to not just be outright mean.

, People, when they seek advice, will often be wanting a guarantee. Remind them that you can't give this, that there's no way to predict the future. Let them see that you are there for them though and that even if things don't turn out like they hope, life will still go on.

, If they are dealing with a situation where another person can actually do something, such as many interpersonal situations or overwhelming work problems, offer to help them. They will likely refuse, but it's important to follow through if you do offer.


Of course, if you know you would be terrible at helping them, don't offer your own help but you can offer to help them find someone else who can help.

, As they navigate the difficult situation that they're in, continue to support them as much as you can. This can be as basic as being their cheerleader or it might mean something like covering their shift at work if they need to leave to deal with the situation. Knowing that you still have their back can make a world of difference.

, Do a little research on the problem that they're having and send them helpful links. You can even buy them a book, if you find one that covers their problem. This is a great way to give someone the tools they need to solve their own problems.

, If they don't offer any follow up information or updates, you should ask them (unless they clearly don't want to talk about it). This will let them see that you really do care about them and that you really are invested in seeing their problem solved.

Do scales.,

Add in sirens and kazoos.,
Hum.",How to Warm up Your Voice2," You wouldn't run 5 miles (8.0 km) out of the gate, so don't expect your voice box to be able to go up and down 3 octaves either. Doing scales slowly warms up your voice, extending it to its top and bottom ranges. And it's pretty easy to do, even alone.


If you are breathing right and holding yourself correctly, it'll be easier to hit those notes in your high register. Be patient, though, and work gradually. You'll actually hurt your voice if you start off too low or too high, forcing it to do things it really doesn't want to do., Another common method to warming up apart from scales are trills. They relax the lip and tongue, engage breathing, and eliminate tension.


For lip trills, simply create a raspberry sound by loosely placing your lips together. Experiment with different consonant sounds, like ""h"" and ""b."" Go slowly up and down your range, but don't do anything that's uncomfortable or hard to maintain.
For tongue trills, think of the Spanish ""r."" Place your tongue behind your upper teeth and exhale strongly. Hold the sound and air steady, varying the pitch while trilling. Again, don’t do anything your voice doesn't want you to do. You'll know., Some of the more fun warm ups are sirens and kazoos. When you do your siren (which should start low and go high), use your arm and toss it in a circular motion, going up and down with the pitch.


Kazoos focus of the sound and stretch the vocal folds in a healthy, controlled way. Just pretend like you're sucking in spaghetti -- it's as simple as that. On an exhale, make the “woo” sound; it'll come out like a buzz. Holding the sound steady, go up and down to the extremities of your range. Do this several times.Try some tongue twisters going up and down in tunes. This is preparing your voice for complexed songs. A good one is 'Seven salty sailors sailed the seven seas (repeat up in Do Re Me.)

, Humming actually helps cool a voice down, too, which is an oft-forgotten, though important, technique. It warms up your voice without straining your voice like singing can.


Release your jaw and relax your shoulders. Inhale normally and exhale on a ""hum."" Go from high to low, like a sighing half-siren. If you feel a tickling around your nose and lips, good job."

Keep it short.",How to Write a Persuasive Public Speech," If you have the freedom to choose your own topic, make sure you choose a compelling and interesting subject to talk about. The topic should be important to you but not so important that you can’t keep your composure while speaking. If you’re having trouble choosing something to talk about, consider a controversial topic. A controversial topic, such as abortion or the gender wage gap, will generate a lot of interest and conversation.


For example, if your school recently adopted school uniforms, you could write a compelling persuasive speech in favor of the new policy.;
, Before you start writing you need to completely understand your topic. Do some research and find out why people might agree with your argument and why people might disagree. Keep track of your research in a notebook so that you can easily refer to your notes when writing the speech.For example, adopting a school uniform can reduce the distractions that students face at school. However, it can be a financial burden for parents who can’t afford to buy lots of new clothes for their children.

, Think about the point of view of the audience you’ll be speaking to. Will the majority of the audience agree or disagree with your position? Identify the obstacles that your audience may have with your argument and research ways to address them. It’s better to mention negative aspects of your topic and explain them than to ignore them completely.For example, if a parent is worried that providing school uniforms for their children would become a financial burden, you could point out that uniforms are more cost effective in the long run.

, Most people are more likely to empathize with other people that are in similar situations. Real-life hardships of someone in their community will be more meaningful to them than a hypothetical person’s hardships. This is especially important if you’re arguing an unpopular point.


If you were trying to convince a room full of angry parents that school uniforms are in the best interest of their child, you could mention the ways in which the uniforms have benefitted a particular member of the community.

, This is an important step that many amateur writers skip. It’s much easier to write cohesively if you have a plan. The outline doesn’t have to be detailed; it can be as simple as a list. For example, you could have a list of arguments for your topic followed by a list of disproved arguments against your topic.


The more time you spend on research and outlining, the less time you’ll have to spend writing the speech. Writing is much easier if you’ve prepared yourself properly.

, This can also be called a “thesis.” Before you begin writing, figure out what your goal is. Write it out in big letters on a page of scrap paper so that you’ll see it often. Whenever you’re writing, you should be writing to achieve that goal. This will help cut down on wordiness and stop you from going off-topic.For example, your goal might be to convince elementary school parents that a school uniform would benefit their children. Everything you would write would need to be relevant to this goal.

, Don’t write so formally that you sound strange. Inversely, don’t write so informally that you sound insincere. Write as if you were having a serious conversation with someone you respect such as a teacher or a parent. You wouldn’t use overly wordy, flowery speech, but you also wouldn’t use bad grammar or slang.


Read out loud as you write.This technique will help show you how your speech sounds to an audience. Any awkward phrases will be easy to spot.

, This is especially important if the majority of your audience disagrees with your point of view. Begin by emphasizing your common ground with your audience to create empathy. Next, slowly work towards more divisive claims, making sure to relate these claims to the common ground you share. This will help convince your audience that your argument is correct.If you were arguing in favor of school uniforms, you might say, “Buying new clothes is expensive. I certainly can’t afford to buy as much as I’d like. However, when you have less types of clothing to buy, you save money in the long run.

, Evidence is a powerful motivator. If you can prove your point of view through carefully researched statistics, you’re more likely to sway your audience in your favor. However, empathy is even more powerful when persuading others. If you can make a person feel empathy through real-life examples, you can usually sway them to your point of view.For example, to prove that school uniforms are beneficial for students, you might write about the personal experiences of a student who has benefitted from the new uniform policy.

, Think of your speech as a story that will illustrate your argument.Include phrases that paint a compelling picture of your topic. For example, instead of saying “School uniforms reduce distractions for students,” say “Many students at L.B.J. Elementary are finding it easier to focus in class without the distracting fashion choices of their peers.”


Tell the audience why they should care. While you’re helping them visualize your point of view, it’s important to remind them of the reasons they should agree with you.

, Your introduction should clearly state your position and explain your logical process. Therefore, it’s best to write this section last so that you can adequately introduce your entire argument. Your conclusion should be very similar to your introduction. Don’t present any new information in your conclusion; if it’s important enough to mention, it should be included in the body of your speech.As a reminder, the “body” of a speech or paper refers to the writing between the introduction and the conclusion.
Try to include a “hook” in your introduction, or a sentence that is compelling and strongly worded. For example, you might write, “Many parents are against the new uniform policy. They wouldn’t be against it if they knew how beneficial it was to our students.”

, You don’t have to recite it word-for-word. However, if you know your speech well it will be easier to deliver, especially if you get nervous on stage. Additionally, reciting a speech from memory looks more professional than reading it from a piece of paper. If you are worried about forgetting your speech you can carry notecards with key phrases written on them to help jog your memory.


Rehearse your speech. You can do this in front of a mirror or in front of a small audience of family and friends. The more you practice the better your speech will be.
If you’re really worried about forgetting your speech, copy your speech word-for-word onto your notecards. Use one sentence per notecard and write in large letters.

, You should speak slowly enough that everyone in the audience can understand what you’re saying. Many people speak more quickly when they get nervous. If you find yourself doing this, take a deep breath and pace yourself. You don’t want to rush through your speech.


Don’t worry if you fumble over a few words. Your audience will be forgiving if you make a mistake. The important thing to do is to finish giving the speech.

, You want your audience to see you this way as well. If you are confident when you speak, they are far more likely to take your arguments seriously. If you’re reading off of notecards or an outline, make sure to look up frequently.


If you’re really nervous, stare over the audience. Find a spot on the wall over everyone’s heads to look at. Your audience will think that you’re making eye contact.

, It’s better to have a short, to-the-point speech than one that’s long and rambling. Most people have relatively short attention spans; if you speak longer than thirty minutes, you may lose their interest. Try to be concise with your writing to keep your speech short and manageable.


The Gettysburg Address is a good example of a short concise speech with less than three hundred words."

Write out lengthy quotes, complex statistics or other information that must be exact on your notes.,
Practice your speech using your notes.",How to Prepare Notes for Public Speaking," Construct an opening, well-organized paragraphs, effective transitions, and a memorable closing. Pay attention to sentence structure and word choice.;
, If you stumble over a certain word or combination of words, choose alternatives that will be easier to say. Listen for the rhythm and flow of your speech and make changes so that your reading proceeds smoothly from start to finish.

, Highlight the keywords in each sentence.

, Stop whenever you don't know what to say next.

, Try to remember what to say based only on the keywords you've highlighted. If the keywords don't help you, find new ones.

, Which you will use depends on the speaking situation and your own preferences.

, Put your notes on the lectern and occasionally glance down at your keywords. This will allow you to look out at your audience most of the time, which will keep them engaged.


Don't use more sheets than there is room for on the lectern. The movement and sound of turning pages over during your speech will be distracting to your audience.
When using paper for notes, organize the keywords in a way that makes sense to you. You may want to number them, list them under general headings or use different colors. Write the keywords large enough to keep you from having to lean down and squint in order to read them.

, Notecards give you something to hold while you speak, which is helpful if you don't know what to do with your hands, but you will not be as free to use gestures.


Use 4-by-6-inch (10 by 15 cm) cards in a light shade. These will be unobtrusive while still allowing you enough room to use large letters.
When using notecards, put the keywords for each paragraph or section on one card. You will pause briefly to flip the cards to the back of the stack, and this gives the audience a moment to prepare for the next part of your speech.
Number your notecards so you can put them back in order if you drop them.

, Read these word for word in your speech. In these situations, your audience will appreciate that you're taking the time to make sure you're accurate.

, Because you haven't memorized it, your speech will be a little different each time, but it will sound more natural than a memorized speech.


Use the notes you create to practice. If you practice from an outline and then try to use a keyword sheet or notecards when you give your speech, you'll likely become flustered.
If you can't deliver your speech smoothly and completely, make changes to your notes.

For a sports team, include the team members, parents, etc. For a school presentation, include classmates.;
, The speech should not just list accomplishments, but should tell the story of the achievement, no matter how big or small. Keep the story ""light"" - the idea is to make the recipient feel special.

, It is his or her special day, so the more you can do to make them feel special, the better.

,, This not only adds a great touch, it provides an opportunity to share the accomplishment with others who may not have been able to join the award ceremony, through a newsletter, newspaper, or email. It also enables the recipient to have something tangible to relive the moment at a future date.

Even if you’ve been given a theme for your speech such as “inspiration” or “strength,” this is more a general umbrella under which your specific point (and point of view) will fall. Brainstorm a short list of five ideas for your speech. It can be helpful to write them in command form to ensure that you’re delivering a message to your audience rather than just a soliloquy or meditation.For the example above of “strength” a brainstorm of five speech messages could include: “don’t ever give up,” “find strength through adversity,” “overcome failure,” “build physical strength for inner strength,” and “know your strengths.”
If you feel stuck for ideas, consider if there is a current political or social context that brings new insight to your theme.
Which of the ideas do you feel most passionate about? You’re apt to have a lot to say if you have strong feelings about a given topic.;
, By girding your central message with supporting evidence, you strengthen it. A stronger message has more meaning and will resonate more with your listeners. To come up with supporting points, ask yourself “why” about the speech message you’ve selected. For example, for “don’t ever give up,” you’d ask, “Why should you never give up?”So for our example above, three answers to the “why” could be: “Because you won’t accomplish your goals,” “because you’ve already invested time and effort,” and “because all things worth accomplishing challenge you.”
Make a list of several possible supporting ideas. Read through your finished list, and at the end, cross off the weaker ones that don’t support your main point as well. This way you’ll be left with the most potent arguments.

, After you have focused the central message and supporting points for your speech, you can flesh out the rest by considering our audience. Is this a formal speech at a CEO summit or a weekly meeting over bagels? Knowing who your audience is and what they are expecting from this encounter can help you pick the right tone to optimal effect. Expand on your message appropriately., Some speakers choose to generalize complex topics in a speech because they think it’s easier for the audience to understand. It’s actually better to do the opposite. Listeners tend to connect better with concrete examples and personal stories, so embrace detail in your speech. A personal anecdote about why one shouldn’t give up is more effective than just saying not to.In crafting your speech, you can draw on famous stories, parables or your professional area of expertise. Areas where your passion and knowledge overlap are generally richest.
If appropriate to the context, don’t be afraid to tell a joke about the topic. A little self-deprecating humor can make the audience warm to you.

, Some of the most effective speeches of all time have been brief. “The Gettysburg Address” was only 15 minutes, while “I Have A Dream” was 17. Aim for brevity. A good formula is to speak for 20% less time than you’ve been asked to, as people tend to vastly overestimate the attention span of their audience. So for example, if you were asked to speak for 1 hour, try speaking for 48 minutes., Because this speech is being delivered to an audience rather than being published, it is important to get feedback from theoretical listeners. Read your speech to someone you trust and ask for some honest feedback. In particular, it can be helpful to ask if anything is confusing or unclear. Your speech will have more impact if the message is engaging.

, During your speech, look at your audience while you are taking. It can be helpful to put the content of your speech, either fully written out or in bullet points, on note cards, so you are not staring straight down at a piece of paper while you speak. Use the changing of each note card to remind yourself to look up..


Try to connect with someone new every time you scan the room. Engaging your audience visually makes you appear secure and confident.

, It doesn’t matter how great your speech is if people only hear every few words. Use a friendly, but authoritative tone and be sure to speak loudly enough so everyone can hear you., A well-placed gesture can add humor or aid greater understanding of your speech. These non-verbal cues can emphasize your speech’s content for better comprehension. For optimal effectiveness, punctuate your speech with gestures when appropriate.Try to keep gestures of moderate size and between your shoulders and waist. Gesticulating wildly can make you seem out of control.
Try to avoid pulling at the hem of your clothes or gesturing too much if your hands are shaking with nerves. If you’re a very nervous public speaker, try just resting your hands against the podium. It will make you feel steadier.

, If your speech is informal, walking from one side of the stage to the other can help engage people sitting in different parts of the audience. Linger for a moment or pause your walking to punctuate a thoughtful moment of your speech. It will draw your audience in and enhance your effectiveness., Practicing your speech frequently ahead of time will make you feel most at ease with the material. This will enable you to employ more of the non-verbal cues, which increase speech effectiveness. Try practicing in front of a mirror to note any desired (or undesired) facial expressions you use during your speech.Use a voice recorder app on your phone to record yourself delivering your speech, and listen to the playback. Make notes of any undesirable pauses or places where your voice becomes difficult to hear. Work on these sections of your speech in particular.

, If appropriate, bring props to punctuate your speech for your audience. This can be anything useful such as a graph to handout to all attendees or even a personal item to drive home your speech’s content. Props can personalize your speech and add interest or humor.For example, if you were giving a speech about conquering your fears, it might be funny and effective to show your childhood teddy bear to the audience. “Humans have lots of ways of conquering fears,” you might say. “This is Fuzzy, and he was mine for the first 5 years of my life. While we might not sleep with teddy bears as adults, conquering our fears in effective ways is no less important.”
Limit yourself to one or two props maximum per speech.

, Use your clothes to reinforce your authority or professionalism as the speaker to increase your effectiveness. For example, if you, a doctor, are giving a speech at a medical supply company, it might make sense to wear your white coat. Similarly, if you are a CEO, wear a nice suit to convey authority., A dry throat can sabotage the most well-intentioned speakers and blunt their message. Have a glass or bottle of water nearby while you deliver your speech in case you need to take a drink.

Realize the source of your fear.,
Face down your fears.,
Prepare.,
Practice.,
Buy some recording software, and record everything on your laptop.,
Breathe deeply.,
Relax.,
Make use of the wall push.,
Be aware that adrenaline sends the blood rushing to the fight/flight centres of your brain at the base of the skull.,
Learn how to enroll and engage your audience.,
Recognize that people can't see your nervousness.,
Do not overthink the audience's reactions.",How to Overcome Your Fear of Public Speaking," In a nutshell, it is not knowing what will happen when you are in front of people, giving your speech or presentation. Your fear is not that you don't know your topic. It is that you don't know what will happen when you step to the podium or table.

The fear of being judged, making a mistake, not measuring up, getting hurt either mentally or physically can get in the way of a good performance (speech, seminar, sales presentation, etc). Remember that people in the audience really want you to succeed. Nobody is standing there hoping you'll be boring or bad. If you are coming from an authentic place, and you cover the material with clarity, you've won 3/4 of your inner battle with fear.

, If you feel your knees turning to jelly out of fear, remind yourself that fear stands for False Evidence Appearing Real. Almost certainly, whatever it is that you're frightened of won't happen. If there is a real worry, for example you've forgotten an important prop, do something about it and then stop worrying. Remember, you can always rationalize yourself out of fear.
, Make sure you know the material that you're going to cover. Make a detailed outline, and break it into basic points to memorize. Include subpoints and the title of speech. Here is an idea to help you build a speech that flows well:


Associate each part of the outline into a ""room"" in your house. Your first point is your entry room. The second point is your hallway/kitchen/living room (as you step through your house in your imagination), etc.
Associate each sub point with pictures on the wall. Have the pictures demonstrate something that will help you remember your point. The more ridiculous, the better the speech will stick (as long as you don't get distracted).
The morning of the presentation, walk through ""the house"" in your mind to ""decode"" the memorization technique.

, Find business organizations, networks and clubs in your area (such as Toastmasters) that can afford you the opportunity to practice. Remember to choose topics that you are already an expert on. Speaking on a topic that you are not familiar with will increase your stress, and impede on your performance.

, Review it to see where you can improve. Have speaking pros attend your live presentation to give you feedback. Allow yourself the opportunity to learn more every time you go out.

, Practicing a breathing exercise before you go on will relax your body and mind. Here's one that you can do anywhere, even in the wings. Stand still and feel the ground beneath your feet. Close your eyes and imagine yourself suspended from the ceiling by a thin thread. Just listen to your breathing and tell yourself there is no rush. Slow your breathing until you can count to 6 seconds of in-breath and 6 seconds of out-breath. You'll now go on in a totally relaxed and confident mood.

, Relaxing is the art of letting go. There are many ways to let go. You can imagine you're made of rubber . Or you can sit in front of a mirror and make a horse's laugh with your lips. Why not lie on the ground and pretend you're floating? Or, just collapse on the ground like a limp doll. Letting go un-tenses the body and makes you more at ease and relaxed.

, The wall push was a technique used by Yul Brynner, star of the musical ""The King and I"". This is what you do:


Stand about 18"" away from a wall and place your palms flat on it.
Push against the wall. As you push, your abdominal muscles will contract. As you breathe out, hiss and contract the muscles below your rib cage as if you were rowing a boat against the current.
Do this a few times, and you'll banish all feelings of stage-fright.

, Place your hand on your forehead and press gently on the bony points. This will bring the blood to the parts of the brain that need it to present your speech best.

, If you haven't yet taken a professional development course on public speaking, consider finding a public speaking training course appropriate for your needs. Learning the art of public speaking can enhance your results in a boardroom, in a sales presentation, and even accelerate your climb up the corporate ladder. It is a must-skill for any executive and/or business owner.

, When you're walking out onto the stage toward the podium, no one knows you're nervous. Your stomach could be in knots and you feel like you're going to be sick, but you really aren't showing nervous behavior. Sometimes, with public speaking, you think that people may notice you're nervous. This makes you even more nervous. There are only a few subtle cues that show a person is nervous and they're so small, that the ordinary person wouldn't put more than 1 second into them. Don't worry so much. People don't see that extreme nervous beast inside you.


Bluff. Stand tall, with shoulders back and chest out. Smile. Even though you don’t feel happy or confident, do it anyway. You will look confident and your body will fool your brain into thinking it is confident.

, When you are on stage or speaking in public, calm your mind. Remember that even if you see people looking at you like they think you are weird, ignore it. What they think doesn't matter. If there really is something that you know you are doing wrong, fix it as quick as possible.


Yawning, bored expressions and similar negative facial expressions will always appear in an audience. Chances are some of those people will be bored whatever the occasion; some of those people are difficult to please; some of those people are tired; some of those people are distracted. None of these reasons reflect on you.

Practice, practice, practice!",How to Prepare and Give a Speech Using an iPhone," Although this article isn't about speech content, you should always start by thinking about the goal of your speech. Who is the audience? Is the speech for a formal or informal occasion? Is it for work, to educate or to entertain?;
, Don't use the built in Notes application for this purpose, it can be very hard to find your content quickly as it's not built to replicate cue cards.

, To organize your speaking notes one very useful app is iSpeechCards, an application specifically for creating and helping deliver speech material. Or you could start by using an outlining application, such as Outliner or Zeptoliner. Some outliners will be able to export in a format called OPML which iSpeechCards can use, so you aren't restricted to just one app.

, There is a large choice of voice and recording applications too which can be useful to record your speech before the event. Although most of these apps are designed for taking verbal notes, they can also be used for this purpose. Examples are iTalk Recorder or Record - Voice Recorder. Check that the app will be able to record at least as long as you'll need to be speaking. A good feature is the ability to pause and resume recording.

, If you use iSpeechCards it's easy to copy and reorder your note cards. Outliners are very good at reordering and reorganizing your text because that's exactly what they are designed for.

, It's essential to get the timing of your speech right. In iSpeechCards assign each of your cards a duration so it can track progress when it comes to delivering the speech.

, Write facts and figures, keep notes short. Write enough to jog your memory. Remember, you don't want to read your speech as though it's a novel. The iPhone and iPod makes it so easy to enter text that all these apps let you write your ideas down quickly and clearly. Having simple notes with legible text and bullet points really helps.

, Rehearse your speech! In iSpeechCards you can ""play back"" a speech. This lets you track progress against elapsed time. Be prepared to go back and adjust your speech several times to get the timings, content and general flow just right. It's essential to practise by speaking out loud. Going over notes in your head is not the real thing!

Move past mistakes.",How to Overcome Your Fear of Reading1," Practice can’t guarantee perfection, but it will inspire greater confidence when reading in front of others. If you know what you’ll be reading ahead of time, practice in front of a mirror, in front of friends, or in front of a video camera. Practice reading slowly and clearly, as most people read aloud more quickly than they realize.If you don’t know what you’ll be asked to read aloud, work on building your overall public reading and speaking skills. Emphasize deliberate speech and positive body language.
Try joining an organization that focuses on public speaking, such as Toastmasters.;
, Many people get wobbly knees, trembling hands, and cold sweats when asked to stand up and read in front of others. You can’t deny these natural manifestations of anxiety, but you can work on recognizing and managing them.Do calming exercises, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, before you enter the classroom or meeting room.
Try gesturing with your hands while reading, or holding a heavier book or stack of papers in order to reduce indications of trembling.
Practice making subtle shifts in body position and weight-bearing to limit signs of weak knees.
If you tend to sweat a lot, wear light layers of darker clothing to mask it.

, No matter how much you practice the passage and calm yourself beforehand, you’ll likely flub a line or mangle a phrase here and there. Keep going if it’s a minor error, or go back and restate the words more clearly if necessary. Accept that we all make mistakes, and remain composed. Overreacting to one mistake will likely just lead to more of them.


If you have a crippling fear of making mistakes while reading, or simply of reading out loud in general, you may have a treatable condition such as dyslexia. Don’t hesitate to consult with a therapist and/or reading specialist."

, Make sure that your points are concise and direct.


You can start by looking at generic sources like an encyclopedia or Wikipedia, but you need to fact check your ideas with more authoritative sources after you generally understand your subject.
Draw on your own experience. If you have a long history with your topic, your experiences and personal stories can be great resources. Just keep these stories succinct so that you don't ramble and lose the audience's attention.

,


Consider your comfort level with the topic. If you know the topic well and can improvise easily, then use index cards.

Use 1 card for the introduction. This card should include your opening statement.
Use 1 or 2 cards for each supporting point. Then, create 1 card for the conclusion which ties back to the main idea of your speech.
Write brief sentence fragments or even single words on your cards. These words or fragments should contain key phrases that remind you of what you want to say.


If you feel insecure or don't know the subject well, write out the words of your speech exactly as you want to say them.

, You may create a Prezi or a PowerPoint presentation to go along with your speech, or you may choose to use paper-based charts and graphs.


Keep the visuals to a minimum. You want them to aid your speech, not to overshadow it.

"
Be clear on the occasion.,
Pick a topic that will interest your audience.,
Set a goal.,
Always keep your audience in mind.",How to Prepare a Speech2," It's important to know what kind of speech you're giving and why your audience is gathering to hear it in order to get started on the right foot. Understand if your speech is meant to be a personal narrative, informative, persuasive or ceremonial.


Personal narrative. A narrative is just another word for story. If you're asked to tell a story about yourself, find out if the intention is to use something that's happened to you in order to teach a lesson, convey a moral, offer inspiration or simply to entertain.
Informative speech. There are two kinds of informative speeches: process and expository. If you're charged with doing a process speech, the idea is for you to explain how something is done, how something is made or how something works. You take your audience step-by-step through the process. If your speech is meant to be expository, your job is to take what might be a complex subject and break it down into sections as a way of educating your audience about the topic.
Persuasive speech. If you're meant to persuade, then your job is to convince your audience to adopt a particular way of thinking, a belief or a behavior that you advocate for.
Ceremonial speech. Ceremonial speeches run the gamut from wedding toasts to eulogies, from graduation speeches to farewell addresses. Many of these speeches are intended to be short and the focus is often on entertaining, inspiring or increasing the audience's appreciation for someone or something.

, If you have the option, choose to speak about something that your audience will find interesting or enjoyable. Sometimes, you don't have a choice about your topic--you find yourself assigned to speak about something in particular. In that case, you must look for ways to keep your audience engaged in what you have to say.

, Write a one-sentence statement about what you want to accomplish on behalf of your audience. It could be something as simple as ""I want my audience to learn the four things they should look for when buying a diamond"" or ""I want to convince my audience to give up fast food for a month."" It may sound simplistic, but writing down this kind of goal statement does two thing: it helps keep you on track as you begin putting your speech together, and it helps remind you to keep your focus on your audience as you move through your speech preparation process.

, It would be a terrible waste of time and effort if you devoted yourself to putting a speech together and the audience tuned out or couldn't remember a word you said by the time you were done. You continually want to think of ways to make what you have to say interesting, helpful, relevant and memorable to your audience.


Read the newspaper. If you can find a way to link your speech topic to something that's happening in the news, you can highlight the relevance of what you have to say to your audience.
Translate numbers. Using statistics in your speech can be impactful, but they can be even more meaningful if you translate them in a way the audience can understand. For example, you could say that worldwide, 7.6 million people die of cancer every year, but to make it more relatable, you might want to follow it up by saying that that number represents the entire population of Switzerland.
Express the benefits. It's a good idea to let an audience know exactly what they'll get out of your speech, so that they're primed to listen. If they'll learn how to save money, tell them. If the information you're about to share will make their lives easier in some way, make that clear. If they'll gain a new appreciation of someone or something, let them know.

"
"
Know your subject.,
Do broad research.,
Avoid plagiarism.,
Decide if you'll outline or script.,
Be sure you have all the pieces in place.",How to Prepare a Speech3," In some cases, you might need to do nothing more than sit down, gather your thoughts and put all of your ideas on paper. Other times, your topic will be unfamiliar enough that you must do research in order to speak about it knowledgeably. Most times, you'll fall somewhere in between the two extremes.

, The internet can be a great source to find out more about your speech topic, but don't necessarily stop there. If you're a student, use your school's library or library databases. Many public libraries subscribe to databases that house thousands and thousands of articles. If you have a library card, you have free access to those databases. Think about interviewing someone who's an expert in your topic or conducting a survey. The more ways you go at gathering the information you need, the more successful you're likely to be. Plus, using various research sources gives your speech breadth.

, When you do use information you got from an outside source in your speech, plan to give credit to that source. To do so, keep track of where you're getting your information so that you can cite it later on.

, Narrative, informative and persuasive speeches lend themselves well to being outlined while ceremonial speeches are best written out.


Outline. When you outline, you're simply organizing and structuring your speech as a series of points. For example, if you were giving the speech mentioned above: ""I want my audience to learn the four things they should look for when buying a diamond,"" you might designate one point for ""Cut,"" one for ""Color,"" one for ""Clarity"" and one for ""Carat."" Under each of those points, you'd offer your audience more information and detail.

Outlines can be written in complete sentences or they can be a series of abbreviated phrases and reminders. Another approach is to begin by writing complete sentences and then transferring your outline on to note cards on which you abbreviate those sentences using just the words and memory prompts you need.


Script. One reason that it makes sense to write out ceremonial speeches is because the words you choose to express yourself in these kinds of speeches are particularly important. You're meant to inspire or entertain or pay tribute to someone, so saying exactly what you mean and have prepared increases your chances for success.

Pull out your old English textbooks and review things like similes, metaphors, alliteration and other kinds of figurative language. These kinds of devices can add to the impact of a ceremonial speech.
Beware one pitfall of the scripted speech: having a page full of words in front of you can cause you to fall into the trap of simply reading from your script without every looking up, making eye contact or engaging with the audience in any way. Thorough practice should help to eliminate your chances of falling into this trip.



, A speech includes three basic pieces: an introduction, a body and a conclusion. Be sure your speech contains all of these elements.


Introduction. There are two things that most good introductions include: an attention-getter and a preview of what's to come in the speech.

Give an attention-getter. The most important thing you must do in your introduction is to grab your audience's attention. You can do this in a number of ways: ask a question, say something surprising, offer startling statistics, use a quote or proverb related to your speech topic or tell a short story. Take the time to figure out how you'll grab your audience's attention--it's easier to get them hooked in the beginning than to try to get them interested as your speech progresses.
Offer a preview. Think of a preview as kind of the ""coming attractions"" of your speech. Plan to tell your audience the main points you'll talk about in your speech. There's not need to go into any detail here; you'll get to that when you come to the body of your speech. You can write a preview that's simply one sentence in length to cover what you need to say here.


Body. The body is where the ""meat"" of your speech resides. The points you outlined or the information you scripted make up the body. There are several ways to organize the information within the body of your speech--in time sequence, in step order, from most important point to least important point, problem-solution, to name just a few. Choose an organizational pattern that makes sense based on your speech goal.
Conclusion. There are two things to accomplish in your conclusion. This is not the place to introduce any new information; instead, the idea is to wrap things up in a way that's memorable and definite.

Give a summary. One of the ways an audience remembers what a speech was about is through intentional repetition. In your introduction, you gave a preview of what you'd be talking about. In your speech body, you talked about those things. Now, in your conclusion, you remind your audience what you talked about. Simply offer a brief review of the main points you touched on in your speech.
End with a clincher. A clincher is a memorable, definitive statement that gives your speech a sense of closure. One easy way to do this is to write a clincher that refers back to what you said in the attention-getter of your speech. This helps bring your presentation full circle and provides a sense of closure.



"
"
Choose visuals to benefit the audience.,
Pick visuals that suit the speech.,
Use PowerPoint with care.",How to Prepare a Speech4," There are many good reasons to use visual aids. They can help make things easier to understand, they help audiences remember what you've said, they appeal to visual learners, and they can help an audience view you as more persuasive. Be sure you're clear on what you hope to accomplish with each visual you incorporate into your speech.

, While it's a great idea to use visual aids in your speech, be sure to choose ones that make sense. For example, in the speech mentioned above in which the speaker wants the audience to learn the four things to look for when buying a diamond, it might would make sense to show a diagram of a diamond that illustrates where a jeweler makes cuts in preparing the gemstone. It would also be helpful to show side-by-side photos of clear, white and yellow diamonds so the audience can recognize the differences in color. On the other hand, it wouldn't be very helpful to show an exterior photo of a jewelry store.

, PowerPoint can be a great delivery device for visual aids. You can use it to show photos, charts, and graphs with ease. But there are common mistakes that speakers sometimes make when using PowerPoint. These are easy to avoid once you stop and think about them.


Don't write everything you plan to say on your slides. We've all suffered through speeches where the speaker did little more that read off of his or her slides. That's boring for the audience, and they soon disengage. Instead, use word charts to preview, review or highlight key information. Remember, the sides should be a supplement to what you're going to say rather than an exact copy of it.
Make your slides readable. Use a font size that's easy for your audience to read and don't overcrowd your slides. If your audience can't see or get through the material on your slides, they won't have served any purpose.
Use animations sparingly. Having graphics fly around, zoom in and out ,and change colors can be engaging but can also be distracting. Be careful not to overdo the special effects. Your slides should be a supporting player rather than the star of the show.

Consider what’s holding you back from reading.,
Ease back into reading.,
Read with other people.,
Adjust your media consumption habits.",How to Overcome Your Fear of Reading2," Even if you used to be an avid reader, you might at some point find yourself unwilling or unable to pick up a book or other reading material. You may find yourself obsessing over small passages; unable to concentrate or remember what you just read; feeling inadequate to the task of reading challenging material; or even feeling insignificant in comparison to the larger world and deeper truths revealed through reading. Take some time to think about the sources and symptoms of your reading avoidance.A fear of reading — or more accurately, an inability to draw pleasure from reading — can be known as “reader’s block,” but it also has a more technical label — lexical anhedonia.

, If you’ve found yourself avoiding reading, don’t try to force yourself back into the habit by picking up War and Peace or Ulysses. Start with shorter, digestible morsels of reading material, like magazine articles or short story collections. Keep a wide selection of reading materials readily available, so that you can read what you want when you want.If you want to re-read something for the eighth time, do it. If you want to read children’s books, go for it. If you want reading to become pleasurable again (or even for the first time), you need to start out by choosing reading materials that please you.

, Finding a reading buddy or joining a book club might provide you with the right mix of motivation and social interaction to get you going. Being part of a group gives you a reason to pick up the book; having others to talk with about the book helps you see that everyone has challenges, questions, concerns, opinions, and even fears about what they read.Reading can become your gateway to developing new friendships or deepening existing relationships.
Joining a group can also be good motivation and help to keep you accountable.

, If you find yourself struggling to stay awake when reading anything longer than a news article, you may have become too accustomed to consuming “rich media” — that is, interactive, brief snippets of information accessed digitally. To restore your attention span and recapture the pleasures of sitting down with a good book, you may want to dial back on your consumption of “rich media” reading materials.For instance, at bedtime, place your smartphone out of reach and put a couple of book options on your nightstand. Limiting your exposure to a glowing screen before bed will likely help you sleep better as well.
Many people in the western world divide their attention between multiple tasks on a regular basis, so reading something of substance or length may need to be relearned as a skill."
"
Provide yourself with enough time and a good environment.,
Prioritize reading comprehension over speed.,
Seek out reading instruction as needed.",How to Overcome Your Fear of Reading3," Feeling rushed or uncomfortable while reading is likely to increase anxiety and reduce comprehension. Don’t leave reading a textbook chapter to the last minute, or expect to power through your book club selection the night before.If you’re working on developing your reading skills and/or a reading habit, carry along several reading options to suit your interest in the moment and the time you have available (for instance, riding the bus or sitting in the dentist’s waiting room).
When possible, set up in a comfy (but not sleep-inducing) space with lots of light.

, Many people confuse reading speed with reading skill; however, not being able to remember or make sense of what you just read (because you went too fast) may contribute to a fear of reading. Let your reading speed increase naturally — or, if you desire, with targeted instruction — after you’ve built up your reading comprehension skills.Holding a notecard or running your finger beneath the line you’re reading may slow you down a bit, but if it helps you understand what you’re reading, it’s worth the extra time.
Try to focus on one part of the page at a time. You can make this easier by covering up part of the page with your hand or a piece of paper.

, You’re never too old to learn to read, or to improve your reading skills. If reading presents a special challenge for you, seek out reading instruction resources available at your school, in your community, or online. Look for specialized instruction if you have a diagnosed condition like dyslexia.Don’t let a diagnosis of dyslexia or another condition turn you off from reading, or make you feel like you aren’t smart enough to succeed. Many people with reading issues have gone on to achieve great things.

"
"
Acknowledge what you’re afraid of.,
Challenge your fears.,
Employ relaxation techniques.,
Get help managing your fears.",How to Overcome Your Fear of Reading4," The first step to overcoming your fear of reading (or anything else) is to acknowledge that the fear exists. Denial is not a cure, and you can’t will a fear out of existence.


Verbalize your particular fear by speaking it out loud and writing it down: “I am afraid that my classmates will laugh at me if I make a mistake while reading,” or “I think trying to read this difficult book will prove how dumb I am.”

, Fears don’t have to be rational to be real, but examining them rationally may help you to find vulnerabilities that you can exploit. For instance, you might watch your classmates when someone else is reading aloud and notice that most of them pay no attention whatsoever, and the rest pay no mind to small reading mistakes.Question your fears directly: “Would I really not get the promotion if I get tongue-tied once or twice while reading this report?” You can also use the “So what?” technique to trace the potential worst case scenario to a situation. For example, if you think to yourself, ""I'm going to fail the reading course,"" then ask ""So what?"" “Then I won't pass my class,” and ask again ""So what?"" “Then I won't get the degree,” and again ""So what?"" Keep going until you come to the logical conclusion that your fear will not kill you and that it is not as important as it seems.
Try gradual exposure. If you fear reading because you have trouble maintaining focus, start with short passages and quiz yourself afterward. Slowly work your way up to longer readings.

, If you can’t eliminate the fear, reduce its impact by maintaining your calm and composure. Use deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, prayer, yoga, light exercise, or other activities that reduce stress. Sometimes simply talking to a trusted friend is enough to calm you down., There are no “bonus points” awarded for overcoming a fear alone; if you would benefit from help, seek it out. Seek comfort and understanding from friends and loved ones, look for support groups, or utilize the services of a therapist or counselor.


You might feel ashamed to admit to a fear of reading, but the only shame would be to let a manageable fear prevent you from experiencing the joys and benefits of reading.

Say ""I would like to speak to a person"".,
Mumble.,
Repeat ""complaint"".,
Curse.",How to Talk to a Human when Calling a Business2," Or repeat ""operator"" or ""agent;"" say ""I would like to speak with a human being."" Since these systems often miss the first 1/4 second of your statement, full sentences allow for a clearer understanding.

, Don't say anything distinguishable. If the system hears you making sounds and cannot distinguish words, it usually asks you to repeat yourself twice, then gives up and sends you to customer service.

, Do it as many times as you can. Many voice-controlled systems have checks for certain words, so you may be forwarded to a real human being after a mere three or four utterances of that word

, Many programs are trained to recognize swear words and often take you to an operator after you drop an f-bomb or two. Just remember not to carry this method over when you're speaking to the actual operator!


Refrain from yelling at the system, as tempted as you might be. Most systems are designed to respond to a regular tone of voice and will only ask you to repeat yourself if you speak loudly."

"
Give yourself plenty of time.,
Practice in front of people.,
Be OK with changes.",How to Prepare a Speech5," The more time you have to practice your speech, the more prepared you'll feel, and as a result, the less nervous you'll feel. One guideline for the amount of time to spend on preparing a speech is one to two hours for every minute you'll be speaking. For example, you might want to devote 5 to 10 hours of prep time for a 5-minute speech. Of course, that includes ALL of your preparation from start to finish; your rehearsal would be just a portion of that time.


Leave yourself time to practice. If you're given to procrastinating, you could find yourself with very little or no time to practice before you deliver your speech, which could leave you feeling unprepared and anxious.

, Whenever possible, give your speech in front of family members and friends. If you want their feedback, give them specific guidelines for what you'd like them to comment on so that you don't feel overwhelmed by helpful notes.


Look at your audience. Almost nothing does more to keep an audience engaged than eye contact from a speaker. As you rehearse your speech, be sure to look at the family members or friends who've agreed to be your audience. It takes a bit of practice to be able to look at your outline, script or note cards, capture a thought or two and then come up and deliver that information while looking at your audience. It's yet another reason why rehearsal time is so important.
If you don't have the opportunity to practice in front of people, be sure that when you do rehearse, that you say your speech aloud. You don't want your speech day to be the first time you hear the words of your speech coming out of your mouth. Plus, speaking out loud gives you a chance to double-check and correct any mispronunciations, practice articulating your words clearly and confirm the timing of your speech (We speak more quickly when we simply recite a speech in our heads).

, One thing rehearing your speech allows you to do is to make any necessary changes. If it's running too long, you have to cut some material. If it's too short or some sections seem skimpy, you add more. Not only that, but each time you practice your speech aloud, it will come out a bit differently. That's perfectly fine. You're not a robot, you're a person. It's not necessary to get your speech word-for-word perfect, what matters is conveying the information in an engaging and memorable way.

"
"
Get physical.,
Focus on your audience.,
Use visual aids.,
Practice visualization.,
Stay positive.",How to Prepare a Speech6," It's common for people to feel physical symptoms of nervousness--rapidly beating heart, quick breathing and shaky hands--before giving a speech. That's a perfectly normal response caused by a release of adrenaline in the body--something that happens when we feel threatened. The key is to engage in physical activity to help move the adrenaline through your system and allow it to dissipate.


Clench and release. Ball up your fists really, really tight and hold for a second or two and then release. Repeat this a few times. You can do the same thing by squeezing the muscles in your calves very tightly and then releasing. With each release, you should feel a reduction in your adrenaline-induced symptoms.
Take deep breaths. The adrenaline in your system causes you to take more shallow breaths that, in turn, increase your feeling of anxiety. You need to break the cycle. Take a deep breath through your nose and allow the air to fill your belly. Once your belly is full, let your breath fill and expand your ribcage. Finally, allow your breath to move fully into your chest. Open your mouth slightly and begin to exhale starting first with the air in your chest, then the air in your ribcage and finally the breath in your belly. Repeat this inhale-exhale cycle five times.

, While it might seem difficult to believe, a good speech is really not about you, the speaker. It's about the audience. Plan to put your total focus and concentration on your audience throughout your speech, especially in the beginning. Really take them in and check out the non-verbal messages they're sending you--do they understand what you're saying? do you need to slow down? are they in agreement with you? would they be open to you moving closer to make a stronger connection? If you put your attention fully on your audience, you won't have time to think about your own nerves or anxiety.

, You're probably planning to use visual aids anyway, but if you're not, you might want to consider it. For some people, using visual aids reduces their anxiety because it makes them feel less like the center of attention; instead, they feel as though they're sharing the spotlight with the visuals.

, When you use visualization you simply create a mental image of you successfully giving your speech. Close your eyes and see yourself sitting down prior to your speech. Hear your name being called or your introduction being given. Visualize yourself standing up confidently, picking up your notes and walking to the podium. See yourself taking a moment to make sure your notes are in order and looking up to make eye contact with the audience. Then picture yourself giving your speech. Watch yourself move through the entire talk successfully. See the speech end, yourself saying ""thank you"" and returning confidently to your seat.

, Even if you're feeling nervous, do your best not to engage in a lot of negative talk. Instead of saying ""This speech is going to be a disaster"" say instead ""I did the best I could preparing this speech."" Replace ""I'm a nervous wreck"" with ""I feel nervous, but I know that's normal before a speech, and I won't let that stop me from doing my best.""


Negative thoughts are incredibly powerful--one estimate is that you need five positive thoughts to counteract every one negative thought you have, so steer clear of them.

Write out the entire speech.,
Type up the speech.,
Rehearse your speech for a friend.,
Record yourself rehearsing the speech.,
Avoid trying to memorize the speech word for word.",How to Memorize a Speech in One Night1," Simply take a piece of paper and a pen and write out the entire speech. If the speech is relatively short, consider writing it out multiple times. Many people memorize information better when they are actively recording it. Copying the speech on another piece of paper can help to commit that information to memory., Much like writing the speech out on paper, typing the speech can also help commit the information to memory through visual learning. Since typing is generally faster than handwriting, you may have more time to type the speech several times in one night.There is no need to print the typed speech each time that you type it.
However, you may be more likely to remember things that are handwritten rather than typed., Sometimes you may think that you know your speech well, but you freeze up when you perform it in front of people. It is important to practice the speech in front of someone to ensure that you really know the information. Request that your friend give you some tips. They may be able to tell you if you are not speaking loud enough or if you are talking too quickly., If you don’t have anyone to practice with, try recording yourself while you rehearse your speech. Video recording is the best because you will be able to watch the recording and critique your speech and body language. You can also listen to the recording while you are doing other things to help remember the information., Normally, it is not necessary to recite a speech word for word. It is more important to remember all of the topics that you need to cover during the speech. Spend time memorizing the bullet points, important facts and statistics, and the layout of your speech in order to guarantee that you cover all of the information that needs to be covered."

Start with the first phrase read it while looking at the paper then close your eyes and say it. Then read that phrase over again with the next one, and then close your eyes and repeat both phrases. Repeat, repeat, repeat.

, Do whatever you can to try to make memorizing your monologue fun. If you're bored, you risk giving up on it.

If you do make a mistake or miss a word, simply repeat the part you missed. Don't advertise that you made a mistake or make it worse by floundering, or by offering more than a simple ""excuse me"" by way of apology. Listen to people who speak on the radio. They miss words often enough, but they recover quickly and without dwelling on it.
Use a natural voice or exaggerate your inflection a little bit. Try to avoid reading in a monotone.

Choose a material.,
Find the center point of one side.,
Make a short arc.,
Make a long arc.,
Cut the megaphone from the material.,
Roll the megaphone.,
Overlap one side.,
Glue or fasten the overlap.,
Decorate your megaphone, if desired.,
Add a handle.,
Add a mouthpiece.",How to Make a Megaphone," You can make an effective megaphone out of sturdy construction paper. For a more durable version, you can shape it from a cardboard or posterboard. Either way, you can decorate your megaphone when you are finished to make it aesthetically pleasing.Whatever your material, you will need a 30 inches (76 cm) by 30 inches (76 cm) square of it.;
, Choose one side of the square and mark the center of it. This will allow you to measure your megaphone proportionally. You can mark the spot with a marker, or push a pin in the center point.Use a ruler along one edge to measure 15 inches (38 cm) This is the center point for that edge. Since all of the edges are the same, it doesn’t matter which one you use.

, Make an arc with a 5 inches (13 cm) radius from the center point. This arc will form the narrow end of your megaphone. If done correctly, your arc will start on one side of the center point and end on the other side.You can use a 5 inches (13 cm) string stuck to the center point to make your arc. Put a pencil on the far end of the string and swoop it around the surface of your material.

, Your second arc should have a radius of 29 inches (74 cm). You can use a piece of string that is 29 inches (74 cm) long to make the arc. Tape or pin one end of the string to the center point, and attach the other end to a pencil. Swoop the string along the surface of your material to make your long arc.The long arc will make the wide end of your megaphone.

, Draw a line from both ends of the long arc back the the center point. The lines should meet at the center point and make a cone shape. Cut along these lines with scissors. Next, cut along the both arcs., Once the megaphone template has been cut, it is time to shape the template. Start by taking one end of the template and rolling it over the other end. Do not fold or crease the template., One side of the megaphone should overlap the other side. Create a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overlap to ensure that the megaphone stays together. Without the overlap, the megaphone could easily pull apart.The narrow end of the megaphone will be between 1 inch (2.5 cm) and 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter.

, Use super glue or hot glue to glue down the overlapping side. If you are using a sturdy material, like cardboard, you can use metal fasteners in place of glue. Either way, make sure that the megaphone cannot unravel., Once your megaphone has been cut and shaped, you can make it look good. Use markers or paint to color the megaphone. You can also cut out or draw designs to put on your megaphone.Do not cut the megaphone to make designs.

, A megaphone handle will help you hold the megaphone, making it more effective. Cut a cardboard roll to roughly 6 inches (15 cm). Tape the role to the bottom of your megaphone. If you have decorated your megaphone, you can decorate the roll to match., You can cut a tapered mouthpiece from wood or cardboard. Cut or sand the material into the shape and size that you want. The mouthpiece is not necessary, but it can make speaking into the megaphone easier. Once you have finished your megaphone, try it out by speaking into the mouthpiece and hearing your voice amplified.Measure the circumference of the narrow end of your megaphone. You want the mouthpiece to fit inside that circle. For example, if the circumference is 4 inches (10 cm), then you want to make a mouthpiece with a circumference slightly less than 4 inches (10 cm).

Organize your speech into bullet points.,
Pinpoint locations in your home for each bullet point.,
Visualize an object for each bullet point.,
Match the bullet point with an object and piece of furniture.",How to Memorize a Speech in One Night2," Divide the speech into several bullet points. Each bullet point should be about a different topic. Write these bullet points down on a piece of paper or note cards., Count the bullet points and locate the same amount of pieces of furniture in your home, office, or wherever you are memorizing your speech. For example, if you have ten bullet points you will need to pinpoint ten separate pieces of furniture., Once you have determined the furniture that you will use for the memory palace, visualize an object that relates to each bullet point.For example, if the bullet refers to finances you may visualize dollar bills.
If the bullet is discussing fashion you may visualize a shirt.

, Assign a piece of furniture with each bullet point and object. Then visualize the object with the piece of furniture.For example, you may discuss fashion by visualizing a row of shirts in the wardrobe.
When talking about finances you may visualize dollar bills coming out of the oven.

Get enough sleep.,
Take a break.,
Learn how to keep calm.",How to Memorize a Speech in One Night3," Although it might seem tempting to stay up all night to prepare for your speech, it probably won’t help you. A lack of sleep increases your stress levels and decreases your ability to focus. Be sure that you get at least eight hours of sleep the night before your speech., It is important to remember to take care of your body even when you are cramming for a presentation. Take some time to take a quick walk. Don’t forget to eat meals and keep yourself hydrated. These steps are equally important in memorizing your speech., Make a list of things that scare you about the speech. Then, try to tackle those fears. If eye contact makes you lose focus, try looking just above your audience’s head. Try giving your speech behind a podium or while holding a microphone to keep your hands busy. Use deep breathing exercises to keep yourself calm before your speech."

Decipher the number yourself.,
Look for a ""Phone Number Location Lookup"" site.,
Google the number.,
Call the number back.",How to Trace the Location of a Phone Number," The digits in a phone number correspond to a certain location that the cellphone is registered in. By breaking down the phone number into four parts, you can narrow down the general location of the caller, such as their city or the part of a county they registered their phone in.



Decipher the ""Country Code."" This is the first series of numbers before the three-digit area code — for example, 1 (555) 444-3333. This number lets you know what country the person is calling from. If this part of the phone number doesn't show, then the call is coming from the same country that your phone number is from. A comprehensive list of country codes is available online.Decipher the ""Area Code."" This a three-digit series of numbers––for example, 1 (555) 444-3333). This will give you the most specific information on the location of a phone number. This will let you know the general location (county, city or part of a city) the phone number is registered in. A comprehensive list of area codes is available online.Decipher the ""Prefix."" This is the series of three-digits after the area code — for example, 1 (555) 444-3333. This number used to tell you what ""switchboard"" the phone number is sent to. This often will lead you to a specific company switchboard, cellphone provider switchboard or a ""land line's"" local switchboard. A comprehensive list of these numbers is not available online because the ""switchboard"" method is now outdated, and phone numbers can be carried over when you change providers.

Decipher the ""Line Number."" This is the last four digits in a phone number––for example, 1 (555) 444-3333. This lets you know what level on the switchboard you are calling. Again, this is outdated and a comprehensive list of these line numbers does not exist because it relies both on the area code and the prefix.;
, This method will usually yield the city, the provider, and whether the phone number is a land line or cellular line. Many phone number look up sites claim to be able to locate the address of the caller. Be aware that they will require you to join or pay for the information, and there is no guarantee that you will have access to that information once you do.



Find a ""Phone Number Location Lookup"" site. You can find dozens of these through Google that provide basic information without joining.

Type in the full 10 digit, or 9 digit phone number. You will need to include the area code to find out the city of the caller.

, This method is usually a hit or miss, but it can't hurt to try. This method relies on the idea that the phone number was put online by a company or person.



Google using the right format. Type in the phone number in this ten digit format: ""X(XXX)XXX-XXXX"".

Results will return. These results will often return in one of two ways:

If the number is an exact match to a number listed online, then it will pop up with the business or person's name on a website where they list their information.
If the number is not an exact match to a number listed online, then it will pop up with ""Phone Number Results"" where it will give you the general location you found in the earlier steps.



, If all else fails, you can call the number back for more information. Pay attention to the voice mail for a company or person's name. You can then, use that information to search online for more information on their location."

Keep a pen and paper next to you.,
Answer the phone in as few rings as possible.,
Identify yourself and the company.,
Ask the right questions.,
Assume that someone from your organization is listening in on the conversation.,
Ask before putting someone on hold and wait for his or her response.,
Make sure the intended recipient wants to take the call.,
Use correct grammar.,
Pay attention to your voice.,
Use the caller's name, whenever possible.,
Identify yourself first when calling another person.,
End the conversation in a professional manner.,
Practice active listening skills.,
Lower your voice and speak in an even tone.,
Establish rapport through empathy.,
Avoid getting upset or angry.,
Avoid taking it personally.,
Remember you're interacting with a human.",How to Speak Professionally on the Phone," Keep track of calls by writing down the person’s name, the time he or she called, and the reason. It’s best to write the information on a phone memo pad with a carbon. This keeps the calls organized in one place and when it isn’t for you, you can give a copy to the intended recipient.;
, No one likes to be forced to wait. Answering quickly shows the caller, who is more than likely to be a customer, that your company is efficient. It also lets the caller know that his or her call is important.

, For example, say, ""Thank you for calling West Coast Drywall and Paint. This is Brooke speaking."" Likewise, ask the caller who they are and where they are calling from if they don’t offer those details to you, especially if your company has a strict policy against unsolicited calls.

, Gather as much information as possible. This helps identify unsolicited calls. Though when questioning others, it could come across as accusatory, especially if you have to ask a number of questions. You don’t want to be like a jackhammer, so pace yourself using a calm and moderate tone.


Caller: ""Can I speak to Bill?""
Respondent: “Can I ask who is speaking?""
Caller: ""Tom.”
Respondent: ""Where are you calling from?""
Caller: ""England.”
Respondent: ""The company name, please?""
Caller: ""It’s a personal call.”
Respondent: ""Is Bill expecting your call?”
Caller: ""No.”
Respondent: ""OK let me try his line for you.""

, Companies that monitor incoming calls usually say so in an initial voice recording. Even if they’re not, thinking that they are can help you use your most professional voice. If they are, you may have the opportunity to hear what you sound like on the phone and make improvements, if necessary.

, A big problem with many companies is that they leave callers on hold for too long. Except for Zen masters, most people do not like to be on hold. There is also the tendency to think they’ve been on hold twice as long as they really have. Taking them off as soon as possible can greatly minimize having an irate caller on the other end when you do come back!

, When the caller asks for a particular person, tell him or her you will ""try the person’s line"" before putting them on hold. Then check that the recipient is a) available and b) ready to speak to them. If not, then be sure to take a detailed message.

, Always use ""Jane and I"" for your subject and ""Jane and me"" when it’s a direct object (i.e. ""Jane and I went to the store"" not ""He talked to Jane and me""). Don’t leave the word ""at"" dangling at the end of a sentence. For example, ""I do not know where it is at” is incorrect. Usually, you can just remove “at” from the sentence entirely. “I don’t know where it is” is the correct way.

, It’s through your tone that the caller hears your true intentions. Whether in phone or in person, this conveys more than the words that come out of your mouth. The key to talking on the phone in a professional manner is to smile inwardly!


This point of smiling hit home with the senior management of a call center, and he placed little mirrors at each of the agents’ stations that said: ""What you see is what they hear!""

, It adds a personal touch and shows that you’re listening. ""I'm sorry John, but Mark isn't available at the moment. Can I help you with anything or take a message?""

, For example, say, ""This is Mary Hunter calling for Louis Meyer."" However, don’t be long-winded. In other words, get right to the point without going into unnecessary details.

, With sincerity in your voice say, “Thanks for calling. Have a great day!”

, Don’t argue or interrupt the customer. Even if the person is mistaken or you know what he or she is going to say next. Allow the person to get what’s off his or her chest. Listening well builds rapport and can help greatly in diffusing a heated caller., If the client gets louder, begin speaking more slowly with a steady voice. A calm demeanor (versus agitated or excited) can go far in settling a person down. Remaining unaffected by the client’s volume or tone can help an angry or upset person to get a hold of him or herself.

, Place yourself in the client’s shoes. Let the caller know that you hear his or her frustration and grievance. Doing this alone can help greatly in calming a person down. It’s called “verbal nodding” and it helps the caller feel understood.

, If the client is verbally abusive or swearing, breathe deeply and continue as if you didn't hear it. Responding in the same manner will not solve anything, and it could escalate the situation. Instead, remind the client that you want to help and that you are his or her best chance in resolving the matter – oftentimes, this statement will defuse the situation., Stick with the issue at hand and do not get personal, even if the customer does. Remember that the customer doesn't know you, and he or she is just venting frustration at you as a representative. Gently guide the conversation back to the issue and how you intend to resolve it, and try to ignore personal comments.

, All of us have bad days. Maybe the person had a fight with his or her spouse, just got a traffic ticket or has had a run of bad luck. To one degree or another, we’ve all been there. Try to make their day better by staying calm and unruffled -- it'll make you feel good, too!

Pick a good time to do it.,
Lay down some groundwork.,
Know your illness inside and out.,
Prepare to take it easy at home.,
Call your boss or supervisor early the next morning.,
Make sure you sound sick.,
Be prepared for questions.,
End the conversation on a good note.,
Follow up on your sickness when you return to work.,
Don’t tell your coworkers that you faked being sick.,
Be friendly to your boss.,
Put in a good day’s work.",How to Call in Sick when You Just Need a Day Off," You may think that every day is a good day to fake sick, but if you’re really determined to fake your illness, then you should put a bit more thought into it. If you pick the wrong day to fake sick, then it’ll be a lot harder to make a convincing case for yourself. Instead, make sure that the odds are in your favor before you execute your master plan. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Be prepared to be extra convincing if you call in on a Monday or Friday. It’ll be harder for your boss to believe you’re really feeling sick during a long weekend.
Make sure you haven’t recently been sick or taken a lot of time off.
Don’t fake sick right after you’ve had an altercation at work, or after you’ve done a lot of grumbling. You don’t want your boss to see your fake illness as an affront. Your illness will be much more convincing if all was fine and dandy the last time you went to work.
Try not to conveniently miss a particularly unpleasant day at work. If your boss knows you hate the dreaded monthly meetings, then you shouldn’t fake sick on this particular day — no matter how good it will feel.
Try to fake sick when someone else at work was sick, or if it's flu season. That way your boss won't be too suspicious, since everyone is getting sick.;
, If you plan to call in sick, then you should make an effort to seem sick the day before without being too obvious about it. Don’t fake a cough throughout the day, but act a little bit under the weather and even sniffle a little, leading your coworkers to ask if you’re feeling sick while brushing them off. Act like you’re sick, but in denial about it, so that your coworkers don’t suspect that you’re faking it. Setting up this foundation the day before will make it more convincing when you take the next day off.


Act more reserved that day, too. If you’re extra energetic one day and then call in sick the next day, people will be surprised. Turn down invitations to lunch or happy hours the day before you call in sick.
Try to “subtly” take an Advil around your coworkers.
Blow your nose a little more often than usual.
If you do have lunch with your coworkers, don’t eat all of your food so it looks like you don’t have much of an appetite.
Look slightly unkempt that day. Tussle your hair a bit, don’t wear your best outfit, and be okay with looking a little tired around the eyes.

, Though your boss may not ask too many questions, it’s important to know what you’re sick with before you call. Instead of just saying you don’t feel well, saying you have a migraine, stomach flu, or just a regular cold can help make your argument more convincing. You should prepare to answer any questions your boss may ask you, like when you started feeling sick, when you’ll be back, and whether you’ll see a doctor. You don’t want to sound uncertain, or your boss will suspect that you’re faking it.


If you want to take off multiple days, pick a good illness. A migraine or a bad case of gastroenteritis can get you off for two or more days, as they can carry on for a long time and pop up at any time. Pink eye and strep throat can drag on longer. Whatever you choose, do your research thoroughly so that you can discuss the symptoms with clarity.
You can even rehearse the conversation with a close friend to make sure you can pull it off. Chances are, your boss won’t want to get into the details of what’s going on with your stomach or throat, but it’s best to be prepared.

, Don’t fake sick and then go hiking with your wife or throw a wild party for your friends. If you fake sick and then act super social, it’ll get back to your boss. Instead, you should call in sick when you really feel like just being in bed, hanging out around the house, and taking it easy — doing pretty much what you would do if you were actually sick, minus the feeling ill part.


Besides, if you spend your sick day outdoors and show up to work with a tan, that will look pretty suspicious.
While you're at it, it's a good idea to log off any social media sites that you might be tempted to visit on your ""sick day."" That way, your boss won't stumble over photos of you hiking in the middle of your supposedly debilitating illness or leaving comments that raise suspicions of good health.

, Don't delay––the sooner you tell your boss, the better. Additionally, you'll have a rather rough voice after waking up, giving you that added credibility. Plus, if you call early, you may be more likely to get your boss’s voicemail or to catch your boss when he’s off guard. If you call too late, then it’ll look like you didn’t really consider your boss’s feelings.


Keep the conversation short. Though knowing your “illness” well can help you feel prepared, you should remember that stories are typically the embellishment told by liars. Don't get too detailed––just say that you're not feeling well and won't be coming in. Give just enough information for your boss to believe you, such as saying ""I was up all night"" or ""I'm having awful stomach problems.""
You can also say something like, “I knew I should have said something at the end of the day yesterday, but I was hoping I would sleep this thing off.” Without being too obvious about it, make a point of showing how much you really hoped you would come to work.

, While you shouldn’t overdo it when you call your boss, it won’t hurt you to actually sound a little sick. In addition to having a hoarse voice from calling early in the morning, you can sniffle or cough very occasionally so your boss thinks you’re sick without having to overdo it. You can also talk a little more slowly or softly to show that you don’t have your full strength. Practice this act aloud so it sounds convincing.


If you want to make your voice sound extra hoarse, you can scream into a pillow for ten seconds or so before you make the call. But this will hurt your throat, so make sure it’s worth it.
You can also just try to sound a little bit out of it and disoriented. If you sound extra sharp and are super snappy to answer any question your boss has, you may not be very convincing as a sick person.

, Is your boss the nosy type? Try to imagine what kinds of questions he or she might have. For instance, if you work in food service, your boss might wonder how contagious you are. He or she might also ask if you've tried everything possible to make yourself feel well enough to come in. The best policy is to say that you think you're contagious, and that you've tried every remedy you can muster (painkillers, antacids, more liquids, etc.) but all to no avail.


Casually mention you've called your doctor's office and are waiting to hear back on an appointment time as they're booked out. During peak cold and flu seasons, it may be several days before they could squeeze you in for an office visit. If your employer demands a note after you get back, you can always say your appointment isn't until later in the week. It gives you time to run to the doctor.

, When you get done talking to your boss, try to leave a positive impression as much as you can. Say that you’ll do your best to recover to come to work the next day and that you’re grateful that your boss can be so understanding. Show how committed you are to the job and how eager you are to return to your responsibilities without overdoing it. Make your boss feel like you’re truly sorry to take a day off instead of that you can’t wait to watch TV and ditch your job.


You can even tell your boss to reach out with any questions if you think he’d really need your help. If you’re willing to be disturbed during your fake sick day, you can say, “I’ll be in bed all day, so give me a call if you need me…” But do this only if you think your boss will really be at a loss without you.
End the conversation by thanking your boss for being so considerate.

, Don't walk into work after your sick day looking perfectly healthy. Play it up like you're still getting over your illness. Blow your nose a few times or cough softly. You don’t have to play it up too much or act a little too much like a martyr for returning to work. Don’t mention your illness and let other people ask how you’re feeling. You should play it down to be even more authentic, saying something like, “I’m not feeling so bad anymore, really,” or, “I just need one more good night’s sleep and I’ll be just fine.”


If you want to look extra authentic, don't get a lot of sleep the night before so that you show up to work looking haggard and exhausted. This bolsters your credibility for the next time you call in sick (and gives you an excuse to stay up late).
Act a little more reserved that day. Don’t be extra friendly or chatty with your coworkers, and turn down invitations. Remember that you still need to save your strength.

, You may think that you’re close with your coworkers and that they would never rat you out, but you should still be careful about announcing that you were pretending to be sick. Your coworkers won’t want to high-five you, and will think you were being irresponsible or just plain annoying. Plus, if just one coworker repeats what you’ve said and it gets back to your boss, then you will not only get in trouble, but you’ll never be able to fake sick again.


Furthermore, getting called out for faking sick will also make your boss more suspicious the next time you’re actually sick. You don’t want to have to defend yourself for the rest of your time at work.
Hey, we all need a day off from work once in a while and there’s no judgment. Still, this doesn’t mean you should go bragging about it, or it’ll show that you really don’t take your work seriously.

, After calling in sick, you should be nice to your boss when you return to work. You don’t have to mention the illness or thank your boss for being so understanding, but you should work on having a good attitude and sending positive vibes your boss’s way. Make him or her remember what an awesome employee you are and don’t leave a shadow of a doubt in your boss’s mind that you might have been playing hookie.


You don’t have to exaggerate your friendliness or go on and on about how much you love your job and how much meaning it brings to your life.

, When you return to work from faking sick, you should try to put your best foot forward. This is not the day to roll in an hour late or to spend two hours on the phone making personal phone calls or booking your next vacation. Instead, you should stay at work the full time you need to be there, contribute to meetings, respond to emails promptly, and do anything else you can to ensure that you’re making a good impression.


You may love to complain to your coworkers when you come to work, but you should ease up and be a bit more positive after you return. You don’t want your boss to hear you complaining after you’ve taken a day off.
It’s okay to fake sick every once in a while, but if you get into the habit of slacking off in general, then your job may be in jeopardy. Make an effort to whistle while you work as much as you can when you return.

If you've been answering the phone in a slapdash manner, think about how you impact others hearing you.,
Be aware of the tone of your voice.,
Stop drinking or chewing food or gum before taking a call.,
Answer promptly.,
Greet the caller with a ""Hello"".,
Listen politely and carefully to the caller's request.,
If you need to put the caller on hold, then tell them so politely.,
Leave a comprehensible and clear answering machine or voicemail message.,
After the caller has established what they want, use their name to show that you've listened and to establish rapport and repeat back anything that you think needs clarification.,
Finish your call on a pleasant note, even if the conversation wasn't pleasant for any reason.",How to Greet People on the Phone," For starters, you don't know who might be on the other end of the phone––it could be a future boss or lover and your first impression has left the caller feeling less than enthused about your phone manner! Remember that a good beginning ensures a good ending. If you find the phone intimidating at the best of times, improving your answering technique will help to boost your confidence because you only have to switch into a polite mode and follow the routine to overcome those initial nerves. Once you've practiced this enough times, it'll feel like second nature and you'll perform it flawlessly.

, Without being able to see you, people will draw conclusions about your trustworthiness, reliability and confidence from how you sound. If you're answering the phone for the sake of making business deals, this may be the only chance you get to impress a potential client or business partner. The tone of your voice is impacted by such things as clear or muffled speaking, the mood you're in and the enthusiasm you have for taking the call. You might think that your voice is loud or clear enough to be heard by others, but this is not necessarily so. On the other hand, shouting is just as bad as mumbling and will give the caller a shock. Try to practice your tone of voice with a friend who knows what you're trying to do. Let your friend provide constructive feedback on how you might improve your phone voice.

Aim for a clear voice that is loud enough to be heard but doesn't shout.






Lean back and arch your neck up. It is easier to exude enthusiasm in this position.






Keep your tone of voice pleasant and welcoming. Even if there are other things going on in the background of your life, be reluctant to infect your tone with this unless it's your mom or similar who will listen to your woes. Most other people will only be inclined to listen to a pleasant tone.






Try to stay standing up when answering the phone. This enables better breathing because your diaphragm is not squished by sitting. In standing up, you'll have more energy and this will come across to the caller in your voice.






Smile when you answer the phone. The smile will be heard in your voice and keeps a positive energy going.







, Each of these sounds comes through to the caller on the other end of the line and they sound terrible. Other bodily noises to avoid when answering or speaking on the phone include flatulence, burping, smacking your gums together, yawning, mumbling or making popping noises with your mouth. If you have no choice but to sneeze or cough, excuse yourself and quickly cover the phone's sound piece.

, A phone that continues ringing leaves time for people to wonder why you're so slow at answering it. When you eventually get around to picking it up, it's possible that they'll be unfavorably disposed to you because they've become a little impatient and they'll wonder if you take them seriously. This is especially important in a work or business context but it can also matter on the home front unless your only callers are family who are already used to slow response times (it won't make them any less frustrated though).

, If you need to be more professional, say something like ""Good morning"" or ""Good afternoon"". Avoid saying ""hi"" in anything but the most informal context, unless you're keen to sound like a kid. Give your name and if you're at work, give your work title and/or the department you're in.


A formal example, ""Hello, my name is Elizabeth Jones from the Legal Services Department. How may I help you?""
A less formal example, ""Hello, this is Jeremy speaking, from the Brown residence"". You don't have to state your family name if you don't wish to. However, if you're in a shared household, you might find this is helpful to a caller looking for one member among several unrelated household members.
You can simply say, ""This is XYZ. May I know who's there on line?"" Or, simply giving out your phone number if it's your residence is acceptable, provided you say it slowly and clearly, to allow the caller time to register what you're saying.
If you're taking calls professionally, always say ""Good morning/afternoon"", etc, first, before you go onto the company name. For example: ""Good morning, this is Mark. You have reached ""The Local Deli"", how can I help you?"" People invariably miss a small portion of what you say first, so if you say the business name as a greeting, such as ""local deli..hi!"", the caller may well be unsure they have the right number, and have to ask, which makes your business seem unprofessional and can irk the client.
If the caller is someone you haven't heard from for a while, feel free to express your joy at hearing from them after such a long time. However, don't make them feel as if they have somehow been remiss for not calling you!

, During this brief moment, you'll become aware of whether the caller wishes to speak with you, whether you can continue formally or informally or whether you need to take a message or pass the phone to someone else. During this fact-establishing moment, remain courteous and don't interrupt. If the other person hasn't given their name or it isn't clear to you, be sure to ask for clarification at this early point. Something along the lines of ""I'm sorry but I didn't catch your full name Madam"" should work.


If you're so busy that the phone call will be an interruption, then you really shouldn't answer the phone. By answering the phone, you are intimating availability to talk on it, even if only for a few minutes. Never tell someone that you're too busy to talk to them right now; let the answering machine or voicemail do the talking if this is really the case, especially if you're on the line to someone else. To juggle more than one call at once is distracting and potentially confusing for the caller. And to let the annoyance of the interruption come through in your voice is impolite and makes the caller feel awkward.
Never answer a phone as a means for imprinting your self-importance on the caller. Answering with a brutal ""I'm in a very important meeting, I can't take your call right now"" is plain rude and is a call that you should not have responded to.

, Indeed, only put someone on hold if you really have no choice. Some people will launch into telling you their problem before you have a chance to intervene, in which case stay polite and let them know that you've heard their request but that you'll need to put them through to the person whose role it is to deal with their matter. If you have to ask them to wait, say something like: ""May I put you on hold for a moment, or should I call you back?"" rather than asking them in slang to ""hang on two ticks and I'll get back to ya"".

, Your answering machine or voicemail is a form of greeting as much as is picking up the phone and answering it directly. Be very careful as to the message that is left on the answering machine. Avoid leaving anything garbled, mumbled or disorienting, such as a silly joke that only your best friends get. Leave a message that is succinct, clear, friendly and makes an invitation for the caller to leave you a message, with a promise that you'll get back to them as soon as possible.


Cute, funny, noisy messages on voicemail or the answering machine can fall really flat because only you or your nearest and dearest think they're cute and funny. For the potential client, employer, character referee, etc., such messages suggest immaturity and a lack of seriousness.

, Proceed with your discussion, and continue to insert their name frequently as a way of keeping the human connection in place. Continue to listen carefully and make notes if needed. Ask questions about anything that's not clear to you.;
, Say something along the lines of ""It has been a pleasure talking to you Jane"". Listen for a response and don't be too quick to hang up on them.

Mark your book.,
Make some notes.,
Write up a to-do list.,
Label your folders.",How to Use Sticky Notes1," Sticky notes are great for marking pages or passages in a book you are studying. Just stick the note on the relevant page and maybe write a brief note or a few key words that indicate why you have marked this section. As well as the traditional square sticky notes, you can purchase slim and tall ones which work particularly well to mark pages in a book.These slimmer notes will mark the page without covering over much of the actual text.
You can also tear the regular square notes into thinner strips and use these as markers.;
, Sticky notes are a great way for you to make some brief notes on a topic you are studying or working on. Whereas you would make longer more detailed notes in a workbook, sticky notes are great for writing down key words or phrases that you want to learn. You can then stick them up on the wall around where you are working.


You can organise the notes and move them around to help you visualise the information you are trying to learn.
If you are studying for a history exam and want to learn a chronology of events, you can stick the notes in order and separate them by year or month.
Writing up key vocabulary and sticking the notes up around your house, can be good way to practice a foreign language.

, If you have a long list of tasks to complete or things to study, sticky notes can be a useful way to organise your to-do list. You can write down a task on each sticky note, and then shift them up and down in the list according to your priorities and deadlines. Alternatively, you could group together similar or related tasks on one note, in order to better visualise what you have to do.If you have a to-do list of sticky notes on the wall, it will give you some satisfaction to pull down the note of a task when you have completed it.
If you are using the notes for study, sticking them up above your desk is probably the best place.
You could also stick them up somewhere prominent around your house, such as on your computer monitor, or on the fridge.

, Use sticky notes to label your different folders and collections of notes to make it easier to find what you need when you are studying. You can trim down the sticky note so you are just using the slim adhesive-backed section, and write a brief title for the contents of the folder.You could stick the label on the side or spine of the folder to make it easier to find what you are looking for.

Understand what a ruler is.,
Learn what a seamstress' tape is.,
Know what a carpenters ruler is.,
Find a tape measure and look at it.,
Know what an architect's scale is.",How to Use a Ruler1," A ruler is a measuring stick marked with units for measuring along its edge. These can be made of plastic, cardboard, metal, or fabric. marked units for measuring length along its edge.
These can be for either English (inches) or metric (centimeters) units of measurement.
In the U.S. and the UK, a student's rule is from 12 to 36 inches, or from one to three feet long. Different fractions of inches or centimeters are used to make measurements more accurate.;
, This is a soft fabric tape, also marked with numbers representing inches or centimeters. This can be wrapped around a person's torso, to measure chest, waist, neck, and other sizes for sewing clothing.
It may be used for measuring length, such as inseams and sleeves of garments.
Using these to measure 3-dimensional objects that are curved is best.

, These are about 6 feet long and can be folded to fit into a tool pouch or pocket. These are also called ""stick rules"".
Typically, these are made up of 8 inch segments.
They are scaled in metric units and foot and inch measures, and fractions are marked to 1/16 inch.

, Also called measuring tapes, these are flexible metal or fiberglass tapes. These have a spring to rewind them into a case.
They are also rolled on a spool in lengths of 100 meters (or 330 feet) and longer.
Most measuring tapes have one side for standard and metric units.

, These are not actual lengths of measurement but will give distances to scale from a size ratio. These are ""scale"" rulers, with special marks representing a size ratio.
For example ""1 inch equals 1 foot"".
These are used for drawing precisely scaled blueprints and building plans.

Purchase a correction fluid thinner.,
Prepare your workspace.,
Add thinner to the fluid.,
Use water to thin the fluid.,
Use non-acetone nail polish remover.Non-acetone nail polish is formulated with chemicals that are similar to correction fluid thinner.,
Keep the lid on.,
Maintain the fluid’s consistency.,
Store the correction fluid safely.,
Check the consistency of the fluid.,
Apply a thin coat of correction fluid.,
Clean your workspace.",How to Thin Out Correction Fluid That Has Thickened Up," These thinners can be found at most art stores and office supply centers. Most manufacturers of correction fluid sell matching thinners that you can use to thin out thick paint or even completely restore dry paint. Make sure you buy your fluid’s matching thinner as each brand has its own formulation.Correction fluid is made with chemical solvents because these solvents evaporate into the air more quickly than water. This means that you don’t have to wait very long for correction fluid to dry.
If you can’t find the right thinner for your correction fluid, buy a generic brand instead. It won’t work as well as the correct fluid might but it will be much better than nothing.;
, Lay out newspaper or use paper plates to protect the surface you’re working on. Work in a well ventilated space so that you don’t inhale harmful fumes. Have a sheet of scrap paper ready so that you can test the thickness of the correction fluid. If you have sensitive skin, consider wearing gloves while you work.


Avoid inhaling the solvent fumes. Solvent fumes are hazardous to your health and can cause damage to your nervous system, liver and many other organs.If possible, work outside. This provides the maximum amount of ventilation of hazardous fumes.

, Most commercial thinners come with a dropper attached to the lid. This allows you to add tiny drops of solvent to the correction fluid at a time. First, add three or four drops to the correction fluid. Close the lid tightly and shake the bottle for one minute. Next, unscrew the cap and paint a line of correction fluid onto the scrap paper. If it’s thin enough, you can use it immediately. If not, add a few more drops of thinner and repeat the process.


Don’t stir the correction fluid to mix in the thinner. This will cause the solvent to evaporate more quickly and expose you to more hazardous fumes.

, If you don’t have time to find the proper correction fluid thinner for your product, you can use water as a thinner. However, the correction fluid won’t dry as quickly and it may develop other issues as well. Add a few drops of water to the correction fluid. Screw on the cap and shake the fluid for one minute. Then, test the thickness of the fluid by painting a line on a scrap piece of paper. If it’s not thin enough, add a few more drops of water and repeat the process.
Some correction fluids react badly to added water. Always check the manufacturer recommendations before putting water in a correction fluid.

, This method won’t work as well as using the manufacturer thinner but it will work in a pinch. Add one or two drops of the nail polish remover and screw the lid onto the correction fluid. Shake the bottle for one minute. Next, test the thickness of the fluid by painting a line onto a scrap sheet of paper.


If it’s not thin enough, add another drop of nail polish remover and repeat the process.
It’s easy to add too much nail polish remover. Therefore, you should only add one to two drops at a time. Otherwise, your correction fluid will be too thin.

, Correction fluid can dry very quickly. It’s not impossible to restore dried fluid but it’s very time consuming and annoying. To avoid this problem, keep the lid on the correction fluid whenever you’re not using it. If you lose the lid, cover the correction fluid with plastic wrap and secure it with a rubber band.


Keep the Styrofoam insert. Some brands of correction fluid come with a Styrofoam insert that lines the top of the lid. Try to keep this insert in the package as it helps keep moisture in the container., Once your correction fluid dries completely, it’s very difficult to soften again. Prevent this problem by monitoring the thickness of your correction fluid. Occasionally check your correction fluid to make sure it’s not drying out by painting a line onto a piece of scrap paper. If the solution is becoming too thick, add a few drops of thinner and shake it up.

, Keep it in a cool, dry place that’s out of the reach of children. Correction fluid contains many potentially hazardous chemicals that can be harmful when ingested. Similarly, be aware of who has access to your correction fluid. Some people abuse substances such as correction fluid by inhaling the fumes to get high. This is incredibly dangerous and can lead to brain damage and heart failure.If you or someone you know is addicted to using inhalants, contact an inhalant addiction treatment centeror call a toll-free addiction recovery hotline at 1-888-319-2606.

, Your correction fluid should be slightly thinner than acrylic paint. It should be easy to paint onto surfaces but it should also be thin enough that the application is smooth. If your correction fluid is too thick your paper will have a textured area where the fluid dries. If it’s too thin, it won’t cover your mistakes properly. The thinner the fluid, the less opaque it is.


If the fluid is too thick, thin it out with the correction fluid thinner, water, or non-acetone nail polish remover described in the previous method.
If the fluid is too thin, remove the cap and let the fluid sit in a well-ventilated place. Every ten minutes give the fluid a stir and test the thickness.

, You can use the attached brush or a clean brush of your choice. Carefully paint a thin layer of correction fluid over your mistake. Don’t worry if you can still see a faint outline of the error; you can apply another thin coat to make the area more opaque. Allow the first coat to completely dry before applying a second coat.


Each layer needs to dry for at least two minutes. If you try to paint on a new layer while the old one is still wet, the correction fluid will become clumpy and uneven.
Once all of the layers are dry, you can draw or write over the surface.

, If you have any correction fluid on your hands it may not come off with soap and water. If this is the case, rub baby oil over the correction fluid to remove it from your skin.If you get any correction fluid on your work surface simply wait for it to dry before gently rubbing it off. If there’s leftover residue use a wet sponge to wipe it away. Lastly, remove correction fluid from your clothing by letting it dry, scraping it off, and then gently washing the affected area.


If washing the clothing doesn’t help remove the correction fluid, try spraying WD-40 or Windex onto the affected area and letting it soak in. After a few minutes, gently wash the area again."

Label your cables.,
Mark your food.,
Leave messages and reminders.,
Make a colourful schedule or plan.",How to Use Sticky Notes2," Sticky notes can be very helpful for organizing yourself and your house in a number of ways. If you find that you have developed a confusing tangle of cables behind your TV or computer, and it always takes some painstaking work to discover what cables is for what, sticky notes can help.


Tear or cut the note down so you just have the adhesive strip left, and then write down the name of the appliance of each cable, “TV,” “DVD,” “Stereo,” etc.
Then wrap the label around the appropriate cable, taking care to fasten it tightly in a ring around the wire., If you live in a shared house, you may want to label your food to make sure that none of your housemates eat it. Sticky notes are ideal for this as you can quickly and easily label your supplies just by writing your name on a note and attaching it to your eggs, milk, or anything else.


Try to have some restraint when it comes to labelling food. Labelling absolutely everything can seem somewhat over the top.
Consider just labelling a few key things that could easily be mistaken for somebody else’s.

, Sticky notes are a convenient and easy way to leave notes and reminders for people you live or work with. Write down a reminder to pick some milk on the way home from work, or that the electricity bill is overdue, and stick it somewhere prominent.


Research has shown that people are actually more likely to respond to, and act on, a message or request made on a sticky note than communicated in some other ways.It is thought that sticky notes work so well because it is more personalised. It is also harder to ignore as it sticks out from its environment.
Seeing a note stuck on the fridge may make you want to deal with it so you can take it down, and free the fridge door of mess and clutter., You can use sticky notes to make a colourful, visually engaging, and flexible plan or schedule for everything from work, to study, to household chores. If you are making a schedule for everybody’s weekly chores, you can write up each chore on a note and arrange them in groups. Once a task has been completed, the person responsible can tear down the note.


You can use notes to make meal plan so you know what you will be eating through the week. This could also help you to realise if you need to buy any ingredients.
Using sticky notes to make schedules and plans allows you to move around the meals or tasks. You can easily reassign a task to somebody else, or change the meal plan."

Make a mosaic.,
Try some origami.,
Clean your keyboard.,
Use a note as a coaster.",How to Use Sticky Notes3," If you are feeling a bit more creative, you can use the brightly coloured sticky notes to make a mosaic on your wall. Think of each note as a tile, and experiment with different arrangements to create a striking mosaic. Sticky note mosaics are increasingly popular and there are examples of people spending months and using thousands of sticky notes to realise their vision.Try to plan out the mosaic you are going to make before you get started sticking things to the wall.
Using squared paper and colouring in the squares could be a good way to try out some different designs on paper, before using actual sticky notes.

, You can use your sticky notes as the raw materials for all kinds of 3D models and origami creations. Making models of your old notes can be fun way to re-use the notes and celebrate tasks you have completed. You could start off by making a simple hat, a pelican, a jumping frog, or a star.Look online for easy to follow folding instructions for all sorts of origami and 3D models.
Remember that if you are just using one small sticky note, your options will be somewhat limited.

, An often overlooked use for sticky notes is as a handy cleaning device for your keyboard. Keyboards will often get little pieces of fluff and detritus stuck down in the spaces around the keys, and these can be hard to clean out easily and effectively. You can use the adhesive strip of a sticky note to clean these narrow spaces.


Fold or tear the note so that the adhesive strip is on both sides, and then slide it into the space around the keys on your keyboard.This is painstaking but satisfying work, and you’ll be amazed how much dirt gets into your keyboard.

, You can use a small stack of sticky notes as a makeshift coaster for a hot or cold drink, to help protect your furniture from any marks or stains. You will to get a few sticky notes, rather than just one, to help ensure that the liquid from your drink doesn’t get through the coaster and onto your table.


If you have sticky notes in a variety of colours available, favour those are not so brightly coloured.
Avoiding neon or highly saturated colours reduced the chance of the colours running and staining your furniture."

Learn how standard units work.,
Find the inches unit on your ruler.,
Find the fraction of an inch markers.",How to Use a Ruler2," Standard units are based on feet and inches. The inch is the basic unit in standard measurement.
There are 12 inches in a foot.
Most rulers are 12 inches long.
Longer rulers, which are 3 feet long (or 36 inches long) are called yardsticks.
Most countries don't use this unit of measurement any longer, preferring the metric system.

, These are larger lines next to large numbers on your ruler. The distance between one of these larger lines and the next is one inch.
Most student rulers can measure up to 12 inches at a time.
You will want to measure accurately, so you will have to know more than just where the inch markers are.

, These delineate different fractions of an inch to help you measure as accurately as possible. The smallest lines in between inch markers on a ruler represent 1/16 of an inch.
The next largest lines represent 1/8 of an inch.
The next largest lines show 1/4 inches.
The longest line between inch markers shows 1/2 an inch.
You will want to measure as closely an accurately to a fraction of an inch to get a true measurement of an object.

Understand what metric units are.,
Find the centimeter lines on a ruler.,
Learn to read the smaller units.,
Remember that all measurements in metric are in units of 10.",How to Use a Ruler3," These are the units of measurement used in the metric system. The larger unit of measurement in the metric system is the meter. This is close in size, but not exactly, a yard.
The main units of measurement in the metric system are centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in a meter.

, These are the lines that have a long line with a number beside it.


Centimeters are smaller than inches. There are 2.54 centimeters per inch.
The distance between two centimeter lines is one centimeter.
Most standard rulers have 30 centimeters on them.
Meter sticks have 100 centimeters.
The abbreviation for centimeters is cm.

, The smaller units on a metric ruler are called millimeters. The abbreviation for millimeters is mm.
There are 10 mm in a centimeter.
Therefore, 5 mm is half of a centimeter.

, This is an easy trick to remember for measuring in metric. There are 100cm in a meter.
There are 10 mm in a cm.
The millimeter is the smallest unit of measurement on most metric rulers.

Measure with a ruler or tape measure.,
Place the zero end of your rule at the end of your object.,
Move to the opposite side of the object you are measuring.,
Use a metric or decimal rule with a metric ruler.,
Use a tape measure to measure between objects, for instance, walls.,
Use your 12 inch rule (or similar instrument, like a yardstick) to draw a straight line.",How to Use a Ruler4," Find an object or distance between two points you want to measure.


This can be a length of wood, string, or cloth, or a line on a sheet of paper.
Rulers and yardsticks are better to use on hard flat surfaces.
If you are measuring a person for clothing it is best to use a flexible tool like a seamstress' tape.
Long distances can be measured using a measuring tape.

, This will usually be on the left side. Make sure the end of the ruler is flush with your object.
Use your left hand to hold it in place.
Use your right hand to adjust the other end of the ruler.

, You will now read the ruler to see how long the object is. Read the last number on your ruler that is alongside the object. This will indicate the ""whole unit"" length of the object, example: 8 inches.
Count the number of fraction marks (dashes) the object you are measuring goes beyond the last whole number.
If your ruler is marked in 1/8 inch increments, and you are 5 marks past the last whole unit number, you will be 5/8 inches beyond the 8, and your length will be read ""8 and 5/8 inches'.
Simplify fractions if you are able. For example, 4/16 of an inch is the same as 1/4 inch.

, You will be reading measurements in units of 10, following the metric system. Read the larger hashmarks as centimeters. Go to the nearest centimeter line. That will indicate the ""whole unit"" length. For example, 10 centimeters.
In the case of a metric rule marked in centimeters (cm), read the intermediate marks as millimeters (mm).
Read how many intermediate marks go past your whole unit measurement to the edge of the object. For example, if you measured an object that was 10cm plus 8mm, your measurement would be 10.8cm.

, A retractable steel measuring tape would work best for this.


Slide the zero end of the tape against one wall, or have a helper hold it, then pull out enough tape to reach the opposite wall.
Here, you should have two sizes of numbers, the larger for feet (or meters), the smaller, for inches (or centimeters).
Read the feet (or meters) first, inches (or cm), then fractions thereof.
Example, a distance may read ""12 feet, 5 and 1/2 inches"".

, You can also use rulers as straight edges in art or geometry.


Lay it down on the surface you are drawing on, and lay your pencil point along the edge of the rule.
Use your ruler as a guide for a straight edge.
Keep holding the ruler steady to get the straightest line possible.

Find out what your elderly parents need done.",How to Communicate with an Elderly Parent," Life is busy and change is inevitable. However, despite all the things that you have going on in your life, remember to keep your parents a part of it. Set aside a time at least once a week to call up or drop by and see how your parents are doing.


If you live a long way away from your parents, set up a means for communicating with them regularly. Skype is great because you can see them as well as talk to them. If they feel uncomfortable with the technology, ask someone who can help to set it up for them. Once they know how, it's unlikely they'll ever go back to older, clunkier ways of communicating.;
, Keep up to date with their day-to-day happenings by asking them what they're doing. Also listen for the things they're not telling you, such as health problems or money worries.


Ask them if there is anything they need or that you can do for them. Sometimes you won't know unless you ask them, as many parents are very careful about not wanting to burden their children.

, Call them, visit them and spend time having a good laugh together. Sure, there will be tales of sadness when they lose friends and stories of their hardships but it is important to remind them of what it's like to feel happy, to laugh and to see the beauty of the world.


Share jokes and funny stories together.
Remember happy things from the past. Retelling fond family memories can let them know you treasure the memories too.

, Let your parents know that you are there for them and that you're happy to offer advice if wanted. However, don't foist advice onto them. They might be slower and less active than before but they're still capable of making their own decisions and it is important to respect this.

, For example, if they need good financial or legal advice, help them to find a good financial planner or a lawyer. This is better than trying to offer advice on things you don't know much about. Even if you do know, it can also provide appropriate distance so that nobody feels taken advantage of.

, Don't presume that your elderly parents are unable to take care of their needs unless there are clear signs that this is the case. Even then, respect that your elderly parents still care about their independence and being treated as someone who matters. Respect their dignity at all stages of the elderly years.

, For example, suggesting to your 76 year old dad who is relatively fit and still working hard that he needs a rail to help him get into the bath won't go down very well; on the other hand, if he's 86 and in poor health, this may be a good thing to suggest.

, There is no need to over-complicate your explanations; keep them simple and ask for confirmation regularly that your elderly parent has understood and is happy to proceed without further explanation from you. This is contextual, so judge your approach accordingly––some elderly people are sprightly and switched on right into their 100s, while others may be losing their sight, mental agility and hearing much earlier.


Speak calmly at all times. This becomes even more important if you're discussing something that is highly emotional, such as downsizing the family home, moving to a nursing home, or changing their routine, etc.

, If you realize that your parents need to make a major change, such as moving to a nursing home or not replacing a lost pet, approach such future issues early in small steps. Talk to them about their plans for the future and what they hope. Ask them what they feel about living in a smaller house or living in an environment where they have less to worry about. When you get a feel for what they prefer, you can slowly broach the topic of starting to make such changes. This is a much better way than avoiding such topics until you really have no alternative and then having to make massive decisions all at once.

, They have been doing things a certain way for a long time; for many people, making changes to their lifestyle, their opinions and their beliefs gets much harder as they age. Your views might differ a lot or you may even oppose their views but it's best to agree to disagree. Arguing vehemently won't change their mind and is likely to create a lot of tensions.

, They have made their choices based on the things that mattered to them in the past and that still matter to them now. There will always be generation gaps but there are also similarities amid the differences. Connect with your parents on the things that both of you care about and believe in, such as family, the well-being of your children and shared interests.


Consider learning more about an interest a parent has. Use the internet to find out more on any subject and ask questions based on your research. Your parent will be thrilled that you want to find out more!

, No doubt you will still have some differences of opinion but always look for the common ground. Allay their fears that you are going to argue by simply agreeing that they may have a point and then change the subject.


Stay calm. Although there are years of emotional experiences between both of you, it is important to respond to your parents in a calm and caring way.

, If you end up brushing off your parent's viewpoints and treat them like children, they will feel insulted. It is important to be kind in all your approaches to your parents and not come across as condescending towards them.

, Start by simply asking them and listening to their needs. If they're too proud to say they need help or they can't think of anything, take a look around and see what might need doing. You can help out in many ways, such as:


Running errands for your parents; doing shopping, collecting medication, etc.
Walking their dog. If they are finding it harder to take the dog for a walk every day, help out on a few days to give them a break.
Reading for them or fixing the settings on their computer so that they find it easier to see the text and use the computer.

Avoid starting discussions about heavy topics in the late evening. Few people will be thrilled to be faced with sorting major issues like finances or long range scheduling when they are the most tired. Instead, deliver messages and conduct discussions about heavy topics in the mornings or afternoons when people are alert, available, and more likely to be able to respond with clarity.;
, Choose the right place, one that provides freedom for the communication to open, flower, and come to maturity. If you need to tell someone something that isn't going to sit well (such as news of a death or a breakup), don't do it in public, around colleagues, or near other people. Be respectful and mindful of the person by communicating to them in a private place. This will also provide space to open the dialog into a wider and a more involved mutual understanding and ensure that the two-way process is functioning properly.


If you are presenting to a group of people, be sure to check the acoustics beforehand and practice projecting your voice clearly. Use a microphone if needed to ensure that your audience can hear you.

, Turn off all electronics that could interrupt the conversation. If the phone rings, laugh it off the first time, then turn it off immediately and continue talking. Do not allow external distractions to act as crutches that sidetrack your concentration. They will distract both you and your listener, and will effectively kill the communication.

, This should be done before you attempt to communicate any ideas. If you are feeling passionate about a topic, your ideas may become garbled if you haven't already targeted some key points to stick to when communicating. Key points will act as anchors, bringing focus and clarity to your communication.


A good rule of thumb is to choose three main points and keep your communication focused on those. That way, if the topic wanders off course, you will be able to return to one or more of these three key points without feeling flustered. Writing the points down, if appropriate, can also help.

, Make it clear what you're hoping to convey from the outset. For example, your purpose could be to inform others, obtain information, or initiate action. If people know in advance what you expect from the communication, things will go more smoothly.

, Once you start to convey your three main points, make sure everything you're saying adds to the message you intend to communicate and strengthens it. If you have already thought through the issues and distilled the them to the essentials, it is likely that helpful pertinent phrases will stick in your mind. Do not be afraid to use these to underline your points. Even confident, well-known speakers reuse their key lines again and again for emphasis and reinforcement. Remember to keep the overall message clear and direct.

, Thank the person or group for the time taken to listen and respond. No matter what the outcome of your communication, even if the response to your talk or discussion has been other than you had hoped, end it politely by properly respecting everyone's input and time.

, You want to do this before launching into your conversation or presentation. It can help sometimes to begin with a favorite anecdote. This helps the listener identify with you as someone who acts like them and has the same everyday concerns.

, It is important to deliver your message clearly and unambiguously so that the message comes across in a way that every listener can understand. Your words are remembered because people instantly understand what it is that you are saying. This requires delivering your words distinctly and using simpler words rather than more complex ones.

, Speak at a volume level that is guaranteed to be heard and that doesn't come across as too quiet or disengaged. Take special care to properly enunciate key points so that you avoid any kind of misunderstanding. If mumbling is a defensive habit that you have fallen into due to fear of communicating, practice your message at home in front of the mirror. It is sometimes best to discuss what you want to communicate with those you feel comfortable with. This helps solidify the message in your own mind. Be aware that any practice or refinement of your wording will help you to build confidence.

, Listen actively. Remember that communication is a two-way street and that while you are talking, you are not learning. By actively listening, you will be able to gauge how much of your message is getting through to your listener(s) and whether or not it is being received correctly or needs to be tweaked. If your audience appears to be confused, it is often helpful to ask the listener(s) to reflect back some of what you have said, but in their own words. This can help you to identify and correct mistaken views of what you have intended to communicate.



Validate people's feelings. This will encourage them to open up, and help them feel better if they're upset.

, A monotone is not pleasing to the ear, so good communicators use vocal color to enhance communication. Norma Michael recommendsthat you:


Raise the pitch and volume of your voice when you transition from one topic or point to another.
Increase your volume and slow the delivery whenever you raise a special point or are summing up.
Speak briskly, but pause to emphasize keywords when requesting action.

, Sure, you don't necessarily know the people in your audience or that new friend in your group, but they're nodding along with you and looking knowingly at you all the same. This means that they are connecting with you. So reward them with your acknowledgment!

, Use facial expressions consciously. Strive to reflect passion and generate listener empathy by using soft, gentle, aware facial expressions. Avoid negative facial expressions, such as frowns or raised eyebrows. What is or isn't negative depends on the context, particularly the cultural context, so be guided by your situation.


Be quick to identify unexpected behavior that suggests a cross-culture collision, such as a clenched fist, a slouched posture, or even silence.If you don't know the culture intimately, ask questions about the communication challenges you might face before you start to speak with (or to) people in an unfamiliar cultural context.

, Eye contact builds rapport, helps to convince people that you're trustworthy, and displays interest. During a conversation or presentation, it is important to look into the other person's eyes if possible and maintain contact for a reasonable amount of time. Take care not to overdo it.– Use just as much eye contact as feels natural, about 2-4 seconds at a time.Remember to take in all of your audience. If you're addressing a boardroom, look every member of the board in the eye. Neglecting any single person can easily be taken as a sign of offense and could lose you business, admission, success, or whatever it is you endeavor to achieve.
If you're addressing an audience, pause and make eye contact with a member of audience for up to two seconds before breaking away and resuming your talk. This helps individual members of the audience feel personally valued.
Be aware that eye contact is culturally ordained. In some cultures it is considered to be unsettling, or inappropriate. Ask about this in particular or do the research in advance.

, There is power in pausing. Simon Reynolds says that pausing causes an audience to lean in and listen. It helps you to emphasize your points and allow the listener time to digest what has been said. It also helps to make your communication come across as more compelling and it makes your speech easier to absorb and become comfortable with.Take a few deep breaths to steady yourself before you begin communicating.
Get into the habit of solid, regular breathing during a conversation, This will help you to keep a steady, calm voice and will also keep you more relaxed.
Use pauses to take a breather from what you are saying.

, Use hand gestures carefully. Be conscious of what your hands are saying as you speak. Some hand gestures can be very effective in highlighting your points (open gestures), while others can be distracting or even offensive to some listeners, and tend to shut down the conversation or listening (closed gestures). It also helps to watch other speaker's hand gestures with an eye for how they come across to you. Emulate those you see that are effective and engaging. Notice that the most effective gestures are natural, slow, and emphatic.

, Be alert to your wandering eyes, your hands picking at fluff, your constant sniffling, shuffling, rocking, and the like. These small gestures add up and are all guaranteed to dampen the effectiveness of your message.


Have someone record your talk, then take the time to view your speech delivery in fast forward. Any repetitive gesture or unconscious habit will stand out like a sore thumb and will be somewhat comical. Once you have targeted such a behavior, it will be easier to modify your unintended body language and monitor its reappearance.

, Do not stand or hover over the other person. This creates a power struggle and pushes the conflict to another level. If they are sitting, you should sit with them.

, Let them say how they feel. Wait until they are completely finished talking before beginning to speak yourself.

, Don't yell or make accusations about the other party or their actions.

, Take the time to make statements like, ""If I understand correctly, you are saying,...""

, If the person walks out of the room, don't follow them. Allow them to do so and let them return when they are calmer and ready to talk.

, Again, this could lead to a power struggle that escalates and never ends. Sometimes, you have to agree to disagree and move on.

, When you're phrasing your concerns, try to start your sentences with ""I..."" and state clearly how their actions make you feel. This will make the other person more receptive to your complaints and more empathetic. For instance, instead of saying ""You're sloppy and it drives me crazy,"" try ""I feel that different levels of messiness might be a problem for us. Clutter is something that seems to work its way into my mind and limit what I feel I can do. Frankly, messiness seems to unsettle me more than it probably should.""

Stand up straight, look people in the eye, smile, and keep your voice even and enthusiastic. Also dress nicely and not like a sweat pants and t-shirt.;
, Do research on the computer or in the library. Know everything that you can possibly know about what you're trying to talk them into. You're not going to be very convincing if you tell them something that they know isn't true.


Where you get your information will depend on what you're arguing for, but try to only get your information from reliable, legitimate sources. It's a good idea to research all sides of the issue as well. Play devil's advocate with yourself!







, They'll probably have some arguments against what you're trying to get them to do. Know some of the most common arguments and be ready with a good way to win them over.

, Keep calm and turn on the charm. Seriously though, if you start shouting or get all whiny, no one is going to listen to you anymore. It becomes like tuning out a small child. Keep calm and friendly in your demeanor and you'll be fine.

, If you can, it's best to get to know your audience before you try to persuade them of anything. Develop a bond with them, because if they trust you, they'll be much more likely to listen to you. Even if it's just a half hour of trust building, anything helps.


Depending on the situation, how you bond with them may change. A good basic place to start would be to say, ""Can I take you out for a cup of coffee?"" While you're having coffee, talk to them about what's been going on in their life and the exciting or challenging things they have coming up. Offer them some solid advice and help them if you see an opening. Try not to persuade them during this meeting unless your matter is urgent. Take them out another time at least a week later, catch up on what you talked about previously, then get to work persuading.







, Look at where your audience is coming from. Are they poor, rich, middle class? Do they live in the city, suburbs or the country? Do they come from this country or are they from somewhere else? Where do they work? Our background heavily influences how we perceive arguments and what arguments work best on us.


For example, if you're trying to persuade someone who's rich to buy something that looks low-class, sell it as ""kitsch"" or ""Americana"". To a lower class person, sell it realistically as a useful item.

, Do they think of themselves as educated, logical people? Do they view themselves in a more emotional manner, like the hero of their own life story? How they see themselves will heavily influence what type of evidence you show them when you try to persuade them.


Talk with them for awhile and do your best to get them to talk about themselves. Listen to how they describe themselves or what they do. Do they emphasize what degree they have? Do they mention their church involvement? Do they talk about their kids?
Another trick to seeing how they process information is to work them into a discussion of politics. See how they talk about the issues. This can reveal a lot about how they think.

, Try slipping your idea into a conversation with the other person, to find out what they think about it. This can help you figure out how you're going to approach the idea with them and how they might react. The more prepared you are, the better.


Try to keep this as subtle as possible. For example, if you're planning on persuading your wife to let you buy a new car, tell her you need advice on something. Your buddy Max wants to remodel his living room (mention the cost as being the same as a new car and detail his family expenses as being the same as yours), but he doesn't know how to bring it up with his wife or what she'll think. Max asked you for advice but you thought your wife would know better. How she thinks the other woman should react can help you understand how she might react and what some of her arguments may be against it.

, When you tell your audience anything, watch for their reactions. Watch their face, their body language, and even things as subtle as when they breathe. All of these things can tell you what someone is thinking.


Held breathes indicate anticipation, listening with bated breath, while a sharp exhale usually indicated surprise. Squinted eyes indicate doubt or displeasure, as do crossed arms. Relaxed body posture indicates mild interest or expected information, while upright posture with a forward lean indicates interest, sitting up up and taking notice. Fidgety movements indicate nervousness.







, If you really want to be persuasive, you have to be able to change your tactics at a moment's notice. This means practice and it means being flexible and it means thinking things through before you go into them. Being able to react the right way to your audience's feelings can make all the difference.

, Choose when to persuade them very carefully. Let's say you're a salesman: you want to sell someone a couch when they're looking at a couch, right? Not when they're looking at a fridge. And you want to pay attention to if they're spending a lot of time looking at different couches and not harass them as they're walking past trying to get to the exit. Timing is everything.

, A bored audience is not a swayed audience. Make sure that you're keeping them engaged in the conversation that you're having. Give them lots of opportunities to talk and look for signs of that they're not feeling it (checking their watch, shifting their weight, etc).


You can pull the old teacher trick of randomly engaging them in conversation. Ask them questions every now and again, even if it's just something like, ""What do you think of that?"" or ""What would you have done in this situation?""
You can also refocus their attention by making them move, physically. Ask them to get up, look around, or say something. Make sure this makes sense in context, though, and use this trick sparingly.

, Before really sinking into your argument, make them see the need for what you're arguing for. Even if there really isn't one, create the illusion of one. For example, if you're trying to persuade your wife to let you get a PS4, tell her about how you've been feeling really restless and bored lately and you're worried about the effect that that's having on your desire to be at home.

, Take the most common argument against what you're trying to argue for and make it seem terrible and stupid. Make it seem like the worst possible option, or something that needs to be actively avoided. For example, if you're trying to persuade your teacher to increase your in-class reading time, show her some statistics about how few kids actually have conducive reading environments at home.

, Make it seem like the decision they need to make about what you're persuading them to do can only be made for a short period of time. If they only have a few seconds or a few minutes to think about it, they'll have less time to realize they don't really like the idea.

, When you persuade them, use language very carefully. Use words like ""we"", ""together"", and ""us"" instead of words like ""you"" and ""I"" or ""me"". This forces your audience to view you as a single unit with similar interests, rather than two separate people.

, Use evidence when you're trying to persuade someone into doing something. If you have facts right in front of them that show how great your idea is, it becomes a lot harder to argue with you.

, If they're someone who values education, intelligence and facts, appeal to their logic when you try to persuade them. Argue things like, ""If you don't do (A) then (B) will happen because of (C) reasons.""

, If they're someone that is obviously emotionally prone or strongly values emotions, use arguments like, ""You should do (A) because if you don't then (B) will suffer and the consequences will affect (C,D, and E).""

, If they place a high value on themselves, use a similar argument to that for emotions but show the negative consequences for them instead of other people.

, Help them see the reward in doing whatever you want them to do. Show them all of the upsides until what you're arguing really does sound like the best decision. Sometimes, you may have to get a little creative and find something that might not be that obvious. Another technique is to ask them what rewards they would want out of doing that thing or what rewards they think they'll get. Good luck!

Speaking from a desire to add something or just get your voice heard, will not add to your perceived level of articulateness. Let others speak about things that they are an expert in and add to that discussion through articulate questions. Do your research and know the alternative perspectives but be willing to quit sharing when you move outside your current knowledge.


If you don't know your subject well but have to speak on it, then extensive research will help you sound like you know your stuff.;
, This helps to eliminate the verbal pauses and may prevent you from saying something that does not make sense. It's okay if this slows you down a bit. In fact, pausing before you give a real answer will make you look more thoughtful and intelligent than someone who just blurts out a string of nonsensical phrases as soon as a question is posed.


If someone asks you a question and you really want to think it through, don't be afraid to say, ""Come back to me in a minute. I need to gather my thoughts."" You will sound much more prepared after you have time to think.

, Using a variety of words that mean that same thing creates more interest and color in your speech. If you do not understand the words you read, consult a dictionary or thesaurus. The easiest way to expand your vocabulary is to read, read, read. Knowing synonyms for words can be helpful, but you should make sure you use them correctly instead of using a word you've only ever seen in a dictionary aloud for the first time.


You can create vocabulary flashcards and quiz yourself. Make a goal of learning ten new words a week.

, Shun slang and contractions. Instead of hi, use hello, instead of yeah, use yes. Never use huh, uh-huh unless in the context of a story or event….if you're giving a formal or even semi-formal presentation, then it's important to use intelligent, full words. Avoid too many contractions (say ""I cannot"" instead of ""I can't"") and speak in complete sentences as much as you can, unless you are not doing so for effect.

, Study the proper uses of the words following words: I, me, him, his, he, no, not. They are commonly used incorrectly in cases such as double negatives and when listing people. When reiterating a fact you already stated, always say ""as I said"", never, ""like I said"". Here are some other tricks to know:


You should say, ""He and I were discussing…"" instead of ""Him and I were discussing…""
You should say, ""You can give your report to her or me,"" instead of ""You can give your report to her or I.""
You should say, ""Such as…"" instead of ""like…""

, If you want to sound articulate and intelligent, then you have to look confident when you deliver your message. Make eye contact with the audience, sound like you really mean what you say, and speak loudly enough for people to hear you. If you seem comfortable with your message and like you believe in your words, instead of second-guessing yourself, then people will be more likely to believe in it too.


Make your sentences sound firm and decisive. Don't end your sentences with a question or with turning up your voice slightly, or you'll sound like you're constantly asking for affirmation.

, Your posture can go a long way in making you sound more intelligent. Stand up tall and avoid hunching over at all costs, whether you're standing up, walking, or sitting down. Don't cross your arms over your chest; keep them at your sides and use them to gesture. Elongate your neck slightly. Standing up tall will make your words sound more forceful and will make people believe that you know what you're talking about even more.

, If you want to sound smart, then you can't just spout out your latest ideas to a group of people or your close friends without thinking about how you'll frame them in advance. What you have to do is prepare what you're going to say, whether you're giving a class presentation or talking to your girlfriend about a relationship issue. Rehearse what you have to say as much as you need to in order to feel comfortable about saying what you have to say.


It's important to practice and rehearse, but it's also important for what you say to sound natural. Therefore, you should know the material well enough to change things up if it becomes necessary.

, Saying more by saying less can make some people shut down or quit listening. Add content to discussions that is as condensed as possible without being vague. Talking until you get to your point will ensure half of your audience has already tuned out. State your point up front and people will know what you are trying to elaborate about.


If you have to give a speech and there's a time limit, don't squeeze in the thirty thoughts that come to your head. Pick the three most important ideas, and elaborate on those.

, Words such as um, a, like, etc... degrade and detract from what you say. They disturb the flow of a sentence and make it detached. A nonverbal pause is much better. When floundering for words, a nonverbal pause, placed correctly, gives the listener the effect of a dramatic or studied thought. It confirms your control over what is being said.


Speaking more slowly, eliminating distractions, and making eye contact will also help you stick to your message.

, Another way to speak more clearly is to speak more slowly. You may feel that if you rush and say everything you wanted to say, that you'll be able to get it over with and make people see your point more clearly. However, if you take the time to slow down, think about what you have to say, and pronounce your words in a way that won't make you mumble or confuse your audiences, then you will actually be more well-spoken.


You don't have to speak…so…slowly…that you feel like you're pausing between every word, but pausing in between sentences to give yourself time to prepare your next sentence will do the trick.
If you speak too quickly, there's also a chance that you will say something that you regret or that makes absolutely no sense, and you'll have to do some backtracking to make your audience understand what you really mean; you can avoid all that by speaking slowly to begin with.

, If you keep your hands in your pockets, you are more likely to stutter, forget what you have to say, or to confuse your audience. That's because using your hands to gesture can help you explain what you mean and can get your whole body into the speaking process. Communication doesn't just come from your mouth, but from your posture, your eye contact, your gesturing, and your body language -- it's part of a whole package. So the next time you speak, take those hands out of your pocket. Even if you don't use them to gesture a ton, you'll feel more comfortable if you gesture a little.


Keeping your hands in your pockets will also make you look less confident, which will make your message look weaker.

, Another way to be more well-spoken is to be really focused on your message. You may be saying ""um"" and ""uh"" or forgetting your train of thought every few sentences because your phone keeps vibrating, because you're running late, or because you're worried about a meeting you have later that day. So, stay in the moment and focus on what you're saying when you're saying it as much as you can.


If you are focused only on your message, you'll be able to deliver it more articulately, and your audience will pay more attention, too.

, If you want to make a lifelong effort to be a more articulate person, then you have to live a more intellectual life. Read contemporary and classic fiction to be immersed in the world of literature. Read non-fiction and the paper to be up-to-date. Watch the news to have a better sense of what is going on in the world, and how relevant issues are expressed. Talk to other intelligent people and make a habit of communicating wisely.


Sure, reading an extra book a month or reading the paper every day may not immediately make you more articulate the next time you have a conversation, but you will able to see it impact your speaking and cognitive abilities in the long run.

, Another way to be more articulate is to work to have a strong sense of the group of people you are talking to. If you're giving a presentation on a poet to a group of literary scholars, then you can assume that they understand the vocabulary and concepts you are using; but if you're teaching a group of fifth-grade students to write their own poetry, then the words you use, and the level of explanation you give, will have to be very different depending on who you're talking to.


Being a complete genius won't help you at all when talking to a group of nine-year-olds; to be a professional at being articulate, you'll have to adjust your words and speech to your audience whenever it's necessary.

, If you tell a story, you are more likely to get rid of all that verbal filler or the hesitation, because you will know it like the back of your hand and will be able to move more fluently from one sentence to the next. If you have a story that illustrates your point very well, then you should use it in a speech or when you talk to people, and you will sound more animated and articulate because you'll be speaking from a place that makes you comfortable.


Practicing telling the story in advance, of course, can help you fine-tune it, even if you think you know it pretty well.

, Go on YouTube or another online source and watch some great speakers, such as Martin Luther King or Steve Jobs, and see if you can learn anything from them. You can also read some great speeches, such as ""The Gettysburg Address,"" to see if you can pick up on how to impress and inspire people. You can also just watch inspiring speakers on the news who are particularly well-spoken and thoughtful, and see what you can learn from them.


Take notes while you watch or read. You'll see that you can learn a lot about how to be articulate just by watching other people who are well-spoken.

, Another way to wow a crowd or a co-worker and to get your message across is to make sure that your message is worth listening to. Though telling an amazing and inspiring story about how you finished a marathon with a sprained ankle may not be perfectly stated, if you make the story interesting enough, people will be able to overlook the times you pause, stutter, or use verbal filler. So, the next time you're nervous about talking to people, don't just focus on how you state the message -- focus on making the message itself as engaging as possible.


To make your content more interesting, you can not only trim down the extra verbiage, but you can also figure out what would be the most captivating thing to tell your audience.

, This will put you in touch with like-minded people and will offer the time and place you need to give speeches, captivate audiences, and learn to be more articulate. If you're feeling shy or afraid to speak in front of audiences, this will give you the push you need to become a more confident, articulate person."

Don't expect them to open up immediately.",How to Be a Good Listener," It's easy to get lost in yourself and to only consider the impact of the other person's ""telling"" on you. But active listening is blocked by your inward thinking. Instead, you must open out and look at the problems from the other person's perspective: and assume that if you had been in their shoes, you would have come to the same conclusion, and not seen your way through the problem any faster than them. By being a good listener this can also help you become better friends with the person by getting to know more about them.


Remember that you have two ears and one mouth for a reason. This means that you should be listening more than you are talking. It is more beneficial to listen than it is to talk. When listening to people, engage in the conversation and make eye contact so they know that you care about what they are saying (even if you don't care, it is still polite). People who listen more are more observant and therefore more thoughtful and have a better understanding of things. Make sure you really are listening and not doing something else. Try to make sure you are completely focused on the person who is talking and not get sidetracked. Make sure you are making eye contact with the person, not someone else or something else.
Instead of immediately judging the person who is speaking, or coming up with a ""solution"" right away, just take the time to listen and to look at the situation from the other person's perspective. Think about how you would feel if someone was silently judging you. This will help you truly hear the person instead of forming your own opinions before you truly understand the situation at hand.;
, Though you may think that the best thing you can do to really listen is to compare the person's experiences to your own, this is far from the truth. If the person is talking about dealing with a death in the family, you can share some wisdom, but avoid saying, ""That's exactly like how it was with me..."" This can come off as offensive or insensitive especially when you compare something really serious to your own less-intense experiences, such as comparing the person's divorce to your three-month long relationship this may cause discomfort to the person talking.


You may think that this is the best way to be helpful and to approach the situation, but this type of thinking is actually reductive and can make the person feel like you're not really listening at all.
Avoid saying ""I"" or ""me"" a lot. This is a good indicator that you're focusing more on yourself than on the person's situation.
Of course, if the person knows that you've had a similar experience, then he or she may actively ask for your opinion. In this case, you can offer it, but be cautious about acting like your experiences are exactly like the other person's. This might seem as though you are just trying to make fake situations to seem helpful.

, Some people think that, when they're listening, they should also have their gears turning to find a quick and easy solution to the person's problem. Instead of this attitude, you should take what the person says at face value, and take the time to think of a ""solution"" when the person is speaking — and only if he or she is really looking for help in this way. If you start frantically thinking of all of the quick fixes for the person's problems, then you won't really be listening.


Focus on absorbing everything the person is saying to you. Only after that can you really try to help.
Limit distractions. We live in a society that is filled with so many distractions. We are constantly listening to so much noise that it’s a challenge to truly listen to another person. In order for you to be a good listener, you need to limit distractions during your conversation, whether it be the television, telephones or interruptions. It takes a mental decision to limit distractions when you are listening to someone else.

, Show them that you care by nodding at appropriate times so they know are listening. Also says little things such as ""Yeah"" when the person is talking about something that they want you to agree on (you can tell by their tone of voice) or ""Wow"" when the person talks about a tragedy or something bad done against them. Saying these words shows them that you are not only listening but also paying attention. Say these words at the appropriate times and softly so that you don't come off as overbearing and interrupting. Try to appeal to your sensitive side and comfort the person if in distress. But on the other hand most people do not want to be pitied. So comfort them but don't make yourself seem higher than them.

, One important part of being a good listener is to actually absorb the information the person has told you. So, if the person is telling you about his problems with his best friend, Jake, and you've never met the guy before, you can at least remember his name so you can refer to him that way, making it seem like you're better acquainted with the situation. If you don't remember any names, details, or important events, then it won't sound like you're listening.


It's okay if you don't have a razor sharp memory. However, if you keep having to stop and ask for clarification or keep forgetting who everyone is, then yeah, you won't come off as a very good listener. You don't have to remember every little detail, but you don't want the person who is speaking to feel like they have to repeat themselves a million times, either.

, Another important part of being a good listener is that you go beyond just hearing the person out having a conversation, and never thinking about it again. If you really want to show that you care, then you should ask the person about the situation the next time you're alone together, or even shoot him or her a text or give a phone call to see how the situation is progressing. If it's something serious like an impending divorce, a job search, or even a health complication, then it can be very nice to show that you care by checking in, even when you're not being asked to. Don't be put off however if they don't want to follow up, accept their decision but tell them you're always there to support them.


The person who talked to you might be touched that you made the effort to actually think about him or her beyond your conversation and to even check in to see how he or she is caring. This takes your listening skills to the next level.
Of course, there's a difference between following up and nagging the person. If the person talked to you about how she wants to quit her job, you probably don't want to send a text every day asking if she did it yet, or you'll be putting unneeded pressure on the situation and creating stress instead of helping.

, Knowing what to avoid when you're trying to be a good listener can be almost as helpful as knowing what to do. If you want the speaker to take you seriously and to think that you are being respectful, then here are some general things to avoid:


Don't interrupt in the middle of a point.
Don't interrogate the person. Instead, gently ask questions when it's needed(i.e.between gaps or lulls when the person is not talking).
Don't try to change the subject, even if it's a little uncomfortable.
Avoid saying, ""It's not the end of the world"" or ""You'll feel better in the morning."" This just minimizes the person's problems and makes him or her feel bad. Make eye contact with the person so that they realize that you are interested and are listening.

, It might sound obvious and trite, but one of the biggest obstacles to listening is resisting the urge to voice impulsive thoughts. Likewise, many people falsely express empathy by sharing similar their own experiences. Both ""gut"" responses can be helpful, but they are usually overused and, ultimately, abused.


Put aside your own needs, and wait patiently for the other person to unfold their thoughts at their own pace and in their own way.

, If the person is telling you something pretty private or important, then you should make it clear that you're a trustworthy person who can keep their mouth shut. Say that the person can trust you, that whatever is said stays between you two, and that your word is your bond. If the person is unsure of whether or not you can really be trusted, then he or she will be less likely to open up. Also don't force anyone to open up to you as this makes them uncomfortable or angry.


Of course, when you say that what the person says will remain confidential, it should be true, unless there are circumstances that prevent you from keeping it to yourself, such as if the person is suicidal and you're deeply concerned. If you can't actually be trusted in general, though, then you'll never be a good listener.

, It's important to use empathetic sounding back at appropriate intervals during the conversation so the speaker doesn't feel like you're not listening at all. It's helpful to ""summarize and restate"" or ""repeat and encourage"" the main points. This will help the conversation feel fluid and will make the speaker less self-conscious about talking. Here's what you should do:



Repeat and encourage: Repeat some things the speaker said and, at the same time, provide positive feedback as encouragement. For example, you might say, ""I can see that you didn't enjoy having to take the blame. I wouldn't have either."" Go easy with this technique, though. Use the empathetic sound back as a nudge from time-to-time because if you overwork it, you will come across as patronizing.

Summarize and restate: It is highly useful to summarize your understanding of what the ""teller"" has said and to restate it in your own words. This reassures the speaker that you have truly been listening to what he or she is saying and that you ""got it"". It also provides the speaker with an opportunity to correct mistaken assumptions and misconceptions on your part.
Make sure to leave the door wide open with statements like, ""I may be wrong, but..."" or ""...Correct me if I am wrong."" This technique is especially useful when you find yourself getting frustrated or you sense that your listening focus is wavering.

, Refrain from probing or putting the other person on the defensive. Rather, aim to use questions as a means by which the speaker can begin to reach his or her own conclusions about the issues being raised. This can help the speaker make his or her own conclusions without sounding judgmental or too forceful. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Once you have shown empathetic listening, it is time to move into empowered listening: Re-frame the questions you ask. For example, ""You didn't enjoy having to take the blame. But I cannot understand why you feel blamed rather than merely being asked not to do something that way.""
Wording the question in this manner presents the speaker with a need to respond directly to your lack of grasping something. In the response process, the speaker should begin to move from a more emotional response to a more logical and constructive response.

, In the process of encouraging a constructive response, an active listener must be ever-so-patient and let the speaker acquire his or her full flow of thoughts, feelings and ideas. These may, at first, start as a trickle and the full flow may take a long time to develop. If you press too early and ask too many personal, probing questions, that may actually have the opposite of the intended effect and may make the person feel defensive and reluctant to share any information.


Keep your patience and keep your place in the ""teller's"" shoes. It sometimes helps to imagine why the ""teller"" has worked into such a situation.

, Instead, wait for the other person to ask your opinion before breaking the flow of their discourse. Active listening requires the listener to shelve his or her own opinions temporarily and patiently await appropriate breaks in conversation. When the conversation breaks, provide a summary or an empathetic concurrence.


If you interrupt the person too soon, then he or she will be frustrated and won't fully absorb what you're saying. The person will be eager to finish saying his or her part and you'll be causing a nuisance and a distraction.
Abstain from giving direct advice (unless you're asked for it). Instead, let the individual talk the situation out and find his or her own way. This empowers both the individual and you. It is the course most likely to result in beneficial change and self-understanding for the ""teller"" and for you.

, Whatever the conclusion of the conversation, let the speaker know that you have been happy to listen and to be a sounding board. Make it clear that you are open to further discussion if need be, but that you will not pressure him or her at all. In addition, reassure the speaker of your intention to keep the discussion confidential. Even if the speaker is in a terrible situation and saying something like, ""It's all going to be okay"" seems completely inappropriate, you can still reassure the speaker by saying that you're there to listen and to help.


You can even pat the speaker's hand or knee, put an arm around him or her, or give another reassuring touch. Do whatever is appropriate to the situation. You don't want to overstep your bounds when it comes to touching.
Offer to assist with any solutions if you have the ability, time and expertise. Do not build up false hopes, though. If the only resource you can provide is to continue to be an active listener, make that very clear. This, in and of itself, this is an extremely valuable help.

, Think about what is best for the person in question rather than what you did although this may help.

, Eye contact is important when you are listening. If you give your friend the impression you aren't interested and are distracted, they may never open up to you again. When it comes to being a good listener, it’s important for you to have eye contact with the other person.When someone is talking to you, focus directly on their eyes so that they will know with certainty that you are absorbing every single word. Even if the topic is not interesting to you, at least respect and truly listen to what the speaker has to say. Don't stare off in space.


Focus your eyes, ears and your thoughts only on him/her and become a good listener. Don't concentrate on thinking about what you will say next, but instead, focus fully on what the other person is saying. (Remember that it's about the person, not you.)

, If you want to be a good listener, then it's important for you to create a conducive physical and mental space. Remove all distractions and confer all of your attention to the person who has something to say to you. Turn off communication devices (including cell phones) and arrange to talk in a place with no distractions. Once you are face-to-face, quiet your mind and pay attention to what the other person is telling.Show them that you are helpful.


Pick a place that is free of distractions or other people who might grab your attention. If you go to a coffee shop, make sure you're focused on the person who is speaking, not the interesting characters who walk in and out of the door.
If you're talking in a public place like a restaurant or a cafe, avoid sitting near a television that's on. Even if you're determined to give the person all of your attention, it can be tempting to take a quick look at the television, especially if your favorite team is playing.

, Nodding your head will indicate that you understand what the speaker is saying, and will encourage them to continue. Adopting body postures, positions and movements that are similar to the speaker (mirroring) will enable the speaker to relax and open up more. Try looking straight into their eyes. Not only does this show you are listening, but it shows you take real interest in what they are saying.


Another way to have encouraging body language is to turn your body toward the speaker. If you're turned away from the speaker, then it may look like you're itching to leave. If you cross your legs, for example, cross your leg toward the speaker instead of away.
Don't cross your arms over your chest, either. This will make you appear standoffish or skeptical even if you don't actually feel that way.

, Active listening involves the entire body and face — both yours and that of the speaker. You can be quiet while still making it clear that you are hanging on to every word that the speaker is telling you. Here's how you can make the most of the situation by being an active listener:



Your words: Though you don't have to say, ""Mmhmm,"" ""I see,"" or ""Right,"" every five seconds or it will begin to get annoying, you can throw in an encouraging phrase here and there to show that you're paying attention.If that person whom you are talking to really means something to you,then you will surely pay attention and help them sort out their problem if there is any.

Your expression: Look interested and meet the gaze of the speaker from time to time. Do not overwhelm the speaker by staring intently, but do reflect friendliness and openness to what you are listening to.

Read between the lines: Always be alert for things that have been left unsaid and for cues that can help you gauge the speaker's true feelings. Watch the facial and body expressions of the ""teller"" to try to gather all information you can, not just from the words. Imagine what kind of state of mind would have made you acquire such expressions, body language and volume.

Speak at approximately the same energy level as the other person. This way, they will know that the message is getting through and that there is no need to repeat.

, Be patient and willing to just listen, without giving any advice.


Try to repeat what the other person is saying to confirm the exact meaning. Sometimes words can mean two different things. The best way to confirm and avoid misunderstanding between the conversationalists is to repeat what the other person is saying so that the other person knows you were listening and both of you have the same idea.
Consider their circumstances. If they are a sensitive person, don't give them ""tough love.""

Be prepared!,
Be calm.,
Be positive!,
Practice!",How to Talk Without Hesitation and Feel Confident," If you get on stage and have NO idea what you are going to say, then chances are you'll hesitate and stutter. You don't HAVE to have a well written, spell-checked, award winning speech (Save those for times when you are in competitions and such.)! Just have a basic idea of what you are going to say. Example: If you are presenting a speech about cat behavior, think of three main points such as neutral behavior, good/happy behavior, and bad behavior. Then, find three main points about each of those topics.;
, If you are freaking out and are thinking about all of the negative things that could happen and you head is full of ""what-ifs"", then there is NO WAY you will be able to do it! Believe in yourself! If you just think something like, ""It's all good. I know what I'm going to say and I can TOTALLY do this!"", right before you present, then you'll be fine!

, If you think ,""I can't do this. I stink at speaking in front of people"" or, ""Everyone is going to hate my speech that I worked really hard on because it's so bad"" you will not be able to do it! But if you believe in yourself, then everyone else will believe in you too.

, Practice in front of your mirror and before you go on stage. The more you practice, the more fluent and confident you will become!

Only pronounce your ""r"" sounds if they are before a vowel.,
Replace a ""th"" at the beginning and end of words with a percussive ""d"" or ""t"" sound.,
Elongate your vowels into an ""awww"" sound, especially ""a""s and ""o""s. Many of the words that have the ""o"" sound (like in coffee) are pronounced with an ""aw"" sound.,

Pronounce New York English as if projecting forward in front of the mouth, almost like a open-mouthed pucker.",How to Talk Like a Stereotypical New Yorker1," The dropped ""r"" is a classic New York sound, though it is actually going out of style. The tricky part is to remember when to subtly drop the ""r."" It only disappears when it is before a consonant, though the disappearance is slight -- listening to native speakers will help you find the sweet spot. So, for example:Park → ""Pak.""
Nurse → ""Nuhse.""
Water → ""Watta""
River → ""Rivva""
Fear → ""Feah""Note, however, that some New Yorkers also add ""r""s where they aren't needed, like ""idea-r"" or ""law-r and order."" These are generally colloquial and common in older speakers.;
, This is found in the cliched New York accent expression ""toity-toid street"" (""33rd Street""). But it is not always so cliche -- dropping the softer, whispery ""thhhh"" sound for a harder ""ddd"" or ""tttt"" sound is very New York.


The → ""teh""
That → ""tat"" or ""dat""
Three → ""tree""When making ""d"" or ""t"" sounds, place your tongue against the back of your bottom teeth. Note the subtle difference., So the word dog, for example, would sound like ""dawg"", and ""coffee"" would sound like ""cawfee.""


Talk → ""Tawk""
Though → ""Tawwt""
The short ""o"" sound is pretty rare in New York English. Words which include the long ""i"" in the middle, like ""liar"", use a very similar ""aw"" sound, so ""liar"" should sound almost like ""lawyer""

, This is a tricky one, because it requires turning one syllable into two. Some linguists actually believe it is near impossible for outsiders to learn, but you can pick it up with a bit of practice. Check out the following examples and see if they make sense, trying to get through the first syllable quickly and sliding it naturally into the next.


Cab → ""ca-AHB""
Avenue → ""ahav-enue."", Furthermore, most New Yorkers get their words out quickly, speaking with a pace just a bit faster than the average American. Test out a few words, phonetically spelled out for you, to get used to the accent before diving in. The capitalized letters are for emphasis.


Sunday → ""sun-dA""
Monday → ""Mun-dey""
Tuesday → ""Twos-dey""
Wednesday → ""Wehn-s-dey""
Thursday → ""Thuhs-dey"" (err being kind of rolled r)
Friday → ""Fry-dey""

, The best way to practice is the word Long Island itself, pronounced by residents as ""Lawn-Guyland"") Really take your time with the vowels, stretching them out for a nice long time. The ""g"" at the end of ""-ing"" isn't pronounced either. So ""going"" is pronounced ""goin'"" and ""here"" sounds like ""hea""., The following expressions aren't really used so much anymore, but they're still stereotypes. They will instantly place your listener into the NYC mindset, even if that mindset is about 15 years old by now. Typical expressions Noo Yawkez use include ""Get outta hea"", ""Fawget aboutit"" & ""Ahrite ahready""


Say ""hey"", instead of ""hi"" or ""hello"" and say it quickly.
Make the classic ""you guys"" into the NYC plural ""yous guys."", It is often a deep sounding voice, and words are spoken kind of in a relaxed way. Since New York was at one point very Italian, Staten Island and Brooklyn in particular (Staten Island is still 44% Italian, the highest percentage of any county in the country), people of Italian descent that live in the areas tend to have a little bit of Italian accent mixed in. So if you've ever heard, have or done an Italian accent, it may be a little bit easier to do a NY accent. Think of Sylvester Stallone. Now think of Danny DeVito. Both have similar accents, but also plenty of uniqueness. Your own accent can be similarly unique, as long as you follow the basic rules above.

Breathe through your diaphragm.,
Keep a comfortable, upright posture.,
Speak evenly.,
Practice breathing deeply and projecting your voice.",How to Talk Loudly1," The diaphragm is the main muscle involved in respiration, and it is located deep within your belly.Inhale and exhale deeply so that you increase the volume of air in your lungs. Focus on your belly: let it expand as you inhale air, and contract as you exhale. Speak as an exhalation of this deep breath to give more force to your words.


This technique is similar to singing from your diaphragm. Whether you are singing or speaking, the amount of breath that you have available is highly dependent upon the way that you are breathing.;
, Relax your shoulders and keep your back straight. Standing up straight allows your lungs to expand to their full capacity, which gives more weight to your voice. Good posture will also help keep your diaphragm open so that more air can flow through more quickly., Take a nice, deep breath, and use this air as fuel for your voice. Do not speak quickly or madly, releasing all of the air into one phrase. Let your lung capacity sustain you through an entire steady sentence.


Make sure that you aren't speaking from your nose. When the air comes through your nose, it can result in a high, reedy pitch that is hard to pick out from the crowd. Try to be conscious of your exhalation., It may take some work to master the technique – but be patient. Take the time to tune into your body and critically engage with your breathing pattern. Be conscious of how your throat, your lungs, your diaphragm, and your belly when you speak. Try it out in a room of people and see whether people take notice."

Enunciate each word more clearly.,
Practice tongue twisters.,
Stretch your vowel sounds.",How to Talk Slower1," One of the biggest problems for people who speak too quickly is that they often blur words together in a way that can be difficult to understand. Spend some time practicing how you enunciate words, especially when you string them together in a sentence.Don’t skip over any words, not even the small ones. Enunciate each syllable of every word.;
, Tongue twisters are designed to help you work out the muscles in your mouth, and improve your own pronunciation. Try various tongue twisters to help you warm up your voice before a speech, or just to help you slow down your vocal cadence in general.Try saying, “The lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue” over and over. Exaggerate each syllable.
Repeat the words “rubber baby buggy bumpers.” Say each word clearly. Repeat the phrase again and again.

, While practicing your enunciation, try stretching your vowel sounds to add length to each word. This will help you speak more slowly and more clearly.Exaggerate it at first and add a short pause between each word. Over time, this will help you learn to not link your words together so intensely while still enunciating each word clearly.

Listen.,
Learn the sound differences.,
Learn the vernacular.,
Learn the grammar.,
Practice.",How to Talk Like a Geordie," Before you can properly begin to speak the dialect, you must first familiarize yourself with it. Some people may find it within their means to hear the dialect first-hand. For those unable to get in contact with an in-the-flesh Geordie, you can hear the dialect in movies that take place in the area, such as ""The Likely Lads"" and ""Billy Elliot"".;
, Before getting on to new words, learn how to say the ones you already know with a Geordie accent. Here are some of the more common Geordie mannerisms. (To understand these sounds represented by the symbols used below, you made need to consult the International Phonetic Alphabet. At https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipa, you can learn about the IPA and hear the different sounds pronounced.)


Vowels

A final -er becomes /a/, so brother sounds like brotha.

/æ/ sounds often become /ɛ/, so sat sounds like set.

/o:/ in words like walk becomes /a:/ or /æ:/.

Note that the pronunciation of walk with the /o:/ sound is the British pronunciation, not the American one, which has the /a:/ sound.


/ə:/ in words like work becomes /o:/, so that work and port have the same vowel sound.
/æu/ in words like crown and /ou/ in words like ""know"" become /u:/, so crown sounds like croon and know sounds like new.

/ɛ/ often becomes /i/, especially in words spelled with ea like head. Thus head sounds like heed.

Final -ing is pronounced /ən/, so talking sounds like talken.



Consonants

The /t/ (that is pronounced more commonly in American dialects) in words like ""notice"" is realized as a glottal stop. This means that instead of pronouncing the /t/ sound, you make a hard pause between the two vowel sounds.
Final r is dropped following a vowel sound. This is typical of British dialects.
Vowels are sometimes added between successive consonants, usually when the consonants are at the end of the word.
Many consonant clusters become altered in both stressed and unstressed syllables. So, for example, dew sounds like Jew. This is called Yod-coalescence, and affects the clusters , , and , turning them into , , and .


These are just a few of the numerous sound differences between Geordie and other dialects. You can visit http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/case-studies/geordie/ for a more complete list with audio pronunciations, as well as larger lists of grammatical and lexical features.

, This is where you start building up your Geordie vocabulary. Go back to step one and start listening - being more accustomed to the accent, you'll start to notice the slang. It's best to pick up the words as you hear them - that way you can naturally acquire the common words. Geordie has a large vocabulary of unique words; many of these are formed just by sound changes, but some are entirely unfamiliar. A few of these are:



a-one for ""one""
aught"" for ""anything""

aye for ""yes""

bairn for ""child""

champion for ""great""

gan for ""go""

loaning for ""lane""

mebbies for ""maybe""

somewhat for ""something""

tae for ""to""
There are many more, so keep listening and practicing to acquaint yourself more fully.

, Geordie has a number of unique grammatical features that distinguish it from Standard English. A few are listed here.


Verbal Constructions

Third person plural: is rather than are, and was rather than were


mustn't have + past participle, rather than can't have + past participle
Past tense: come rather than came, and done rather than did



Nouns and Pronouns

No plural marker for certain count nouns, e.g. 10 month ago

First person singular: us rather than me

Second person plural: youse rather than you

Reflexive pronouns: mysell, yoursell, hissell, etc. rather than myself, yourself, himself, etc.



Negative Constructions


divn't rather than don't


I've not, you'll not, etc. rather than I haven't, you won't, etc.
Multiple negation, e.g. didn't do nothing



Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Adverbs


for to + infinitive, rather than to + infinitive

so as rather than so that

No adverbial marker, e.g. quick rather than quickly




, It may only be a dialect, but for some, it can be just as difficult as learning a foreign language, or even harder because one needs to conceptualize the idea of a language that is already known. Try to find a Geordie friend who can correct you. The best way to practice is to try as hard as you can to not break character. Doing this will force you to think about the way you are speaking, until it begins to feel natural.

Breathe from your diaphragm to gain more control.,
Develop diaphragm strength to keep improving.,
Exhale on a hissing sound to pace your breath.,
Practice voice exercises to widen your vocal range.,
Do tongue twisters to get better articulation.,
Read poetry, articles, or a book you’re in the middle of out loud.",How to Stop Your Voice from Shaking1," Look at yourself in the mirror while you take a deep breath. If your shoulders rise, you’re breathing from your chest instead of your diaphragm, which is a muscle that sits right at the base of your lungs. Breathe in and see if you can expand your rib cage outwards without moving your shoulders or chest.Believe it or not, this will actually make a huge difference in the way you speak. Since the diaphragm is a muscle, it needs exercise just like, say, your biceps. Once it gets stronger, you’ll be much better at controlling your voice (and the shake), since strong voices rely on steady breathing.;
, Once you discover where your diaphragm is and how to use it, it’s time to make it stronger. Before or after you shower, wrap a towel around your waist. Breathe in and try to move the towel outward without letting your shoulders or chest rise. Breathe out slowly. On the next breath out, say “ah.” Do this ten times.When you say “ah” while breathing from your diaphragm, you should notice that it’s easier to speak loudly and steadily. Practice getting louder and softer. You can even take a few shallow breaths from your chest to compare the two sounds.

, Breathe in using your diaphragm, and hiss the air out through your teeth while you’re standing straight and tall. Repeat this exercise ten times. Hopefully, no one walks in while you’re making snake noises! Weird as it may feel, controlling how quickly or slowly you release your breath is a great way to make your diaphragm stronger. , One of the ways to make your voice shake less is to build a wide range of speaking tones. Sometimes, people who suffer from shakiness also make high, cracked sounds when they’re nervous. Avoid these problems by doing vocal exercises at least once a day.Say mm-mmm (as in the “that’s tastes good” kind of mm-mm), and mm-hmm. Remember to always breathe from your diaphragm during these exercises, and use your breath to make these hums loud. Repeat five times.
Say “ney, ney, ney, ney” up and down your vocal range. Speak as high as you can and then move all the way down to speaking as low as you can. Have fun with this, because you’re going to feel super silly. Repeat ten times.
Say “ooo-eee” over and over again, sliding all the way through your vocal range. Repeat ten times.
Say “mmmmm” and focus on the buzzing sensation that should be happening right at the front of your face and around your mouth. Keep that buzzing going until you’ve finished your breath. Repeat this five times.

, Having good articulation means that people will be able to catch every syllable of the words you say. This is super important, because if people miss syllables, they might mishear you or not understand what you’re saying at all. Practice these exercises once a day.You can use the ones listed here or look up ones that you feel challenge you. Go as fast as you can, but only so long as you’re speaking clearly.
Try: “the bluebird blinks,” “three free throws,” “what time does the wristwatch strap shop shut?,” “strange strategic statistics,” and “freshly fried flying fish, freshly fried flesh.”

, The best way to get better at speaking without shakiness is to speak often. To practice in low-pressure situations, read various things out loud. Treat it like a performance. Speak loudly and softly, high and low, and get emotional. Do a private reading for a friend when you feel like you’re ready for an audience.If you have a particular speech you’re preparing for, that’s perfect! Read that out loud every day.
You can also record yourself on your phone or a video camera. Watch or listen to the playback to find spots for improvement.

Think about how you feel when you speak.,
Practice speaking with confidence.,
Match the volume of the people around you.",How to Talk Loudly2," Perhaps you feel self-conscious about speaking in front of people. Maybe you are uncomfortable with coming across as assertive or confrontational. Analyze your own thought patterns, and consider that you may need to work on more than just your speaking voice.

, Own your words, and don't be afraid of what anyone else thinks. Notice when you are being hesitant, and check the impulse in yourself. Try to overcome a fear of judgment.Try not to apologize or hedge the things you say. If you are always hesitating, then you won't speak as loudly as you are able.
Speak to a person as though he or she is your equal, not your superior. Try to suppress low self-esteem and ""fake it until you make it.""

, When you are having a conversation or speaking with a group of people, try to speak at roughly the same volume that they are. Be aware of the energy of the conversation. Speak loudly when the energy is high, and speak softly when the energy is low. You don't always need to speak loudly to be heard!"
"
Add pauses at appropriate times.,
Allow yourself to occasionally use filler words.,
Breathe more frequently.,
Make eye contact with your listener.,
Practice self-calming techniques.",How to Talk Slower2," Many people who speak too fast skip over places where pauses would make sense in normal conversation. This includes between sentences, after a major piece of information, and when the topic changes. Try to make a conscious effort to add more pauses while you are speaking.You may need to pause between each word, or add extra-long pauses after important information.

, Filler words are conversational tools that allow the listener to better understand the topic, and also provide the speaker with time to think before completing a response. Allowing yourself to occasionally use these words in your speech can help you slow down your presentation. It can also allow your audience to connect more strongly with what you’re saying.


These include things like “um,” “uh,” “I mean,” “you know,” and “like.”
Keep in mind that using too many filler words can make it look like you are struggling to find the right words, or don’t know the answer. Use these sparingly, and only as a means to help you slow down your speech.

, Sometimes people hold their breath a bit, or speak more quickly in order to get through more of the words in one breath. If you want to speak more slowly, make a concerted effort to breathe more often while you are speaking.If you have a typed speech, you should consider adding notes for yourself to remember when to breathe and to do it more frequently than you normally would.

, When you are giving a speech or talking to other people, it can be helpful to make eye contact with whoever is listening. By practicing this trick, you will be waiting for verbal or body language cues from your listener(s) before you move on with your topic. This means that you will be forced to slow down to accommodate your audience.Speaking more slowly and engaging with your audience with eye contact will help them keep up with you and understand what you’re talking about.

, Talking too fast is often caused by anxiety or nervousness in speaking situations. It can be helpful to practice calming yourself down so that you can slow down they rhythm of your speech.Try counting your breaths slowly. Inhale deeply and exhale slowly. Count each breath and continue this practice for one to five minutes.
Try clenching and releasing your muscles. Start with the muscles at the top and work your way down. Clench the muscles in your forehead and face while you breathe in. Hold the breath for a moment and then slowly release it, unclenching the muscles as you go. Repeat this process as you work your way down your body, clenching and releasing all of your muscles.

Read texts aloud at varying speeds.,
Read texts aloud at varying volumes.,
Record yourself speaking.,
Ask someone to listen to you and provide feedback.",How to Talk Slower3," Try reading a passage out loud at your normal speed, and then try reading it faster than your normal speed. This will make any other tempo seem slower. Next, re-read the text with a conscious effort to read it more slowly Then continue slowing down until it seems exaggeratedly slow.With practice, this kind of speed alteration will help you learn how to control the tempo of your voice.

, Read a passage aloud at your normal volume. Then try reading it aloud in a whispered voice. Practice reading things in a whispered tone. The extra effort put into expelling the air out at a softer volume will automatically slow down your monologue.Try to inhale deeply and then expel all of the air while you complete a single phrase. Pause between phrases.

, A lot of people have trouble hearing the problems that occur in their own speeches, especially in the moment during a presentation or speech. Record yourself while you are speaking – preferably during a live presentation, not just a practice session – so you can listen to yourself and critique your mistakes.Play the recording when you are alone and have some time to analyze what you hear. Try practicing the same speech again, but make a conscious effort to alter some of the issues you noticed in the recording.
Think about places in which your speech seemed especially fast, and practice slowing down especially in those moments.

, Ask a trusted friend or colleague to listen to you when you are speaking and to jot down a few notes for you. After the presentation is over, ask the person for any thoughts, especially related to the speed of your speech.Try to take their criticism in a good natured manner. Remember that you asked them to do this for you.

Exercise to get rid of excess energy.,
Open up your throat by sticking out your tongue.,
Center yourself by keeping your legs firmly on the ground.,
Straighten your shoulders to get a good, open posture.,
Rely on your breathing exercises.,
Sip some water right before you begin speaking.",How to Stop Your Voice from Shaking2," Go for a run in the morning or walk around the building before you have to give a speech, perform, or have a tough conversation. Letting go of as much nervous energy as you can will help you with your anxiety. This should also allow you to manage the shakiness.

, Go to the bathroom right before your talk or speech. Stick your tongue out as far as you can, and say a nursery rhyme or one of your tongue twisters with your tongue out. As ridiculous as this feels, it actually opens up your throat. This will make more space for sound in there, providing you with a stronger and louder speaking voice., This is important whether you’re standing or sitting. Place your feet about shoulder-width apart. Keep your feet flat on the ground, and don’t rock, sway, or shift your weight from side to side. This is your power stance. Embrace it., Having slumped shoulders and bad posture will actually make it harder for you to breathe deeply. This means that it’ll be even harder for you to speak clearly and without a shaky voice. Slouching will also make you look nervous, so it’s something to avoid during public speaking for lots of reasons., If you’re feeling nervous as you’re getting ready to start speaking, focus on your breathing. Pretend you have that towel around your waist, and push it out a few times. The oxygen will energize you, while focusing on the exercise will calm your nerves., Bring a water bottle along with you just in case no one gives you water. Getting hydrated will keep your voice clear rather than scratchy and dry. You also don’t want to get dehydrated while you speak, as this could make you feel light-headed."
"
Act confident even if you’re nervous.,
Start strong and open with a smile.,
Speak slowly to keep your audience engaged.,
Raise your voice to let everyone hear you.,
Make eye contact with people in your audience.,
Keep your energy up through the whole speech or chat.,
Pause and sip water if you need a quick break.,
Don’t let mistakes get you down.",How to Stop Your Voice from Shaking3," You know your stuff. Even if you’re nervous, remember that you’ve worked hard to be where you are. Smile, stand up straight, and look people in the eyes. Acting confident can actually make you feel more confident, so fake it ‘til you make it!, Smiling will stretch your face and engage your audience (whether it’s big or just one person) right off the bat. Speak loudly and clearly right away. You can moderate your voice if it sounds too loud, but it’ll be better to start off in a way that lets everyone hear you.Getting a good start may help you feel more confident. The first few words will be the hardest.
If you don’t have a good start, don’t allow that to make you upset or more nervous! Take a sip of water and a deep breath, smile again, and keep going. You’re gonna make it through this.

, You probably want to rush through this speech or conversation to finish it as quickly as you can. Resist the urge! If you move too fast, you’ll lose people’s attention because they won’t be able to understand you.Some people in your audience may be taking notes, and they won’t mind if you speak extra slowly.

, Think about your voice and breathing exercises and project your voice so that it’s loud and clear. Shakiness comes from shallow breaths and nervousness. If you’re taking deep breaths to make your voice loud enough to let everyone in the audience hear you, it should naturally be less shaky.A strong and loud voice will also automatically make you sound more confident, even if there is a slight shake. Remember that the most important thing is for your audience to be able to hear and understand you.

, Don’t look down at your notes more than you absolutely need to in order to remember what you’re saying. Keep your eyes on your audience. This will make you look more confident, and it’ll help you keep your rib cage open for good breathing.If you need to, focus on people’s foreheads rather than their eyes. They won’t be able to tell the difference., This might be tough, because you’ll probably start getting super tired toward the end. You’ve been working so hard to keep your voice strong and steady! Push through to the end and go out with a bang., If you’re feeling nervous, speaking too fast, or are worried the shake is coming back, stop. It’s normal for people to pause during speeches or conversations. Cover it up with a sip of water, breathe, and keep going from there., Everyone (no, really, everyone) makes mistakes. No one is going to judge you if you slip or stumble over a word, or if your voice does start to shake. It may actually make people relate to you, because they’ve been there. Remind yourself that everyone in your audience has been in your position, and keep on going."

Practice Canadian diphthong sounds.,
Keep the Briticisms.,
Say “zed” instead of “zee.” While Americans pronounce the letter “Z” like “zee,” Canadians pronounce it as “zed.” This is due to etymological reasons, since “Z” comes from the original Greek letter “Zeta.”Americans are actually almost the only ones who say “zee.” Canadians, British, Australians, New Zealanders, and most other English-speaking countries pronounce it “zed.”

,
Listen to some examples of Canadian English.,
Use “eh.” One major difference between Canadian English and American English is their use of “eh.” Canadians use this word/sound instead of things like “huh” or “you know.” They also use it to indicate they want someone to repeat or explain something that was just said, instead of other question words like “pardon?” or “excuse me?”For the Canadian pronunciation, “eh” rhymes with “hay.”
A Canadian might say, “The weather is nice, eh?” Whereas an American might say, “The weather is nice, huh?”

,
Learn the slang for Canadian money.,
Practice Canadian greetings.,
Use Canadian food words.,
Study Canadian-specific words.,
Be polite.,
Give personal space when talking.,
Emphasize the phrase “North American.” Many Canadians are quick to point out that US citizens are being exclusionary when they call themselves “Americans,” as Canada (along with nearly two dozen other countries) is also part of the “Americas.”When discussing what something is like in Canada or the United States, many Canadians will say, “In North America…”
Canadians might also tell someone that they are North American, rather than Canadian.

",How to Talk Like a Canadian," Diphthongs are two vowels that combine to make a single sound in one syllable. Canadians typically emphasize a single syllabic vowel sound, rather than moving from one vowel sound into another.In this way, words with an “ou” or “ue” are typically pronounced “oo.” For example, “about” becomes “aboot” and “Tuesday” becomes “Tooz-day.”;
, Canadian English is quite similar to British English in many ways. Some Canadians pronounce the word “avenue” as “avenyew,” which is similar to the British pronunciation. Canadians often say “mum” instead of “mom.” They say “pardon me” more often than “excuse me.”Canadians even maintain the British spelling of many words. For example, “neighbour,” “flavour,” “labour,” “centre,” and “theatre.”
Canadians also use the metric system for most measurements.

,, Try listening to news and culture podcasts from Canadian creators. Watch Canadian movies and television shows.A few examples of movies that provide great examples of Canadian accents include The Shipping News, One Week, and Goin’ Down the Road.Some good Canadian podcasts to listen to for news and entertainment include Canadaland, Ottawhat, Taggart, and Torrens, Never Sleeps Network and The Night Time.
The English Teacher Melanie podcast discusses everyday life in Canada, while also teaching Canadian English lessons.,, Canadians call their one-dollar coins “loonies,” and the two-dollar coins “toonies.” A five dollar bill is often called a “fiver.” And a ten dollar bill is often called a “ten-spot.”The loonie was given this name because of the loon featured on the coin. The toonie is a combination of the words “two” and “loonie.”

, In general, Canadians have very similar greetings to other English-speaking countries. However, they do often run some of the words together so that “How are you doing” often becomes “How ya doin?” And “What are you up to?” becomes “Whadder yup to?”Instead of “How’s it going?” some Canadians say “How’s she bootin’er?”

, Canadians have quite a few variations when it comes to food names. For example, they call Canadian bacon “backbacon.” They call American cheese “processed cheese.” For a Canadian, whole wheat bread is “brown bread.”Canadians call whole milk “homo milk” – short for homogenized milk.
A “double double” is a coffee with two creams and two sugars.
The Canadian word for non-dairy creamer is “whitener.”

, Canadians have a lot of words that they use regularly, but don’t occur in other English-speaking countries. A “toque” (pronounced “tuke”) is a winter hat. A “snowbird” is someone who goes to warmer southern climates during the winter.Canadians call themselves “Canucks.”
Some Canadians call couches “chesterfields.”

, Canadians are well known for their helpful and polite nature. While this may be a based on a stereotype, many studies have shown that Canadians actually are nicer than their American neighbors to the south. If you want to talk like a Canadian, you need to increase your levels of politeness.Always hold the door for people. Smile at people on the street. Apologize if you bump into someone. Avoid overt sarcasm unless you’re speaking to people you know well.

, Canadians are friendly people, but they like their personal space too. Studies have shown that Canadians generally prefer at least 14 inches between themselves and the person they are speaking with.Don’t crowd people or get in too close to their personal space.

Practice listening more than you speak.,
Control your environment.,
Be assertive using communication skills instead of volume.,
Assimilate with the group.,
Breathe from the diaphragm.,
Relax your throat.,
Vary your volume level.,
Enlist the help of someone else.,
Listen to yourself speak.,
Test your hearing.,
Assess your competition.,
Question your motives.",How to Stop Speaking So Loudly," Take the competition out of your conversations by being an active listener. Truly engage with what the other person is saying. Avoid interrupting. Listen to what they are saying instead of thinking about what you want to say next. This way you will not feel the need to raise your voice to be heard over theirs, but can be involved in the conversation on an even playing field., Do your best to change the elements in your environment which may cause you to increase the volume of your voice. The more you can adjust the environment to be ideal to hearing what you are saying, the less need you will feel to speak loudly.Get rid of exterior sounds by closing windows and doors.
Move closer to the person or people you are talking to. The more distance between you and your audience, the more likely you will feel the need to raise your voice to fill the void.
Speak in a small room. Large rooms eat up sound, and you may feel the need to speak up. Choose small rooms for quieter communication.

, Your opinions are valid and deserve to be heard. If you feel that the other person isn’t listening, practice communicating assertively without raising your voice.Meet the other person where they are at. Try to understand where they are coming from and let them know that you get it by saying something like, “I understand you have been under a lot of stress lately,” or, “I know that you are busy right now, so I will be quick.”
Stay positive when you are speaking negatively. Even though you disagree with a person, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you dislike the person. There is certainly no need to disrespect them.
Say “no.” Sometimes it’s as simple as just learning to say, “no.” If there does not seem to be a solution in sight, you can end the conversation and walk away rather than escalating the argument and raising your voice.

, When speaking with a group of people, there is an urge to talk over others, one-up the other people, or hijack the conversation. As people continue to make these mistakes in a group, the entire group will increase in the volume of their speech.Wait for your opportunity to be heard rather than speaking over someone.
Use body language to indicate that you would like to speak. Try raising a finger, nodding, or shaking your head.
When you do have the floor, make your point quickly, before someone else jumps in.

, Place one hand at the top of your stomach and the bottom of your rib cage. Inhale into this area and attempt to make your hand rise using your breath. This will put your breath in the right place rather than pushing speech from your nose, chest or mouth. Forcing breath from these places can be grating and loud.Once you have the breath in your diaphragm, try vocalizing from the place where you are resting your hand.

, Having tension in your neck can lead to trying to force the sound out of your throat. Relax your throat in order to relax your voice. Place one hand on your neck and speak normally to assess the tension in your throat. Drop your jaw as low as you can and take in a large yawn. Release the air slowly with a gentle hum. Repeat this several times until you begin to feel your throat relaxing.
Once your throat is relaxed, continue dropping your jaw, then exhaling with words like “hang, harm, lane and loam.”
Massage your neck throughout this process if you feel it tightening.

, This will help you be heard as well as hearing yourself. Speaking at the same volume, tends to have the effect of the listener tuning the speaker out. This could lead to frustration and tempt the speaker to be even louder. Experiment with varying your volume level. Creating variety in your volume will allow you to be more conscious of your volume and see the effect on your listener.
Try speaking at almost a whisper.
Make your voice quieter until someone asks you to speak up.
Try raising your volume only on the word you would like to emphasize. “That pizza was the BEST!”

, It can be difficult to hear yourself. Ideally you would hire a coach to be an outside ear. They can assess your volume and your needs, then lead you through some exercises which will help you learn how to control your voice. I this is not an option for you at this time, ask a friend to give you feedback.Voice coaches can lead you through some breathing exercises, as well as running through the range of pitch and volume with your voice.
If you are working on your own, ask a friend if they have noticed a difference. Give them permission to point out when you raise your voice. When they do point it out, don’t get angry. Remember that they are trying to help you.

, There are two ways that sound reaches the inner ear, through air and bone. Usually, the sound you hear when you speak is a combination of these two pathways. Some people are more sensitive to one or the other.Listening to a recording of yourself eliminates the bone-conducted sound as there is no vibration from the vocal chords to create this pathway. This is why your voice sounds different when you are listening to a recording of yourself.
Try wearing earplugs to eliminate the sound conducted by air.
Some abnormalities of the inner ear can lead to extra sensitivity of the the bone transfer of sound to the point where you can hear the automatic systems of the body like breathing and moving your eyes.
See if eliminating one of these pathways has a significant effect on your hearing.

, Speaking too loudly can be a sign of hearing loss. Other signs of sensorineural hearing loss are difficulty hearing when there is a lot of background noise, and understanding what people are saying with clarity. If you are experiencing these symptoms, see your physician and get your hearing checked., People in positions of power are often trained to speak loudly and with authority, but it also comes naturally to some who have been assigned or consider themselves to be in a high position of power.Where do you place yourself in rank of power?
What effect is this having on the people around you?
Would it benefit you to reduce your vocal intensity to better communicate on the same level?

, Some people speak loudly because they feel that they are not being heard. Another reaction to this feeling is constantly repeating yourself. If you find yourself doing these things, the cause of speaking loudly could be related to your need to have your thoughts heard."

Work on your tone.,
Speak from diaphragm.,
Know when and when not to speak.,
Increase your vocabulary.,
Always use the correct title when addressing someone.,
Spell words correctly while chatting or posting online.,
Be sincere.,
Avoid laughing or joke inappropriately.",How to Talk in a Mature Manner," Do not talk too loud because it will be taken that you have no proper upbringing. However, do not talk to lightly or it will be taken you are shy. Talk in a medium voice, so the person you are talking to can hear you, but not the person across the room.;
, It is rather hard to explain, but when you talk to not to talk through your nose. Try to talk from your stomach. If you are doing it right, you'll notice that your voice is deeper or more mature sounding.

, Do not interrupt anyone unless it is an emergency. But do offer small talk when can be done. School is always good to talk about to adults. But not the school drama of who likes who. Talk about your ""studies"" and current events.

, However do not use long words just to sound smart. Use words that are synonyms of other words. Such as instead of love say affection and small changes like that.

, For instance, say ""Mr."", for a married or unmarried man, or ""Mrs."" for a married woman. ""Ms."" works for both married or unmarried women.

, Check over a post before you post it to make sure there are no spelling errors.

, Don't fake your manner of speech to impress others.

, If someone is trying to be serious with you, and you try to be humorous, you will not be considered mature.

Read a text out loud at varying speeds.,
Insert words in a passage and read it out loud.,
Practice tongue twisters.,
Try speaking with a pen in your mouth.,
Reduce the use of “filler words” in your speech.",How to Talk Faster1," You can do speed talking drills to improve your ability to speak quickly and clearly. Do this by reading an example passage from a book that contains challenging terms or by using original writing that contains terms you want to get better and faster at saying out loud.Start by reading the text out loud at a normal speed. Then, read the same passage again at a slightly faster speed. Repeat this again, reading the passage at an even faster speed. This can help you get your eyes and mouth to work together at faster speeds.You can also try reading the passage backwards, starting from the end of the passage and moving backwards to the beginning of the passage. This drill will help you get used to reading out loud quickly, as you will not have to pause to take extra time to think about what you are saying out loud.;
, You can also try inserting a word between each word when you read a passage out loud, such as “and” or “the”. For example, the phrase, ""The dog walked down the street"" can be read as ""The and dog and walked and down and the and street and.""Inserting a word between the words in the passage will force you to simply read the text without having to think about what it means, which will then allow you to speak faster. It also gives your speech a certain rhythm and diction that you can then translate to other texts and instances when you have to speak fast.

, Tongue twisters can help you to get better at enunciating your words at a faster pace. They are also good for getting better at flow and clarity as you speak faster.You can use familiar tongue twisters, such as “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers/A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked/If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers/Where’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?”If you struggle with words that begin with a certain letter, such as “j” words, you may want to try a tongue twister that features the letter “j”, such as “James just jostled Jean gently. Jack the jailbird jacked a jeep.”Try to practice three to four different tongue twisters a day, saying them out loud at faster and faster speeds. You may also want to time yourself as you say the tongue twisters so you can track how fast and how well you can say them as you practice them every day.
Tongue twisters are also great warm up tools for when you are about to talk to others and want to speed up your talking speed. Try to repeat one to two tongue twisters to yourself to get used to talking faster once you are around others.

, Though you may look silly to your friends, speaking with a pen or pencil in your mouth can help you improve the clarity and speed of your speech. Hold the pen or pencil horizontally in your mouth between your back teeth. Then, practice reading a passage or text out loud.Try to articulate every word as you read out loud, even if it may be difficult due to the pen. This drill will force your tongue to work harder and allow you to get used to over-articulating your words. You will also develop exaggerated mouth and facial movements, which can allow you to become a more engaging speaker.

, Filler words are terms that you tend to say when you are thinking of what to say next or when you are nervous. Words like “uh”, “um”, “like”, and “you know” do not hold any meaning and will slow you down when you are trying to talk quickly. You should work on reducing or removing these words from your speech.Try to remind yourself not to use “like” or “um” when you speak to others. You may need to get in the habit of pausing for a breath whenever you feel the urge to use these filler words. Over time, you can then fill in the pauses by flowing from one meaningful word to the next, without filler words.
You can also try the rubber band method, where you put a rubber band on your wrist. Every time you say a filler word, you can gently slap your wrist with the rubber band. Over time, you should remember to avoid using filler words for fear of getting a rubber band slap.
Some filler words are redundant and meaningless, leading to greater confusion when you speak to others. Try to avoid filler words like “actually” or “in fact”, such as “The sky was actually blue yesterday” or “In fact, I know the answer.” Removing these terms can make your speech clearer and more concise.

Mentally and physically relax... Tell yourself that you really are going to do fine.,
Stand in front of the mirror and imagine the person in the mirror being someone else.,
Read books out loud.,
Visualize the words you're going to say before you say them.,
When you stutter, try letting out tension in between blocks.,
Get in the right frame of mind.,
Try breathing exercises to make speech easier.,
Try putting some rhythm into your speech.,
If you're making a speech, don't look directly at someone.,
Don't sweat the small stuff.,
Never give up.",How to Stop Stuttering1," When you are worried that you are going to stutter, you make it likelier that you will. Relax both your body and your mind.


Relax your body:
Release the tension in your back, neck and arms. Relax your shoulders; let them sink down to a natural level.
Buzz your lips for a couple seconds before you start speaking. Singers do this sometimes to warm up.
Shake out any tension that you have in your legs and arms. Twist your torso.


Relax your mind:
Tell yourself: ""I am bigger than this stutter; this stutter is not bigger than me!""
Don't tell yourself it's a life or death situation. Stuttering is annoying, but it's not as much of an issue to other people as it probably is to you. Let this thought relax you.
Concentrate your attention inside your head. Gently let your attention drift to the furthest tips of your body, breathing evenly. This can be done as a form of meditation.

;
, Just start talking about anything — how your day went, what you're feeling like, what you're planning on eating later on — and watch your stutter disappear.


Of course, talking in front of the mirror isn't the same thing as talking to another person, but this exercise should give you a good boost of confidence. Remember how well you spoke to yourself in the mirror when preparing to talk to somebody else.
Try speaking to yourself every day for 30 minutes. It might seem weird at first, but the exercise is hearing your voice without the stutter. It'll give you lots of confidence.

, Your charisma skills will be improved. Just read out loud. It's going to be hard at first, but it will teach you how to breathe. One big problem most stutters have is knowing when to breathe while reading or talking while also giving you practice on recovering from stuttering.

, This is hard to master, but it really helps. If you can imagine words, you claim them and it'll be harder for them to slip into a stutter. If you cannot imagine it, they can't be yours. Have a clear mental picture of what you want to say.


If you are stumbling over a particular word, try using a word that has a similar meaning— a synonym. This word might be easier to use and one that you won't slip over.
Try to spell a word out if you stumble over it. You might have to pronounce it very slowly and letter by letter, but at least you'll get the satisfaction of knowing that you pronounced it.
Don't be afraid to pause as you visualize or spell out the letters in the word. We're trained to think of silences as frightening; you have to train yourself to think of the silences as opportunities to ace it.

, Work through stuttering by letting out deep, guttural noises at each block. For example: ""It's s-s-s-s-s-. GRRRRRR It's silly."" Try stopping by saying ""Blah "" or Aa and continue.

, Before you go to talk, get optimistic instead of pessimistic. Often times, the fear of stuttering can cause stuttering itself.Instead of fearing it and expecting it to happen, try to visualize succeeding. This will help you destroy any nervousness you might encounter.

, Often, a stutterer will have trouble breathing while they are stuttering. Getting your speech back could be helped drastically by doing breathing exercises. Try these for more fluency while you speak:


Take a couple of deep breaths before you start speaking. Pretend you're diving down into water and you need to get a couple of deep breaths before you dive. This may ease your breathing and help regulate it. If you're in a social situation and you feel uncomfortable doing this, try to breathe deeply through your nose.
Remember to breathe when you speak and if you stutter. People who stutter often forget to breathe once they begin stuttering. Pause, give yourself some time to breathe, and try to tackle the word or phrase again.
Don't try to set any speed records. There are plenty of fast talkers out there, but the goal is not to speak how they speak. Your goal is to be able to express words and be understood. Learn to speak at a moderate pace. There is no rush here, nor are there competitions on who can out talk the other person.

, People who stutter tend to lose their stutter when they sing, for several reasons: the words they are singing are prolonged, and the voice they use is smooth and delivered easier than normal speech. If you can put a little bit of rhythm into your speech (give it an oratory quality, like Martin Luther King, Jr.) you might find that your stutter has lessened or even gone away.

, Look over people's heads, or at a point in the back of the room. This way, you might not get as nervous and start a chain reaction of stuttering.


If you're talking directly to someone, see if you can make regular eye contact with them. You don't have to stare at them the whole time, but making eye contact with them will put them at ease, which will help you feel more comfortable.

, Understand that you'll make mistakes. But it's not the mistakes that define you. It's how you rebound from the mistakes, how you persevere. Understand that you will probably lose some battles, but that your goal is to win the war.

, Even if people think poorly of you,you can't let their thoughts affect your mind.

Be very rhotic.",How to Speak With an Irish Accent1," Many people, especially Americans, tend to harden their vowels. For example, Americans pronounce the letter A, ""ay""; those with an Irish accent would pronounce it ""ah"" or ""aw."" Be very conscious of this in every word, but especially those vowels that come in the middle.


The standard, ""How are you?"" should be pronounced, ""Ha-ware-ya?"" The ""au"" (in ""how"") and ""oo"" (in ""you"") of the Generalized American accent are not differentiated between.
The sound in ""night,"" ""like,"" and ""I,"" is pronounced similar to ""oi,"" as in ""oil."" Think of ""Ireland"" as ""Oireland.""

While very similar to ""oi,"" it's not the exact same. Turn the 'o' into more of a schwa. The diphthong does not exist in American English and is similar to a compounded, ""Uh, I...""


The schwa sound (the sound of a caveman grunt), as in ""strut,"" varies from dialect to dialect. In the Local accent, the vowel sounds more like ""foot,"" and in the New Dublin accent (popular among youth), it sounds more like ""bit.""The epsilon (as in ""end"") is pronounced like the vowel in ""ash."" ""Any"" becomes ""Annie.""

There are many different Irish dialects with numerous slight variations. Certain rules may not apply to certain dialects.

;
, As a general rule, Americans have gotten lazy in their speech. ""Ladder"" and ""latter"" are pronounced the same in the US, but not to an Irishman. Give each consonant its due (with the exception of the next rule!).


As a beginning sound, /d/ often sounds like /d͡ʒ/ or the sound that a J makes in most variants of English. That is, ""due"" will sound like ""Jew."" As its unvoiced partner, ""t"" becomes ""ch."" ""Tube"" sounds like ""choob.""
There is a distinction between words like ""wine"" and ""whine."" Words with ""wh"" begin with an initial ""h"" sound; try expelling a bit of breath before the word -- the result should be something akin to ""hwine.""
Some Irish accents turn ""think"" and ""that"" into ""tink"" and ""dat,"" respectively. Try ""trowing"" it into your speech sporadically.

, English is full of words that end in -ing, but you wouldn't hear an Irishman admitting it, at least not in a natural context. Whether you're muttering verbs or gerunds, cut it out.


""Morning"" becomes ""mornin."" ""Walking"" becomes ""walkin,"" and so on and so forth. This stays true in all contexts.

In Local Dublin, a poorer dialect, final sounds are eliminated entirely: ""sound"" becomes ""soun,"" for example., For most American English speakers, this is not a problem. But if your dialect is non-rhotic (drops word-final or inter-vocalic R; ""park"" sounds like ""pack""), be conscious of pronouncing every ""r"" -- be it beginning, middle, or end.


Speakers of both American and British English will need to put their 'r' more forward in their mouths than they are used to. Experiment placing your tongue further forward and higher in your mouth while saying words with an 'r' in the middle or end.

Warm up your vocal chords before a presentation or talk.,
Record yourself as you practice the presentation.,
Replace words you find difficult to pronounce.,
Use your hands when you speak.",How to Talk Faster2," You should give yourself ten to fifteen minutes before a presentation to warm up your voice and prepare your vocal chords for some fast talking. You can do this by doing some common warm up vocal exercises, including:Close your lips and force air between them until you make a horse-like noise. Your lips should vibrate together and make neighing sounds or noises. This can help to loosen up the muscles around your mouth.
You can also do face stretches to get the muscles in your face ready for fast talking. Do this by trying to get your mouth, nose, and eyebrows as close together as possible. Then, try to get them as far apart as possible. Stick your tongue out while you do this.

, You can determine how slow you speak by recording yourself talk out loud. You may set up a tape recorder and record yourself as you pretend to present your speech in front of a mirror.Listen to the playback of your presentation and note if you slow down in particular areas of your speech. Focus on speeding up your delivery in these spots the next time you practice the speech.
You should also be on the look out for any filler words, such as “um” or “ah”. Try to remove them the next time you practice the speech. Focus on saying the word before and the word after the spot where you used a filler word so you are not prone to using them.

, You may also notice that you are stumbling over certain words when you read your speech out loud. You should consider replacing terms that are tricky for you with simplified terms or terms that you are more familiar with. This will also allow you to speak faster, as you will not have to consider unfamiliar words when you present your speech.For example, you may replace a term like “utilize” with the more simplified term, “use”. Or, you may replace a more academic phrase like “let me solidify my point” with a more simplified phrase, “let me demonstrate what I mean”.
You may also notice that certain sections of your speech appear wordy or long winded. You may decide to cut out certain words and revise the speech so it is shorter and easier to say. Often, shorter is better for speeches and talks.

, You can also use other parts of your body, like your hands, to help you maintain a steady speaking pace. You may gesture with your hands to highlight a point or walk slowly back and forth across the room to emphasis your speech. Use your hands and your body to help you keep up a certain rhythm and pace to your speech.You should also demonstrate positive body language when you are giving a presentation or a speech. This means maintaining eye contact with your audience and positioning your body to face your audience."

Try not to make the child feel concerned about stuttering.,

Listen patiently to the child without interrupting them.,
Talk with the child about their stutter if they bring it up.,
If your child goes to a speech therapist, talk with the therapist about when to gently correct and when not to.",How to Stop Stuttering2," Parents who express too much concern about their child who stutters risk alienating the child and making him or her feel more self-conscious about the stutter.This will harm the child's progress more than help.

, Putting the child in stressful social situations so that they can learn to be ""comfortable"" will backfire., When a child stutters, let them finish their thoughts without interrupting them and finishing the words for them. Show love and acceptance to them when they stutter.

, If your child wants to talk about it, set aside time to discuss what they might be going through, and to discuss options in treating the stutter. Let your child know that you understand their frustration.

, Listen to any other recommendations the speech therapist might have.

Don't be afraid to see a speech therapist if things are bad.,
Speech therapy may be beneficial in some cases.,
Understand what speech therapists may do.,
Understand that a speech therapist may recommend a support group.",How to Stop Stuttering3," Most stutters will go away after some time, especially if the stutterer is young. Seeing a speech therapist is recommended in some cases, however, especially those cases when the stutterer is depressed or views the stutter as a significant roadblock in their lives.

, There are situations where therapy may be beneficial, and situations where it may not be. Speech therapy can help a child if:


The stuttering itself has lasted more than 6 months
The blocked speech lasts more than several seconds
There is a family history of stuttering
The child is emotionally drained, embarrassed, or depressed about their stutter.

, Speech therapists often put patients through a series of vocal training sessions in an effort to lessen the impact of the stutter on communication, not so much cure the disruptions themselves.Patients then practice these techniques in real life situations.


Speech therapists may wish to talk to parents, teachers, and sometimes even friends in an effort to communicate their techniques and help them understand what the patient is trying to achieve. They do this so that patients receive help and understanding from the people around them when they speak outside the confines of therapy.

, Hundreds of stuttering support groups exist worldwide. A speech therapist, after consulting with a patient, may find it beneficial to try attending a support group, where a person who stutters is less likely to find therapy techniques and more likely to find opportunity to bond with others in a non-threatening environment.

Speak quickly but clearly.,
Repeat the verb in yes/no questions.,
Use the 'after' construction.,
Utilize idioms and colloquialisms.,
Think lyrically.,
Irishmen use some words that are unfamiliar to most Americans.",How to Speak With an Irish Accent2," An Irishman will not be caught saying, ""coulda, woulda, shoulda."" Each sound (unless dropped via a phonemic process) should be given attention. Your tongue and lips will be getting a workout.


If you do have pauses, use ""em"" to fill them. Stay away from ""uh"" or ""um""; ""em"" should be your filler. If you can throw this in naturally and without thinking, your Irishness will be upped ten-fold. It's used all the time -- so when you're thinking of how to pronounce something, you know how to fill the silence.

, Often yes/no questions are straightforward and to the point -- as a result, we answer ""yes"" or ""no."" Seems pretty logical, right? Nope. That's not how it works in the land of Saints and Scholars. When asked, repeat the noun and verb.


For example, ""Are you going to Jane's party tonight?"" --""I am.""
""Does Ireland have unicorns?"" --""It doesn't.""

, The after perfect (AFP), which is one of the most characteristic features of Irish English, has given rise to a certain amount of debate and a great deal of confusion. It is used to denote recency in two situations:


In between the two verbs of the past continuous (again, denotes a recent action): 'Why did you go to the shop?' -- ""I was after running-out of potatoes."" (Do not confuse it with the English use of ""seeking"" or ""searching for"". You are not ""after buying potatoes"" - otherwise you wouldn't be going to the shop).
In between the two verbs of the present continuous (used as an exclamation): ""I'm after performing on the West End!""

, The Irish accent is full of words and phrases unfamiliar to other dialects of English. No one else may know what you're talking about, but sacrifices must be made to be authentic. Soon you'll be cod acting like a bucklepper!Cheers: Not only is this used while clinking glasses, it's used in normal conversation, and consistently. It can be used to thank people and to say hello and goodbye. Work it in often; the Irish certainly do.

Lad: This term describes any male, though usually it's reserved for ones you're closer to. ""Lads"" can refer to a group of males and females, for the record.

C'mere: Literally, this is the same in any other dialect -- ""come here."" But in Irish English, it's an opener that means, ""listen"" or even just ""hey,"" to grab your attention. To begin any innocuous sentence, start it with ""C'mere.""

Right: This sort of serves as an alternative to ""c'mere."" It's multi-purpose and mainly serves to clarify. As in, ""Right, we're meeting at 7 o'clock by the watch tower then?""

Most British colloquialisms are also acceptable. Avoid ""Top of the mornin' to ya!"" and ""Blarney!"" unless you want to be that guy.



, The Irish accent is generally thought of as more 'musical' than American English. It has a definite lilt to it that isn't seen in other variations of the Lingua Franca. Practice phrases a bit more 'sing-songy' than you would in your native dialect.


A good place to start is slightly higher than your natural tone. Get a little lower in the middle of the phrase, and then move back up slightly.

,



Runners: Runners usually refers to Jogging shoes, or Tennis Shoes.

Jumper: Jumper is really plain and simple; a sweater.

Yoke: This one is kind of confusing. Yoke is like when you are trying to say what something is, but you don't know the word for it. ex.: ""You know the yoke that you use to clean the dust off the stand?"" It kind of means something like Thingamajig, or Thingamabob. However it also is a colloquialism for Ecstasy tablets.

Boot: This simply refers to the trunk of a car. ""Put the food in the boot.""

Footpath: A sidewalk.

Ride: A very attractive person of either sex.

Gum Boil/ Mouth Ulcer: A canker sore.

Listen to Irish accents.,
Visit Ireland.,
Buy a book.",How to Speak With an Irish Accent3," Look on YouTube and watch movies and interviews for good examples of what you're trying to emulate. However, beware of impersonators out there -- and there are plenty.


Brad Pitt, Richard Gere, and Tom Cruise are not good examples. Stick to true native speakers; RTÉ is a safe place to start. It is important to note that the northern counties have a quite different accent .

, In the same respect you never truly master a foreign language if you don't live in the country, you will never master an accent if you don't live among the people.


If you go for vacation, do your best to feel out the local flavor. Go to small restaurants and listen to those around you. Make small talk with the vendors on the streets. Hire a native tour guide to show you around. Make your exposure as 24/7 as possible.

, Just as there are American and British English dictionaries, there are Irish dictionaries, too. What's more, resources abound when it comes to sources on colloquialisms and idiosyncrasies of the accent. Invest your time and money into this endeavor if you truly want your accent to shine.


If a dictionary seems a bit much and would just rest on your shelf gathering dust, buy a phrase book. The idioms and figures of speech will help you get into the emerald zone.

Prepare for your introductory speech.,
Create an introduction speech.,
Practice your guest speaker introduction.,
Deliver the introductory speech in a way that commands attention and incites audience interest in the guest speaker.",How to Introduce a Guest Speaker,"


Learn what you can about the speaker you will be introducing. Read any books the speaker may have written, or watch footage of some of the speaker's previous speeches in order to get a good idea of what the speaker is all about.
Research the speech topic. Even if you are not familiar with the guest speaker's area of expertise, you should know enough about the subject of the speech to be able to explain how it is relevant to the speaker. For example, if the speech is about astrophysics, then you should at least be able to explain the guest speaker's contribution to the field.
Find out why this particular guest speaker was invited to speak. Learn of any ties the speaker has to the organization hosting the event, and whether the speaker is an industry leader, a client giving a testimonial or an inspirational speaker.
Interview the guest speaker. Ask a variety of questions, both personal and related to the topic of the speech. You may ask anything that you are comfortable asking, and that you feel will be met well by the speaker. The purpose is to get as much material as possible to personalize your guest speaker introduction.
Ask for a copy of the speaker's standard introduction speech, as well as a short biography that you can draw on for additional material. Be sure to ask how far you may stray from the verbiage of the written introduction provided to you.;
, Use the guest speaker's standard introduction as a template, then incorporate what you learned through your preparation in order to personalize the speech to the circumstances.


When introducing guest speakers, the purpose is to inform the audience of the topic, the topic's relevance to that audience and the speaker's relevance to that topic. Your speech should cover all 3 of those things.
Begin by introducing yourself. State that you are happy to be able to introduce the guest speaker.
Provide the audience with some of the speaker's credentials, achievements and interesting links to the establishment hosting the speaker.
Use humor appropriately. You may draw from the information you gathered to weave some light humor into the speech, but keep the occasion, the audience and the speaker in mind when deciding what is and isn't appropriate. Remember that you are not there to make people laugh, but that you are there to prepare them to receive what the speaker is saying.
Close your speech with a clear announcement of the guest speaker's name. For example, you may say something like, ""Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. I. M. Speaker.""

,


Perform the speech out loud, using a paper copy for reference until you are comfortable reciting it from memory.
Watch yourself in the mirror as you perform and assess your delivery for needed improvements.
Be sure that you are comfortable with the pronunciation of the guest speaker's name. Practice saying the name until it flows from your speech naturally.

,


Use engaging body language. Stand up straight, smile and scan the audience to make eye contact as you speak.
Speak at a comfortable pace that is easy to understand. Pause in between sentences, and for applause or laughter.
Build the audience's enthusiasm when you announce the guest speaker's name. Say the last name more loudly than the first, and emphasize the first syllable of the first name and the last syllable of the last name. Smile and gesture toward the speaker when you say the speaker's name.

, Check at your city's website if they have one.

, While there is often a period for public comment on any topic, councils generally cannot act on anything unless it is on the agenda.


Understand what is being done. Is your council studying and planning, or is it voting on an issue? What will the vote decide?
Read any supporting documents for the agenda item which concerns you. Plans, reports, drafts of ordinances, proposals, and many other documents may be available. Understand what is being proposed and what action may be taken.

,


Be aware of any time limits on comments (typically 2 or 3 minutes), and practice your comments out loud a few times to make sure you can say what you want in the allotted time.
Make notes. You could read from a paper, but be aware that you may sound flat and make little eye contact. You could also make a note card of points and speak from that.
Be prepared to be nervous. Even if you plan and practice well, you may still feel pressure when you are at the podium, with the timer running and the council looking at you. Pre-write your notes if you need to.

, If you're not sure what the procedure is, arrive a little early and ask.


At some council meetings, you may also speak simply by lining up to do so during the comment period. It is usually best to submit a card if you know in advance you plan to speak.

,


Dress appropriately. You need not dress overly formally, but dress more as you might for an office than for the beach. If you are affiliated with a group, and especially if other group members will be present, consider wearing a uniform, t-shirt, or other insignia.
Listen to others' comments on the issue(s) of concern,
Listen to anyone giving a presentation on the issue(s) of concern. Sometimes city staff, engineers, architects, or other direct stakeholders make presentations to explain what is being proposed. Listen carefully.

, If you are confident enough to make changes at this point, it can save scarce time to say that you agree or disagree with previous speaker(s), and would like to add something. It can also help your comments to be on point with what is really at issue.


The simplest adjustment to make is to strike out and omit any part which is no longer relevant or correct.

, Thank whichever person called you, putting their title (mayor, council member) before their last name.

, If you are a member of a group but are speaking for yourself, say so.

, This is the most important part, and the reason you came. Briefly explain your reasoning or describe evidence.


It's ok to be nervous, and to refer to your notes. Do your best to speak clearly, to make eye contact, and to sound human.

,


Conclude when your time is up, whether you have completed your thoughts or not. It's generally all right to finish your sentence or say thank you after the timer goes off, but don't keep going any longer than that.

, If you have additional remarks or supporting materials, or if you can't attend, write it down. Many city councils have an email address, and most should have a city clerk or other staff member present, who can collect printed material for the record. Ask before the meeting if you're not sure what to do with such matter.


If you are submitting photos, graphs, or other supporting material along with your comment, mention it during your comment.
It's best to submit written materials before a meeting, especially if the council will be making a decision on a matter the same day.

Watch some videos and movies where New Jersey accents are available.,
General - South Jersey Accent


There is a slight Southern ""twang"" to the accent in most of southern NJ, which is probably difficult to mimic well without overdoing it.,
Consonants


'D' at the end of the word stops when the tongue hits the palate, although it has become fashionable among some younger people (<30) to emphasize the final 'D' and append a quiet ""uh"" for emphasis, so that, for example, ""I did!"",
Vowels


Long vowels tend to be elongated a bit, similar to a Southern accent, or what most Americans would think a stereotypical English accent sounds like.,
Specific Words


'Water' is usually pronounced something like ""wooder"" (wood'-er) or ""wudder"".,
Expressions


""Pert'near"" has almost disappeared, but it's still heard from time to time and means ""pretty near,"" i.e., nearly or almost.",How to Speak With a Convincing New Jersey Accent," If it's a ""South Jersey"" accent you're after, good luck finding a genuine one in a movie!;
, There are also inexplicable pockets of strong southern accents mixed with the regular South Jersey accent in virtually every southern county of NJ.

, sounds a lot like ""I did-uh!""
The 'R' is hard. Think of saying the pirate ""Arrrr!"" Make the 'R' that hard, but don't elongate it.
'T' at the end of the word also stops when the tongue hits the palate. In northern NJ, there may be a slight hiss after the ending 'T' so that ""it"" sounds almost like ""its"", but not in the south. As with the final 'D', younger people also sometimes stress the final 'T' and append a quiet ""uh"" for emphasis, e.g., ""I did it-uh!"".

, Short vowels are unremarkable, except for 'A'.
Long 'A': Think 'eh-ee' smoothly blended together; somewhat English-sounding.
Short 'A': Before 'M', 'N' or 'S', usually sounds something like ""aya"", so that the noun ""can"" (as in ""tin can"") sounds something like ""cayan"" and ""fast"" sounds like ""fayast""; however, if you're saying ""I can,"" the 'A' is much shorter and flatter (""I kan""), while ""can't"" reverts back to ""cayan't"". When preceding other consonants, the short 'A' is usually short and flat (map, cat, etc.).
Long 'E': Unremarkable.
Long 'I': Think ""ah-ee"" smoothly blended together (often very English-sounding).
Long 'O': Think of a stereotypical English 'O' -- the mouth starts in a more open ""eh"" position and sort of closes to an ""oo"" sound at the end.
Long 'U': Unremarkable.

, Saying ""wooder"" or ""wudder"" will definitely make you sound South Jersey.
'Log', 'fog', 'hog', 'bog', etc. are most commonly pronounced like 'dog' (e.g., 'lawg').
About 50% of South Jerseyans pronounce 'roof' and 'hoof' with the same vowel sound as 'put', and many give 'root' the same pronunciation. The other 50% will say those same words -- except for ""hoof"" -- with the same vowel sound as ""moo"".
'Push' and 'pull' occasionally sound more like 'poosh' and 'pool', but this pronunciation is dying out and is rarely heard in people born after the 1950s.

, ""I pert'near fell when I slipped on the ice!""
A funny one is ""Jeet?"" which is easily understood by everyone in the greater Delaware Valley area, but can confuse people from the West Coast. It means, of course, ""Did you eat?""

Use a joke.,
Change your tone.,
Stop and start.",How to Master the Segue in Public Speaking," Sure, it might be the oldest trick in the book, but it still works. A carefully selected bit of humor can easily transition your audience from one topic to the next – even if those topics seem completely unrelated.;
, This segue style is effective if the tone or mood of the two topics are dramatically different. For example, if you were presenting a problem (or bad news), and now you’ll present the solution (or the good news). It might sound something like this: ""OK, we’ve covered the dismal reality of last year’s final numbers but enough doom and gloom – let’s now look at the bright future that we are in the process of creating.""

, Perhaps the easiest way to transition is to simply let the audience know that this section is complete, and ask if there are any questions before we move into the next topic. ""That concludes the technical part of today’s demonstration. Are there any questions before we begin talking about sales strategies?""

Your answer to this question should be the guiding principle for compiling your report. In order to inform, explain, and maybe even convince your audience, you need to be well versed in the topic you’re presenting on.


Initially, you just want to familiarize yourself with the topic.
Since you’re giving an oral report, you need material to help keep your listeners engaged, and most Wikipedia articles do a great job of including both the important facts and the tantalizing points of interest.;
, Take note of the facts and concepts that interest you or otherwise stand out. If you ever find yourself surprised by something you read while researching, make a point of referencing it in your report. Note that the footnotes of Wikipedia articles can provide you with a slew of citable sources, making your time spent researching especially fruitful.Double check any sources you're unsure of or intend to rely upon heavily.

, Ask yourself what more you need to know to make a convincing point. This will help guide your specific search queries.More specifically, use Google Scholar to bring in some peer-reviewed, academically scientifically articles.


Most of the content generated by Google Scholar will be firsthand research publications, which are the strongest form of reference there is.
Don’t fall for the temptation to pepper your audience with as much info as you can fit into the presentation.
Emphasize the one or two key elements of your presentation, and include further material only insofar as it supports those points.

, While researching for the specific content you’ll share with your audience, think about who you’re giving the report to. The audience – whether your fellow grade school classmates or a few other PhD candidates at your university – will have backgrounds and knowledge relevant to how you’ll structure your report.In particular, think about what a good entry point to the content of your report may be, considering your audience.
Write down three different opening points, based on what will generate the interest of those you’re speaking to.

, It can be tempting to try to win your audience over as soon as you begin speaking. Instead of leading with your best stuff, save it until after you’ve gotten everyone listening. To do this, introduce yourself, and the topic of your report in a few sentences. Articulate your specific objective in giving the report, and explain to your audience how you’ll achieve this objective.For instance: “Hello, my name is __________, and today I’ll be talking about __________. My intention is to you ____________. I will do so by first _______, then ________, and wrapping up with _________.”

, Throughout your report, maintain the logical flow that you outline in your introduction. In simplest terms, make sure there’s a clear beginning, middle, and end. Emphasize your key points whenever possible; in fact, you should rarely, if ever, digress from material that directly contributes to your objective of driving home one or two main points.If you encounter a roadblock when organizing your material, think about what approach will most likely be understood by your audience.
In general, address your simplest and most basic arguments first, and then move into your more complex arguments.

, Throughout your report, you’ll address specific supporting material that will culminate in a convincing presentation of your main points. As you develop the conclusion, be sure to explicitly restate your main points. Thank the audience for the their time, and welcome any questions they might have., As you encounter sources you know you’ll use, immediately add them to a running list, perhaps with its own file. As you put the list together, use whatever format your teacher or professor prefers. The end of the report is usually the best place to include your references, and you do not necessarily need to actually reference your sources out loud.You should verbally cite your sources if you followed their reasoning closely or if your report was based mostly on one or two sources.

, Even if you do not intend to use notecards while giving your report, make some to help you condense the material you hope to cover and to help you practice giving your report. Paraphrase your key points and write them in bullet format. Reducing your points into bullet points will ensure you memorize the supporting material as you practice, and will be able to give the report while looking at your audience.


Summarize subsidiary points into one word, if possible. This will ensure you do not forget them, but will also not be sidetracked by focusing too much on a tangential point.
Include hard facts and statistics in your notecards too, especially numerical data, as it is beneficial to have these on hand for immediate reference.

, Though it may feel as though more material means more support, more material may also increase the chances that your audience will lose track of your main point. The more concise you are, the more clear your report will be. Further, too much material risks running over your allotted time and increases the chances you lose track of your train of thought while giving your report.Save nuanced dialogue for a question and answer session, if one will be allowed. Hint at controversial or otherwise commonly contended points, and anticipate addressing at least one additional response to such a challenge if it is raised.

, If there’s one thing that will improve the quality of your report, it’s plenty of practice giving the report. A great benchmark to shoot for while practicing is the ability to give the entire report without looking at your notes.While practicing, stick to the material you’ve included – tangents are confusing for the audience and will eat your time more quickly than you realize.

, Especially if giving oral reports is a new experience for you, timing yourself can help prevent certain bad habits by reassuring you that you’re on track. Incorporate any visuals into your practice regimen, in part because they will help you stay on track and maintain your timing.As an example, a 10-minute oral report should be practiced to the point you can give it in 9 to 9.5 minutes.
With such a time allotment, spend a maximum of 1 minute on your introduction, with 7 to 7.5 minutes on the body of your report, and 1 to 1.5 minutes left to conclude.

, Less is almost always better than more in the realm of visuals. While some material certainly requires appropriate charts and graphs, these – especially – should also be used infrequently.Keep your number of visuals below the number of minutes in your presentation. For longer presentations, keep the number of visuals well under one per minute.


Include visuals based solely on their ability to support what you’re saying verbally with either emphasis or hard data that provides objective proof.
Do not read or describe a visual unless you wish to explicitly over-emphasize the point.
In the visuals that you do include, default towards simplicity. If you’re including a graph, for instance, only plot the data and include the labels necessary to make your point.

, While accounting for what your audience can be expected to already be familiar with, make sure to only cover necessary information. Over-explaining simple concepts is a sure fire way to lose an audience’s interest, and this is the stuff that can usually be cut down to size while editing the amount of content in your report. Further, people’s attention spans are objectively limited.For a scripted oral presentation, know that a 10-minute presentation will likely run from 900 to 1200 words.

, Record and listen or video record and view yourself giving your report. This will remind you of anything you may still need to work on. Watch for opportunities to adjust content, as well as signs of any potential bad habits – you’ll be better able to break these habits after witnessing them for yourself., There are several physical components of giving a great oral report. Foremost among them, you must look at your audience! Maintain general eye contact by scanning from person to person. Use hand gestures while making especially important points, but take care not to wave your hands around the whole time you’re speaking.Make sure your body language reflects engagement and enthusiasm by standing up straight and holding still, though comfortably so.
Another benefit of making eye contact is that this allows you to gauge your audience. If faces are starting to go blank: slow down, speak more loudly, and give more illustrative examples of the points you’re making.

, Understand that’s totally okay to feel nervous about giving an oral report. Remind yourself that you’re prepared, rehearsed, and organized – all that’s left is to share it with the audience. Take a few deep breaths before taking the podium and picture yourself nailing it as you prepare to begin.If you’re nervous, you may wind up speaking too quickly or too softly without thinking about it. Stay aware of your voice and the speed with which you’re speaking.
Smile. Not only will this help engage your audience, it’ll help calm you down!

, Don’t forget to hammer your key points in the conclusion to drive them home. A great way to do this is slowing down as you build up to your closing statements, and pause immediately before and after the key points – this will allow you to collect yourself, and allow your audience to absorb the information you’re hoping to convey."

You wonder if you’re saying the right thing. If your point is getting across. If you sound intelligent enough.


Before engaging in any form of public speaking, learn about your audience. If you are giving a presentation you should be able to do this easily. Think about why you are speaking and where you are speaking. Then go through a checklist.
Try to be able to answer as to the size of the audience, age, gender, education (experience and socioeconomic level), religion, friendliness, and if the audience knows about you. You can remember this as an acronym, SAGE RFK. Being able to fill in those blanks will help you form a speech that you will feel comfortable giving. The type of audience will affect how you speak.;
, Negative thoughts associated with the task of public speaking can hinder your ability to present the amazing speech and knowledge you have inside you. Instead of letting negative thoughts prevail, turn those thoughts into positive ones.


If you feel nervous or scared you probably also have nervous thoughts about what might go wrong. Having such thoughts will alter your voice and your body language negatively.
Instead of harboring bad feelings and letting negative thoughts fester, remember to think positively. Positive thoughts will make you excited, allow you to relax, and give you confidence. Instead of thinking about how you wish you didn’t have to speak, reframe your thoughts and give yourself a pep talk. You might say to yourself “Wow! I get to share my knowledge on a subject I’m passionate about with all these wonderful people who want to hear what I have to say!”
View the chance to speak as a compliment. And know, that in most cases, the people who are listening to you are there for you. These people want to hear what you have to say.

, Silences can feel awkward, especially when you’re standing in front of a lot of people who are staring at you and waiting for you to say something. But silences are a chance to breathe and collect your thoughts. Make speaking a choice. It’s not something you have to do because you’re standing in front of a bunch of people. It’s something you choose to do when you’re ready.
Learning to feel ok with silence will help you take your time when speaking publicly. You don’t want to rush your speech. Silences will always feel longer to you than to those not speaking. Just smile and gather yourself but never take too long. If what you speak is good enough, the audience will not mind some silence.
Use silence to notice your breathing and stay calm. You can also use silence to let a particular point sink in. If you are speaking and want something you just said to really sink into your audience, silence is a great way to allow that to happen before you move on. Silence is your friend, not your enemy.

, Understanding how you speak when you’re just having a casual conversation will allow you to improve your public speaking skills. Pay attention to all the filler words you say in any given conversation. These words are the noises and words you say when you are processing your thoughts and don’t know what to say next. Words and sounds like “Ah,” “Um,” “Like,” “Er.” Getting more comfortable with silence can help you reduce filler words.
We also have default speech settings which have become automatic to us over the course of our lives. For example, if someone sneezes, you might say “Bless you.” These behaviors exist in public speaking as well. Identify what behaviors you have, both verbal and nonverbal. Which ones make you look nervous or not authoritative?
Once you identify what your behaviors are you can begin to correct these habits.
Perhaps you adjust your glasses when you’re nervous. Or pick your fingernails. Maybe you use more filler words.
To help you change these habits, learn to be aware of what you’re doing in all settings. Even if you’re talking to a friend on the phone, be cognizant of what you are doing. When you realize you are doing something, make an effort to stop.

, Spend time putting your speech together so that when you give it, it flows naturally and feels normal to you. Being familiar with the content will greatly reduce stress. View your public speaking like a play. If you don’t learn your lines you won’t be able to act and engage your audience. When an actor doesn’t know her lines, the audience is always aware.
The more you prepare the less you have to worry about when speaking publicly. If it helps you prepare, create a character. You don't have to be just you. Take on a stage persona. If you're introverted, create a character who is extroverted and play that character when speaking. Plan everything that you can so that when it’s time to speak all you have to do is focus on your speech. Not only should you know your speech inside and out, you should plan everything from what you’ll eat to what you’ll wear.
Plan your outfit a day ahead. When it’s time to get ready, you don’t have to worry. Plan what and when you’ll eat. If you know you get nervous and not hungry before speaking, then plan to eat a few hours earlier.

, You don’t have to write out your whole speech. But you should have some sort of outline that works for you.


While your speech should be pretty much memorized, having an outline will let you reference something to make sure that you’re hitting all the points you need to.
An outline will help you develop a natural flow to your speech. You won’t have to panic if you forget what your next point was because you can look at your outline.
You should also include the thesis, or main point, of your speech. Like in an essay paper, having a clear thesis that you will back up is a great help. Your thesis will inform you and your audience of what you will talk about. It will also show the audience that you are prepared and knowledgeable.
You may get sidetracked during a speech depending on the forum you’re in. Having an outline and really knowing your material will allow you to easily transition and get back on track.

, Rehearsing your speech and taking notes on how you speak, the tenor of your voice, body language, and other factors will allow you to speak with confidence. Then watch yourself and take notes on how you sound and look. Make necessary adjustments.


Just like for any athlete or artist, practice is a key component to success. When practicing your speech, go a little slow to really digest what you are saying and how you are coming across. When you give your actual speech in public you’ll probably have the tendency to speak faster than normal. But practice can help you keep a good tempo. Practicing will also help you memorize and feel prepared. When it’s time to speak publicly, you’ll know that you could do your speech in your sleep.

, Breathing is a key component in delivering a great speech. Your breath and the oxygen you allow to enter your body will keep you calm and focused. Smiling makes you happy and water keeps you energized. When you smile, you feel better.


When you allow yourself to take a moment to breathe you can slow your heart rate and process what you are doing and saying. When we get nervous we often take shorter more shallow breaths. This kind of breathing doesn’t allow us to get as much oxygen and can cloud our thoughts.
Long, steady breaths will help you keep a clear head and a calm body. Additionally, smile. Smiling triggers endorphins in our brains which make us happy. Make sure to stay hydrated as well. When you’re dehydrated you can’t think as clearly and can become tired much more easily.

, If you know that you’re speaking in the morning, plan to get a full night’s rest. Then, once you wake up feeling refreshed and energized, put on your outfit which you already planned to wear.


Do whatever you need to do that relaxes you and allows you to get a good night’s sleep. Exercise, watch a movie, read. Try to get eight hours of sleep so you wake up feeling refreshed.
Plan your outfit beforehand so all you have to do is put it on. You should wear something that gives you confidence and makes you feel amazing. Whether it’s that great suit that makes you feel like you can take on the world or that classy dress that fits your body perfectly and gives you confidence. Dress well and appropriately, but wear something that you feel great in. When you feel great about how you look, your confidence will soar.

, Before you give your speech you should properly warm up both your voice and your body.


Do some stretches to get your body loose so you don’t feel and look stiff when speaking.
Warm up your vocal chords with some signing drills like moving through your vocal range. Start as low as you can go and then move up through your register to your highest note. Then go back down and repeat.
Try a few diction exercises and tongue twisters to warm up your mouth and loosen your jaw. , Even if you are speaking to people who know you, introducing yourself is a great way to ease into any speech and warm up the audience.


Your introduction can be as simple as stating your name and who you are. Explain why you’re speaking today.
You can also be more casual if the environment allows. Start with a quick anecdote about something that happened to you and relate it to your topic if you can. A story or a joke is a great ice breaker.
An introduction is a great way to get the crowd on your side and engaged before you start speaking. It will also help you stay relaxed. You want your audience to feel comfortable around you.

, Then briefly, outline the parts of your speech.


Having a thesis to provide the audience will inform everyone on your topic. It will also show the audience that you are prepared.
Move on to briefly outline the rest of your speech. This shows that you aren’t taking the crowd for granted and informs everyone that there will be an end. Audiences like to know that at some point you’ll stop talking. This will keep the audience more engaged, rather than zoning out early.
Stating your outline also helps you to go over it one more time before you dive into speech.

, Look your audience in the eye, and use facial and hand expressions. Whatever your topic, remember that your speech isn’t boring, and you shouldn’t be either.


Look your audience members in the eye. Focus on someone and make eye contact for a sentence or two. Doing this shows your audience that you are speaking to the audience, not at the audience. Making eye contact can also help you stay calm. Focusing on one person at a time and treating it like a conversation instead of speaking to a large group might feel more comfortable to you.
Your body language is just as important and your words. If you stand still and are stiff, you’ll come off as boring and nervous. If you wave your arms too much or move around a lot, you can also look frantic and nervous. Stand straight and remember your nervous habits. Feel free to move around when you transition to a new thought. Walk at a steady pace and mirror your pace with your talking speed.

, Diction is invaluable with public speaking. You need to be heard. If the audience can’t understand you, people will start tuning out quickly.


Make sure that you speak slowly and loudly enough so everyone can hear. Don’t overdo it, but you should finish each word completely before speaking the next one.
Remembering to breathe and allow silences to happen will help you with this.
Pay attention to the cadence of your voice. You don’t want to be a monotone robot. Feel free to be a little excited or speak a little softer to help convey a certain mood.

, Your audience will have an energy as will you. If your’s is nervous, the audience will sense that. Don’t follow the energy of the audience, lead it.


Your speech and body language should inform the audience of the kind of energy you need for your speech. You’re passionate about your topic and know it so well that you get to speak about it. Use that energy to lead the audience.
Remember to think positively and smile. This kind of good energetic energy will affect your audience, and as a result, will return to you.

, Refer to your outline when you need it. But don’t look down and read from it.


With all your practicing and engaging the audience, you shouldn’t need to look down and read from your outline. But you might want to check it from time to time to make sure you’ve hit all the important points.
If you’re speaking at a podium, you can leave your outline there. When speaking, feel free to step away from the podium. You can also use your outline as an anchor spot. This anchor is a safe place you can always go back to. Take a breath, let what you said sink in, and check to make sure you’re on track.

, Great public speakers are those who are clearly having fun doing it. You should feel proud that you get to share your knowledge and that people want to hear what you have to say.


When you conclude your speech, you might want to summarize your main points and reiterate your thesis.
Make sure to thank your audience for listening to you and being a great audience. Then ask if anyone has any questions.
Before you go into your speech, you may want to write down some questions you’ve had about your topic, ones you’ve heard before, or any you think might get asked. Be able to answer these. Answering questions shouldn’t be hard since you know your topic so well.
If no one asks a question right away, show that you’re an experienced speaker by saying that people usually ask a certain question. Then use one of the questions you wrote down.

Know what an impromptu speech is.,
Be prepared.,
Start with the easy and obvious if it makes it easier to start, e.g.,
Relate to and connect with your audience.,
Remember that you don't have to accept the premise on which you're invited to speak.,
Avoid making statements, even in jest, which compromise your principles.,
Use humour in proportion to your skill, Better a short and heartfelt speech than one laced with tasteless jokes that fall flat.

,
Use your three points, or an ending, moral or exhortation (also known as a ""call to action"") to draw together the threads of what you have said.",How to Give Impromptu Speeches," By definition, impromptu speeches happen without warning, but the very nature of your initial invitation (before the impromptu invitation) may give you a chance to think ahead. There are three common impromptu speeches: birthdays, toasts, and ""vote of thanks"".;
, Even impromptu speeches rarely come with no warning. Even if you only have 2-3 minutes, write 3 points on the back of a napkin, written large, so you can read it while standing. You should feel you can confidently speak on each point for at least one minute, from experience. If not, you have picked the wrong three points.

, ""I'm glad we're all gathered here today, even if Gillian did spring this speech thing on me...""

, Make it relevant. A builder talking to doctors may seem to have little common ground, until you point out that both professions have to deal with problems and people, e.g. ""You know, we have a lot in common. Every day I'm dealing with troublesome inanimate objects which I call carpentry but you call patients."" ""And there is nothing more satisfying than fixing some slippery sucker with a nail gun."" The audience has now warmed to your theme!

, Or, you might spend 2 minutes exploring it and 2 minutes debunking it.

, In a moment a tweet, video or other medium can send your statement viral. A reputation takes years to earn and milliseconds to burn.

,, Return to acknowledge the audience, organisation, or key person/s at the event. If you have contrasted your experience with that of the audience, allow yourself to come of ""just-so"" slightly worse, as this humility will endear you to your audience. You want to finish with a bang, not a whimper and sometimes speeches have a ""natural stop point"" even if this leaves some things unsaid.

"
Throw the net as wide as possible when searching for a speaker.,
Choose a speaker based on their overall fit.,
Good writing does not necessarily a good speaker make.,
Be holistic in your search for a speaker (don't base your search on price alone).,
If you are a not-for-profit charity trying to raise funds see if the speaker will work with you on price (some will and some will not), but don't try to negotiate price based upon your charitable mission with the speaker and then have an expensive dinner at an expensive venue!

,
Don't get caught up in the name.",How to Hire an Inspirational Speaker,"


Look in your own organization.
Think about community leaders
Think about excellent speakers whom you have heard and would like to bring to your membership.
Ask colleagues and friends to recommend a speaker.
Check with your local Toastmasters club and Chamber of Commerce.
Don't just look locally to save travel expenses, but don't overlook local talent either.
Check out the web sites in the Sources and Citations section below. All three of the organizations provide free listings (and sell upgraded listings) to speakers who would like to hear from you. None of the organizations charge you for their services, although one does require you to register.
Check out LinkedIn Groups. There are several Groups of speakers on LinkedIn eager to hear from you.
If your budget allows and you are looking for a big name speaker, consider contacting one of the Speakers Bureaus who represent well known speakers.
Alternatively, you might consider hiring a speaker-consultant-on-call who can help you.;
, Think beyond just the theme of your event. While any speaker worth their salt will work to customize the presentation to fit your theme in one way or another, you deserve more than that. You want your attendees to walk away from the session saying “What a great speaker!.”

, Interview your speaker before making a decision.

, Don’t let price, budget, name, or even topic dictate your search. Look for the right speaker and if they are a fit, try to negotiate the expenses into the fee.

,, Name-recognition speakers are expensive, and sadly there are only a handful of great name-recognition speakers out there accepting dates. Finding a ‘silver bullet’ speaker is rare (great name, great story, great speaker, great message, actually accept engagements). Nearly without exception, one of the things on that list has to be sacrificed. Quite often name-recognition is a contra-indication of speaking skills. It’s a short list! You can save $10k - $20k by hiring a no-name speaker with the right stuff. For well-spoken, engaging, name-recognition speakers, consider those who are famous for a profession that requires giving speeches (e.g.,politicians & activists)..

Remove stubborn, stuck-on tape with a hairdryer.,
Wash any residue using water, vinegar, and soap.,
Consider using a magic eraser to remove any residue.",How to Remove Double Sided Tape1," Plug your hairdryer into the nearest power outlet and turn it on to a medium or high setting. Hold the hairdryer a few inches away from the tape and let the hot air blow over it, focusing on the edges and corners. This will cause the glue to soften. After a few minutes, set the hairdryer aside and try to pick at one of the corners of the tape with your fingernail. Most of the tape should come off, but you may need to take the hairdryer to it again.








If you have very short fingernails, or don't want to ruin a nice manicure, then use a butter knife or pallet instead.
If you still have a thin film of residue, you can buff the surface with a scouring pad soaked with warm, soapy water. Avoid using oil or oil-based commercial cleansers.;
, Mix 2 cups (275 milliliters) of water with ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of vinegar and a few drops of liquid soap. Dip a sponge into this solution, then scrub the affected area on your wall or door using small, circular motions. This cleansing solution is mild and should not remove most paint; however, you might see some fading.







, Dampen the magic eraser with water, and buff the affected area with it until the residue is all gone. Magic erasers are mildly abrasive, which makes them unsuitable for glass and highly-polished surfaces, but they are safe for walls and doors; you may see some mild fading, however.









You can purchase magic erasers in the detergent section of a supermarket or hardware store.

Get an English ruler.,
Learn the inch marks.,
Learn the 1/2 inch marks.,
Learn the 1/4 of an inch marks.,
Learn the 1/8 of an inch marks.,
Learn the 1/16 of an inch marks.",How to Read a Ruler1," You will know it is an English ruler because it will have 12 lines that denote inches on the ruler. 12 inches equals 1 foot (0.3 m). The 1 foot (0.3 m) is broken down into inches. Each inch is broken down into 15 smaller marks, equaling 16 marks in total for each inch on the ruler.The longer the line on the surface of the ruler, the bigger the measurement is. Ranging from 1 inch to 1/16 of an inch, the lines decrease in size as the unit of measurement does.
Make sure you read the ruler from left to right. If you are measuring something, align it with the left side of the ruler. The place where the object ends on the right will be its measurement in inches.;
, A ruler is made up of 12 inch marks. These are typically the numbered marks on the ruler and are denoted by the longest lines on the ruler. For example, if you need to measure a nail, place one end directly on the left side of the ruler. If it ends directly above the long line next to the large number 5, then the nail is 5 inches long.Some rulers will also denote 1/2 inches with numbers, so make sure you are using the largest numbers with the longest lines as your inch markers.

, The 1/2 inch marks will be the second longest lines on the ruler, half as long as the inch marks. Each 1/2 inch mark will come midway between each inch number because it is half of an inch. This means that marks directly between the 0 and 1 inch, 1 and 2 inches, 2 and 3 inches, and so on across the ruler, are the 1/2 inch marks. In total, there are 24 of these marks on a ruler.For example, place the ruler against a pencil with the eraser at the far left of the ruler. Mark where the tip of the pencil lead ends on the ruler. If the pencil point ends at the shorter line halfway between the 4 and 5 inches marks, then your pencil is 4 and 1/2 inches long.

, halfway in between each 1/2 inch line, there will be a smaller line that denotes a 1/4 of an inch. In the first inch, these marks will mark 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1 inch. Although the 1/2 inch and 1 inch marks have their own lines, they are still part of the 1/4 of an inch measurements because 2/4 of an inch equals half an inch and 4/4 of an inch equals 1 inch. There are a total of 48 of these marks on a ruler.For example, if you measure a carrot and the tip falls on the line halfway between the 6 1/2 and 7 inch lines, the carrot is 6 and 3/4 inches long.

, The 1/8 of an inch marks are the smaller marks found directly in between the 1/4 of an inch marks on the ruler. Between 0 and 1 inch, there are marks that denote 1/8, 1/4 (or 2/8), 3/8, 1/2 (or 4/8), 5/8, 6/8 (or 3/4), 7/8, and 1 (or 8/8) of an inch. In total, there are 96 of these marks on a ruler.For example, you measure a piece of fabric and the edge falls on the 6th line after the 4 inch mark, which is directly in between the 1/4 of an inch mark and the 1/2 inch mark. This means that your fabric is 4 and 3/8 inches long.

, The small lines halfway between each 1/8 of an inch denote 1/16 of an inch. These are also the smallest lines on the ruler. The very first line on the left hand side of the ruler is the 1/16 of an inch mark. Between 0 and 1 inch, there are marks that denote 1/16, 2/16 (or 1/8), 3/16, 4/16 (or 1/4), 5/16, 6/16 (or 3/8), 7/16, 8/16 (or 1/2), 9/16, 10/16 (or 5/8), 11/16, 12/16 (3/4), 13/16, 14/16 (or 7/8), 15/16, 16/16 (or 1) of an inch. There are a total of 192 of these lines on the ruler.For example, you measure a flower stem and the end of the stem falls on the 11th line after the 5 inch mark. The flower stem is 5 and 11/16 inches long.
Not every ruler will have the 1/16 inch mark. If you plan on measuring things that are small or you need to be extremely accurate, make sure the ruler you use has these marks.

"
Start with an expression of gratitude.,
Talk about your esteem for the people honoring you.,
Tell a funny or poignant story.,
Mention the names of people who helped you.,
End it on a high note.",How to Give a Thank You Speech2," Right off the bat, you can start by saying thank you for the award or honor you're receiving. An acknowledgement of why you're giving the speech is the most natural way to start. Your expression of gratitude will set the tone for the rest of your speech. As you decide exactly what you want to say, take the following factors into account:The type of honor you're receiving. To give thanks for an award or professional honor, say something like ""I'm so honored to be here tonight, and grateful to be the recipient of this award.""
The formality of the event. If it's a more casual event, like an anniversary party thrown by your friends and family, your expression of thanks can be a bit warmer. For example, you could say ""I can't express how grateful I am to have all of you here with us tonight.""

, This gives you an opportunity to go a little deeper and make the people who are responsible for giving you award feel good. Whether you're being honored by your company, another organization or people you know well, take few minutes to express your sincere regard for them.


If you're being honored by your company, talk about the great work the organization does, and what it pleasure it is to work there.
If you're receiving an award from an outside party, like an arts organization awarding you for a film you directed, talk about how honored you are to be recognized by such a great organization.
If you're giving a speech to thank friends and family for honoring you, say a few words about what a special group of people you're lucky to have in your life.

, In a thank you speech, it's charming to tell an anecdote or two about something that happened leading up to the honor you're receiving. Since thank you speeches are often given at dinners and festive events, saying something to keep the mood light and bring smiles to people's faces will be appreciated.


You could tell a story about a funny mishap that happened during a big project you worked on, or an obstacle you had to overcome to accomplish your goals.
Try to bring other people into the story, too, instead of just talking about yourself. Talk about something that involves your coworkers, your boss, your kids, or other people in the audience.

, It's nice to give credit to the people whose support helped you accomplish something worth honoring. Create a short list of colleagues, friends, and family members without whose help you wouldn't be receiving this honor.You can introduce the list by saying, ""I'm especially grateful to a few amazing people whose support is the reason I'm up here right now."" Then recite the list of people who helped you.
Take the audience into consideration, too. If you know your boss will be sitting in the front row, you might want to make sure you thank him/her.
This part of thank you speeches can often get tedious. Don't leave anyone important off of your list, but don't list everyone you know, either. Keep it limited to people who actually helped you.

, When you finish listing people you want to thank, the speech is just about over. End it by saying thanks once more, and repeating how sincerely grateful you are. If you want your speech to be especially memorable, you could consider including an additional flourish. For example,


Say something inspirational. If you're accepting an award for achievements you made for the nonprofit you work for, you could say, ""Our work is far from over, but what we've accomplished together has made a difference in hundreds of people's lives. Let's roll up our sleeves and continue this journey with more dedication than ever. If we've made this much progress in just one year, think what we can do in three.""
Dedicate the honor. You can give special appreciation to a loved one or mentor by dedicating your award to that person. Say something like, ""And lastly, I want to dedicate this award to my mother. When my teachers told her they thought my dyslexia would prevent me from ever learning to read, she scoffed and told them I'd be a brilliant writer one day. It's because of her faith in me that I'm up here today accepting my first Pulitzer. I love you, mom.""

Write out your notes.,
Time yourself.,
Practice in front of someone who makes you nervous.,
Replace filler words with pauses.,
Work on looking and sounding natural.",How to Give a Thank You Speech3," A thank you speech should be fairly short, and you may be able to memorize it. However, having a note card or piece of paper with a general outline will help you make all your main points and remember all the names you want to mention.


Don't write out the speech word for word. When you deliver it, you'll be looking down at the paper the whole time instead of addressing the audience. You'll come off as nervous and stiff instead of sincerely grateful.
Try writing out just the first line of each paragraph you want to say. Then, when you glance down at your card, that first line will jog your memory.

, If you're giving the speech at a formal award ceremony, there may be a designated time limit for the acceptance speeches. Ask the organization responsible for giving the awards whether there are any guidelines you should take into account. If you aren't given a time limit, see if you can find out how long other people who've received awards from the organization took for their speeches.As a general rule acceptance speeches are very short. Acceptance speeches for Academy Awards, for example, are limited to 45 seconds or less. Going over two or three minutes is going to end up boring people, so no matter what, aim to keep it to the point.
When you practice your speech, set a timer to see how long it takes. You might want to record yourself so you can listen to the speech and identify parts you can shave off if your speech is too long. The most essential part of the speech is the expression of gratitude; the rest can be lopped if necessary.

, If you're not much for public speaking, try giving your speech to a person or group of people who make your stomach erupt with butterflies. Practice giving the speech four or five times, or as many times as it takes to be able to deliver it without your heart beating fast and your breath quickening. That way, when it's time to give it to your real audience, you'll be less likely to get stage fright.


Solicit feedback from the people listening to your speech. Ask them which parts drag on too long, or if there's anything you didn't say that should be included.
Make sure you deliver the speech to at least one person you trust to give you totally honest feedback.

, Most people naturally fill in awkward moments with ""um,"" ""uh"" or ""like."" Train yourself to eliminate these words from your speech. Instead of using a filler word, just pause and be silent for a moment. Your speech will end up sounding poignant and well rehearsed, rather than thrown together.


To help yourself eliminate the filler words, listen to a recording of yourself talking. Try to catch the spots where you tend to fill in the blank with ""um"" or ""uh."" Practice saying those lines without filler until you're able to deliver the whole speech that way.

, Helping your audience feel the depth of your gratitude is the whole point of a thank you speech, and it's very hard to make that happen if you seem stiff, or worse, arrogant or ungrateful. Practice doing the things you'd normal do during a conversation: gesturing a bit with your hands, smiling, pausing and laughing. Make sure the way you inflect your words conveys the emotion you're feeling.

"
"
Calm your nerves right before the speech.,
Make eye contact with audience members.Remember not too look down at your note cards too much; just glance at them now and then to remind yourself of what you want to say.,
Remember your gratitude as you're talking.,
Say thoughtful words that could make people emotional and feel like ""Oh this person is so thoughtful and sweet."",
Leave the stage on cue.",How to Give a Thank You Speech4," If you tend to get the jitters right before you speak in public, take some time beforehand to calm yourself down. For some people, those nerves don't go away no matter how many times they have to speak in public. Luckily, there are some tried and true methods you can use to prepare yourself to speak clearly and calmly:


Try visualizing yourself delivering the speech without stumbling. Deliver the whole thing in your head without a hiccup. This technique can help you feel less anxious when it comes to the real thing.
Some people find it helps to laugh heartily before giving a speech. It puts you in a more relaxed mood.
If you have the opportunity to do some vigorous exercise before the event, that's another great way to release nervous energy.

, Pick two or three different people in the audience, seated in different areas, and make eye contact with them in rotation as you're talking.


Making eye contact will help you deliver the speech with more feeling. You can pretend like you're giving it to a friend, rather than a faceless crowd of people.
Rotating between more than one person is important. When you look at more than one spot in the audience, the whole group will feel more included in what you're saying.

, You might be so worried about forgetting part of your speech that you forget the reason why you're up there giving it. Think about the meaning behind your words as you say them, and deliver your speech with the true emotions you feel about the honor you're receiving. Think about the hard work you did to earn the award, and all the people who helped you along the way. If you do this, your speech will come off as sincere.


If it's possible to look at the people you're thanking as you say their names, try to do so. For example, if you're thanking a colleague who's sitting in the first row, your gratitude will be more apparent if you're able to focus on her while you're talking.
Don't be embarrassed if you tear up a little. It happens all the time during thank you speeches.

, Saying different kinds of words will matter.

, When your speech is complete, smile at the audience and leave the stage when you're supposed to. Hogging the stage for extra time is a classic move during acceptance speeches, but it tends to bore the audience and leaves less time for the next person up for an award. After your allotted time is up, graciously leave the stage and return to your seat.

Gather your supplies.,
Try to remove tape as much as possible.,
Spray the tape with window cleaner.,
Buff the soaked area with a sponge using small, circular motions.,
Consider using oil and a glass-safe scrubbing sponge.,
Clean the glass with some rubbing alcohol.",How to Remove Double Sided Tape2," If you have some double sided tape stuck to your window, you cannot use heat or you will risk cracking the glass. You also can't use anything too abrasive, or you will risk scratching the glass. Instead, you will need to dissolve the tape using oil. Here is a list of what you will need:


Butter knife (you can also use your fingernail)
Window cleaner
Sponge and glass scrub
Cooking oil or cleaning oil (mineral oil, Goo Gone, etc)
Rubbing alcohol

, You can do this by picking at one of the corners with your fingernail. You can also use a butter knife or pallet knife, but take care so that you do not scratch the glass.








, If you do not have any window cleaner, you can make your own by mixing together 2 cups (275 milliliters) of water, ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of vinegar, and a few drops of liquid soap.







, This will help dislodge some of the stuck-on residue. If your sponge has two sides (a soft side and an abrasive side) try using the scratchy side.








, If the glass cleaner or vinegar solution did not remove the tape, you will need to saturate it with some cooking oil (such as olive oil) or a cleaning oil (such as Goo Gone or Goof Off). Spray the oil onto the affected area and buff it with the sponge until there is no more residue.








, Soak a soft cloth with rubbing alcohol and rub it until you have removed all tape and oil residue.









If there is still some tape left, buff it again with a glass-safe scrubbing sponge soaked in oil, and then clean it again using rubbing alcohol. The rubbing oil will get rid of the oil residue and evaporate, leaving no marks.

"
"
Use a hairdryer to remove tape from paper.,
Try some commercial residue cleaning products.,
Consider using some food-grade oil.,
Try some acetone or nail polish remover on unpainted surfaces.,
Use rubbing alcohol on plastic.,
Try using masking tape to peel double sided off.Tear off a piece of masking tape and press it down firmly onto the top of the double sided tape; be sure to keep a firm grip onto one corner of the masking tape.",How to Remove Double Sided Tape3," Plug in the hairdryer and turn it on. Using a medium or high heat setting, aim the nozzle at the tape and blow on it. After a few minutes, try to pry the tape off of the surface using your fingernail. This is especially effective on paper.








Use caution when working with photographs, as the heat may damage them.

, Many products, such as Goo Gone and Goof Off, can effectively remove double sided tape, but they can also damage plastic surfaces. If you choose to use one of these products on plastic, keep this in mind. Simply pour some of the product over the tape and let it soak for a few minutes, then pull the tape off. If the tape doesn't come off, then try scrubbing it with a scratchy sponge until it does. The chemicals in the fluid will have dissolved the sticky adhesive on the tape.









This will be most effective on glass. Avoid using this on paper, cardboard, and fabrics as you will risk staining them.

, It will work similar to commercial products, such as Goo Gone and Goof Off, but it won't contain any harmful chemicals, making it safer to use on sensitive surfaces such as plastic. Simply pour some oil onto the affected area and let it sit for a few minutes, then scrub it with a scouring pad.









Do not use oil on paper, cardboard, and fabric surfaces, because it will stain them.

, This will dissolve the adhesive in the tape, making it easier to remove. Like alcohol, it evaporates and leaves behind no residue. Unfortunately, it will also dissolve any paint and finishes as well, so may not be the best product to use on plastic or painted surfaces. Simply pour some acetone or nail polish remover onto the tape and let it soak for a few minutes before peeling the tape off. This will be the most effective on fabrics, as it won't stain.









This may work on paper and cardboard, but it may also cause the paper to warp and become wrinkled (as with any other liquid).
If you are using nail polish remover, try to use a basic one, without additives, such as vitamins and strengthening properties. Also, try to avoid colored nail polish removers, as they may stain your surface.

, It will work just like acetone, but it is not as harsh; this means that it is less likely to remove paint or mar finishes. It also means that you may still see some residue and will have to scrub the left-over adhesive with a scouring pad. This will be effective on fabric surfaces.








, Slowly pull the masking tape towards you; it should also pull the double sided tape along with it.









You can also use duct tape or scotch tape as well.

Use oil to remove residue from plastic and glass.,
Try using acetone on glass.,
Use rubbing alcohol to remove residue from any surface.,
Try using a mixture of vinegar, water, and dish soap.,
Try rubbing the area with your finger or eraser.",How to Remove Double Sided Tape4," You can use a cooking oil, such as olive oil, mineral oil, or a cleaning oil, such as Goo Gone or Goof Off. Soak a cotton ball with some oil and rub it over the surface until the residue is gone. Soak another cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and rub it over the surface to clean off any oily residue.


If you are working on a large area and the surface is horizontal, you can pour some of the oil over the affected area and let it sit for a few minutes.
Do not use oil on unfinished wood or walls. It will soak into the surface and stain it.

, Do not use acetone on painted surfaces, finished surfaces, or plastic. It will remove paint and can melt certain types of plastic. For light residue, soak a cotton ball with some acetone and rub it over the residue until it is all gone. For heavy residue, fill a spray bottle with some acetone and spray it over the affected area; let it sit for a few minutes before wiping it off until the residue is gone.


This method can be combined with the oil method.
Acetone is safe on most fabrics, but test it in an inconspicuous area first; it may cause some fabric dyes to bleed.

, It is safe to use on walls, plastic, finished and unfinished wood, fabric, and glass; it should not remove paint and finishes, but it may cause some fading. A higher percentage, such as 90%, will be the most effective, but for painted surfaces you may want to use a lower percentage, such as 70%.


For smooth surfaces, soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and buff the affected area until the residue is gone.
For rougher surfaces, use a towel or cloth instead; this will prevent any fuzz from getting caught in the texture.
If the residue is really bad, fill a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol and saturate the area. Leave the rubbing alcohol on the affected area for a few minutes, then wipe it off using a cloth or towel.

, Mix one part vinegar with eight parts water. Add a drop or two of dish soap and mix. Saturate the residue with the mixture and let it sit for a few minutes. Wipe the residue off using a paper or cloth towel. This should be safe to use on most surfaces, but it may cause some fading or staining on certain wall surfaces.

, Some light residue can simply be rubbed away. The area may look a little dull; if this happens, simply wipe it clean with some rubbing alcohol.

Get a metric ruler.,
Learn the centimeter marks.,
Learn the 1/2 of a centimeter marks.,
Learn the millimeter marks.",How to Read a Ruler2," A metric ruler uses the metric system, which measures in centimeters instead of inches. There should be 30 centimeters on the ruler, which are designated by large numbers on the ruler. Between each centimeter (cm) mark, there should be 10 smaller marks called millimeters (mm).


Make sure you read the ruler from left to right. If you are measuring an object, align it with the left side of the ruler. The place where the object ends on the right will be its measurement in centimeters.
Unlike with the English ruler, the measurements for the metric ruler are written in decimals instead of fractions. For example, 1/2 a centimeter is written as 0.5 cm. , The large numbers next to the longest lines on the ruler denote the centimeter marks. A metric ruler has 30 of these marks. For example, place the bottom of a crayon on the far left side of the ruler to measure it. Note where the tip falls. If the crayon ends directly on the long line next to the large number 14, your crayon is exactly 14cm long., halfway between each centimeter, there is a slightly shorter line that denotes 1/2 of a centimeter, or 0.5cm. There are a total of 60 of these marks on the ruler.For example, you measure a button and the edge ends on the fifth line right between the 1 and 2 centimeter marks. Your button is 1.5cm long.

, Between each 0.5cm line, there are four additional lines that denote the millimeter marks. There are a total of 10 lines per centimeter, with the 0.5cm line acting as the 5 millimeter mark, making each centimeter 10mm long. There are 300 millimeter marks on the ruler.For example, if you measure a piece of paper and it ends on the 7th mark between the 24 and 25 centimeter mark, it means your object is 247mm, or 24.7cm, long.

Practice in front of small groups of supportive friends.,
Spend more time practicing your intro.,
Film your practice sessions.,
Check out the space in advance.,
Talk with a therapist.",How to Give a Speech Without Getting Nervous1," Gather a group of people together who you trust to give you solid, constructive feedback. Be sure to invite in people you know who have a background in public speaking. Give your speech in front of them and then leave time afterwards for questions and comments. Repeat this process with new groups of people and then compare the comments that you’ve received. Make any necessary adjustments and continue practicing.Think about people you know who have to give speeches or presentations on a regular basis. Ask them for their input and advice as you prepare.
Practicing in this way will also help you to become desensitized when speaking in front of groups of people. Do it often enough and it will become habit and nothing to worry about.
You can also join a local group, such as Toastmasters, to work on your skills. Or, you can even take a public speaking course at a local college or recreation center.;
, For every time that you practice your speech, run through your introductory section just one more time. Really concentrate on getting comfortable with the first 30-60 seconds of your talk. Go over the intro in your mind each night before bed. This will make it less likely that you’ll stumble over it during the final talk.Expect that your anxiety level will drop significantly after you’ve completed your introductory remarks and this will help you to relax for the rest of your talk.

, Get a small camera and go find a room that is similar to the one that you’ll be speaking in. Set up your camera and record yourself giving your full speech. Try to recreate the final scenario as closely as possible, minus the audience. It even helps if you dress the part. Then, go back home and review the tape to see where you can improve.For example, you may find that you speak way too fast at the start of your speech. This is fixable by simply concentrating on slowing down early on.

, Try to gain access to the space that you will be using for your speech. Being familiar with the room will make you more comfortable for your final talk. Walk around the room and take a seat to get an audience member’s perspective. Go to the front and check out whether you’ll have a podium to use and if any of the set-up needs to be adjusted for height or movement.It is especially important that you check out the technology, such as the computer and projection screens, to make sure that they are functioning properly and compatible with any equipment that you’ll bring along.If you cannot look at the space well beforehand, try to arrive a little early for your speech and check everything out at that time.

, If you find that you are crippled by your nerves in front of audiences, you might want to make an appointment to meet with a therapist. You can work together to decide if you are suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD), which may require both therapy and a medicated approach. A therapist might also put you in touch with a support group.If social anxiety is not an issue, a therapist can also help you overcome a phobia of public speaking. A therapist or speech pathologist may also be able to work on treating public-speaking-induced speech disorders, if you suspect you suffer from such a problem.

Ask them what subjects, if any, they would like you to discuss in particular. They can also give you some insight regarding who will be attending the event.


You can also express your reservations to the toastee if you would like to participate, but are too nervous to do so. Just because you are asked to give a toast does not mean you have to, especially if you suffer from social anxiety.;
, Find out when you will be asked to speak and who will be going directly before you, if there will be a series of toasts. If you are giving a spontaneous toast then you don’t need to worry about order and will instead want to look for a good time when you can get everyone’s attention.


Rehearsal dinner toasts are usually informal with the hosts generally addressing everyone followed by anyone else who wishes to jump in. At a wedding the best man and maid of honor offer the first toasts followed by the bride and groom. The parents then have a chance followed by any of the guests.At a casual dinner party it is best to wait until the dinner or first course plates are collected before you offer a toast., Short toasts are the best toasts. A wedding toast should last for right around 3 minutes. If you hit 5 minutes, you have gone too long. It is best to keep a dinner party toast at a minute or less. You want to keep your audience curious for more, not begging you to wrap up., Make sure that both the content and how you deliver the toast suits the occasion. It is okay to make a few jokes, but watch including anything too lewd. It’s also a good idea to avoid cursing unless you want to risk offending random attendees.If you are really worried, run your toast by the bride or groom to gauge their reaction and ask for feedback.
It is hard to establish a clear line for lewd humor, but most people find discussing sex or the wedding night to be in poor taste., Toasting practices vary across cultures, so if you are planning on giving a toast at an unfamiliar locale you may want to research the norms beforehand. Even the placement of your glass matters as in China you try to keep your rim lower than others in order to show deference and respect., Spend some time in front of a mirror going through your toast in advance. If you will be speaking in front of a larger audience, try your toast out before a few of guests in advance. Watch for their reactions as you speak to know what you need to keep and what you should cut.Practicing will also help you to learn to moderate the volume of your voice. Nothing is worse than a mumbled or inaudible toast., If you practice your toast enough, you will eventually be able to set aside your notes and speak directly from memory. You should anticipate speaking about 100 words per minute in a standard toast. If you mess up a part during the actual event, keep going as if nothing happened and (most likely) no one know the difference., Don’t be the speaker who opens their toast by apologizing for what they don’t know or what they won’t say. This sets a poor tone for the whole thing. Instead, be confident and seize the moment. Tell the audience what you do know and why that matters.Instead of saying, “I don’t know Jerry very well, but here goes nothing,” you might try, “Those times when Jerry and I can hang out are action-packed and adventure-filled.”

, It can be really tempting to use your toast as an opportunity to show everyone how close you are with the toastee. However, this can backfire and make your audience feel less connected to what you are saying. Instead, try to bring everyone together by relating stories that touch on subjects that all people can relate to like friendship, love, or family., If you are nervous, take a few deep calming breaths before standing up to speak. Repeat to yourself, “I can do this,” and then do it. Resist the urge to use alcohol to relax beforehand and this can have horrible consequences when public speaking., Before you begin to speak you’ll need to get the attention of your audience. It is best to stand up and say something similar to, “I’d like to give a toast.” This announces your intentions and people will look toward you out of curiosity. Remain standing as you start to speak and raise your glass as well.The old practice of tapping your glass with a knife has now gone by the wayside. A series of glass-tapping toasts can quickly get annoying at a big event. Instead, get attention with a confident voice and consistent eye contact., Open with a funny or intriguing tidbit about the subject of your toast. Don’t over-promise, but don’t provide too many details at this point either.Make your first few lines about the toastee, not you. Avoid using, “I” or “me/my,” to keep your focus, and that of your audience, on the person or persons of the hour., After your opening sentence, it is a good idea to give 1-2 lines about your background and relationship to the toastee. Keep this information brief, tailored to the event, and humorous. You’ll also want to give your audience enough background so that they will be able to follow any stories that you provide.You might say, ""I'm the groom's brother and football watching buddy.""

, You’ll want to add in at least one, perhaps a few more, fleshed out stories as the centerpiece of your toast. These stories should be personal, but not intimate or overly embarrassing. They should explain to your audience why the person is worth toasting to begin with.For example, you might tell the story about the time that you and your brother (the groom) backpacked through Europe.

, Make your listeners experience the story along with you by replacing boring descriptors with lively ones. The mud is the story wasn’t just stinky, it was rancid. The situation wasn't just concerning, it was dire. Play off of as many of the senses as you can., No one wants to listen to a depressing or high-handed toast. Be flattering to all parties involved. Find something nice to say, even if you don’t know them that well. Minimize the teasing and instead stick to general humor. If you are doubting including a particular moment, trust your initial instincts and leave it out.Leave out all mentions of exes, especially in a wedding toast. No one wants to listen to a story about a prior relationship when they are trying to celebrate a new one.Omit all negative jokes or jabs about the state of marriage. These remarks are generally cliché and bring the mood of the party down as well., The best toasts are the ones that are almost interactive in nature. If you know audience members, call out to them when you can. Ask them to back you up with a quick, “Am I right?” You can also foreshadow your stories by warning the audience members involved with a quick, “Stan, this story is about you buddy!”, Some people try to be so funny during their toast that it comes off as insincere and forced. Instead, try to intermix laughs with heartfelt emotions. Let your audience know how you truly feel about the object of your toast., At the end of your toast, signal that you are done by thanking the audience, your hosts, and/or the object of your toast. Offer heartfelt congratulations or a brief wish of well-being. Request that everyone else join you in these sentiments, lift your glass, and then take a sip.A solid concluding line for a wedding toast is always, ““Ladies and gentlemen, to the couple.”"

Smaller tape dispensers may not have a spindle. You should see a plastic core (or roller) with the empty cardboard tape roll surrounding it; remove both of these from the dispenser.;
, Slide the empty tape roll off its spindle, and discard it. If the empty roll is cardboard, it can probably go in with your paper recycling.

, Remove a new, full roll of tape from the box. Check the box to make sure you've got the correct size for your dispenser.

, Hold the full roll so that when you pull the tape, the strip of tape will unwind across the top of the roll. The sticky side of the tape will be facing down, toward the floor. (If you are holding it the wrong way, the tape will extend away from you, as it pulls from the underside of the roll; the sticky side of the tape strip will be facing upwards, toward the ceiling.)

, Slide new roll of tape onto the tape dispenser spindle from either direction; most rollers will fit into the dispenser either way.

, Hold the spindle so that the paper tab on the end of the roll is facing up and toward the front of the dispenser. Slide the spindle and the new full roll of tape back into dispenser. Settle it into its holding grooves so that it moves freely.

, Hold onto the paper tab at the end of the tape, and pull it towards the cutting edge at the end of the dispenser. Pull the tape over the sharp edge, and pull down on the tape to cut off the colored tab.

Make a leaf stamp.,
Sew on fabric.,
Add scents.",How to Make Stationery," For your own stationary, you will need to get certain kinds of paper to give it a special look, and handle any decorations you come up with. Look for high-quality typewriter paper or specially designated craft paper. You should be able to find some at craft stores, and even some office supply stores., Before doing any work on paper, or later decorations, make sure you have an area to work. Find somewhere with plenty of space for you to operate and place all of your supplies within easy reach.If you are using chemicals, even things like glue and paint that can get over valuables or other items, make sure you cover your workspace with newspaper to prevent them from getting all over other things.
If you are using chemicals with a particularly strong odor, or don’t have a well-ventilated area inside, consider going outside, or at least into a place like a garage. Just be careful not to let chemicals like paint onto the ground, and be prepared for wind that may blow your materials around.

, If you are going to include specific writing on your stationary, you may want to print it directly on to the paper. This can be helpful if you have a lot of text, or are making a lot of stationary. Typing and printing will help fit the text on your paper, make sure it fits, and give you a more consistent look.


If you are printing, make sure your printer is able to handle the paper you intend to use for your stationary. If not, you may consider getting your notes printed through an outside printer, or using different paper.This can be a good step for something like a wedding invitation, where you have a lot of information that needs to be included, and a long list of people who need to receive it.

, If you are going to add outside materials like paint, stamps, or other things, consider giving your paper some treatment so they are better prepared to paint and other liquids from leaking through paper and ruining any text on the inside. Spray a fixative to prevent smudging, like Krylon, over the outside, and let it dry before doing other decoration work.Another way to treat the paper before adding decoration is to soak it in coffee to give it an aged or vintage look. Brew a pot of coffee or black tea, then let your paper soak in it. Remove once the paper is a shade or two lighter than you would like it to be, then hang to let it dry., One simple and classy addition to your own stationary is the addition of letters, such as your initials, or maybe just the first letter of your first or last name. Using a linoleum block, you can make a nice stamp with your initials. You should be able to find all the tools for this stamp in a craft store.Sketch out your monogram or design it in a word-processing program.
Trace a pencil over your printed monogram, then lay it face down on a linoleum block.
Scribble over the block to transfer those pencil lines to the block.
Use a linoleum knife to cut the shape into the block (deep, but not all the way through), then cut the monogram out of the block to create a stamp.

, Placing a picture or photograph on the front of a card can make more personal, especially if the picture has some meaning to both you and the recipient. Print out a picture of your choosing, and glue it to the front of a card.Your picture can be on any type of paper you would like, though you may want to avoid high quality glossy photo paper, especially if you are making a lot of cards, as it can be quite expensive.
You can also add the look of a frame to your pictures by cutting out some colored paper and placing that underneath your picture. Different colors or adding more than one border gives you some flexibility in designs. Just make sure your picture doesn’t take up the entire front of your card so there is room for the border.

, Using bright green leaves you can find in nature, you can add a natural look to paper. Place the leaf on your paper with a lightweight white paper towel on top. Gently hammer the spot where the leaf is until you see the green soak through the paper towel. Pull off the towel, gentle remove the leaf from the paper, and let it dry.There are many different leaves out there which will give you many different kinds of greens. Go ahead and experiment with different types until you get a shade and shape that you like.

, To add a touch of color, you can add small squares of fabric to the front of your cards. Cut out a square of fabric, making sure it is not bigger than your actual card. Stich it to the card using sewing machine or sewing by hand.This will probably give you a bunch of cards that all look slightly different, rather than being uniform, unless you have a lot of some kind of fabric. This can also be a good way to get rid of excess fabric without just throwing it away.

, You can also add some slight scents to make your card stand out and be a pleasant surprise for the recipient. Take some cotton pads, and add a few drops of a scent you like, such as scented oils or perfume. Put the cotton pads at the bottom of a plastic container, then cover the pads with a piece of cardstock. Spread your stationary on top of the cardstock and close the top for 24 hours. You can repeat by adding more oil to the cotton pads to get a stronger scent.The cardstock is important because you don’t want the oils to get directly on your paper and damage it. All you want is the smell, not the liquid.

Choose your paper type.,
Select your stationery style.,
Examine the envelope.",How to Personalize Stationery1," If you visit your local office supplies store or a specialty arts and crafts shop, you’ll soon discover that there are several different types of paper to choose from. Your paper selection can convey a particular personality or feeling, which is part of the fun in creating your own stationery!


Text paper or copy paper comes in white and a variety of colors and is the typical paper used for a home or work printer.
Cardstock is heavier and more durable than regular text paper and comes in a wide variety of colors, textures, and finishes.Felt-weave and linen paper can be found in most office supplies stores.It is thicker than regular text paper, and its mild texture offers a unique, sophisticated feel.;
, You may think of stationery as just a simple sheet of paper, but it can come in various sizes and be presented in a variety of ways for both social and business situations! Think about how you wish to use your personalized stationery and select the style or styles that best suit your needs.


Letter sheets and monarch sheets are used for writing lengthy personal or business letters.Correspondence cards are about 4 by 6 inches and are most frequently used as thank-you notes, congratulatory notes, and condolence cards.Fold-over notes are commonly used as thank-you notes, too. The handwriting goes inside the card on the bottom portion so that the text can be read upon opening., When creating your stationery, it is also important to think about the envelope size. Be sure to select a size that will properly house your stationery type, be it for a business letter or a thank-you card. The return address is typically presented on the back-flap of the envelope and is a nice feature to work with while designing your stationery.

Focus on a spot behind the audience.",How to Give a Speech Without Getting Nervous2," Learn as much as you can about your topic, whether by reading additional books or talking with experts. The more that you know about your topic, the less likely you are to stumble talking about it. If you do stumble, you will be better equipped to improvise or fill in content until you find your place again. You’ll also be more prepared to answer questions, if needed.Just be careful that you don’t get overconfident and stray too far off of your prepared script. This can have the effect of making you seem even more nervous and frazzled.

If you get a choice of topic, choose one that will hold your interest and that you think is important. If you feel your nerves increasing, then think about how significant your message is, regardless of whether or not you make a few mistakes., When you practice and immediately before you take the stage, think about how your ideal presentation would go.

You might even say, “You can do this!” Or, “I can’t wait to tell everyone about this!”Some people even find that repeating, “Yes!,” over and over again works wonders to decrease nerves.Take a deep breath and then think of your favorite speaker. Perhaps envision Abraham Lincoln giving a battlefield speech. Be inspired by their poise and try to emulate this as you take the stage.Remember, though, not every speech will go exactly as visualized, and that is alright. The purpose of this exercise is to help bolster confidence. You cannot and should not expect to predict an audience's response.

, Invite your friends, family, and colleagues to attend your presentation. Before you start speaking, look to see where these friendly faces are sitting. You can also arrive a bit early to your talk and get to know the audience a bit. Then, you can even reference these persons by name during your presentation.If you find yourself freezing up, locate a friendly face and then focus your stare right above them. Hold this position as you continue to talk. Move on whenever you feel your nerves lessening.

, Everyone makes mistakes, but not every mistake is noticeable to others. If you stumble over a word, correct yourself quickly and keep going. If you leave out a part of your presentation, make a quick decision whether to circle back or continue. Try not to draw attention to your own errors.If you make an error, don't apologize. No one but you knows your speech! Just keep going, and save apologies for off-stage
Remind yourself that no one is expecting you to give a flawless speech. In fact, audiences often find small stumbles and other signs of being human relatable and even endearing. Try not to panic if you stumble. Instead, just focus on your recovery.

, As you take the stage, find a focal point just above the heads of the last audience row. Continue to look at that point until you feel yourself relaxing. Then, slowly let your gaze slide across the room until you locate another brief focal point.

Work off some energy before your speech.,
Keep your breathing even and controlled.,
Dress to fit the occasion.,
Maintain confident body language.",How to Give a Speech Without Getting Nervous3," If you try to contain all of your body’s nervous energy, then you may find yourself jittering on the stage. Instead, take a quick walk before your presentation. Or, do a few toe flexes or even jumping jacks. Release that excess energy and your body will calm down., Make sure that you are taking deep breaths both before, and during, your speech. You might even think, “in” and “out” and you inhale and exhale. If you find yourself holding your breath, then let it out slowly and continue speaking. Use pauses in your presentation as an opportunity to reset your breathing.You may also want to do a quick body scan. Close your eyes, breathe in deeply, and focus on any areas where you feel yourself tensing your muscles. Take a deep breath in, and try to soften the tension as you exhale., Talk with the organizer for your speech or the teacher for your class and discuss the dress code with them. As you’ll be a center of attention, you want to dress the same, or even nicer, than your audience. You can also consider your clothing as your armor and try to visualize feeling stronger when you put on your speech outfit.


Try your outfit on before you give your speech to make sure everything fits well and that you feel comfortable. This helps prevent awkward adjusting during your speech.

, Keep your back straight and stand up as tall as you can. Pull your shoulders back and avoid hunching over. Dip your chin to check your notes, if needed, but then keep your head raised up.Watch out for jittery behaviors, such as tapping your fingers or twirling a pen. Practicing a good deal will help you to spot these actions and work on eliminating them prior to your final speech."

Use proper modulation.",How to Give a Speech on Deforestation," If you know only the basic principles of deforestation, your speech will be boring.


As it is an informative speech, research properly and get your facts right. It is very embarrassing if you make a mistake in your speech and the audience realizes it.
Talk to people who know about the topic. People provide more realistic and practical versions of the topic compared to the internet. However, be careful of their opinions influencing your speech.
While researching, get the data right. You do not want to say that Bhutan has a biocapacity deficit when it actually has a biocapacity reserve.;
, It might be humiliating to get confused between the ecological footprint and the carbon footprint of a nation.


Make sure that you explain the terms, as you want people who know practically nothing about deforestation to understand you.
If you are not sure about a particular term when you are speaking, do not use it! It will save you the embarrassment of getting it wrong.

, Dive into the research, going beyond what most people know (that industry is bad for the environment). Speak about the causes in a precise and a specific way.


Talk about all the different causes. Do not say 'Trees are cut to make furniture and build houses,' which will make your speech look like it was borrowed from a six year old's textbook.
Know all the different causes, like civil strife, commercial crops and so on.

, You can tell that tall trees in groups attract rain clouds, and thus, forests encourage rainfall.


Make your speech professional, and not sloppy.
Talk about how trees are home to a number of species, and that destroying forests destroys their habitat, and that this will result in those species' extinction, which will throw the ecosystem off balance.
Also speak about the number of tribes living in forests. Forests are their home, and we are wiping out their homes.

, Reforestation is a solution, but you have to elaborate on how it can be done.


Use examples of countries. Explain how Canada introduced the net zero effect, which is literally picking up trees and planting them in another area. Many isolated trees were put together in this way.
Take examples from people such as Wangari Maathai who started the Green Belt Movement in Kenya and encouraged even uneducated people to plant trees and how Kenya's ecological footprint decreased after this.

, Divide your speech into parts, and create bullet points under each part.


Do not include too much content, as then, it will make the speech long and boring. You want your speech to be crisp, yet deliver the point properly.
This is the first draft, and when writing the final speech, you can elaborate on the points.

, Your introduction should pull the listener into your speech. If your introduction is weak, it will act as a successful sleep-inducer.


Do not say 'deforestation is a problem and we have to overcome it. I will explain the causes and the solutions.' This sounds like the intro to a Wikipedia article. Articles and speeches are not the same.
Instead, say ' We all know that deforestation is the decrease of forest cover, but how many of us know the actual bitter truth? Do we know that by destroying forests, we are ravaging our future?' This makes the speech sound more interesting.

, Do not elaborate excessively on each cause, but give a basic idea. Use examples of different countries for causes that are less known.


Never say 'Deforestation has many causes. They are...'! Speak in crisp sentences like, 'Trees were cut for many reasons, even when the human race was just beginning. But today, we call it deforestation as it is happening on a large scale. Trees are being cut to create space to house the ever increasing population and to feed that astronomical number of people. When there is a civil strife, trees are often the victims, like in Cambodia...'

, A statement like 'The world is ours and we have to save it. Trees are like our parents, and we have to save them..' comes across as too ideal, and does not sound practical.


Instead, outline the different benefits of reforestation, like creating employment in replanting trees, creating forest cover encourages rainfall, reduces carbon footprint, reduces global warming, increases biocapacity and so on. Also talk about the various challenges to reforestation.

, Make your conclusion precise and clear, and reassure the audience that all is not lost, and we can still save trees.


Refrain from the standard sentences like 'Let us join our hands and make a better world', which are cliche, and fail to give the proper effect.

, Make sure that all the facts are correct, and get the sources of information ready, and confirm that they are authentic. Especially if this speech is an assignment, the teacher may ask for the sources.


Also check your grammar and word choice. Bad grammar doesn't do much except irritate the audience. Instead of using phrases like 'really important', use 'crucial' or 'vital'. This word choice is better.

, If you stammer and stutter during the speech, it doesn't sound good, and makes your speech look like you put it together five minutes before the time by gathering info from dodgy websites.


Speak in front of the mirror to see your facial expressions, and the way you move around. Try not to fidget, but be relaxed when you are speaking on the stage.

, Do not murmur into the microphone; however, do not shout into it. Enunciate, and speak slowly. You want everyone to understand.


Make sure that you get all your facts and examples correct.
Beat the nerves. If you are feeling nervous, you are more prone to muttering. For a  detailed guide on getting rid of stage fright, see How to Overcome Stage Fright.

, Never read out what is there on the slides; it gives a bad impression.

, This way, you can remember your content more easily., Even if you do not feel confident, fake it to speak in a better way.


Move your hands about a bit. Use gestures and proper facial expressions and body language to engage the audience.

, Do not speak in a monotone. Give your examples like you are teaching someone.


Your tone plays and important role in your speech, so get that right, practicing as much as you need to. People will understand better, and it will give you more time to think about what you are saying.
Refrain from blaming the government, or offending anyone. It is okay to have opinions, but don't appear arrogant on stage.
Avoid abusive words and overly-dramatic tone and gestures.

Thread the tape.,
Adjust the tensioner.,
Test the dispenser.",How to Refill a Tape Dispenser2," Slide the empty cardboard roll off the spindle that holds it in place. The spindle and roller on most packing tape dispensers are not removable.

, Take a fresh roll of tape out of the box, and align the roll so that it will unwind counter-clockwise on the roller. The end of the tape with the colored tab should face towards the metal cutting edge., Pull the loose end of the tape off the roll, and thread it through the gap between the roller and the safety shield. The sticky surface of the tape should be facing down.Some dispensers do not have a safety shield. In this case, just thread the tape around the spinner with the tape strip leading over the top of the roll; the sticky side of the tape should be on the underside of the tape strip.

, Pull the colored tab on the end of the tape roll over the sharp cutting edge of the dispenser. Slice off the colored tab.Keep your fingers away from the sharp cutting blades.

, In the center of the spindle that holds the tape, there may be a button to adjust the tension level of the tape. Adjust this as appropriate, so that the tape flows freely when rolled across a crate or box., Test that the tape is loaded correctly and the tensioner adjusted appropriately. #*Get a large box, and hold the open edges of the box closed on top.


Hold the dispenser handle, and apply the tape to the far side of a package, right at the seam where the open edges of the box join together. The sharp cutting edge should be facing away from you. It will look as if you are holding a “tape gun.”
The tape should stick itself to the surface of the box. If it doesn't, you may need to pull the tape strip out a little and stick the end of the tape to the box manually.
Press the dispenser firmly down against the surface of the box, while pulling the whole unit across the top of the box.
Pull the tape over the edge of the box that is closest to you, and tear the tape off using the sharp cutting edge on the dispenser. Adhere the edge of the tape to the box manually, if needed.

Do a test run.",How to Personalize Stationery2," Printers that have a rear-paper feed are better suited to handle heavier, thicker paper types. Front-feed printers have more trouble pulling thicker paper through.Be sure to see how paper feeds into your home printer when selecting what paper to use.

, Monograms are a classic, timeless design element to add to your personalized stationery. Monograms typically feature one, two, or three interlacing initials. Play around with your initials and look for unique fonts that suit your personality and preferences. To make a monogram, you can also use resources like PicMonkey or Mark and Graham., A collage is a distinctive way to personalize your stationery, share memories, and show your personality. Make a collage that showcases your friends and family, or use photos from your vacation as a way to share your memories.


You can create these collages by hand, or you can use an online service to help you design and print your customized stationery. Websites like Shutterfly or Snapfish make it easy to create your designs online.

, Printing outlines or clip art onto your stationery and coloring them in with colored pencils is a fun and exciting project for all ages. This is simple to do and will make your stationery stand out. Try using different shades or color patterns to amp up the style.

, Before printing several sheets of your personalized stationery, be sure to print a test page first. Your printer and monitor may not be completely in tune, and the colors you see on your screen may not show up on the page as you intended. Printing a test page will help you see these differences so you can tweak your design if necessary.Plus, it will save a lot of paper!

Clean the stamp.",How to Personalize Stationery3," Using rubber stamps is a fun way to create your personalized stationery, and most craft and hobby stores have a wide variety of stamps and inks to choose from. Pick up a few letter stamps to create your very own letterhead, or choose autumn leaves or a snowflake to create a seasonal scene.

, To cover your rubber stamp with ink, tap the stamp into the ink pad several times. Do not press as this can damage the rubber and collect more ink than necessary. After tapping the stamp, check to see that it is adequately covered with ink., With the paper in place on a flat, hard surface, gently lower the stamp onto the section where you wish the image to appear. Be sure to gently press the stamp down. Wiggling the stamp can cause the image to smear and damage the stamp., Place your stamped paper in a safe, dry place to allow the ink to dry. To avoid smearing the ink, do not stack your stationery papers. Drying time will vary depending upon what type of paper or ink you used. Dye-based ink will dry in a few minutes, while pigment ink can take several minutes to several hours to dry.Pigment ink will not dry on glossy paper, so be sure not to combine these two., After each use, clean the stamp with alcohol-free baby wipes or mild soap and water. Cleaning the stamp will help prevent the inks from blending together, and it will help keep your stamp in like-new condition!

, Decide what to keep and what to to throw away. This decluttering is an important part of only keeping the things you actually use.

, Try places such as the dollar store, thrift store or stationery stores during sale time. Look for general storage containers that you probably wouldn't think of putting supplies in because they aren't in the stationery organization aisle.


Small bathroom containers without handles are a great choice. Buy six containers and categorize them by type (for example pens, highlighters, pencils, staples, rubber bands, smaller items and erasers, the categorizing is up to you.) Then get paper, write the categories and tape it on. You could use chalkboard paint to sort them too.

, Changing the ordinary into something interesting is always fun, and it's customized to your preferences too.


Find a box and quite strong cardboard (preferably wooden box but any plain box whatever size with a lid will do.If it is wooden then skip the next step)
Cover the box and lid with recycled paper.
Paint the box and lid in paint that suits the material of the box.
While that is drying, paint over the strong cardboard. It may take time for it all to dry, so you may want to do the rest on the following day.
Continue when ready. Place the strong cardboard inside to create a section and secure it in place using whatever method that is handiest, such as glue or mounting putty. Cut to a size and shape that suits your box. Repeat according to how many sections you want in the box.
Personalize the box with small pictures, stickers, etc. or leave it as it is.

",How to Make a Pencil Holder," These items are perfect for pencil holders because they are a good shape and can usually be found around the house. Next time you make a cup of soup, cook vegetables, or make beans, save your can. Simply rinse it out and set it aside so that you can later reuse it.;
, Almost everyone has these and they are great pencil cans, and can be grouped together to form cool designs. You'll need to create a bottom for your holder but that is simple. Simply trace the circumference of your toilet paper roll onto thick cardboard. Then, cut out that cardboard and tape it to the toilet paper roll until it is secure. It won't look pretty, but it doesn't matter because you will decorate the roll.To create a cool grouping with your pencil holders, take each toilet paper roll and add a bottom to it. Then, group them together by using three, four or five rolls (depending on how many holders you want). Place the rolls side by side, or in a circular grouping. You can also cut some of the rolls to be shorter so that you have different heights for your holders.

, Mason jars can create the perfect, rustic look for a pencil holder, but can also be decorated to be a very pretty, simple holder. If you don't have an old mason jar you can purchase them at the store for an inexpensive price. You can also use a glass jar leftover from salsa or another product, or you can simply use a regular glass.


If your jar has a label on it you'll need to soak the label to remove it. Fill up a large bowl with hot water and place your jar in the water. After an hour, check the label and see if it can be easily peeled off. If it is still difficult, place it back in the water and allow it to sit for another hour or so.
It's beneficial to soak a label rather than pulling it straight off, because many labels leave a sticky residue. Soaking your label will remove any residue and give you a clean jar once you remove it.

, For this type of pencil holder you'll need a piece of wood that has enough depth to hold a third of your pencil, so about two to three inches. A log or thick branch can be a good a choice for this holder. Saw off the excess wood so you have your desired height. Then, take a drill bit (7/16 inch is a good size) and drill holes into your wood. Then, finish it off by sanding your piece until it has a smooth finish.You can drill the holes in your wood in any pattern that you'd like. You can drill 15 holes placed symmetrically in the wood or you can do a random pattern.

, These aren't the small cardboard boxes, but the taller plastic boxes that are circular or oval shaped. Simply peel off the label of the can once you have emptied out its contents and you are ready to decorate!

, Once you have finished using a shampoo or conditioner bottle, don't throw it away. Rinse it out and cut it to use as a pencil holder. Take off the lid and then cut off the top quarter of the bottle. If your bottle is taller or shorter you may need to cut a different amount. You can use an X-Acto knife or scissors to cut your bottle. It is now ready to be decorated!A bottle like this doesn't always stand up easily, especially if it isn't completely round. However, these bottles work great if you want to hang your pencil holder on a wall. Simply place a piece of velcro on the flat side of the back of the bottle, and then place the other side of the velcro on the wall. You can now hang it up above your desk.

, Before you begin to decorate your pencil holder, you'll want to make sure it is thoroughly clean. If you are using a glass, can, or plastic item, rinse it out with water and soap and clean the outside as well. This will ensure that you don't have dirt on the outside of the holder while you decorate. Make sure your holder is completely dry before decorating it by wiping it down with a paper towel.


If you wipe down your item with a regular towel you risk leaving lint on your holder, which will make it more difficult to decorate. You can use an old rag that has been washed many times, though, as these won't have too much lint on them.
If you are using wood or the toilet paper roll, just make sure it is free of dirt or dust. You can wipe off the toilet paper roll with a slightly damp towel (but you don't want it too damp as this can damage the roll). If you are using a piece of wood, take a sweeping brush, and sweep off any dirt or dust that was leftover after sanding it.

, There are so many different ways you can decorate your pencil holder, but one of which is painting it a solid color or with a design. If you have an item that is originally not a pretty color (like an aluminum can) first spray paint it. Allow the paint to dry and then decorate it with your other paints. Covering your containers with chalkboard paint can also be a cool idea.


Spray paint is a good base coat for paint as it will stick much easier to different surfaces than regular acrylic paint. Spray paint your holder in a well ventilated area. You also want to make sure it has the option to dry in an area that dirt and other bugs won't get to it, as they can easily stick to the paint as it is drying.
If you plan to paint a lot of color over your base coat, choose a neutral color like white or light grey. That way your designs will pop.
If you are going for a modern designed holder, spray paint or paint it a bright gold, silver, or white.

, If you have a clear glass jar, painting the outside of it can be difficult because the paint may not stick very well. However, you can dye the inside of your jar, which can create a very pretty look. There are several different ways you can color your jar:


If you want to tint your glass (meaning it is still relatively clear but is now a color) you can do so using glue, food coloring, and water. Take one tsp of multi-purpose glue, three drops of food coloring (whatever color you want your jar to be) and one and a half teaspoons of water and mix it in a small bowl. If you want a different shade, like a turquoise, you may have to mix different colors, like blue and green. Pour the mixture into the jar and screw the lid on tight. Shake it up until the jar is fully coated. Then, set it upside down and let the coloring drain out. After most of the mixture has drained out, take off the cap and let it dry for a few hours. You can also paint the outside of these jars with the color mixture you created and it will dry translucent.Heat the jar in the oven. Take a mixture of 10 drops food coloring, two tablespoons mod podge, and one tablespoon water, and pour into the jar. Then, twist the jar around until the color covers all of the inside of the jar. Turn it over and let it drain out of the jar for about 30 minutes. Then, place it upside down on a piece of wax paper and place into a preheated oven at 225 degrees. Let the jar heat in the oven about 10 minutes, then take it out, flip it right side up, and stick it back in the oven for about 20 to 30 minutes.Paint distressed jars. Start with two coats of ultra matte paint in your desired color on the outside of the jar. Let each coat dry before you apply the next coat. Chalk paint often works the best when painting jars as it adheres to the glass better than regular paint. After the paint has dried, take a small piece of sand paper (80 grit) and rub it around the raised edge on the jars. Finish your look with a clear, matte finish sealant -- this will help the paint last longer on your jar., Instead of painting your holder, you may want to cover it in a fun fabric or scrapbook paper. Take your material and cut a size to fit your holder. Then, glue it onto your holder with hot glue or by covering your container with mod lodge and then spreading the fabric onto the mod-podged container.


Mod podge will likely help the material stay better, but it will create a wetter look on your material. If you don't want this, place hot glue on the top, bottom, and two edges of your holder and glue your material down that way, making sure you don't have any bubbles or gaps in the material.To cut the right amount of material, take your holder and place it on top of your material. Place one edge of your holder on the fabric, marking the fabric where the edge starts (it can be helpful to make a little mark on your holder as well). Then, roll the holder, tracing on the fabric where the top of the holder hits and where the bottom hits, until you've reached the first edge on your holder. Then, mark on your material where your holder ended, and cut out the area you traced, cutting out an extra inch around it in case you need extra material.
To wrap your material around your holder you should be able to take the piece you just cut and start at one edge of your holder. Wrap the piece around until you reach that same edge again. Cut off any excess material.
You can also cover your can with a plain piece of white paper and then draw or color on it with markers, paint, or colored pencils. This can be a fun idea for little kids so that they can decorate their own pencil holders without creating too much of a mess.

, Maybe you are looking for a more rustic look for your pencil holder. If so, use twine, rope, or yarn to decorate your container. Simply take the color and texture of material you want and start at the bottom of your holder. Glue the beginning of your rope with hot glue and as you wind up your container continue to add hot glue. Then, cut off the rest of your material once you have reached the top.Make sure as you wind up your container that you don't leave any empty holes. Once you have created one loop around your container, place a string of hot glue right above it. This will hopefully prevent you from leaving gaps on your holder.

, Now that you've covered your container with paint, fabric, or rope, you can add any extra embellishments. Maybe you want a glittery can, vintage can, or floral can. For a glitzy can, shake glitter onto your paint as it is drying, or mod podge it onto your fabric. For a vintage can, add a trim of lace around the top or bottom of your can or old fashioned buttons. For a floral can, create felt flowers.


You can also hide your holder completely by lining it with small twigs or wine corks. Another fun idea for a pencil holder is lining it with an old map, or a map of a location you hope to visit some day. You can also add a ribbon to the top or bottom of your can to cover up any ugly fabric or paper edges. The options are really endless!

Let the paper sit.",How to Get Wrinkles out of Paper1," While you probably won’t be able to remove all of the wrinkles, you may be able to work out some of the creases and folds just by running your hand over it. It’s important to be gentle, though, because you may rip the paper if you use too much force. The goal is to flatten it, so it’s as smooth as possible., Your hand may not be able to smooth all of the wrinkles from the paper, but a significant weight can often press out the creases and folds. Look for items around the house that are fairly heavy, such as thick books, pots and pans, or even bricks. Choose objects that are as large or larger than the paper to ensure that the entire surface is covered.You don’t necessarily need one extremely heavy object. Try stacking several smaller objects on top of one another to create a significant weight.

, You’ll want to set the page on a flat surface, and make sure that it is as smooth as possible before setting your objects on top. Check that the entire sheet of paper is covered, so all of the wrinkles can be smoothed. If your heavy object isn’t large enough to cover the paper, place two or more side by side to ensure that the full surface is weighted down.Depending on the items that you’re using as weights, it may be a good idea to throw a towel over the paper before placing the objects on top to prevent it from getting dirty.

, It takes time for the weight of your objects to press out the wrinkles, so you need to let them sit for a while. The amount of time necessary depends on how wrinkled the paper is and how heavy the objects on top are, but the longer you let it sit, the better. Typically, you’ll want to wait at least 24 hours.In most cases, using weight alone isn’t enough to completely smooth all of the wrinkles out of a sheet of paper. However, it can help get rid of some of the creases before you move onto one of the other methods.

Take the label off of a plastic bottle.,
Rinse the bottle using soap and water.,
Cut top part off the bottle with box cutter.Don't worry about being too exact; you will be trimming the bottle down shorter in the next step.,
Use scissors to even out the top.Keep trimming until you get the height you want, and there are no jagged lines left.,
Tear some tissue paper into small pieces.,
Apply white school glue onto the bottle with a brush.,
Stick the tissue papers on it.,
Let the glue dry, and add a second layer if desired.,
Decorate the bottle further using paint, markers, or stickers.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Pencil Holder from a Water Bottle1," The bottle can be any size, shape, or color you want. If you can't find a plastic water bottle, use a plastic soda bottle instead.;
, Use a dish scrubbing brush to scrub any leftover glue off. Once the bottle is clean, lightly pat it dry with a towel.


If there is any glue left from the label, wipe it off using a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol.

, It might be a good idea to cut it a little bit taller than you think you might need it.


If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.

, Try to make the bottle no shorter than half the height of a standard pen or pencil.

If your water bottle has ""ribs,"" use the grooves as a guideline.

, Aim to make them about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Don't cut the tissue paper, however. The jagged edges will give you a smoother finish. They will also make the papers easier to apply., You can use a flat paintbrush or a foam brush. Keep the bottle steady by sticking your hand inside of it. This way, your hands won't get messy., Overlap the papers slightly so that there are no gaps, and smooth them down using your fingers or a paintbrush to get rid of any bubbles.


When you get to the top, fold the papers over the rim and onto the inside of the bottle. This will give you a neater finish.

, Once the bottle is dry, you can continue decorating it, or you can add a second layer of tissue paper. This second layer can be the same color, or it can be a different color to create a tie-dye effect.


After you have applied your second layer and let it dry, you can ""seal"" your work by painting another layer of glue on top of it.

, Once the bottle is completely dry, add some more color to it using some stickers, markers, or paint. You can even decorate it with glitter glue pens!


If you want to use lighter colors, try paint pens. They will show up much better than regular markers, which are translucent.

Mark the bottom of the bag.The bottom of the bag is the side opposite of the zipper end.,
Hole punch the bottom of the bag.,
Reinforce the holes.,
Click your pencil case into your binder.",How to Make a Pencil Case2," For this project, you'll need one durable plastic sandwich bag with a slide zipper and a paper hole puncher. Choose a plastic zipper bag that will accommodate your pens, pencils, erasers, or other items you wish to store.

, To get the holes in the right place, lay the bag in a binder, next to the clasps. Then mark two spots for holes on the bag so that when you punch the holes, the holes will line up with the clasps in the binder


Mark the spots close to the edge of the bag. Around half an inch from the edge should work fine.

, Use the hole puncher to make two holes in the place you marked them.

, This step is optional, but if you want your plastic bag pencil case to last longer, you may want to reinforce the punched holes. You can do so with reinforcement labels, which can be found at any office supply stores. These are small circular stickers that can simply be placed around a punched hole in order to prevent the binder from wearing and tearing it. Place the reinforcement labels on all sides of all the holes in the plastic bag.

, Fill the bag with your pens and pencils and you're done!"

Sew a running stitch up both sides.,
Use a machine optionally.,
Mark the spot for the button.,
Attach the button.,
Make the hole for the button.",How to Make a Pencil Case3," For this case, you'll need felt, embroidery thread, a needle with a large eye or a sewing machine, a button, and scissors.

, First, cut the felt down to 2 1/2"" by 18"". Lay your 2 1/2""x 18"" rectangle of felt so the short end runs along the top.

, Fold the bottom of the rectangle 6 inches (15.2 cm) up.

, Thread the large eye needle with the embroidery thread. Tie a knot a half inch from the bottom of the loose end of the thread.

, To sew a running stitch, do the following:


Begin by inserting the needle at the back of the bottom corner, nearest to the fold.
Pull the thread through to the front. Continue passing the thread back and forth from the front to the back.
Each stitch should be approximately the same length. 1/8"" is a good length for this project.
Finish with a knot in the back. Be sure to trim all of your excess thread.
Repeat with the other side.

, If you'd like, you can use a sewing machine instead of hand sewing the sides of the felt.

, Fold the flap forward to close the pencil case. Make a pencil mark half an inch from the bottom of the flap on the front of the case.

, Sew a button to the front of the case just above your pencil mark. The bottom of the button should touch your pencil mark.Before sewing the button on, you should make a button hole stitch in the felt to reinforce the button. Do so by running the needle through the underside of the felt and up to the outside, then back in and out, making a small ""x"" where the button will be placed.
You can sew the button on by placing it over the ""x"" and running the needle through the holes in the button and through the felt, one by one.
Further reinforce the button by pulling the needle through the felt from the underside, wrapping it around all the stitches underneath the button, and then pulling it back through the felt.

, With a small pair of sharp scissors, cut a buttonhole on the flap. Button your case closed. All done!You can prevent the button hole from becoming frayed and becoming bigger over time by either stitching around the hole or applying a bit of glue around the edges of the hole. Craft stores carry a type of glue called Fray Check that is made for this purpose."

, Cut the felt down to 9"" by 33"". Arrange your felt on your workspace so it lies with the long side at the top.

, Using your washable fabric pen or tailor's chalk, make 24 dashes across the long side of the fabric.


Begin the marks 1"" from the short side and 3"" from the long side in the upper left corner of the fabric.
Dashes should be 1/2"" long with 1/2"" between them.

, Make another identical row of dashes 1/2"" above the first. Mirror these 1/2"" marks at the bottom of the fabric.


As above, begin the marks 1"" from the short side and 3"" from the long side (bottom) of the fabric.
Mark another identical row of dashes 1/2"" below the existing row of marks.

, Use your utility knife to cut slits where you have made marks.

, Cut a hole 1"" from the edge of one of the short sides and approximately 4½"" from the top.

, Do this by folding the cord in half and passing the folded end through the hole. Tie a knot in the loop to keep the cord from coming out of the hole.

, Because you cut 24 slits, your roll can hold up to 24 pencils.

, Once rolled, use the cord to wrap and secure your pencil case."

Place paper on an ironing board.,
Cover the paper.,
Set your iron to low.,
Iron the paper.",How to Get Wrinkles out of Paper2," You want to make sure that the page lays flat on the surface, so smooth it with your hands to ensure that it’s not folded or bent in any areas. Cover the ironing board with a clean towel or sheet before setting the paper down to ensure that it doesn’t get dirty.Depending on the type of paper and what kind of ink is used on it, you may want to lightly mist it with distilled water before setting it on the ironing board. The water can help soften the paper, so it’s easier to press out the wrinkles. However, it can also make some types of ink, such as inkjet printer ink, run, so you may want to mist a test page before doing it to the paper that you’re trying to smooth.
If you don’t have an ironing board, any flat surface, such as a table, counter, or even floor, can work. Just make sure to line it with a very thick cotton towel to protect it from the heat.

, You don’t want the page to get too hot when you apply heat because you run the risk of scorching it. That’s why it helps to place a clean towel or piece of fabric over it before you get your iron out. Don’t fold the towel or fabric into too many layers, though, or it may be difficult for the heat to reach the paper., Because you don’t want to damage the paper, it’s best to start with the lowest heat setting. If you notice that the wrinkles aren’t coming out of the paper once you start ironing, raise the heat slightly.Make sure to wait until the iron is heated before you start ironing the page. Depending on the iron’s type and model, it can take anywhere from one to three minutes.

, You can use the same technique that you would if you were ironing clothing. Move the iron over the cloth-covered paper in small circular motions, making sure that you don’t let it linger in any one spot for too long. Every so often, stop, lift the cloth, and check to see if the wrinkles are gone. If they aren’t, keep ironing until you’re satisfied with the paper’s smoothness.While you should move the iron just as you would with clothing, it’s important to keep in mind that you’re working with paper, which is more fragile than fabric. Be as gentle as possible to avoid ripping, tearing, scorching, or otherwise damaging the paper.

Turn on the shower.,
Set the paper on a flat surface.,
Let it sit.,
Smooth out the wrinkles with hand.",How to Get Wrinkles out of Paper3," You can create a great deal of steam in your bathroom if you turn on your shower as hot as it will go and close the door. To fill the room, you’ll want to wait at least 10 minutes so the steam has time to build., Once there is plenty of steam in the bathroom, you can set the page down so the steam can help relax its fibers. Make sure that it’s not too close to the shower, though, because you don’t want any moisture to develop on the paper. Check that it isn’t folded or creased in any areas either.Wherever you plan to set the paper down, it’s a good idea to lay down a clean towel first. It will absorb any moisture that might be on the surface from the steam, so you don’t have to worry about the paper getting too wet.

, In order for the steam to help the paper release the wrinkles, you’ll need to keep it in the bathroom for approximately 10 minutes. If the page is severely wrinkled, you may want to give it extra time -- but check on it every so often to ensure that it’s not absorbing too much moisture., After the paper has been steamed, remove it from the bathroom, and place it on another flat surface. While the steam may have helped release some of the wrinkles, you should use your hand to press over it again while the paper is still relaxed from the steam. Be gentle, though, because you don’t want to tear or damage the page.You may want to cover your hand in a clean hand towel before smoothing the paper. That will help protect it from any dirt, oils, or other debris that might be on your skin.
Even if you manage to smooth most of the wrinkles out of the paper, you may want to place the paper under a heavy weight for several hours to a day in order to further press it.

Cut down 7 water bottles, with one of them being taller than the rest.,
Decorate the bottles.,
Arrange the shorter bottles around the taller one.All shorter bottles should be touching the taller one.,
Pull out the first bottle and draw a vertical line of hot glue down the side.,
Quickly replace the bottle, and press it gently against the taller bottle.,
Wrap a piece of ribbon or colorful tape around the middle of the bottle bundle.,
Consider decorating the caddy further.",How to Make a Pencil Holder from a Water Bottle2," The first 6 water bottles should all be the same height. The 7th bottle should be cut 1inch (2.54 centimeters) taller.Make sure all bottles are the same size and shape.
A pencil caddy is ideal for those who have a lot of different pencils, and like to keep organized. They are also perfect for keeping pencils, colored pencils, crayons, and pens all separate.

, You can decorate it however you want, skip bulky embellishments like buttons and gems. If you want to add bulky embellishments, such as buttons or gem stones, wait until after you have assembled the caddy.


A quick and simple decorating idea is to paint the bottles different colors, or decorate them with stickers.

, When you look down on them, you should see a design sort of like a flower.

, Make sure that the glue is going all the way from the top edge to the bottom. For extra holding powder, make the line squiggly.

, Make sure that you are pressing the glue part against the taller bottle. Repeat for the rest of the bottles, until they are all glued against the taller one.

, You can glue the ends down, or tie them off into a pretty bow.

, You can glue down plastic rhinestones, buttons, or even draw on it using glitter glue. If you'd like to make a base for the caddy, glue it down onto a cardboard disk or cake stand.

Hot glue colorful buttons, gems, or rhinestones for a pop of color.,
Cover the bottle with yarn or twine.,
Punch holes along the rim, then weave colorful yarn through the holes.,
If your bottle is made from PET or PETE plastic, use an iron to give it a nice rim.",How to Make a Pencil Holder from a Water Bottle3," If you don't want to use tissue paper, you can simply draw on your bottle with permanent markers. This will give you a translucent, stained glass effect.


If you make a mistake, dip a q-tip in rubbing alcohol, and ""erase"" the mistake. Wipe the area dry, and continue drawing.

, To make the paint stick better, consider buffing the entire bottle using a fine grit sand paper. Paint the entire bottle a solid color first, wait for the paint to dry, then add details, such as flowers.

, If you don't have a lot of supplies on hand, you can always decorate the bottle with stickers. For example, you could paint a bottle dark blue or purple, wait for the paint to dry, then cover it with silver or gold star stickers.

, Unroll about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of tape, and press it down on the bottle, right against the bottom edge. Keeping the roll of tape close to the bottle, start winding the tape around the bottle. When you come back to where you started, overlap the tape by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) and snip the tape off. Start your next row just above the first one; you can also overlap the rows a little.


If the tape extends over the top of the bottle, fold it inwards, inside the bottle.

, You can cover the entire bottle, or just small portions of it, with buttons, gems, or rhinestones. Make sure that you focus most of your design on the bottom however; if you glue too many things towards the top, your pencil holder will fall over.


For a more colorful pencil holder, paint it or cover it with tissue paper maché first.

, Draw a line of glue along the top rim, and press the string down onto it. Start wrapping the string around the bottle. adding a line of glue every few inches/centimeters. When you reach the bottom of the bottle, draw another line of glue, and press the end of the string into it., Use a hole punch to poke holes ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) apart along the rim. Thread some yarn through a yarn needle, and use the needle to weave the yarn in and out of the holes. This will give you a more colorful rim.

, You will need to do this just after you have cut the bottle, but before you decorate it. To tell whether or not your bottle is made out of PET or PETE plastic, turn it upside down and look at the bottom. If there is a recycling symbol with a 1 inside it, it's PET/PETE plastic.Turn on your iron and make sure the steam setting is turned off. Consider wrapping a sheet of fabric or tin foil over the bottom of the iron to keep it clean.
Press the bottle, cut-side-down against the bottom of the iron.
Every couple of seconds, lift the bottle to see the progress. As the plastic warms up, it will start to curl in on itself, creating a neat rim.
Turn the iron off and let the bottle cool before you start decorating it.

Sew the rectangle pieces together.,
Cut another piece of fabric.,
Sew the new piece to the original rectangle.,
Sew lines for the pencil pouches.,
Attach the ribbon.,
Put everything inside the pencil roll.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Pencil Case5," You'll need two different fabrics, about a yard of each, a needle and thread, scissors, washable fabric marker or tailor's chalk, and a ribbon.

, The rectangles of fabric can be whatever size you'd like your pencil case to be. Around 7"" by 12"" would be sufficient.

, Sew the edges of the pieces of fabric together with the wrong sides facing each other. Leave one long edge unsewed so you can turn it inside out. Then turn it inside out.

, Cut this one the same size as the first rectangle. So if your first two pieces of fabric were 7"" by 12"", you should cut out another 7"" by 12"" rectangle, using either of your fabrics.

, First, fold the newly cut fabric in half so that the printed side is on the outside. Then sew the folded edge to the bottom of the first rectangle of sewn together fabric.


It should be sewn so that the open end is still open, and lies in the middle of the case.
Which side of the original sewn together rectangles you sew this folded in half rectangle on depends on what looks better to you.

, At 2"" intervals, sew lines in the folded in half fabric, going downwards. These will make the gaps where the pencils will go in.


You'll want to mark the fabric with 2"" intervals first with washable fabric marker or tailor's chalk first.
You can reinforce the stitches by doubling the stitching, running back through the line after making the first stitch line., Sew your ribbon to one end of the case, on the outside, opposite of where the pencil pouches are. Sew the ribbon in the middle of the edge of the case. Make stitches neatly along the edge of the ribbon and the pencil case.

, Roll it up and tie it closed with the ribbon.,"

Familiarize yourself with IPA.,
Remember that RP English has the following characteristics:

RP English has undergone the fruit-strut split.,
Focus on your lips.",How to Speak the RP English Accent," In learning how to speak the RP accent, most of the time you will encounter the International Phonetic Alphabet so you must learn how to pronounce words using the IPA.;
, If cut and put rhyme for you, you must learn to pronounce differently fruit and strut. Fruit is pronounced as /fru:t/ while strut is pronounced as /strʌt/ with /ʌ/ being an unstressed a sound, like the u in mud. American English has undergone the same split.






RP English is a broad A accent which means the a sound in bath and chance is like the a in father or palm and not pronounced like trap (with a slight touch of the sound of e or /æ/). In other words, you pronounce the a sound by moving your jaw downwards instead of widening your mouth as with the case with /æ/.






RP English is a non-rhotic accent which means the r sound is not pronounced unless it is followed by a vowel or if it is at the very beginning of the word. For example, the word father and farther will sound alike because the r sound in farther is dropped.






RP English does not have h-dropping so the h sound in head and horse are pronounced.






RP English has not undergone the weak vowel merger so the words Lenin and Lennon are pronounced differently.






In RP English, Mary and marry are pronounced differently. The a sound in Mary is pronounced as eh while the a in marry is spoken with a deep stress on a or with a broad A. In other words, Mary is pronounced as /meri/ while marry is pronounced as /mæri/.






In RP English, cot and caught are pronounced differently. Cot is pronounced as /kɒt/ while caught is pronounced as /kɔ:t/. The vowel in caught is longer and you need to pucker your lips a little to pronounce it.
RP English does not have yod dropping so the u sound in words such as tune /tju:n/, new /nju:/ and enthusiasm /ɪnˈθjuːziæzəm/ are pronounced with an extra y sound (IPA /j/) unlike standard American accents, which drop it: /tuːn, nuː, ɪnˈθuːziæzəm/. To a Received Pronunciation ear, Americans pronounce ""noo"" instead of ""new"".

, In speaking RP English, put focus on the front of your mouth, particularly on the lips, when pronouncing the words. This is where the focus of the pronouncing the RP English is. When you try to imitate accurately someone who speaks the RP accent, you'll notice that you're placing stress on your lips when speaking.

Look closely.,
Consider that the edge might not be completely straight.,
Run your finger around the roll.,
Once you find the edge of the roll, peel it up carefully.",How to Find the Edge of a Roll of Tape1," Turn the roll slowly in your hands, and carefully examine every inch of the circumference. The edge should look like a thin, almost invisible ridge that runs straight across the width of the tape. It may be slightly darker than the rest of the roll, and it may blend in almost perfectly. If you don't find it on the first pass, try again.


If the tape is patterned, look for the flaw or break in the continuous pattern. On a roll of zebra-print duct tape, for instance, look carefully for a point where the stripes do not entirely match up.;
, If the roll of tape has been treated roughly, the ""edge"" might be jagged, patchy, or even extremely long. Tape-roll edges have been known to run all the way around the roll at an angle, diminishing very gradually until they taper off.

, Use your fingertip for heightened sensation, or use your fingernail for the sake of precision. Slip your finger around the roll and feel for bumps and ridges. The edge should feel like a slightly raised ridge in the tape. If the lip is large enough, your finger will catch slightly. If you think you've identified the edge by looking closely, use your finger for a closer inspection.


If you have very short fingernails, try running the edge of a knife around the rim of the roll. You might also use a toothpick, a paperclip, a key – anything that allows you the sensation and precision to feel a slight ridge in the surface of the tape. Be careful not to press too hard and puncture the tape.
If you don't feel anything on the first pass, try going around in the opposite direction.

, Pick at a corner until you can hold it between your thumb and forefinger. After you manage to get a corner up with your fingernail, use your finger or thumb to roll up the edge diagonally from the corner. Pull the edge until you can hold the full width of the tape. The oils from your hands will keep the rolled edge from sticking back down."

Use flour or chalk as a tracer.,
Put a bit of flour or chalk dust into a cup or small container.,
Dip your finger into the cup or container.,
Run your floured finger around the circumference of the tape.,
Wipe your finger clean once you've found the edge.,
Use a pencil as a tracer.",How to Find the Edge of a Roll of Tape2," If your tape is dark-colored, you can use use a light-colored, contrasting ""tracer"" to reveal the edge of the roll. The basic idea here is to rub a clumpy white material—flour, chalk, and baking powder are good choices—around the outside of the tape roll until the tracer sticks to the hidden edge. If you are using a thicker tape, such as duct tape, this effect may be more apparent than if you are using a thinner tape.

, Any material will do, as long as it clumps together and the color contrasts with the color of the tape.

, It may help to wet your finger, slightly, beforehand.


If you don't want to use your finger, you can also dip the roll of tape directly into the flour or chalk dust. Be sure to immerse it thoroughly. There is a chance that the flour will stick to the edge of the roll, revealing your goal!

, Go slowly and methodically in one direction, then the other. This way, your finger is more likely to catch the edge of the roll. Make sure not to skip over any sections, or you might miss it! The edge should become quickly apparent: the flour will catch along the crack, forming a white line.

, Try not to get any flour or chalk onto the sticky side of the tape.{largeimage|use tape as required Step 5.jpg}}

, If your tape is light in color, try running the flat side of a pencil point around the roll. The dark-grey graphite from the pencil will serve a similar function to the flour. The pencil should bump up very slightly when it hits the edge of the roll, and you will be able to see the break in the graphite line.

Cut a V-shape into the tape roll.,
Mark the end of the roll with a toothpick.,
Fold the edge of the tape back on itself.,
Use a tape dispenser.,
Buy striped or patterned tape.,
Buy sticky tape with non-stick sides.",How to Find the Edge of a Roll of Tape3," Use a sharp knife or a pair of scissors to cut a small wedge out of the entire roll of tape – from the outermost edge to the innermost end. This way, you'll tear the tape off in the same spot every time, and you may have less trouble finding the edge in the future!, When you are done using a roll of tape for the time being, stick a toothpick underneath the adhesive about a half-inch from the edge. This way, when you return to use the tape again, you will be able to easily identify where to begin. This method is especially useful for clear packing tape.In theory, you can use almost anything to mark the end of the roll: paper, a paperclip, a twig, a card. Use anything that isn't too bulky and sticks cleanly to the edge of the tape. Improvise a solution using the materials you have lying around your home or office.

, Fold the sticky end of the tape back into the roll—not far, just a centimeter or so—to make a ""pull tab"" for the next time you use the tape. You can fold the tape directly in, or you can fold at a 45-degree angle for a triangular fold.

, Consider buying a dedicated tape dispenser. These devices usually include a spool (which you can continually refill with new rolls of tape) and a serrated tape-cutting edge. When you stretch the tape over the serrated edge, it slices cleanly and naturally. The edge of the tape sticks there until you need it next.


Consider buying a ""tape gun"" for packing tape. This device is a convenient, handheld version of the standard tape dispenser. Run the tape gun along the surface of a box, and you will seal the box without losing the edge of the roll.You can find tape dispensers online or at office-supply stores. Be aware that many standard tape dispensers are designed for use with Scotch tape

, It is easier to find the edge of a roll of patterned tape, as you can visually parse out the breaks in the pattern. If you consistently have trouble finding the edge of a roll of tape, consider making a habit of buying patterned tape for the sake of convenience., Some tape is designed with black lines on the sides to denote where the adhesive ends. This way, you will not need to find the edge of the roll – you'll be able to pull it up at any point! Look for this specialty tape online or in large office-supply stores."

The reporter tells you what is important, what is sad, what is exciting, and what you don't want to miss, all with their voice. It's not so much what they're saying, but how they are saying it.;
, Speaking like a news reporter starts with having a command of the English language. The type of book you read matters. Read information that is similar in style to what a news reporter delivers on the news. For example:


Biography or historical book
News magazine
Newspaper
Reading will improve your vocabulary.

Look up the words you don't know. This will help you with understanding the context of what you're reading and with word pronunciation. That way, when you are reading as a reporter and come across words you don't know, you'll be able to take an educated guess and sound intelligent.
Read out loud when you are alone. Listen to your voice and what your tone is saying.



,


Before you start speaking, do singing and speaking verbal exercises to loosen your mouth and tongue. Also clear your throat away from your audience before you begin.
Take that book or newspaper and read it out loud to yourself in the mirror. It's time to really see and hear yourself. It will take practice in order to get good at the ability to glance at written work, capture it quickly, then read it well while looking straight ahead.
Look at what your face is saying as you read. Reporters have confidence even when they're staring at a camera. They believe in what they are doing and they want to share the breaking story with the viewer. Your face reflects what you believe and voice confirms this.

, Practice reading quickly without stumbling. It's important to articulate each word clearly when you want to communicate information. Each word should stand on its own and not flow into another word.


Know when to slow it down. A reporter will say, ""Coming up next,"" very quickly but slow down when they say, ""...and you won't want to miss it.""

, You'll often see a reporter with papers in their hand. You can do this too!


Type up and print a news story that you want to practice reading. The letters should be between 1.5"" to 2"" tall and in the sans-serif font, such as Arial or Helvetica. This will most accurately reflect the teleprompter type-style.
Practice reading from a distance by placing the paper(s) on a table while you're seated or down by your waist. Learn to read with discretion, only glancing at your papers not reading them verbatim.

,


Break out the video camera or smart phone and either record video or audio of yourself.
Play it back and listen closely.
Watch the news and compare your voice to the reporter's.
Play your recording back to yourself again. This is not a time to self-loathe or criticize yourself; it's a time to see where you can improve and contemplate how.

,


Read something news related that you haven't read before. See how you do.

, The way you speak with your friends is in direct conflict with the way you will report the news to a public audience.

, At first, you'll find that you need to slow your speaking down to avoid this, but eventually it will become a habit.

, Practice makes perfect so if you practice many times you will do it well."

Sit, stoop, or kneel at their level.,
Put yourself in the child's place.,
Use the child’s name when you speak to them.,
Listen to them.",How to Speak Kindly to Children1," This can show kindness in two ways: you are making it physically easier for them to speak to you and you are showing them respect by being on their level. Think about a time you have spoken to someone really tall and how hard that was. It's exactly the same for a child.Being on their level also helps maintain their attention because they can see your face better.;
, Your child is learning and getting used to a complicated world. So when you speak to them, remember that they want to learn and understand but sometimes that is hard for them.Empathize with their frustration by saying, ""I know it's tough but you are doing a great job!""
Help them get past frustration by saying, ""Let's keep learning and working on it!""

, Saying someone’s name almost always causes them to look at you, so using a child’s name at the beginning of a conversation gets their attention focused on you. Repeating their name occasionally as you talk helps them know they are an individual and makes them feel valued.If it is a child that you see only on occasion, make a point to remember their name each time.

, Speaking and listening always go together, so speaking kindly to children also means listening when they speak back to you. This shows them respect and teaches them to listen better when you are speaking.Kids can pick up on active listening techniques like eye contact, nodding the head, and summing up what they have said, so incorporate these into your interactions.
When talking about school, if the child says, ""Today we worked really hard on our numbers and we got to play outside at recess and we then we read a story but I didn't like it very much,"" you could respond by saying, ""So you learned about numbers and reading and you got to play outside?""

Practice.,
Listen.,
Record yourself and watch.,
Be honest with yourself.,
Know the subject and your audience.",How to Speak Professionally," You have to practice... a lot. Particularly if you are giving a speech or performing in a debate, you need to know your material. If you do not practice, if you think you can wing it, you are really setting yourself up for failure. So practice again and again. You all know that 'practice makes perfect'.;
, This is a vital skill for interpersonal, professional communication. You have got one mouth and two ears, so you should listen twice as much as you should speak. Listening helps you to adjust and meet both your own needs and the needs of the person with whom you are communicating. Listen to your audience. Take in their opinions, make considerate comments in return, and through this practice, boost your listening skills. Try to listen with enough attention.

, This is kind of related to listen and practice; if you have got a video camera, you can record yourself, record it and watch. It may be painful because you are going to see how good or how bad you really are. We are our worst critics, so you may be disappointed at first, but if you can get it up to a point where you feel pretty good about the presentation, you know you will be ready to speak in professional settings.


Listening to your own speech can help you become conscious of and fix poor habits, like using crutch words such as ""umm"" and ""like.""

, Do not think that you are the best. Speaking is a difficult skill, and it takes years of experience and practice to get to a truly comfortable level. Realize that if you are honest with yourself, if you are willing to work on your skills, there is no traffic on the extra mile.

, This about you taking the time and doing the research. Before giving a speech, the best speakers plan their thoughts, write drafts, and make revisions. Examine your subject very carefully so that you can talk about it really well. Try to understand your audience and what they want to see and hear.

Check whether you have a frontal lisp.,
Bite and smile.,
Place your tongue in the correct position.,
Blow to make an s sound.,
Move the tip of your tongue if necessary.,
Blow through a t sound.,
Turn it into a z sound.,
Practice this in increasingly long phrases.,
Visit a speech language pathologist for further assistance.",How to Say the Letter S (for People Who Have Lisps)1," A person with a frontal lisp presses the tongue forward against the front teeth when she makes an ""s"" or ""z"" sound. This may create a ""th"" sound if the tongue sticks out between the teeth (an ""interdental"" lisp), or a muffled ""s"" or ""z"" sound if the tongue presses against the back of the teeth (a ""dentalized"" lisp)If this doesn't sound like your speech impediment, skip down to the section below.;
, Bring your teeth together until they almost touch, in a natural biting motion. Part your lips in a small smile., Raise the sides of your tongue so they touch your upper teeth on the sides of your mouth. Bring the tip of your tongue up near the upper front of your mouth, but do not touch it against your teeth. This should form a groove down the center of your tongue, allowing air to flow.It may help to look in a mirror while trying to adopt this position.

, Blow out gently and see what sound results. Pay attention to your tongue. Make sure the tip doesn't push forward against your teeth, and keep the sides touching your upper side teeth.

, If you aren't getting an ""s"" sound yet, focus on the tip of your tongue. Move this slightly as you blow until you feel a current of air over it. When the tip of your tongue is close to the roof of your mouth, you'll likely hear an ""s"" or a sound close to it.


Don't worry if you can't make an s sound on your first try. The steps below will help you adjust to the right position.

, If you're not sure where to put the tip of your tongue, hold a t sound in one long breath instead: t-t-t-t-t-. Now blow air over your tongue as you make this sound. This should get you close to an s sound, and help you identify the difference in tongue position between the t and s sounds.If you're having trouble with this, try saying eeeeet instead. Extend the duration of the t sound until it becomes eeeeeet-t-t-t-s-s-s-s., The z sound uses exactly the same mouth position as an s. Just engage your vocal cords to turn it into a z. You can perform any of the exercises in this section with the z sound as well as the s.

, Practice this sound daily until you can produce an s sound consistently, about 20 times in a row. If possible, practice with a supportive friend or relative who can warn you when your tongue is in the wrong position. Gradually move on to s sounds in more complex sounds and words, one step at a time:Short vowel syllables: ss - aa - ss - aa → sa sa sa (& so so so, etc.)
Long vowel syllables: ss - ay - ss - ay → say say say
Words with s in the beginning, middle, and end (one at a time): sold skateboard, hissing master, gross pass.
Phrases with several s sounds, and eventually sentences.
Work the s sound into conversation, starting in comfortable contexts.

, Self treatment for speech problems has not been well studied, so it's difficult to estimate your progress. If you are not progressing as quickly as you would like, schedule an appointment with a speech language pathologist (also called a speech therapist).It will likely be very difficult to correct a lisp on your own if you have trouble hearing the difference between the correct and incorrect pronunciations."

Stick with clear and succinct vocabulary.,
Use what you know.,
Make helpful references.,
Don’t use filler words.,
Enunciate each word.,
Familiarize yourself with transitions and adjectives.,
Formulate your sentence in advance.,
Overcome speaking and social anxieties.,
Stay relaxed.,
Speak with confidence.,
Slow down your speech.,
Pay attention to the listener.,
Use notes if you need to.,
Practice in front of a mirror.,
Spend more time reading.",How to Speak Eloquently," Although it may not always be the case, a broad vocabulary doesn’t necessarily equate to a strong vocabulary. When it comes to sounding eloquent, less is more. A wordy explanation is not more eloquent than a simple and clear explanation, if they both accomplish the same thing. Don’t add in extra vocab words to sound more intelligent., Make attempts to learn new vocabulary whenever possible, but when you’re speaking, stick to words you know. One of the least eloquent things you can do is misuse a large vocabulary word, or combine too many large vocabulary words and leave your listener confused.

, When applicable, make allusions to things that help explain a thought or idea, or that will otherwise give the listener a better idea of what you’re trying to say. References to pop culture, classic literature and art, and historical people and events are all incredibly helpful and give you an added air of intelligence., Nothing sounds less professional and eloquent than filling up silences and spaces between words with filler words like “um,” “like,” “so,” and “yeah”. Make a conscious effort not to fill up your speeches with these words, and don’t feel like you must insert words into every empty space. If it is helpful, think through exactly what you’re going to say before you say it so that you don’t fall back on these fillers.

, You could have the most eloquent speech in the world prepared, but if you can’t properly enunciate the words in them, your listeners will end up confused and in the dark. Take the necessary time to pronounce each word in your sentence correctly, minimizing an accent if necessary. If you have particular trouble with proper enunciation, hire a voice/speaking coach to help you pronounce words properly.

, One of the common issues people have with speaking, is they end up grasping for words, leaving an awkward pause in their speech, and then they seem unprepared. Beat this by becoming familiar with a list of popular transitions and popular adjectives. If you do forget what you were going to say, it won’t take you as long to supply a word when you can refer to these mental lists.


Common (and eloquent) transitions include furthermore, additionally, moreover, in particular, nevertheless, and despite.Common (and eloquent) adjectives will vary based on what you’re talking about, but may include gorgeous, disgusted, absurd, tasteful, resonant, brief, pleasant, and lovely., In order to prevent stumbling over your thoughts and jumping straight into speech, think about what you’re going to say before you say it. Similar to writing a response, thinking in advance will give you time to formulate exactly what you’re going to say and how you’re going to say it. Just be careful that you don’t script yourself so much that you sound fake or accidentally leave out important words., It will be incredibly difficult to sound eloquent if your voice quivers, you speak too quietly, or you get a stutter when you begin speaking. Take the necessary measures to overcome these social anxieties by visiting a speech pathologist, speech therapist, or a counselor.

, Similar to the aforementioned note on overcoming your anxieties, if you’re uptight, stressed, or look nervous, you won’t perform as eloquently. Do what is necessary in order for you to relax, whether it be imagining your audience in their underwear or simply remembering that the worst thing that could happen is that your audience gets bored (which really isn’t that bad at all). Speaking should come naturally, not feel forced, so let the words flow and don’t worry too much about how to say them or what people are thinking of you.

, Have you ever noticed how people who act confidently automatically seem more charismatic and eloquent? When you speak with confidence, you instill a sense of curiosity in your audience. Even when you don’t feel it, act confident, and your speech will come across more professional and well-spoken. Plus, as you pretend to be confident, you’ll actually start to become more confident. A win-win situation, for sure., Talking too fast will make even the most eloquent of speakers sound anxious and unprepared. When you’re worried about saying something, it is a natural reaction to speed up your spoken words per minute so that you’re done speaking faster. This doesn’t sound professional and makes you seem stressed. Take time to slow down your speech; it is better to speak too slow than to speak too fast.

, Strong speakers make eye contact with their audience on a regular basis, and address their speech to individual people. This shows that they’re not just speaking into the air, but that they care that their audience is listening and truly hearing what they’re saying. When you speak, even if to a single person, make a point to make eye contact with your listener(s) on a regular basis.

, If you’re worried about a public speech rather than just daily conversation, don’t feel guilty about keeping notes on hand. Organizing your thoughts and having them around for brief glances is a great way to keep your speech in order. Don’t use your notes as a script, but rather as a way to quickly remind yourself of key words and phrases that you can insert into your speech to be better understood.

, Yes, it may seem silly, but if you can watch yourself speak you can see what you need to change. Either set up camp in front of a mirror or record yourself speaking into a video camera. This will help you to pinpoint what you do well when you’re speaking, and what you need to improve.

, Reading books not only increases your vocabulary and reading comprehension, it also introduces you to the eloquent and well-spoken characters of fiction and history. Read on a regular basis, and pay particular attention to the things characters say that you find eloquent. You can mimic those speech patterns and behaviors in your own speaking if you so desire.

Take a deep breath.,
Articulate your words.,
Speak more slowly.",How to Speak Clearly1," Calm yourself down before you start speaking, so that your lungs won't run out of air. Distill your thoughts – do not spill them. If you dive into speech without taking time to ground yourself, you may speak more quickly and slur your words. Take the time to center yourself, and proceed mindfully from there.;
, Pronounce each syllable individually. Syll - a - ble. Take it very slowly, at first, until each sound is clear and distinct. Gradually speed up your speech and decrease the space between words until you are speaking normally.Make sure you actually stop the air for consonants like 't' and 'b'. Differentiate between your vowels.
Don't expect to speak with perfect clarity right away. You may need to practice this for several hours each day, and you may need to practice more to master difficult words.
Practice when you're alone – in the car, or walking down the street; when cleaning, or knitting, or standing in front of the mirror. You can slow down your syllables in conversation, but you may make more progress if you devote some serious time to honing your speech.

, It can be incredibly helpful to give your words an extra second or two to fully come out of your mouth. Pausing also works, because pausing allows the person you're speaking to, to digest all of the words you've just said."

Drink plenty of water.,
Drink warm, soothing beverages.,
Avoid coating beverages and foods.,
Try using soothing lozenges.",How to Prevent Your Voice from Cracking1," Staying hydrated will allow you to speak more comfortably, sing more fluidly, and will promote all-around throat health that will strengthen your voice and keep it feeling comfortable. Drink up to eight cups of room temperature water every day.


If you are a screamer, singer, or strain your voice regularly, take it easy on the icy cold water. Drink lukewarm water instead. Imagine getting doused with ice water after a workout. You involuntarily tense up, no matter how awesome it feels.;
, If you suffer from regular voice cracks, it's common to soothe your throat with warm water-based beverages. While milk and other cloying liquids can coat the throat, making it more difficult to speak clearly, teas, coffee, and other hot beverages are all recommended.


One of the most common home remedies is some hot herbal tea, mixed with about a teaspoon of lemon juice and honey. Chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, and licorice root teas are all soothing to the throat.
Don't drink scalding hot tea, which can burn your throat and make it more difficult to speak comfortably. Drink it warm.

, Some foods will tighten your throat and make cracking more likely, while others will coat the mouth and throat,


Spicy foods like chili peppers, curries, and salsas
Oily foods like buttery biscuits, cookies, or other desserts
Fried foods like French fries, fried fish or chicken

, Vocal Zone are a kind of herbal vocal lozenge used by professional singers to keep their voice from cracking before a performance. They work to soothe, numb and clear the throat without giving the effect of drowsiness. These can be much more effective than usual 'common cold' lozenges.


The taste of the lozenge can be somewhat off-putting and medicinal, but the results are substantial for a small amount of unpleasantness.

Pay attention to your tone.,
Joke around with them.,
Use affectionate names.,
Affirm positive behaviors.",How to Speak Kindly to Children2," Children are not yet familiar with the many nuances of vocal tones, but they know a kind voice versus a harsh voice. In general conversation, use a calm, quiet, gentle tone to help the child know you are friendly and to put them at ease.The wrong tone can either keep a child from listening or can overshadow the content of what you say. Make sure your tone invites the child to listen to you.
Practice the kind tone that you want to use with children, and remember it when you start speaking to them.
In general, shy away from sarcasm because children tend to misunderstand it and could take it negatively. Once you know them well, you can use sarcasm sparingly.

, Kids love to laugh and joking with them will build rapport and trust. Joking together will put both of you at ease and open up better lines of communication between you.It’s important to pay attention to the age of the child you’re talking to as you think about how to joke with them. Make sure you’re joking in a way that the child will understand.
Joke about adult responsibilities by saying, ""Haven't you gotten a job yet?"" or ""Can you drive me to the bank?"" This usually cracks kids up.
Act silly like you are trying to find something that is obviously right in front of you, such as putting your glasses on top of your head and asking where they are. Or pretend like you can't do something that's really easy and let the child do it for you.
Also, a simple smile goes a long way with a child!

, Besides using legal names to convey your respect, using loving names like buddy, champ, son, honey, kiddo, and other creates a sense of affection that kids respond to. Names like these show kindness becuase it lets the child know that you care about them.For kids that you spend time with often, you can even ask them what names they like and use those.
Nicknames and abbreviations of their names also show familiarity.

, When kids do well, they need to be told so they can do it again. Use affirming language to tell them that what they did was good.Use simple clear statements such as, “It was nice of you to hold the door for you grandma.” Or, “You did a good job finishing your chores on time.”

"
"
Stay patient when you have to repeat yourself.,
Keep your statements brief.,
Use “I want” statements rather than orders.,
Choose your words carefully.",How to Speak Kindly to Children3," It’s important, first, to make sure that they actually heard you. You may have thought you had their attention, but they may not have been listening. Even if young kids hear you perfectly the first time, it takes time for them to make sense of what you said to them.When it’s appropriate, try using phrases like, “I’m only going to say this once,” to give them a clear warning that you want their attention.
You can also have them repeat back important information to you to help avoid the need to repeat yourself later.

, Kids have short attention spans so it isn’t helpful to them if you talk for a long time, especially if you have a main point you want them to understand. Speak kindly to them by keeping your directives and responses brief enough that listening the whole time and understanding is easy.Instead of saying, ""Hey, what do you want for dinner? I was thinking about making some burgers but I would need to go out to the grocery first. If I do that, I'll have to wait until your dad gets home, but that will mean dinner is going to be later,"" just leave it at the question, ""What do you want for dinner?""
Instead of saying, ""You know I have had a long day and the last thing I want is to come home to this really messy house, especially after I have told you to stop leaving so much stuff around on the floor,"" just say, ""I would like you to clean up, please.""

, Being told what to do can make kids respond by doing the opposite. Get in the habit of using this type of statement instead of simply telling them what to do. Children want to please their parents, but they don’t usually want to be ordered.The statement, “Go take the trash out,” can put them in a place of being disobedient, but saying, “I want you to take the trash out,” gives them the opportunity to please you.

, You never know when something you say will have a huge impact on a kid and stick with them for a long time. If there are moments when you start to get impatient or start to get frustrated, it’s best to stop talking for long enough to regain composure rather than saying something you’ll regret.


Don't mock or harshly correct a child when they pronounce something incorrectly or use a word in the wrong context. This will only make them more hesitant to speak and won't promote trust with you.

Figure out your type of lisp.,
Perfect your t and d first.,
Adopt the butterfly position.,
Attempt the s sound.,
Extend the t and th sounds.,
Place the tongue behind the lower teeth if your s is still slushy.,
Practice your s sounds daily.,
Consider a session with a speech language pathologist.",How to Say the Letter S (for People Who Have Lisps)2," These two types of speech impediments affect the s and z sounds in different ways, but they can be improved by similar exercises. Read this section if you have either of these symptoms:Lateral lisp: s comes out as a ""slushy"" or ""wet"" sound. You hold your tongue in a position similar to an L sound, and this lower position allows air to escape out the sides of your mouth.
Palatal lisp: s comes out as a hy sound, created by the mid-section of your tongue contacting the soft palate way back on the roof of your mouth.

, The exercises below will only work if you can say the sounds t and d.If you have trouble with these as well, your speech impediment may involve difficulty raising your tongue tip, or difficult raising the sides of your tongue. Practice the t and d sounds until you can enunciate them clearly, with no air rushing out the sides of your mouth.Visit a speech language pathologist if you have difficulty with this step.


Any speech exercise may be easier with a partner who can identify when you are making a mistake. If you have trouble noticing the difference between the correct and incorrect forms, self-training may not work well.

, Say a prolonged ""ee"" as in ""steep"" and pay attention to the position of your tongue. The sides of your tongue should press against the upper side teeth. The center of your tongue should be held lower in your mouth, forming a groove above it where air can pass through. If you're having trouble understanding this description, imagine your tongue in the shape of a butterfly: the central strip of your tongue forms the butterfly's narrow body, and the sides of your tongue form its upraised wings.


Have someone else read this description and check whether you have achieved it. Don't try to move on to the next step until you can form this tongue position.Visit a speech language pathologist if you cannot do it.
If you can roll your tongue, you may instead stick your tongue tip forward, then rolling the edges of your tongue up to your upper teeth., Blow air through the groove formed by the butterfly position to attempt an s sound. If you don't get a clear s sound, make a minor adjustment and try again. At this stage the goal is to try out different tongue positions so you can get a physical sense for what works best. Don't expect a perfect s sound on your first session.


If it sounds slushy, press the sides of your tongue harder against your upper teeth. You should feel the air shooting straight forward, not out the sides.
If it sounds like a y or hy, lower the center of your tongue.
If you're not producing much sound at all, raise the front of your tongue close to the roof your mouth, behind the front teeth but not touching them.

, Here are two more exercises which may help your tongue position:Prolong the t sound, then ""blow through"" it, producing a hiss of air: t-t-t-t-t-(blow).
Say the th sound (as in ""thing"") but blow air through it, out the front of your mouth. Move the tip of your tongue backward along the roof of your mouth as you continue to blow.

, Some people with lateral lisps may find it easier to produce a clear s sound with their tongue tip behind the lower front teeth.This may help the mid section of the tongue stay close to the roof of the mouth without touching it, allowing air to pass above it.

, Try the exercises that work best for several sessions a day, each one a few minutes long. Once you get close to a clear s sound, start using these practice sessions for more difficult uses of s. Slowly progress through these stages, moving on only once you can consistently produce s in each context:


Single syllables that contain s, with both long and short vowels.
Single words that contain s, at the front, middle, and end of the word.
Words that contain a single s next to another consonant (snake, eats), and then two consonants (street, pants).
Full sentences, either prepared or read aloud from a book.
Conversation, starting with people you feel comfortable around.
Note — when you feel ready, drop the butterfly approach and other conscious exercises to adjust your tongue shape. Repeat your practice words until you can say them naturally, without thinking about your mouth shape.

, Speech impediments are complicated phenomena. This self-correcting approach has not been well studied, and it's difficult to produce one set of exercises that works for everyone. If feasible, consider an appointment with a professional who can give you advice specific to your situation

Practice your grammar.,
Expand your vocabulary.,
Think before you speak.,
Speak with inflection.",How to Speak Clearly2," If you use poor grammar, your thoughts and ideas may not come across as clearly as you'd like. Speak as though you're composing an essay or a letter: with patience, poise, and precision.


Avoid speaking in run-on sentences. If you let yourself ramble, your listeners might miss the point. Try to break up your thoughts into comprehensible chunks., One apt word can be much clearer than a flurry of circumlocution. Try to find exactly the word you need – then use it effectively. Be careful not to use words incorrectly or out of context; you may obscure the clarity of what you're trying to say, and you will not be taken seriously.


The caveat: you'll need to make sure that the people you're speaking to also know these words. Keep audience in mind. Use simpler words, when possible.
Reading is a great way to expand vocabulary. Read books, articles, essays; read things that fascinate you, and read things that you wouldn't normally read. Whenever you come across a word that you don't know, look it up.
Try keeping a list of useful, powerful words. The more you use them in context, the more natural it will feel – and the better your word-selection may become.

, If you prepare your words, you may run less risk of slipping up. Even if you don't plan out the exact words that you're going to say, you can take a moment to think through your ideas and clarify them in your mind.


Silently say the words to yourself before you say them aloud. This might help you ensure that you've gotten the pronunciation right.

, Questions should ascend in pitch at the end. Statements should inflect somewhat deeper, with finality. Notice which syllables and words get emphasis. Try exaggerating your inflection, the way you would if you were reading a story to a small child."
"
Practice saying tongue twisters.,
Repeat the phrases over and over.,
Be confident in your speech.",How to Speak Clearly3," If you work on phrases that are difficult to pronounce, you may find it easier to speak clearly in everyday conversation. Start slowly, and gradually work your way up to a normal pace. Identify problem syllables: if you notice that you have trouble enunciating your ""B"" sounds, try saying tongue twisters that play on the ""B"" syllable.For ""B"" words, try: Bill had a billboard. Bill also had a board bill. The board bill bored Bill, so Bill sold his billboard and paid his board bill. Then the board bill no longer bored Bill, but though he had no board bill, neither did he have his billboard!

For ""D"" words, try: Did Doug dig David's garden or did David dig Doug's garden? or Do drop in at the Dewdrop Inn.

For ""F"" sounds, try: Four furious friends fought for the phone or Five flippant Frenchmen fly from France for fashions.

For ""J"" sounds, try: James just jostled Jean gently or Jack the jailbird jacked a jeep.


, Start very slowly and clearly, enunciating each syllable: ""Five flipp-ant French-men fly from France for fash-ions."" Get faster and faster while maintaining clarity. If you trip over words, stop and start again. With determined practice, you may learn to conquer difficult syllables.

, Don't be afraid to speak loudly and clearly. Reciting anything that someone else has written—poems, books, tongue twisters—is great for practicing confidence. Follow through with your words: finish as strong as you start! Be sure of what you intend to say, and the meaning will shine through.


If you tend to mumble or slur your words, it can be difficult to break from the pattern and speak clearly. When you recite words, try to forget about the fact that you are speaking. Focus only on the words, their meaning, their beauty. Try not to overthink it."

Understand why your voice is cracking.,
Breathe from the belly.,
Speak slowly and deliberately.,
Speak and sing in your normal voice.,
Relax.,
Warm your voice up before you speak.",How to Prevent Your Voice from Cracking2," A voice crack is most commonly associated with a boy entering puberty, which can occur any time between the ages of 10 and 16. Some boys will pass through puberty and never notice vocal cracking, while others will experience it for long periods of time. Depending on your age and your circumstances, your voice may be cracking for a variety of reasons, some of which are manageable and some of which need to be waited out.When boys go through puberty, the testosterone production is increased drastically to promote rapid growth in the body, the larynx (or ""voice box"") included. When the larynx gets bigger, the voice becomes deeper and more resonant, but it can take a while for the body to get used to the rapid changes. Eventually, your voice will settle into its new, and usually deeper, range.
For girls, vocal cracks most commonly occur when the voice is strained during singing or from other periods of intense usage. Risky behaviors like smoking and abusing alcohol can also put a strain on the voice, resulting in the occasional crack. Strengthening the vocal chords via singing exercises and eliminating risky behaviors is the best way to avoid vocal cracking.

, When you lie on your back, you'll breathe somewhat differently than you will when you're standing upright, taking deeper breaths from the core, which can help to strengthen your projection and your voice. ""Belly-breathing"" is a technique often taught to public speakers and singers alike, and you can learn to do it too.


Practice lying on the ground with one or two books on the belly and watching them go up and down while one is breathing. Now, try standing up in front of a mirror and watching your belly grow big and small during talking or singing. That means you're breathing properly, reducing the pressure on the vocal cords and the larynx.

, Pubescent boys and singers both tend to crack when speaking emotionally or in a rush. To speak clearly and decrease the possibility of your voice cracking, slow down, take deep breaths, and try to speak deliberately. Don't rush.


Don't hesitate when you speak and try to keep your tone as even as possible. Commit to the thought and the words that you're going to say and move forward. Think of it like moving through mud: just keep going.
Make sure you don't spread your vowels when you sing. Words like ""light"" are diphthongs, which means they have two vowel sounds in one of the letters (lah-eet). To ensure minimal voice cracking, exaggerate the initial vowel sound rather than the second. Throw the second vowel sound on at the end of the word quickly, making sure you hold the word for its full note value.

, Don't try to speak in a lower or higher voice if you feel your voice changing. While, during puberty, this can be harder and harder to find. Speaking in your range is the best way to avoid vocal cracks.


For singers, it's common to want to stretch your range. Do this in rehearsals and practice, not when you're trying to perform. If you're not confident you can hit a note, practice expanding your range, don't try to stick the note for the first time in front of the rest of the choir.
Try not to get frustrated if your voice cracks occasionally. It's a normal part of growing up for lots of people, a sign only that your body is changing and that you're turning into a grown up.

, Your voice naturally gets higher when you are tense. If you are speaking before a crowd, try to relax and take deep breaths. Try not to be nervous, this will cause air to move irregularly through your larynx, causing the pitch to fluctuate. Calm down.


If you have to give a big public performance or speech, give your voice a big rest before the event. Try not to talk loudly or raise your voice.

, If you tend to crack a lot during performances make sure that in your warm ups you do lip drills before you go up the scale of your vocal range.


Try lip drills, slowly going up and down the scale as high is possible while buzzing your lips. Doing this drill every day will expand your vocal range and make your voice stronger and bolder in places where you might usually crack.

Taking shallow breaths uses only the air in your lungs, which causes you to run out of air quicker than you want. This makes the muscles in your throat tense up, which puts strain on your voice and prevents it from carrying to your audience.Instead, you should be taking deep breaths using your diaphragm.;
, In order to breathe for projection, you need to be standing totally erect, without slouching in order to let the most air in as you breathe. The only thing that should be moving is your stomach as you inhale and exhale.


If your shoulders and chest rise when you inhale, you are breathing using only your lungs, which prevents proper projection., As you inhale, place your hand on your belly, feel it expand. You want to make sure your chest doesn't move as you inhale, this indicates that you're not breathing with your diaphragm. You should feel as though your entire abdominal cavity is filling up with air as you inhale.

, Taking deep breaths requires proper use of your diaphragm. To project your speaking voice, you're going to need to be able to breathe deeper and take more breaths. There are several ways to practice breathing skills.


Yawn to open your chest and larynx. Big yawns help us open up our chest to facilitate a deep breath. Stretch your torso while you do it, and make big vowel sounds as you expel the breath to practice projecting as you speak.
Laugh. There’s a reason a good laugh is referred to as a “gut buster.” Laughing is a function performed by diaphragm, and is a fun way to practice the deep breaths necessary to project your voice. Laugh heartily, using big open vowel sounds as you expel your breath. Alternatively, laugh with your mouth closed. This makes it harder to use only the breath in your chest so you learn to utilize the diaphragm instead.
Count or say whole sentences in a single breath. The higher the number you reach or the longer the sentence, the more you will need to use your diaphragm to support it., Being in shape has many health benefits, one of which is better respiratory function and breathing. Spending about 30 minutes a day on a treadmill or performing some other form of cardio is a healthy way to facilitate better breathing. Yoga in particular, can help you learn to control your breath more accurately., In order for a word to be properly pronounced and enunciated, it must be accurately formed, completed, and supported by your breathing.Now that you know how to breath correctly, are you clearly pronouncing each syllable in each word? Most of us don’t practice proper enunciation in casual conversation, but it is crucial for voice projection.


Pay attention to how you pronounce words ending in ‘ing’ like driving, drinking, or working. Say them out loud. Did you pronounce them as ‘driv-in’, ‘drink-in’, and ‘work-in’? Failing to enunciate the last syllable of the word causes you to mumble which inhibits voice projection.Actors in Shakespearean plays--who need to project their voices across auditoriums--are known to enunciate so much that they actually spit on the first few rows! Enunciation to this degree is unnecessary, but exaggerated enunciation will definitely help your audience understand what you are saying., Have you ever met someone who spoke in a monotone voice? Ever notice how hard it was to follow what they were saying because of their lack of emphasis and energy? Another aspect to good voice projection is making sure you're putting enough energy and emphasis behind your words. It might feel weird or as though you're over emphasizing, but if you're breathing properly it will come across naturally to your audience.

, Over exaggerate your words by stretching your cheeks. Make your lips more nimble with lip and tongue exercises that require opening your vowels and making your consonants clearer and better enunciated.


Stretch your cheeks to open your mouth as wide as possible, then smile as big as you can. To exercise your tongue, practice rolling your R's.

, Try repeating “diction is done with the tip of the tongue and the teeth” or “red leather, yellow leather” out loud until you’re able to enunciate every syllable properly., Poor posture causes shallow breathing which harms your voice projection. You should also avoid slumping shoulders and slouching as these cause your words to be pointed towards the floor rather than your audience.Stand straight with your chin up and shoulders back to project your voice out to the audience.
Sitting can make voice projection more difficult, so proper posture is critical. Make sure to sit towards the front edge of your chair with your back as straight and elongated as possible. Pretend there is a string at the top of your head holding it up and straight.

, Some people think of projecting their voice as pushing to make it louder, but that only causes strain to your vocal cords, exasperating the problem. Instead, you want to make your voice larger.When pushing your voice to project, you'll feel strain in your throat as you do after yelling. When making your voice bigger, you'll feel your chest doing the work.Imagine that your throat and mouth are huge, as big as the room you’re speaking in. This will help the muscles inside your throat pull away and relax as they do when you yawn, so a bigger voice can emerge.

, Never cover your mouth when you speak- any object between your mouth and the person you talk to will obstruct your voice even more. It’s also helpful to avoid fillers such as “um” or “uh” as these tend to make your voice trail off instead of project outward.

, Studying yourself while you speak will help you identify any possible pitfalls you may be succumbing to. Watch to see if you bring your hand up to cover your mouth, or if you start to slouch and look at the ground. Being able to see pitfalls in real time helps you learn to quickly fix them.

, Like the mirror trick, recording yourself to play back later will help you hear whether you’re on the right track, or if you’re pushing your voice instead of making it bigger. If you're pushing, your voice tends to sound strained and a bit higher in pitch than normal. Making your voice bigger should result in a slightly deeper and broader sound when played back."

Practice breathing into your diaphragm.,
Release your jaw.,
Breathe through a stirring straw while practicing your vocal range.,
Trill your lips.,
Hum.,
Stretch your tongue for better articulation.,
Improve your diction with tongue twisters.,
Ease any tension in your voice by saying “Hooty Gees.” Saying “hooty gees” will help to relax your larynx and this may improve the quality of your singing voice.,
Balance your vocal resonance with “ooh-oh-uh-ahs.” Making these vowel sounds will help you to practice singing with your mouth in different positions.,
Exercise your voice twice per day.",How to Improve Your Voice1," Using your diaphragm when you speak and sing is essential for actors and singers. Your diaphragm is in the area just underneath your sternum (where your ribs meet). By breathing into your diaphragm and using this breath when you sing your voice will have more power.Breathing into your diaphragm instead of into your chest will also reduce strain on your vocal cords.


To practice diaphragmatic breathing, take a breath into your abdomen. You should feel your abdomen expand as you breathe in. Then, release the breath slowly with a hissing sound. Try to keep your shoulders and neck relaxed as you breathe.You can also place your hands on your abdomen as you breathe in. If your hands rise when you take in a breath, then you are breathing into your abdomen.;
, Taking tension out of your jaw will allow you to open your mouth wider when you speak or sing, which may result in a clearer voice. To remove the tension from your jaw, push on your cheeks with the heel of your hands just below the jawline. Draw your hands down toward your chin, then start back at the top massaging your jaw muscles.Allow your mouth to gently open as you draw your hands downward.

, Practicing your vocal range can also help to improve your voice for singing. To practice your vocal range, place a stirring straw between your lips and start to make a low “oo” sound. Slowly start to increase the pitch of the “oo” sound. Go from the bottom of your vocal range to the top of your vocal range.The air that doesn’t fit through the straw presses down on your vocal chords.
This exercise is helpful for reducing swelling around the vocal chords.

, Trilling your lips is also a good way to exercise your voice and give it a clearer sound. With your lips gently closed, blow air through them while making the “uh” sound. Your lips will vibrate together from the air that is released.The air trapped inside your mouth will close your vocal cords, allowing them to gently come together., Humming is an effective way to warm up your voice and to cool it down after using it for a long performance. To start, close your lips and relax your jaw. Inhale through your nose and let the breath out on a hum. Start by making a nasal “mmm,” then move the hum down through the lower part of your register.This exercise activates the vibrations in your lips teeth and facial bones.

, Stretching your tongue can make it easier to articulate your words, which is essential for stage actors. To stretch your tongue, press your tongue against your palate, then stick it out of your mouth. Press it against one cheek, then the other. Place the tip of your tongue behind your bottom lip and fold the rest out of your mouth, then fold your tongue backward with the tip on your palate.Repeat these exercises 10 times in a row.

, Saying tongue twisters may also improve your ability to speak clearly because it gives you practice enunciating. Tongue twisters will also exercise the muscles in your lips, face, and tongue, which can benefit your voice. Make sure that you exaggerate the sounds of each word that you speak as you say the tongue twisters.


Start slowly and progressively speed up your recitation of the phrases.
Practice “P” words by reciting “Peter Piper picked a peck of piquant peppers.”
For “N” and “U” words, try, “You know New York. You need New York. You know you need unique New York.”
Give your tongue a workout by repeating, “Red leather, yellow leather” over and over.

, Try to say the word “gees” like you are Yogi Bear. As you do, you may feel your larynx drop. Having your larynx in this lowered position gives you more control over your vocal cords, so you might find it easier to hit a higher note after doing this exercise.Repeat this exercise a few times.

, Start with one sound and then transition all the way through the ooh, oh, uh, and ah sounds to give your voice a good workout. Doing this may make it easier for you to hit a higher note or to keep your voice stable while you are singing.Repeat this exercise a few times per day.

, To improve your voice for speaking on a stage and for singing, you will need to exercise it on a regular schedule. Warm your voice before using it extensively, but also practice vocal exercises twice per day for best results.


Try setting aside 15 minutes to do vocal exercises when you wake up, or do them while you are getting ready for work or school. Then do them again before you go to bed, such as while you are making dinner or taking a bath.

Project your voice.,
Enunciate your lines.,
Use emotion to emphasize your lines.",How to Improve Your Voice2," Speaking loudly and clearly is essential for stage actors. When you deliver your lines, make sure that you are speaking loudly enough that people will be able to hear what you are saying, even at the back of the theater. However, it is important to use your diaphragm to project rather than yelling. If you yell, then your throat will get sore and you may lose your voice.Take a deep breath into your diaphragm and then try practicing breathing out and saying “ha” at the same time. This will help you to identify your diaphragm. You should feel the breath coming from your abdomen and out through your mouth as you say “ha.” After you have mastered this, try speaking your lines using your diaphragmatic breath.

, Speaking your lines clearly is also important for a good acting voice. Make sure that you are enunciating each word of your lines so that people will understand what you are saying. To ensure that you are speaking as clearly as possible, open your mouth as wide as you can when you speak. This will help you to enunciate your lines., Emoting is also an important part of delivering your lines well.To emote, try to think about what your character’s emotions should look like.


For example, if you are saying something that makes the character feel sad, then you might slow down the pace of your lines slightly. You might even allow your voice to register the emotion of sadness more dramatically by speaking with a bit of a trembling voice.
Consider the appropriate emotion for each of your character’s lines to determine how your voice should sound when you speak them.

Analyze your current speaking voice.,
Adjust the volume of your voice.,
Use pitch to your advantage.,
Change your tempo.,
Show your emotions when appropriate.,
Practice your speech.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Improve Your Voice3," Record yourself speaking or ask a friend to listen and evaluate your speaking voice. Assess your volume, pitch, articulation, vocal quality and rate to determine the main areas where you need improvement.Is your volume too high or too low?
Is your pitch more shrill or full, monotonous or varied?
Is your vocal quality more nasal or full, breathy or clear, lifeless or enthusiastic?
Is your articulation hard to understand or crisp and articulated?
Do you speak too slow or too quickly? Do you sound hesitant or deliberate?

, You should always speak loudly enough so that everyone in the room can hear you. However, adjusting the volume of your voice up or down can add emphasis or intimacy to different parts of your speech.Get louder as you are about to make an important point.
Lower your voice when you are making an aside.

, People might tune out your voice if it sounds monotonous. Varying your pitch will eliminate a monotonous sound and make it more likely that they will keep listening to you. Continue to vary your pitch throughout your speech. Some common ways to use pitch include:Ending questions on a higher pitch.
Affirming a statement by ending on a lower pitch.

, The tempo is the pace of your speech. Slowing the tempo of your speech will help you to place more emphasis on certain words and phrases. It may also make it easier for people to understand you if you are prone to speaking rapidly.Try pausing after making an important point to give the listener a chance to absorb it.

, Have you ever heard someone’s voice quiver when they are experiencing strong emotions during a speech? This can be an effective technique in some situations, such as when you are giving a speech or acting in a play. Allow the timber, or emotional quality of your voice, to show when you are expressing strong feelings.For example, if you are saying something that makes you feel sad, then you might allow your voice to tremble if it comes naturally. However, do not try to force it.

, Before you get in front of an audience to present your speech, practice it alone and uninhibited. Experiment with variations in tone, pace, volume and pitch. Record yourself and listen for what is working and not working.Practice the speech several times with different variations. Record each attempt and compare them.
Many people are uncomfortable hearing themselves on tape. This sounds different that the voice that resonates in your head, but is closer to the voice other people hear.

, When you are speaking for long stretches of time or at a high volume, it is important to keep your throat and vocal cords lubricated. Avoid beverages that can dehydrate you, such as coffee, soda and alcohol.Drink water instead.


Try keeping a glass of water close by while you are speaking.

Open your jaw for vowel sounds.,
Keep your chin down.,
Incorporate vibrato into your singing.,
Find your range.,
Add one note to your range.",How to Improve Your Voice4," Take your ring and index fingers and place them underneath your jawbone on either side of your face. Draw your jaw down two inches. Sing all five vowels, A E I O U, while holding your jaw in place.Try putting a cork or plastic bottle cap between your back molars to hold your jaw in place.
Continue this exercise to get it into your muscle memory until you don’t need to physically hold your jaw in place.

, As your voice rises, you may be tempted to lift your chin up to get more power. Lifting your chin can help to strengthen you voice for a moment, but it can also have a negative effect on your voice over time. Instead, try tilting your chin down while you sing.Try singing escalating scales in front of a mirror. Tilt your chin slightly down before you begin and focus on keeping it down even as the scales move up in range.
Keeping your chin down gets rid of strain on your voice while giving you more power and control.

, Vibrato is a beautiful, yet sometimes difficult sound to achieve. However, you can develop the ability to sing in a vibrato voice by practicing the technique.Press your hands to your chest and lift your chest higher than normal.
Breathe in, and then exhale without moving your chest.
As you exhale, sing “ahhh” on a single note. Hold the note for as long as possible.
Half way through singing the note, press on your chest while imagining the air spinning in your mouth.

, You can find your range by singing along with the keys on a keyboard. Play middle C on a keyboard. This is the white key to the left of the two black notes in the middle of the keyboard. Sing “la” as you play each key to the left, while matching the tone in your voice. Continue as far down the keyboard as you can, comfortably matching the notes until you feel strain or can’t reach the note. Make note of the key you end on. This is the bottom of your range.Work your way back up the keyboard until you find the note which marks the top of your range.

, Once you have found your vocal range, try adding one note on either end until you can comfortably match it. You may not be able to hold the note at first, but focus on hitting the note 8 to 10 times each practice until you are comfortable reaching the new notes in your range.Once you can sustain the new note for a significant amount of time, you can move on to adding the next higher and lower notes to your range.
Have patience and don’t rush this process. It is best to control the sound and be able to hit the note consistently.

Stretch the time you have and use it to prepare yourself and consider what your opening lines will be.Most of the time when you’re giving an impromptu speech, you’ll be singled out to say a few words on the spot. Since you’ll only have a few moments, preparing yourself is more about getting yourself in the right state of mind than it is knowing exactly what you’re going to say.If you really need to milk it, you can buy yourself some extra time by shaking hands, exchanging pleasantries or adjusting the microphone stand before speaking.;
, Take a few slow, deep breaths to collect yourself. Let your mind settle so you can concentrate on the task at hand. Shut out all unnecessary distractions that might steal your attention and stifle anxious thoughts that might cause you to doubt yourself.Assume that everyone around you wants to see you succeed. This will help put you at ease. Expecting yourself to fail will only destroy your composure and make you more fearful of your audience.
Confront the reality of your situation to avoid being blindsided by panic. Accept that you have to give a speech and then focus all your resources on giving a good one.

, Face your audience boldly and smile. Make eye contact with those closest to you. Display confident body language—try not to fidget, tremble or arrange yourself awkwardly. Think positive thoughts to reassure yourself. For you to come off as interesting, witty and engaging, you have to believe that you are.Oftentimes, the more confident you make yourself appear, the more confident you’ll feel.
Relax! Speaking in front of a crowd is not that big a deal. Even if you make a mistake, it’s not the end of the world.

, In a few words, let everyone know who you are. Tell them your name and describe yourself and your relation to the event or role as a speaker. You might also thank everyone for their presence and attention. Don’t avert to the fact that you’re unprepared or try to cushion their acceptance of your speech. Just get up and talk frankly and energetically.Don’t just jump right into the main idea of your speech. Test the waters by getting used to speaking and sharing a little about yourself first.

, Have a clear subject in mind and keep yourself focused on conveying your message. Talk about what you know; avoid topics you’re uninformed or ambivalent about. Don’t be too rigid or overcomplicate the structure of your speech. Instead, let your thoughts and words flow, reeling them in when they start to wander.Use simple sentences that follow a logical progression and enunciate your words carefully to keep yourself from getting tongue-tied.
Slowing yourself down a little will give your mind time to catch up and formulate new ideas., An impromptu speech should be short and sweet. It’s best to limit your address to right around or just under two minutes, but even a speech as short as 90 seconds or a minute will be perfectly adequate. Be considerate of your audience’s attention span. If you draw things out for too long, they’ll start to grow disinterested and your speech will lose gumption.Two minutes will fly by once you start speaking. Despite your reservations about being put on the spot, you may actually find it harder to give a short speech than a long one.

, Give your speech a well-rounded sense of structure. Just like every story you’ve ever read, a good speech should have a definite beginning, middle and end. Speaking from experience is a plus, as it will make your message feel more personal and prevent you from making factual mistakes.A good way to give your speech a solid beginning, middle and end is to present details chronologically. For example start with “when I first became friends with John, he…”, follow that up with “now that we’re coworkers, we have more fun than ever…” and conclude with “I have no doubt that the future of our friendship will be just as entertaining.”
When describing personal experiences, avoid sharing opinions on irrelevant controversial subjects.

, Work a lighthearted joke or reference into the opening of your speech to disarm the crowd. Humor is effective for cutting through the tension of speaking unexpectedly, or anticipating a nervous speaker. Tasteful wit will help warm your listeners up toward you, keep things from being too serious and make the whole experience more enjoyable.Humor is a great icebreaker and also makes it easier to hold your audience’s attention.
Be sure any jokes you make are suitable for the age and demographic of your audience, as well as the occasion itself.

, In the few moments you have before you go on, get an idea of how you’re going to finish your speech. It can be easy to ramble on and on without the aid of a predetermined stopping point. With your main ideas out of the way, you should start thinking about wrapping things up. Ideally, you’ll be able to transition deftly from the introduction to the meat of the speech to the conclusion with little wasted time or words.As with the rest of your speech, keep your conclusion brief. It’s alright to sign off with a simple “thank you for your time” or “let’s hear it for the newlyweds.”

, Save your most compelling point, touching memory or hilarious anecdote for last. Deliver your closing remarks with strong language and poise. The final part of your speech will make the most impact with your audience because it will be freshest in their minds, so bring it home with something memorable to leave a lasting impression.If you’re planning on making a specific request or appeal, as for a business conference, the end of your speech is the proper time to do it.
The conclusion is the perfect occasion to come out with something especially heartfelt. Emotions will run high and the crowd will be moved by your sentiments.

, At the end of your address, show your appreciation for your audience by thanking them once again. Then, pass the baton to the master of ceremonies gracefully and return to your seat. Even if things didn’t go as well as you’d hoped, resist the urge to make apologies or excuses. This will just undermine what effect the speech did have.You don’t have to thank every important figure at the event individually. A general expression of gratitude is all that’s needed.
Be clear who you’re supposed to hand the microphone or floor off to so that you don’t end your speech by looking around in confusion., Very few people are capable of delivering rousing, inspiring, world-changing orations on the fly. Your audience knows this and will have taken it into account. Don’t beat yourself up for drawing a blank or stuttering here and there. Instead, congratulate yourself for having had the courage to go through with something that would petrify most people.Impromptu speeches are mostly appraised by the willingness of the speaker to rise to the occasion. There’s no sense in being too critical of your performance since you’ll have had no time to work on it beforehand.

Pronounce technical words without focusing on the Texas accent.,
Expect local variations.",How to Imitate a Texan Accent," Like most vowels in a Texan accent, move the pronunciation of “i” to the back of your mouth, where it will lose the “ee” sound of a non-Texan “i” pronunciation, and take the aspirated “hhh” of Southern and Texan speech. In general, Texan vowels are homogenized and made to sound like one another.For example: “I’m taykin’ a look” becomes “Ah’m taykin’ a look.” To get to “ah’m” sound, just draw out the letter “i” and shape the vowel in the back of your mouth. It also helps to aspirate (breathe out when pronouncing) the “h” sound in “ah’m.”
Use “ah” instead of the long “i” when pronouncing the first-person pronoun.;
, You can’t just drop a “g” sound when it’s part of a multisyllabic word, so to sound Texan, change the “ee” sound to an “aahh” sound. When the “-ing” is found within a word, say ‘-ang’.


For example, “singing” would be pronounced: “sang-in’.”
Do not drop “middle” g’s, again: “swinging” is “swayng-in’.”

, This is a classic hallmark of a Texan accent—and of Southern accents in general.In a Texan accent, the open vowel sound of “i” (pronounced in the front of the mouth with the front of the tongue), and the “eee” sound (made by pushing your tongue up and forward) both move to the back of the mouth and tongue.


To this effect, the words “pen” and “pin” should sound identical. Both are pronounced like “pin.”

, In what is often the most over-exaggerated aspect of the Texan accent, the “a” vowel (and others, when pronounced similarly) is drawn out into a soft “y” sound in the famous Texas drawl.


If you want to practice the feeling of the pronunciation, pick a word with a long “a” sound, like “brain.” As you pronounce the “a,” lift your tongue back and up in your mouth, so the word sounds more like “brayyn.”
Even in multisyllabic words like “toothpaste,” linger on the “ay” sound in the middle of the word: “tooth-paayste.”
When imitating a Texas accent, avoid focusing solely on the drawl. This effect is often stereotyped, and sometimes used for negative comedy or to make the Texas accent sound unintelligent or uneducated.

, This is the most effective means to alter the shape of your mouth and the placement of your tongue, in order to achieve the almost-nasal quality of a Texas accent.This jaw and tongue placement will also make your vowel pronunciation sound more Texan, as it will flatten the vowel sounds (make them all sound more alike).

, People with a heavy Texan accent almost always drop the g’s in their speech.Part of the reason for this is due to the drawn-out vowels of Texan speech; it’s hard to pronounce a strong “g” at the end of a word with a long vowel.


For example: “I’m taking a book” becomes “I’m taykin’ a book.”

, Due to Texas’s function as a linguistic “melting pot” and strong regional differences in accent and pronunciation, the same words will be pronounced differently across the state. The Spanish language influences both vocabulary and pronunciation in the southwest part of Texas; Spanish terms like “Gracias” and “amigo” are liberally used in Texan English.Texas speakers add and drop sounds from words, for example: “bowie” is pronounced like “boo-wie.” The best way to learn which pronunciations to change is to listen to Texans speak and imitate their inflections.

, An important part of a Texan dialect and accent is the slang that Texan speakers use—more specifically, the means by which Texan speakers create their dialect and slang.To some, Texas slang may sound mashed together or slurred.


For example, in what is perhaps the most well-known Texan/Southern slang term, say “y’all” instead of “you all.”
The polite replies “yes, sir” and “no, sir” are shortened in to “yessir” and “nosir.”

, Texan speech, even aside from its pronunciation and vowel inflections, is rich and imaginative. Speakers often replace literal statements with country-tinged metaphors, which results in humorous and expressive phrases.You can say things like:


“I wouldn’t trust any farther than I could throw him!” This simply means that you don’t trust the individual.
“I’m madder than a wet hen!” This means you’re furious.
“More than you can shake a stick at.” This means that you have large quantities of the stated object.

, “Fixin’” is used in two senses: the common use of “to repair” (“This weekend I’m fixin’ my car.”) and the Texas-specific meaning of “intending to do something.”If someone has a plan to complete a future activity, they’ll use “fixin’” to indicate their intent: “I’m fixin’ to visit the lake this weekend.”


“Fixin’” is also commonly used to refer to food, specifically dressings and sauces. If you order your hamburger with “all the fixin’s,” you’ll receive onions, relish, cheese, tomato, ketchup, and mustard, among other options., Especially among younger and well-educated Texans, the majority of technical, academic, and business terms are learned in school, so the pronunciation will match up with standard American pronunciation.


“Home spun” wordings from childhood are more likely to fall into the categories of colloquialism or jargon. Vegetables are commonly referred to as “produce,” but pronounced “perduce.”

, Since Texas is a large and well-populated state, influenced on its east side by the dialects of the South, on its inland areas by the Midwest accent, and on its south and west by Mexican Spanish, it’s no surprise that there are major accent dialect and accent differences within the state.Dallas, as one of the largest Texan cities, also has a unique accent.
Since all major Texan cities have seen large amounts of international (and inter-state) immigration in recent decades, many traditional accent and speech patterns are no longer frequently found among people under 40."

Practice proper breathing.,
Incorporate proper breathing into your speaking.,
Relax your body and your voice.,
Practice your pitch.,
Avoid nasal speech.,
Speak more melodiously.,
Work on articulation and enunciation.,
Project from your mask.,
Do a vocal strength training workout.",How to Improve Your Speaking Voice," To produce a smooth, powerful, and natural voice, you must first learn proper breathing techniques. While humans are meant to breathe and speak from their diaphragms, many people do this with their chests instead, and this produces a weaker voice. You know you're a chest breather if you take a breath and your chest and shoulders rise.To correct this and to teach your body to breathe from the diaphragm:Breathe in deeply for four seconds, making sure you breathe into your diaphragm. After four seconds, hold the air in your diaphragm for another four seconds before exhaling for a count of four seconds. Repeat this exercise for two minutes every day. Work your way up to practicing this technique for five minutes a day.
Once you're comfortable with the four second breathing, you can practice the same technique, but extend the inhale, hold, and exhale to 20 seconds each. You only need to do this once daily.;
, As you teach your body the proper breathing technique, you can start working on speaking from your diaphragm as well. To do this, take a deep breath into your diaphragm and practice speaking as you exhale and your belly flattens. As you begin to run out of air, take another deep breath and speak again, but be sure you only speak as your belly is flattening.When possible, always breathe through your nose. Air inhaled through the nose is moister and better for your vocal chords and vocal strength.

, Muscle tension in the body and throat or emotional stress can all wreak havoc on your voice, and this can lead to a thin and nasally voice that has no resonance (doesn’t carry well). The breathing exercises will hopefully calm your body and mind, and you can relax your throat by:


Yawning deeply, and as you finish the yawn, begin humming. Open your jaw to a comfortable width and move your jaw from side to side as you hum. Do this for a few minutes, then use your fingers to massage your throat., It’s important to speak in your natural pitch because trying to talk in a higher or lower pitch can damage your vocal chords, and it will affect your resonance. Moreover, a good pitch will result in a much more pleasant speaking voice, and while it may be difficult to change your natural pitch, you can make your voice fuller and deeper, and give it more character by working with the pitch you have.To take advantage of your natural pitch, be sure you are relaxed when you're going to speak. Stress can put tension on your muscles, including your vocal chords, and this can make your voice high-pitched and squeaky.Breathe from your diaphragm when you're speaking, because this will allow you to project your voice properly and fully.
Resonance in your body is what will give your voice base and depth, because the air in your body vibrates in different cavities, such as the nose, throat, chest, and mouth, and these areas create different sound qualities. To have a full and deep voice, you have to resonate the air in all those cavities. For instance, if you only use the nasal cavity, you will have a higher and more nasally voice.

, Having a nasal voice means your voice won’t be as deep, rich, or full as it should be. You can determine if you have a nasal voice by placing your fingers on the bridge of your nose and saying the words “rung” and “mom.” You should feel the bridge vibrate when you say those words. Now say the words “sour,” “bracelet,” and “tiger.” If you felt the same vibration in your nose, you are speaking with a nasal voice. To prevent this:Concentrate on using the full range of motion with your lips, jaw, teeth, and tongue when you speak. When you don’t use the full range of motions with these articulators, you are more likely to focus sound in your nasal cavity rather than your mouth.

, A melodious voice is one that conveys change, emotion, and life, whereas a non-melodious voice is flat and monotonous. You can work on having more melody in your voice by varying your pitch variety as you speak.Many speakers naturally do this when posing questions: when people speak, they indicate a question by raising the pitch of the voice on the final syllables of the phrase.
Practice saying the phrase “you are going there” in three different ways: the first way is without changing your inflection (a statement), the second way is by slightly raising the pitch of your voice with each word (a question), and the third is by slightly lowering the pitch with each word (emphatic). Say the phrase out loud and see how it conveys different meanings.
To practice incorporating these changes into every day speech, read aloud to yourself every day, and focus on varying the pitch of your voice on different words to convey different emotions.

, If you mumble or don’t articulate properly, your words will be unclear when you speak and people will have a hard time understanding you. The keys to clear articulation are forming the sound to make the word accurately, supporting the sound with your breath, and finishing the sound completely. Articulation and enunciation exercises include:Tongue exercise: Fold your tongue back as though you were trying to touch the back of your throat. Stretch it as far back as you can, then stick it out of your mouth as far as possible. Repeat 10 times.
Jaw exercise: using broad movements with your jaws and an exaggerated motion with your tongue and jaw, repeat each of the following syllables five times: bah, mah, wah, fah, pah, dah, jah, lah, kwah, sah, thah, see, so, soo, zee, zo, zoo
Lip exercise: say the following tongue twister, focusing on articulating each word: “To sit in solemn silence in a dull dark dock; In a pestilential prison with a life long lock; Awaiting the sensation of a short sharp shock; From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block.” As you improve, say it faster and faster., The mask is the area of your face that includes the lips, the side of the nose, and the bridge of the nose, and this is the area from which your voice should come. To find this area, say mmm-hmm over and over. Place your hands on your lips and move the sound around until you feel your mask vibrating. To project from this area:


Say mmm-hmm one, mmm-hmm two, mmm-hmm three, and take note of whether your mask is vibrating when you say the numbers. If not, work on moving the sound around until your mmm-hmms and your numbers are coming from your mask., To help project your voice better and produce a strong, powerful voice, try strength exercises. To do this, inhale deeply and slowly exhale as you make a hissing sound. Repeat this 10 times daily.You can also try saying “ney” 10 times, but the trick is to say it loudly without yelling, and to say it in different pitches as you work up and then down your vocal range.

Understand the expected format.,
Consider your audience.,
Find out what technology is provided and what you need to bring.,
Create audience-friendly slides and visual aids.,
Circulate any materials in advance, if needed.,
Practice giving your seminar using your outline.,
Arrive to the seminar location early.",How to Give a Seminar1," Seminars can come in a variety of forms. Talk with the organizer of the session and ask them about their expectations for your talk. They may want you to discuss a pre-circulated paper. Or, perhaps they would prefer that you give a speech with less audience interaction.You might ask, “Are you looking for a lecture format that is focused on research or a more interactive audience experience?”;
, Know who you will be speaking to and tailor your information to their interest and experience levels. If you are unfamiliar with the group, ask the seminar organizer to give you a bit of information about the possible backgrounds of audience members. If you have worked with this group before, then use the information that you know about them to tailor your talk to what will help them, and you, the most.For example, in a scientific talk before a group of specialists, you may not need to explain all of your jargon and can jump into in-depth topics more quickly.Depending on your audience, you may also choose to directly engage with controversial topics or shy away from them.
You can even get to the venue a bit early and try to talk with some audience members to get a better feel for the room prior to directing your seminar. You might ask one of the attendees, “What made you want to attend this particular seminar?”

, Make sure that you are comfortable using whatever technology is in the room. This may mean getting to know PowerPoint really well. Or, perhaps you need to practice how to switch slides using an automatic clicker or prompter. You may even want to give some thought to how you will set up the microphone, if you plan to use one.For example, if you are planning to use a slide presentation, then you’ll want to make sure that the room is equipped with a good projection system.

, As you start to craft your presentation, think about whether or not your audience can actually interact with your visuals. For example, if you are using slides, then they need to be visible, clear, and easily readable. Use a large font and clear lettering. Stay away from too many extra graphics and include only minimal text.Be aware that it takes anywhere from 1-2 minutes for an audience member to read through a slide along with you. Therefore, don’t overload your presentation with slides or you will never finish. Instead, go with pictures that can accompany the information that you are providing directly to your audience.You can also use other visual styles, such as models, posters, flyers, or brochures. Don’t feel forced into sticking with slides and instead consider dipping into your creative side, if the seminar format supports this.

, If your seminar will focus on a paper discussion, it is a good idea to work with the organizer to get a copy of the paper out to potential audience members at least a few days before the meeting. This will allow audience members to come prepared with advanced questions and comments. It will also let you dive into deeper material right away, as you can assume a certain level of common knowledge.If the paper that you circulate is a work in progress, you might say so on the draft itself and then repeat this at the start of your seminar. This way audience members will know that you welcome constructive criticism and other ideas.

, Once you have an outline in place and your visual materials prepared, you will want to practice as often as possible. Ask your friends and family members to serve as mock audience members for a trial run. Videotape yourself and then play it back, so that you can identify areas of improvement. Practice until you feel totally comfortable with the material and process.


After each practice session, make notes on the sections that are working well and those that still need some refining.

, It is a good idea to get to the seminar room a little early, so that you can see how the room is set up. You can also upload your presentation and pass out any handouts or brochures. This also gives you a last minute opportunity to meet with the seminar organizer to iron out any issues.


If you arrive 15-30 minutes beforehand that is usually enough time to accomplish everything that you need to do prior to starting the session.

Slow down, pause, and breathe during your speech.",How to Give a Speech Before a Championship Game," While some of the best pre-game pep talks seem like they are given off-the-cuff, most have actually been prepared well in advance of game day. Spending some time preparing the content and structure of your speech will help you create the biggest impact for players on game day. Preparing in advance does not mean you have to memorize what you are going to say word-for-word, but will give you a chance to decide what your most important points are and how you can communicate them most clearly., Players may have their own pre-game rituals that help them perform at their best. Don’t take up so much of the pre-game time that the players don’t have time for their own rituals.Additionally, giving too long of a speech may actually decrease the players’ motivation by giving them too much to think about and distracting them from the game at hand.

, Even if the players are standing in front of you, their minds may still be elsewhere. Grab their attention by starting off your speech in an exciting way.Consider opening with a rhetorical question, a powerful quote, or a very brief story.


To pose a rhetorical question, you might say, “Are you ready to push yourself harder than you ever have before?”
To use a powerful quote, you could say, “A man named Ferdinand Foch once said, ‘The will to conquer is the first condition of victory.’”
An brief story might look like this: “Rudy Ruettiger was a kid who no one gave a chance at anything in his life. He fought for everything he got. Because he never gave up, he achieved his dream of playing football for Notre Dame and helped lead his team to victory.”

, The main part of your speech should focus on no more than 3 points for the players to focus on during the game. Only include points you have gone over in practice. Five minutes before the game is no time to introduce new and unfamiliar strategies to players.Types of information you can include here may consist of specific techniques the players have practiced or key elements of the opponent’s strengths or weaknesses.


For example, you could focus on a technique from practice by saying, “Remember to drop your shoulder before you swing.”
To point out key elements of the opponent's strategy, you might say, “This team favors their running game over their passing game. Keep an eye on the running backs.”

, Remind players of game strategies in a positive way, and don’t harp on their shortcomings. Leaving players with a positive mindset can go a long way in giving them the confidence they need to win the game.Don’t dwell on negative faults like this: “You’re too heavy on your feet when you put your weight in your heels. Don’t do that on the field.”
Instead, use positive language to remind players of good form: “Stay on your toes, like we’ve been doing in practice. Remember how quickly you can pivot when you’re on your toes.”

, These are your last words to the players before the competition begins. Making them actionable will inspire players to follow through and bring your words with them into game play. Like your opening, make it emotional and dramatic. You might say something like:


“Now let’s go out there and bring home this trophy!”
“Show them that you’re the team to beat!”

, Keep your language conversational, using the same language that you normally use to talk to the players.Don’t take on a new tone or use overly complicated language just because you feel like this championship game is a special occasion. Using unfamiliar language will only distract the players from your message.

, Giving the players concrete imagery can actually help improve their performance.For example, someone giving a speech to a baseball team could describe how the opposing pitcher will throw the ball and how the batter should prepare to hit it: “This pitcher turns his left foot in when he’s winding up for a curve ball. Watch the ball leave his fingertips and keep your stance steady until the ball is right in front of the plate.”

, Repeat the same key ideas throughout your speech to reinforce them and help the players remember.Important elements to repeat are key strategies for winning the game, such as “Fake with your eyes, move with your feet.” Or, “Serve strong, and serve fast.”

, Bringing in a prop for your pre-game pep talk can help reinforce a visual idea with players. A college basketball coach, known for his corny pre-game props, started one speech by placing a potato chip on each of his players’ shoulders and then telling them they all had “a chip on their shoulders.”The prop helped players visualize the challenge and literally “eat it up.”


Other ideas for props include bringing in a sledgehammer to smash the competition, a lasso to pull the team together, or glasses with blinders to focus attention on the competitor facing them.

, Using questions during your speech stimulates the minds of your audience, keeping them more involved in the content of your speech.Get the players even more involved by having them answer your questions in unison or eliciting a call-and-response round.


Ask questions with obvious answers: “Who are we going to beat today?” or “How bad do you want this championship title?”
Give players the appropriate response by setting up a call and response: “When I say ‘go,’ you say ‘win’! Go!” And they respond, “Win!” Repeat the same call and response several times to build momentum and excitement.

, Read your speech aloud and practice in front of a mirror. Repeat your speech enough that you memorize the key ideas and the structure. Even if you have written everything down, you don’t want to read from a script in front of the players.

, If you don’t believe what you say, the players will feel betrayed and will lack confidence even if they can’t identify why. That is because your tone and body language will subconsciously convey your true feelings.Only include messages in your speech that you honestly believe.

, No matter what, present your speech with confidence. Don’t stutter or scramble for your notes. Players will feel that confidence and it will give them more confidence as they begin the competition.

, Making eye contact improves your audience’s focus on your speech, builds trust, and encourages cooperation.Look each player in the eyes as you’re delivering your speech so that each player feels accountable and included in your speech. The more eye contact you make with the players, the more engaged they will feel in what you’re saying., As you begin your speech, speak slowly and in a deeper pitch to convey confidence and trust.Towards the end of your speech, build excitement by raising your volume and talking in a higher pitch. The change in volume and pitch will motivate the players and increase their energy level.

, Your gestures enhance your words and increase the dynamism of your speech.Practice your speech in front of a mirror and use your hands to “describe” the words of your speech to ensure that your words and your gestures work together to convey a stronger message., Speaking slowly allows your audience to absorb and understand your words better.It is especially important to speak slowly during the portion of your speech about technique and strategy. Pausing emphasizes parts of your speech by giving your audience time to absorb the point you just made. Use these pauses as moments to take a deep breath to keep yourself calm and focused during the speech.

, It might help to bring an iPod or book to where you're going just for this reason.Then take deep breaths, and think, 'I can do this. Those people out there won't know what's coming.'. Repeat ten times, if necessary.

, Pretend you're talking to yourself, or focus on a close friend you may want to invite to hear your speech. If you want, pretend everybody you're talking to are bunnies! What's scary about bunnies? But make sure you don't laugh while thinking about bunnies, because this will mess up your whole speech, especially on something serious. If it's really serious, like war or outbreaks of disease, step 5 will help more than this one.

, Then read another sentence and so on.

, If you would like, pretend you're in a game show and if you finish the speech, you'll get a thousand dollars! Don't worry, because soon, it WILL be over. Take a bow and walk offstage."
"
Introduce yourself.,
Follow an outline of speaking points.,
Give content outside of your visual aids.,
Stick to the time allotted.,
Answer all questions as completely as possible.",How to Give a Seminar2," Start off your seminar by going to the podium, or just the front of the room, and providing a full introduction. Tell the audience a bit about your professional background. Briefly explain why you are interested in the project that you will be discussing today. This is intended to make the audience comfortable listening to you and to start building the speaker-audience trust.If someone else introduced you, then you might say a few quick words about your passion for this project and offer your thanks to the organizers for the opportunity to speak with your audience today.

, Your talk should move from one logical point to another. Even if you have the entire talk memorized, it might be useful to have a paper with talking points or notecards in front of you. This may also help with your pacing. A good rule of thumb when giving a seminar is to, “Tell them what you will tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them.”


For example, if you are giving a seminar focusing on a chronological topic, such as the development of the U.S. Civil War, make sure to give your audience plenty of warning before you jump time periods.

, It can be very tempting to read directly from your slides, but resist that urge. Instead, gesture to your slides as support for the larger points that you are making. If you’ve practiced enough, your progress with the slides will also let you know if you are making good time.For example, if you have a slide with a photo of Lincoln, then you could build upon that by discussing his time in office or his personal background. This information doesn’t need to be spelled out alongside the image.

, As soon as you agree to do the seminar, find out what your time restrictions will be and design your presentation around these. Aim for a presentation that falls at the exact time or a maximum of five minutes over. Do not go over time. If you find yourself at the time limit, then find a quick way to wrap up and offer to explain more during the question session.For example, you might say, “Well, I’ve reached the end of my time, but I would love to talk about any of these issues in response to any questions that you have.”

, Start by repeating the question to ensure that the entire audience can hear what is being discussed. Then, take a moment to compose your response before jumping in, if necessary. Try to link your answer back to your overall presentation whenever possible, perhaps adding information that you were unable to include due to time or format restrictions.Try to thank each person for their question after answering it. If a particular person tries to dominate the question session, you can offer to speak with them after.
If you don’t know the answer to a particular question, it is okay to say, “That is an excellent question, but I do not have that exact information.”"
"
Maintain steady and consistent eye contact.,
Speak clearly and with authority.,
Keep your calm after an error.,
Control your body language.",How to Give a Seminar3," Look around the room as you are speaking and try to make eye contact with almost everyone in the room throughout your presentation. If you find yourself gazing at just one part of the room, force yourself to look in the other direction. Similarly, don’t just focus on the back of the room, look at actual people so that you can gauge their responses to what you are saying., From your video practice sessions, you will notice if your voice wavers or cannot carry far enough. Try to project your voice out, so that you can speak without a microphone, if necessary. Also, go slowly and carefully pronounce each word so that everyone can understand what you are saying.It might help to write, “Speak clearly,” in the margins of your presentation notes. This will remind you to keep up your voice mid-presentation., If you make any mistakes while speaking, odds are your audience didn’t even notice. But, if you are worried, then you can acknowledge your error very quickly before moving right back into your presentation outline. This is yet another opportunity to build trust with your audience.For example, you might say, “I just noticed that that figure in column 3 is not up to date as of today, so the more accurate number would be…”

, Keep your arms and hands under control and avoid fidgeting with a pen or other item. Watch your walking patterns and try to move a bit, but not enough to be distracting. As you are analyzing your body language, consider whether or not your actions will distract from your content and, if they do, try to minimize or eliminate them."

Find information on your audience.,
Gauge your own interests.,
Research thoroughly on the topic, or if not, just make sure you are knowledgeable or experienced enough to speak extensively about the topic.,
Tweak your topic.,
Outline, if desired.",How to Find the Perfect Topic for an Informal Speech," Gauge their interests, the things they like, the activities they are most likely interested in doing, the movies they watch, their morning routines, and their hobbies. Some of these things could be found without asking them directly or even conducting a survey; they could be things that could be observed about them, such as being fashion forward, owning car keys, etc. This is important to make sure that your topic is relevant to the audience. **While this step is vital, information on the audience cannot be determined on some cases. If this happens, skip this step.;
, If you find anything common with the audience's interests, make it a candidate for your topic. If you cannot find anything common, this puts you in a tough position. Try gathering fresh information, such as current affairs and current trends, or just try to give a speech regarding something general, such as caring on their own clothes, emergency DIYs, etc.

, If your topic would be something general, it would be recommended that you give updated or uncommon information, or else your speech may not be of help to them. Find more candidates for your topic until you are sure you can actually talk about your topic.

, Some topics, especially the general ones, are easy to relate to another topic. A topic on basketball could be interesting to a part of your audience, but the rest could not enjoy it. However, to make up with that, relating basketball to something else, such as determination, socialization, love, passion, or even air, may be sufficient to make if not all, most of them, pay attention.


Another tweaking that works would have something to do with using comparing and contrasting. Talking about self-respect might not appeal to everyone, but weighing whether self-respect or your good reputation is more important than the other, and citing relevant examples to the audience, may keep them engaged into the topic. This also works when you try to cite similarities of two things that are seemingly irrelevant, such as equating a resumé to a love letter, likening politicians to hamburgers, etc.
Another approach would be using sarcasm in the topic. Since it is an informal speech, sarcasm would be welcome but make sure that the audience would be able to understand that you are being sarcastic as they might take you seriously and have violent feedbacks. Examples of these would include How NOT to be a Law-Abiding Citizen, Tips on NOT Staying Awake in Class, and more.

, It is important to be prepared especially if you are not experienced on the topic you are going to talk about. Outlining would help you organize your thoughts and see the flow of the speech. This is optional as minding the flow of the speech while delivering it affects the quality of their talk.

Throw the net as wide as possible when searching for a speaker.,
Choose a speaker based on their overall fit.,
Good writing does not necessarily a good speaker make.,
Be holistic in your search for a speaker (don't base your search on price alone).,
If you are a not-for-profit charity trying to raise funds see if the speaker will work with you on price (some will and some will not), but don't try to negotiate price based upon your charitable mission with the speaker and then have an expensive dinner at an expensive venue!

Don't get caught up in the name.",How to Find a Good Speaker,"


Look in your own organization.
Think about community leaders
Think about excellent speakers whom you have heard and would like to bring to your membership.
Ask colleagues and friends to recommend a speaker.
Check with your local Toastmasters club and Chamber of Commerce.
Don't just look locally to save travel expenses, but don't overlook local talent either.
Check out the web sites in the Sources and Citations section below. All three of the organizations provide free listings (some sell upgraded listings) to speakers who would like to hear from you. One of the organizations charges you for their services, the others do not.
Check out LinkedIn Groups. There are several Groups of speakers on LinkedIn eager to hear from you.
If your budget allows and you are looking for a big name speaker, consider contacting one of the Speakers Bureaus who represent well known speakers.
Alternatively, you might consider hiring a speaker-consultant-on-call who can help you.;
, Think beyond just the theme of your event. While any speaker worth their salt will work to customize the presentation to fit your theme in one way or another, you deserve more than that. You want your attendees to walk away from the session saying “What a great speaker!.”

, Interview your speaker before making a decision.

, Don’t let price, budget, name, or even topic dictate your search. Look for the right speaker and if they are a fit, try to negotiate the expenses into the fee.

,, Name-recognition speakers are expensive, and sadly there are only a handful of great name-recognition speakers out there accepting dates. Finding a ‘silver bullet’ speaker is rare (great name, great story, great speaker, great message, actually accept engagements). Nearly without exception, one of the things on that list has to be sacrificed. Quite often name-recognition is a contra-indication of speaking skills. It’s a short list! You can save $10k - $20k by hiring a no-name speaker with the right stuff. For well-spoken, engaging, name-recognition speakers, consider those who are famous for a profession that requires giving speeches (e.g., politicians & activists).

Use the aid of visual images or videos if allowed.,
Be confident and remember to breathe.",How to Do an Oral Presentation," Is it a question or a statement? Make the topic clear and concise; try to avoid generic topics that overwhelm in information, such as 'How does junk food affect the body?' Is this question in referral to the mind? The organs? Appearance? Is it targeted at children? Adults? Condense the question to a state where its completely clear to the audience and yourself what the oral presentation is about.;
, Are you trying to convince the audience or simply inform them? The passion in your tone can distribute between a convinced audience and an informed one. Humor, empathy and factual tones are some of many which allows a speaker to connect with the audience and the topic.

, This allows the audience to observe both sides of the topic and feel as if they have made a fair judgement when convinced. Always make sure to rebut the arguments against the topic when trying to convince an audience.


If speaking about the effect of junk food on an adults mind, include the increase of serotonin, a happiness hormone. Then inform the audience how fast the hormone drastically depletes to give out worse feelings. This gives the perspective that even the advantages of junk food are outweighed by the negative affects.

, Make sure your resources are reliable and always accredit information, ""Research conducted by Neurologist Matthew Smith..."" provides evidence to the credible sources used. Always try to provide statistics, events, personal experiences and conducted research to support your arguments. However try not to overwhelm your audience with information, as the speech can then become

, It is sometimes easier to leave the introduction and conclusion last, as these are the most important to capture your audience. Plan out and write a paragraph for each argument. Try to leave the strongest arguments last as these are what the audience will most likely remember.


Make sure to begin each argument with a clear description of the content such as. ""The result of eating junk food has increased negative emotions such as depression, anxiety and low self-esteem"". This gives the audience a quick outlook of what the argument is about. Always remember to state how the argument relates and supports the topic question.

, Always try to avoid introducing yourself unless its absolutely necessary! If it's a must, try to introduce yourself later in the introduction. The first words are paramount when capturing the attention of your audience and best when used with a definition, question, quote, statistic or statement. ""You are what you eat...To what extent does this statement ring true? Does the food we eat define our thoughts and emotions? If we were to eat junk, would we become 'junk' ourselves?""


If necessary, this is where you could include, ""My name is ___ and I will be speaking about the effect on junk food on our minds."" Then you include a brief out view of each argument you will be speaking about. Do not include any information about your arguments in the introduction.

, Briefly summarize each argument but do not include any new information. Relate back as to how the argument supports the topic question and how they outweigh the opposing facts. The last sentence of the conclusion defines the power of your presentation and must leave an effect on the audience. A good ending to a conclusion can include the same as the beginning of an introduction and sometimes, using the same opening sentence as your concluding sentence can be very powerful in the right context.


Some example concluding sentences include, ""The entire process of the mind, changed by a simple bite of a cookie. Our entire body's control system, defined by our choices of food. The definite truth. You are what you eat.""

, Do not paste your entire script on to the cue cards. Key words are your best friend in an oral presentation. Only having certain key words on your script allows you to easily track your train of words and gives you the opportunity to focus on your audience.


Taking the effort to memorize your script allows you to keep eye contact with the audience and brings confidence to your speech. Reading from an entire script can easily cause you to lose your place and stutter. Also make sure they are the same size and only put important key words or those that are hard to remember. This allows you to easily flip through and read off the cue cards.

, Having PowerPoint presentations that contain important phrases, statistics or images in relation to your script allows the audience to visualize the information, making it easier to follow along.

, And always make sure to check P.V.C before your speech. PowerPoint, Volume and Cue cards.

Realize that most public speaking classes require that students do a speech in three to four areas.,
Focus on both speech research and delivery.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Try to understand your professor or instructor's grading system.,
Gain confidence.",How to Get Through a Public Speaking Class," These include informative, demonstrative, persuasive and entertaining speeches. Each category has its own specific style and approach.


Virtually any textbook on public speaking can provide you with plenty of detail on these types of speeches.
Often you will have a choice of what sub-topic you want to speak about. Always choose something that you are personally interested in and have some basic understanding of.;
, Two of the key areas that you will be graded on include: the quality of your research, and the quality of your delivery.


The research needs to be from a well-known source, such as the New York Times. Generally it is a good idea to avoid using websites that have questionable facts or out-of-date information for your research.
The quality of your presentation includes such factors as how well you maintained eye contact with the audience, whether you varied the pitch of your voice, if you delivered the speech smoothly without relying too much on your notes, and whether you were able to communicate with passion and keep the audience interested in what you were talking about.

, Public speaking can be, and is fun, if you are fully prepared and confident with your delivery. One of the best ways to get ready is to practice your speech in front of friends a few times to find out what they thought about it. Find an audience that is supportive, but realistic in their assessment. Another option is to record your speech on your camera phone and watch it. The more times you practice, the more smooth you will be in your delivery and the more confident you will be in front of a group.

, Often grades are based on points earned for the speeches, along with points for attendance, the final exam, etc. Even though it may seem like the points are set, professors will sometimes find a way to give extra credit to students who are enthusiastic or who make steady improvement throughout the semester. Missing a major speech can have the opposite effect, where you get the ""doubt of the benefit.""

, Perhaps the main reason that people fear speaking is that they are afraid that they will make a mistake and get laughed off the stage. The opposite is usually true... The audience wants you to succeed (they don't want to have a boring evening). If you do make a minor mistake, the audience often won't even notice. Trust yourself to self-correct in the moment. This is especially easy if you have prepared well and have plenty of material to share with the audience. One of the best strategies to staying relaxed and confident is to think of your speech as an extended conversation among friends, rather that a formal presentation.

"
"
Be Confident.,
Make your audience believe that you understand their emotions and dilemmas.,
Talk about things with a practical approach.,
Do NOT memorise but KNOW what you have to speak about.,
Put forward all your points in the given time frame.",How to Become a Good Mass Communicator," If you try to notice history's best mass communicators, one would easily identify that they had that confidence that clearly reflected in their eyes and gestures. When one is not confidence, that becomes visible through various ways. So, garner up the confidence. That also seems to be a hard task for a lot many people, which is totally understandable as everyone has different personality.


Have you paid attention on how easily you are able to explain a concept to a friend of yours while you may become nervous or start blabbering while explaining the same to a large audience? Therefore, what you need to do is consider each person as your friend, and believe that they would not judge as a failure or success.
Next pillar is to forget about the consequence of your words and action. If you will keep thinking about what your words would result into, you would not be able to express what you really want to.
Always be calm and patient. Never try to hurry with your words. Let them just flow as they come.;
, No one has time to listen to someone who does not have a solution to their problems. We all seek answers to our questions appreciate the person who provides us with best solution. Or for that matter can make us believe in our own selves and empower us.

, Gone are the days when we used to spread the idea of a utopia world. This is the era of practicality and intelligent reasoning.


People are smart nowadays. If one tries to make big promises and mislead them by using heavy words, the public would recognize that this is only to fool them.
Garnering trust of his audience is very important for a mass communicator to deliver his ideas effectively.
Being practical and an optimist should go hand in hand. A good mass communicator always encourage to look for innovative ideas that would create a better tomorrow for all.

, There is a difference between learning your speech and preparing for it. Understand that difference.


Just keep in mind what all you have to talk about.
As and when the thoughts come, let them flow, it must be natural rather than looking manipulative.
A good connection is established when you speak in the manner that your audience understands best.

, Some people have the habit of staggering over a single topic. This leads to missing out on other important ideas that one may have wanted to talk about. Be precise and straightforward.

"
"
For questions from the audience: If the question is related directly to the topic that you are talking about, consider answering it on the spot.,
For heckling or skeptical audiences: Acknowledge that there may be different opinions on the subject.,
Consider asking the audience to take a moment to turn off or turn down their mobile phones.",How to Deal with Interruptions in Public Speaking1," If it is a vague or general question, let the participant know that there will be a Q&A session later.;
, You might want to discuss any controversies in your introduction so that the audience knows that you are aware of what they may be thinking. Let them know that you will be happy to discuss any controversy at the end of your speech.

, If a mobile phone does ring during your talk, think in advance of how you'd like to handle it. Some speakers talk through it, some wait, and some will confront the person with the phone.

"
"
Summarize the main points you made throughout the speech.,
Bookend your speech.,
Make the topic seem important.,
Use a signal phrase from your title.,
Don't be afraid of using the phrase ""in conclusion."",
Thank the audience to signal the ending.",How to Conclude a Speech1," The most important thing for a conclusion to accomplish is to remind the listeners of what they should have learned throughout the speech. If the introduction tells the audience what they will learn, and the body tells the audience the content they should be learning, the conclusion should repeat those main ideas one final time.


Use the chance to repeat your thesis a final time, if necessary. What's the one thing you hope someone remembers from your speech? What's the one thing that needs to be learned?
In informal speeches, repeating the main points won't be necessary. If you're giving a toast at a wedding, you don't need to run back through a list of the great things about the groom.;
, In some cases, the conclusion might recall the introduction, helping to illustrate that the speech has come full circle. If you used an example or a specific case study reference in your introduction, then you can return to that example in your conclusion. This can be an excellent way of bookending the speech and keeping people interested.


If you started the speech by drawing a sad portrait of a recently returned veteran who couldn't get work, or health insurance, and ended up in dire straits, that can be a heart-breaking intro. Pick back up with the story in conclusion to let you know where that vet is now.
Any kind of reference can work. If you started a speech with a quote by Thomas Paine, end with more about Thomas Paine. The bookend technique is an excellent way of signaling the end for the audience.

, The speech should do a lot to present a case and lots of details to your audience, but the conclusion can be a great opportunity to make those points important. Depending on the nature of your speech, if you've just presented a lot of complex details about climate change, the ending might be an appropriate time to introduce your first case study, or personal example that will help to drive home the facts that you've just presented. Make it real for your audience.


Put a face on things. Case studies and personal examples are extremely effective in helping an audience connect with a complicated issue or topic.
Some people like to use this technique for the introduction, but it can be unexpected and even more effective to wait and use it at the conclusion, especially for speeches that are a little bit shorter.

, If you've written a speech with an eye-catching title, use that as an opportunity to signal that you're coming to the end by repeating it, or explaining it, or even just using it in the language of the speech naturally. People will perk up when they hear the title automatically, because it will seem important. This can happen at any time during the speech, but it's perhaps most effective at the end.""We can turn back the oceans and stop the warming of our planet. It's not too late, as the title of my speech promises. It's not too late for any of us.""

, Lots of people overthink the conclusion. You don't need to outsmart it. If you're nearing the ending, don't be afraid to say so, and use the phrase, ""In conclusion,"" to signal that you're getting close to the close of your speech. It's one sure way to let people know that you're almost done, and then should be perking up for your final points.

, One nice transitional move to signal that you're coming to the close of an informal address or toast is to thank the audience for listening and participating in the proceedings. This can be a good way to transition into your final paragraph, or into the last point that you want to make. The audience will tend to sit up a little when they realize the end is in sight.


It's also appropriate to use a ""thank you"" as the very last thing that you say: ""We must continue fighting the good fight on climate change, for our children, for our economy, and for ourselves. Thank you."" Cue applause.
Sometimes, it's also appropriate to ask for questions if the occasion calls for it. People should be sure your speech is over, but if people seem hesitant, it's ok to say, ""I'd be happy to take questions, if anyone has them.""

"
"
Plan and prepare so that you have a backup plan.",How to Deal with Interruptions in Public Speaking2," For example, if you are going to do a PowerPoint slide show, make sure that you have several backups of the presentation along with an alternative plan, such as a printed exercise for the class to work on.

"
"
Tell the event organizer to be aware of loud talkers or other disruptive individuals.",How to Deal with Interruptions in Public Speaking3," Get the organizer to deal with it so you don't have to risk losing your composure. You can also use the non-verbal ""stop sign"" where your palm is thrust towards the interrupter.

"
"
Slow down the speed of your speech at the end.,
End on a high note.,
Try repetition.,
Use a call to action.",How to Conclude a Speech2," An excellent technique to get people to perk up and really hit your most important points is to slow down the speech. Slow it down a lot. Take longer pauses in between your words, and put calculated pauses at particular points to help drive home your main ideas one final time. If someone missed the rest of the speech, they should be able to get something just form this.


""The fight for climate change (pause ) is a fight (pause) that we must (pause) win. Our children (pause). Our children's children (pause). Demand it.""

, If you've just presented a really grim portrait, or a really technical series of details throughout a speech, the ending can be a great time to lighten things up a bit and end on a positive note. Letting people know that the situation is changeable, and that things aren't quite so bleak can help to get your audience energized.


Return to the story of the veteran struggling to find work. With the sorts of infrastructure you're calling for in your speech, maybe he could be working a specific job, and getting into his own house, and even starting to plant a garden in the yard, something he always wanted to do. Dream a little, and let your audience do the same.

, Repeating a phrase or a couple of lines can be a great way to hammer home a couple of points and let your speech end with a bang. You can repeat whole phrases, or use parallel sentence structure to end your speech with repetition.""We must do this for our children, we must do this for our neighbors, we must do this for America, we must do this for the world, we must do this for the oceans, we must do this for the forests...""
""Politicians can't legislate this. Architects can't build this. Artists can't dream this. Developers can't innovate this. Only you can do this.""

, Persuasive speeches require you to come up with a solution to a particular problem, and an excellent way of ending a speech like this is to let your audience know exactly what they can do, now, to make the kind of change you're talking about. End by projecting a telephone number they can call, or by getting them signed up for a particular mailing list about an issue, or helping them learn to contact their congress person to talk up this issue. Actually pass around a sign-up sheet if necessary. Get them involved.


Address the audience specifically. Start using ""you"" toward the end of the speech, or address an individual in the audience to help bring it home.

"
"
Don't end abruptly.,
Don't ramble out.,
Don't apologize, even self-deprecatingly.,
Don't introduce a new point in the ending.,
Don't use a conclusion that's very different than the rest of the speech.",How to Conclude a Speech3," One of the worst ways to end a speech is to just run out of steam, as if someone had cut you off. Even if you suspect you're running long, take the time to end the speech properly and sum up your final points in a clear and direct way. Don't just drop the mic and walk off. Avoid using any of the following kinds of last-lines:


""Well, that's pretty much it.""
""That's it.""
""I'm done.""

, The ending is a bad time to go off-script. If you've got a good finish cooked up, but suddenly remember another thing you wanted to say, don't try to jam it back in when you're supposed to be wrapping up. The ending is one of the most important parts, so be sure you get it right and make it clear. Go for short and concise, not long and rambling.


When the speech is over, don't keep talking. Even if you just remembered a point you forgot to make a few minutes ago, don't launch back into the speech when people are clapping, or once they're finished. When the speech is over, let it be over. If there's a chance for Q & A, then get to it then.

, Public speaking is hard, but don't make it worse by drawing attention to your shortcomings. If you think the speech hasn't gone well, or that you've gone on too long, don't end by drawing attention to the fact. This won't make it any better. You'll only serve to end the speech by highlighting the absolutely worst element of it.

, The ending is a time to sum up and repeat the main ideas, not to throw a curve ball into things. Even if you think it would be a surprise, or would be more shocking at the end of the speech, don't use the final moments to try to explain one more complicated thing. Let the audience start slowing down their brains and transitioning into something else.

, If you're giving a speech about the horrors of war, it would be inappropriate to use a call-and-response ending, or some kind of audience participation gimmick that would be out of the purview of the rest of the speech. Don't do something drastically different and risk ruining the tone for the rest of the speech.


Some speeches can be leavened with a bit of humor in the ending. If you've just given a particularly touching toast at a wedding, it might be good to release a bit of the tension with a well-placed gag. Probably not so much for a professional presentation.

Acknowledge whatever fears or anxieties you have about speaking.,
Be knowledgeable about your topic.,
Practice your speech many times.,
Take your time when you speak.,
Remember to breathe.,
Prepare a script for your speech, but don’t read from a paper word-for-word.,
Focus on the positive aspects of your performance.",How to Beat Anxiety About Speaking1," This will give you a more personalized understanding of what makes you nervous. It may even help to make a list.Public speakers often dislike speaking for varying reasons; some dislike their voice, while others fear a poor audience reception. Make a list of your personal anxieties about public speaking. A specific list will help make the problem feel more manageable and less overwhelming. Example anxieties include:


Discomfort standing on a stage / behind a podium.
Concerns about physical awkwardness—physical stance, hand gestures, etc.
Unhappiness about a tendency to rush through public speeches.;
, It doesn't matter if it's an informal conversation or a presentation, if you know what you're talking about you'll feel confident. This will involve hours of research, approach this speaking engagement as if you are working to master the concept itself, not as if you’re merely trying to memorize enough facts and talking points to get you through a brief talk.Talk to others who are knowledgeable about the topic of your speech, and see if they can help you craft a sharper, better focused talk.

, A speaker who has rehearsed their talk many times to themselves in private will be well prepared to deliver a successful talk in public, whereas a speaker who has poorly rehearsed will probably struggle to deliver their speech successfully. Many speakers find it useful to practice in front of a mirror; this allows you to observe your own body language and eye contact.When you practice:


Speak confidently.
Stand with good posture.
Encourage yourself, even verbally. Try saying, “This speech will be a success whether or not I stumble over a few words.”
Before you recite your speech, tell yourself, “What other people think of me is none of my business; I’m free to make mistakes.” Don’t worry too much about whether the audience approves or disapproves of you!

, Trying to rush will make you tongue tied. A slow flow may put your audience to sleep, while too fast of a speaking rate will stress your audience; they may even struggle to understand what you are trying to say.Use a stopwatch (or the stopwatch function on your phone) to measure the number of words that you speak per minute. A good speed should have between 120 and 150 words per minute; if you speak fewer than 100 per minute, your speed is too slow. If you exceed 160, slow down.

, When a speaker is nervous, their first inclination will be to tense up and to contract the abdominal muscles, bladder, throat, etc. A limitation of air intakes and a lack of oxygen can change your voice dramatically. Deep breathing increases oxygen your lungs and brain, which promotes relaxation. Whenever you feel stressed, consider taking a deep breath and reconnecting with your body.

, If you are not reading a speech word-for-word, your hands will be free to make whatever gestures feel natural, and you can make eye contact with members of the audience.This works best if you’re intimately familiar with your speech (and have practiced the talking points many times). You should know roughly what you’re going to say, but give yourself permission and freedom to elaborate important ideas onstage. To avoid reading a script, many speakers:


Use a PowerPoint or Prezi, with limited words on each page.
Prepare note cards, each of which contains a single talking point.
Memorize their presentation, so they can speak without being tied to visual aids.

, No speech will ever be perfect, and speaking in front of a group is an environment in which mistakes are often made, even by professionals. Once you step off the stage, review the speech in your mind: what went well, what went poorly? If you talk with members of the audience, they likely noticed the positive aspects of your speech, and forgot about the negative parts. You should allow yourself to make mistakes, but also focus on the strengths of your speech, and use those to deliver an even better speaking performance next time.

Learn which social situations you feel comfortable in, and which you feel uncomfortable.,
Listen more than you talk.,
Speak confidently, calmly, and don’t let stress overwhelm you.,
Engage in more social conversations using empathy and listening skills.",How to Beat Anxiety About Speaking2," It’s rare for a person with social anxiety—or any kind of anxiety about speaking in a social setting—to feel equally uncomfortable or panicked in every social setting.Maybe you’re more comfortable in rooms that you’re already familiar with, or when you’re with a certain friend or family member. Pay attention to which social situations trigger you and which don’t, and try to gain social confidence from those settings in which you’re already comfortable. These could include:


Talking in a room or building that you’re already familiar with.
Talking in social settings when you’re with a friend or family member.
Talking with people about a topic on which you’re already knowledgeable.

, In any social setting, it’s important to be an engaged listener and to pay close attention to the people you’re sharing a conversation with.This will help you feel more comfortable when you do decide to talk; if you focus on the person who is speaking and engage with them mentally and emotionally, you will feel less anxiety when you have an opportunity to speak in the conversation., When you are conversing or speaking in a social setting, speak to people with direct engagement. It’s best not to come across as aggressive or pushy, but you should come across as being open and honest.That said, even people who are comfortable in social settings sometimes feel anxious or stressed; these feelings will often be worse for individuals with social anxiety. To avoid stress in a social conversation:


Take a few deep breaths.
Step outside of the room; take a few minutes to calm down.
Use humor to diffuse a potentially stressful situation.

, At some point, you’ll have learned enough from listening to others speak and from talking socially in safe, comfortable environments, that you will start feeling more comfortable in general social settings. Approach all social conversations with a focus on listening to the people around you, and when you speak, do so—at least initially—with an emphasis on finding common ground, sharing your emotions with the other members of the conversation, and confidently contributing your own thoughts and opinions."

Practice good posture.,
Move around the space.,
Step closer to your audience when you make a point.,
Use hand gestures while giving a presentation.,
Smile.,
Avoid fidgeting.,
Make eye contact with audience members.",How to Be Confident During a Presentation1," Hold your head up and keep your chin in when standing and giving a presentation. Imagine you are stretching the top of your head toward the ceiling. Keep your shoulders back and try to keep your earlobes in line with the center of your shoulders. Tuck in your stomach, but be sure not to tilt your pelvis. Your knees should be straight, and the arches of your feet should be supported.Good posture conveys to the audience that you are confident, credible, and sure of your subject. Speaking with proper posture also allows you to project your voice, making your speech clear and assertive.;
, If you wish to project confidence, don’t be afraid to use the space around you. When you are giving a presentation, try to move around the stage. When people are nervous or apprehensive, they are inclined to close off their movements, stand with their feet together, and hide behind a podium in an attempt to appear small and unnoticeable. This can make you appear inexperienced or anxious. Controlled walking can help you project your expertise and knowledge and can help you feel comfortable in your surroundings.

, When making a point, make a few steps away from the podium toward the audience. Only move toward the audience when the content of your presentation calls for it.If you are making a point or revealing exciting, unexpected information, that is the time to move. Unnecessary movement can be distracting and can make you appear uneasy.Moving close to the audience helps bridge the gap and creates a sense of authority and confidence.


Don’t stand too close to the audience, and don’t move beyond the first row of seats.
As you move toward the audience, think about staying there for a period of 30 seconds. When you step in another direction, spend about another 30 seconds there.Think about trying to reach everyone in your audience, and try to make eye contact with several audience members as you move from section to section.

, Avoid keeping your arms in a rigid position by your side. Keep your open arms while speaking. Pointing toward the sky can assert an opinion or a fact, while opening your hands can show trustworthiness and inspire audience participation. When coming to the crux of an argument or the summary of your research, point upward with your index finger to assert your authority and appear confident in your conclusion.


Don’t cross your arms during a presentation. While this may be a comfortable position, you may be projecting negative cues to your audience. This closed-off position may make you seem inexperienced, uninterested, or nervous.

, A warm, inviting smile will convey to your audience that you are at ease and are comfortable. Your smile will make you appear and sound more pleasant, and you will come off as responsive and composed.Studies have shown that smiling can help reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and your heart rate, all of which will put you at ease while giving your presentation., It's okay to feel nervous, but avoid projecting that anxiety if you wish to appear confident. Shuffling back and forth, biting your nails, twirling your hair, and other forms of fidgeting can display signs of boredom or nervousness.Take a some slow, deep breaths when you feel the urge to fidget.

, Don’t stare at the floor, at your feet, or at your notes. Look up and make eye contact with your audience members. Eye contact is a great way to not only appear confident, but feel confident as well.While giving a presentation, maintain eye contact with an individual for periods of 3 to 5 seconds.Eye contact will demonstrate that you are trustworthy and passionate about the topic, and it will help keep your audience’s attention."
"
Project your voice.,
Vary the speed, pitch, and volume of your voice.,
Pace yourself.",How to Be Confident During a Presentation2," To appear confident, your voice needs to be heard so your audience can follow your presentation and understand your point.Proper posture will allow you to use the support of your diaphragm, the umbrella-shaped muscle below your stomach, to control the movement of air. When you breathe in, let your stomach expand. This movement is controlled by the diaphragm. Practice using your diaphragm to project your voice.


Lie down on your back, and keep your abdominals and stomach relaxed. Keep one hand on your abdomen, and think about moving it up and down as you breathe in and out.Find out in advance if you will be using a microphone for your presentation. This can help you plan ahead and adjust the volume of your voice accordingly.

, In everyday conversation, your pitch, speed, and volume varies when you are chatting with a friend or sharing a story. A monotonous tone can be boring and may convey to the audience that you are unsure or unprepared. Add interest by playing with the dynamics of your speech. Your audience will be more likely to pay attention to your presentation.


Try to incorporate these variations in speech while giving your presentation, and pretend as though you are having a conversation with a friend or a colleague.
Practice these variations by reading a poem, a play, or another piece of literature aloud., When people are nervous, they may be more likely to speak quickly and speed through a presentation. Try to maintain a slow and moderate pace while speaking. This will help the audience understand what you are saying and allow you to communicate your ideas clearly and confidently.Speeding up your speech is acceptable to offer variety in your presentation and may be a useful tool when you are making a particular point, but aim to remain regulated, consistent, and articulate during the majority of your presentation.


Stretch out your vowels to slow your speech. Pretend that the vowels are italicized and focus on speaking each one clearly. Practice this technique to ensure that it sounds natural.
Break your presentation up into sections. Plan to pause for a moment or two when you reach the end of each section. Allow for one second to pause before moving on to the next point."
"
Study your material.,
Rehearse it in front of a mirror.,
Practicing deep breathing techniques.",How to Be Confident During a Presentation3," The key to projecting confidence during a presentation is to have a comprehensive knowledge of the topic. When you feel like an expert on a particular subject, you are more likely to project that expertise and knowledge to your listeners. Your audience will be able to tell if you are unprepared or nervous. Be sure to study your subject and your presentation slides thoroughly, and be prepared for any questions the audience may have.

, Position yourself in front of a mirror and practice giving your presentation. Pretend that you are in front of your peers and colleagues, and try to imagine that you are on the stage or in front of a classroom while speaking. This will allow you to practice your movements, your pace, your hand gestures, and it will remind you to smile during the speech. You will become more familiar with the material and the flow of the information. After several practice runs, you will be more comfortable and confident.

, Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose and hold for ten counts. Exhale slowly through your mouth, tightening your abdominals as you release the breath.Deep breathing can help you focus on your presentation and release any anxiety or tension in your body.Incorporate breathing exercises into your daily routine to help you relax and appear calm, composed, and confident in front of your audience.

Mix baking soda and water to a thin paste.",How to Erase Ink from a Paper1," Most nail polish remover is made of acetone, and this can be used to remove ink from paper. Apply a small amount of acetone to a cotton swab, and rub into the ink you're trying to erase.This works best on regular ballpoint pen ink.
Blue ink is more easily erased than black ink.;
, You can apply isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol to any paper you're trying to erase the ink from. If you only have a small amount of ink to erase, use a cotton swab. If you want to erase most of the ink from a page, soak the paper in a small washing tray for 5 minutes.Any brand of isopropyl alcohol works for this method. Avoid any rubbing alcohol that contains scents or dyes.
Make sure you cover any area of the paper you don't want to erase.

, Pour a small amount of lemon juice into an 8-oz jar. Dip a cotton swab into the lemon juice. Then, wipe the wet cotton gently across the inked paper you're trying to erase.The acid will dissolve the ink, but it also dissolves the paper. Be gentle, especially when erasing ink from fine paper.
Heavy-weight paper will stand up to pen erasure more readily than light-weight paper.

, Mix it up in a small glass bowl for best results. Use a clean, white cotton cloth to dab your baking soda paste onto the inked paper. Gently rub the paste into the ink you'd like to erase.You might find an old toothbrush useful to carry the paste from the bowl to the page, or to rub it onto the ink. This works best if your toothbrush bristles are still relatively intact, not too frayed.
Allow the paper to dry well. There's no need to rinse the baking soda off. The water will evaporate, and the baking soda will simply fall off the page.

Take out a blank, clean sheet of paper.,
Rub discolored areas on the eraser against your paper.,
Persist erasing until your eraser is clean all over.,
Use an eraser case or cover for storage.,
Repeat this process regularly as build-up occurs.",How to Clean an Eraser1," Any piece of normal paper should do for the purposes of cleaning your eraser. You should avoid paper with a glossy finish, as this kind will be less fibrous. Less fibrous paper could result in your eraser gunk smearing over more of your eraser making more work for you.


Paper that is coarse and heavy will allow you to scrub it harder with your eraser without fear of tearing the paper. Coarse paper will also cause your eraser to come apart from the eraser in flecks or eraser shavings. This is ideal, as these shavings will part the gunk from the rest of your paper.
You should avoid writing on paper that already has writing on it, including words that have been printed onto paper with a computer printer. The ink from the printer, from pens, or graphite from pencils could cause more gunk to build up while you’re trying to remove it.
Printer paper, while somewhat smoother than an ideal sheet of eraser purifying paper, should work well enough for purging gunk from your eraser. This paper also has the added benefit of being bright white in color. This will make it easier to tell when your gunk is gone and the eraser erases clean.;
, Inspect your eraser carefully and note the areas that are discolored. These are the areas you will want to target. When the dark spots on your eraser have been removed, your eraser should erase as good as new. Rub your eraser firmly against the clean paper you have chosen and be sure you avoid crossing over the darkened marks that rub off on your paper.


Feel the eraser gunk with your fingers. Sometimes the graphite gunk will be soft, like putty. In this case, you might be able to cut through some of the gunk with your fingers or nails.
Be careful not to spread the gunk around or push it deeper into the eraser with your fingers. Doing so will make your eraser cleaning more difficult.

, As you scrub your eraser on the clean page, eraser shavings should come free of the eraser, and with these so too should come the graphite gunk. Brush away shavings regularly to prevent them and the gunk they contain from re-smudging your eraser.


A drafting table or an angled desk will allow the force of gravity to help pull many of the shavings free of your paper. You might also hold your paper flat against a wall to get the maximum gravity assistance.
You might also need to switch paper, depending on the size of your eraser and the amount of gunk built up on it. When it becomes difficult to rub your eraser on the page without crossing one of the darkened smears, you should get a new piece of paper.

, A case will protect your eraser from the drying effects of the air or the decay that can be caused by too much moisture. But you don’t need a special case to prolong the life of your eraser! Even a normal pencil case can keep dust and other residue from negatively impacting your eraser’s efficiency.


You can find specialty eraser cases at your local art supply store or through an online retailer. You should especially consider a specialty case if you are an artist and use expensive, high quality erasers for your art.
You might store your erasers in a tupperware container, or some other kind of clean, plastic container. This will limit its exposure to harmful elements, like air, dust, and moisture.
Keep your erasers separate from your pencils, crayons, and pens. These items can carry dust and grime, or in some cases can create dust and grime, that can hurt your erasers performance. Keep a separate container for your erasers to prevent this., If you are an artist and use your eraser frequently, you may need to purge your eraser of blemishes fairly regularly. But even occasional pencil/eraser users may have to repeat this process several times over the life of the eraser.


By purging your eraser of graphite gunk, you will save yourself money and maintain the immaculate quality of your work. If you have a low quality eraser or a soft lead pencil that accumulates gunk quickly, you may want to carry a folded up sheet of clean paper in your eraser case to use on the fly.

Create a core.,
Wrap rubber bands around the core.,
Add more rubber bands until the ball is smooth.,
Test the ball.,
Find all your rubber bands for free.,
Make a ball without twisting any rubber bands.,
Make it massive.,
Cut your old ball in half.",How to Make a Rubber Band Ball," You can start with any small object, such as a marble or golf ball. A ""true"" rubber band ball, however, includes no other materials. Here's how to get it started:Select a short, thick rubber band, such as a band used to secure vegetables.
Fold this rubber band in half, then in half again, then a third time if possible. Do not twist it; you should end up with a flat ""stack"" of rubber.
While pinching the thick band flat, wrap a thinner rubber band around it.
Twist the slack of the thinner band and wrap it over the thick one in the other direction.
Continue to twist and wrap until there is no more slack in the thin band.;
, Start with two rubber bands placed in a criss-cross shape over the core. Make sure they're tightly secured. You may have to twist and wrap them around the core a few times.









Start with the smallest bands first, since they won't be useful once your ball passes a certain size.

, Keep wrapping rubber bands so that you form a ball. Space the rubber bands evenly so that no one side of the ball is larger than any other. A ball without an object in the core will start out lumpy, but it should become smooth by the time it reaches the size of a golf ball.







, Toss it in the air, or bounce it against the wall. Your new rubber band ball should have plenty of spring. Enjoy it as is, or keep adding more rubber bands and watch it grow.









Get it to the size of a tennis ball for the best bounce.

, Since rubber band balls are all about the challenge anyway, why not make it a little harder? Try expanding your ball without paying for any rubber bands. Here are a few places to look for them:


Ask friends and neighbors for spares.
Ask postal workers, newspaper delivery people, and other door-to-door delivery workers.
Look in shoe stores, which may use rubber bands to hold the shoe boxes closed.

, If you don't twist the rubber bands, they lie flat against each other, with no room for air. This makes the densest, bounciest ball. The trick to this is finding each new rubber band exactly the right size, so there's no slack when you loop it around the ball once.







, Rubber band balls are extremely dense, so after a certain point they'll be too heavy to bounce without breaking something. After that, the challenge is to make it as large as possible. You can even beat the world record, if you can find 700,000 rubber bands.Once the ball is about the size of a basketball, wear safety goggles. Plenty of rubber bands will snap after this point, and you don't want them hitting your eyes.Rubber bands decay over time. To stop it shrinking or breaking apart, your project will need regular reinforcement., Once you have a basketball-sized rubber band ball, it will probably sit there in the corner of your room, getting greyer and more frayed. Want to get one final moment of fun? Saw it in half and watch the insides emerge on their own, like a bizarre colony of worms.If that description didn't turn you off the hobby forever, get out there and start creating!

Try a low-level security shredder.,
Consider a mid-level security shredder.,
Advance to a high-level security shredder.,
Find an affordable shredder at all security levels.",How to Choose a Paper Shredder1," A strip-cut paper shredder cuts a standard letter size paper into about 40-50 strips. This type of shredder typically produces the largest size strips of paper.


Strip-cut was the original style of shredder and offers the lowest level of security. It is still a big step above tearing something up and throwing it in the trash.
Strip-cut shredders are sometimes less expensive than other types of shredders.
To decide whether a strip-cut paper shredder will suffice, determine what you need to shred. How sensitive is the information? Strip-cut shredders are good for those who do not dispose high-level security documents.;
, A cross-cut paper shredder is also known as a confetti-cut shredder. This is the most popular type of paper shredder. It offers a higher level of security than the strip-cut variety. A standard letter size paper is cut into over 200 small square pieces.


It is difficult to retrieve sensitive information from documents fed through a confetti-cut shredder. This is good for sensitive information like bank account and credit card numbers.
Some computer programs piece together documents shredded into strips. It is next to impossible to decipher anything shredded into small confetti sized pieces.
Since the shredded pieces are so small, you can change the bags of shredded paper less often without it posing a security risk.
There is a super cross-cut shredder that will cut a standard letter size paper into over 400 pieces.

, A micro-cut paper shredder offers one of the highest levels of security available. This is the best type of shredder if you need to destroy highly sensitive and confidential documents. A standard letter size paper is cut into over 2,000 tiny pieces.


It is impossible to retrieve information from a document fed through a micro-cut shredder. This is one reason micro-cut shredders are popular with government agencies and large corporations.These shredders are for people at risk of having classified or secret information stolen.
Since the shredded pieces are so small, you can change the bags of shredded paper less often without it posing a security risk.
Within the micro-cut shredder family is the super micro-cut shredder. This will cut a standard letter size paper into over 6,200 pieces. There are also high security shredders that cut a standard letter size paper into over 13,000 tiny pieces. This does not diminish the high-level security of the standard micro-cut paper shredder., Whether you choose a strip-cut, cross-cut, or micro-cut shredder, there are affordable options. Although micro-cut shredders tend to be more costly, you can find smaller versions for home use that are relatively affordable at around $100 to $200.High-level micro-cut shredders are generally the most costly type of shredder, often starting around $300 and rising to thousands of dollars. The commercial variety can cost top dollar."

Use a simple blade to erase ink.,
Use a special ink eraser.,
Sand ink off using sandpaper.,
Use a fine-grit grinder to remove ink from paper.",How to Erase Ink from a Paper2," This method works best for printed ink and use only when you need to remove only a few letters. Hold the blade vertical to the paper and rub gently. Do not press the blade very hard on paper or you get off layers of paper.

, If you are using erasable ink, you can easily erase it with an ink eraser. Erasable ink is typically blue, not black, and will be identified as 'erasable' in its packaging. It's also often found like a pencil, with ink on one end and an eraser on the other.If you aren't sure whether or not your ink is erasable, try erasing it with an ink eraser to find out.
Gum erasers and rubber erasers work best on pencil/graphite, and are not recommended for pen.
It's possible to erase ink using a vinyl eraser, but be careful. This eraser is very rough and can easily rub away the paper itself along with the ink you're erasing., Use a triple-ought (000) sandpaper and a small sanding block. If the ink removal requires you to manipulate the sandpaper more carefully than a small sanding block (or your fingers) will allow, cut off a small piece of the sandpaper and glue it to the eraser end of a pencil. Carefully rub the inky paper with your sandpaper using small lateral motions.Be careful not to press down too hard when rubbing the sandpaper to the inky surface.
Blow gently across the page to remove any small pieces of grit, ink, or paper as you work to better see your progress.

, A grinder is basically a mechanical application of sandpaper surface that may be able to sand your paper more evenly and easily than you can do it by hand. A Dremel type mini grinder with a slightly rounded stone grinding head is recommended.Using a sander is particularly recommended for inky edges on books.
A sander is often too rough for a paper's surface, unless the paper is quite strong.

Apply correction fluid.,
Cover ink with correction tape.,
Cover ink spills or slips with paper.,
Camouflage your spilled ink.,
Trace the page and start again.",How to Erase Ink from a Paper3," Although correction fluid does not erase ink, it can cover ink as if it were erased. Correction fluid, often known by the brand names ""Liquid Paper"" or ""Wite-Out"", is a dense liquid, often white in color, that is intended to cover accidental marks or errors on paper. Correction fluid is commonly applied with a small, sponge-tipped applicator.Correction fluid may become dry, clogged or flaky. Make sure that your correction fluid is the proper consistency before applying.
Correction fluid will be wet after applying. Make sure you don't touch the wet fluid to any other surface.

, If you need to erase ink in vertical or horizontal strips, correction tape might be best to cover your errors. One side of the tape is meant to mimic the appearance of paper, the other is adhesive and sticks to your original paper. Correction tape is usually white, but other colors are available to match your paper.You'll likely be able to see correction tape on your original page if you look closely.
If you scan or copy a paper with correction tape on it, the reader may not be able to detect the correction tape.

, If you want to erase or change a section of an ink drawing, sometimes the easiest solution is to cover it with a small piece of paper. Find a blank paper that matches your original paper, and cut out a section large enough to cover the mistake. Glue the new paper over the mistake. Redraw your artwork or lettering on the restored surface.Make sure that the edges of the paper are pressed against the surface, not curled up or bent from the original surface.
The careful observer will be able to discern your correction in the original, depending on how closely they are looking at it.
If you want to copy or scan it from the original, it may be more difficult to notice your correction.

, If you are working in pen and ink, and make a mistake or spill some ink, your first thought might be to erase the mistake. If none of the above methods are practical for your spilled ink, you might try camouflaging your error by adding elements to your artwork, such as background or color.Using opaque color over the ink can also hide the error.
If you've accidentally drawn outside your original design, consider adding ornamentation to your design. If you do this will, it will look like you've intended to draw it this way from the beginning!

, Of course, this isn't erasing the ink, but it functions exactly the same as erasing an error would. If none of the above methods work for erasing ink from your page, lay a fresh page on top of your original. Trace the entire paper, leaving out the part you'd like to erase. Finish by making the correction on the new page.This method is intensive, but if you're working on a pen and ink artwork it may be the best way to go.
Correcting your page this way results in a brand new page, as if the mistake never happened.

Purchase sandpaper for your eraser purifying.,
Rub the afflicted areas of your eraser with the sandpaper.,
Store your eraser properly to prevent re-gunking.,
Repeat your eraser cleaning as necessary.",How to Clean an Eraser2," Sandpaper is a somewhat more direct way of purifying blemishes off your eraser. Sandpaper should be available at your local hardware store, or you might be able to find some in the automotive section or home and garden section of your local general retailer. Craft stores might also be a good place to look.


You’ll want to choose a finer grit sandpaper for your eraser purifying purposes. Grit ratings range from extra coarse (36 grit) to extra fine (320 grit). Too coarse a grit should be avoided, as it will remove more eraser than is necessary and shorten the life of your eraser.In a pinch, you might be able to use an emery board or nail file in place of sandpaper. However, gunk can get caught in the ridges of your board/file and may be difficult to remove.

, Look closely at your eraser and find the spots where gunk build-up, smear, and residue have accumulated. These will look like dark spots or smudges. These are the areas you’ll want to focus rubbing your sandpaper against. You should rub the blemishes on your eraser with light to moderate-light strokes; you won’t need to use much force to cause the shavings to come free.


You may be able to more precisely apply your sandpaper by bending it around a finger (or several fingers) and using the rounded edge to rub off the blemishes. You also might have success with using a corner or edge of your sandpaper to rub the blemishes free.
As you rub your eraser with sandpaper, shavings will come free, removing the blemishes along with them. Keep an eye on your sandpaper as you purify your eraser. If gunk begins to buildup on the surface of the paper, you should switch to a new section of the paper.
You may want to apply your sandpaper to your eraser over a garbage can. The grittiness of the paper will cause shavings to come free easily. Be careful not to remove more than is necessary. As soon as the gunk appears gone, your eraser should be clean., Specially designed pencil cases will prevent your eraser from becoming hard and unusable. But even a run-of-the-mill eraser case can keep your eraser from accumulating dust, dirt, and grime.


Specialty eraser cases can be bought at your local art store. Normal cases can usually be found in the stationary/office supply section of your local general retailer, or even at office supply stores.
You can keep a small square or several small squares of sandpaper in your eraser case to remove blemishes from your eraser as they arise. Simply take some scissors and cut your sandpaper down to a size that will fit in the case. , When using sandpaper, you should be careful not to wear away too much of the eraser while removing blemishes. Sandpaper will wear away at your eraser much more quickly than normal paper. Rubbing too hard can drastically shorten the life of your eraser.


Using a light hand to remove blemishes with your sandpaper will allow you to get the cleanest and most consistent use from your eraser. Removing blemishes will also extend the usability of your eraser, helping you to get the most out of it.

Identify the kind of eraser you are using.,
Check the hardness of your eraser.,
Throw out cheap rubber erasers.",How to Clean an Eraser3," Some erasers are intended for a specific purpose. For example, if you are using an ultra-firm eraser that’s intended to scour deep marks, like those made with soft lead pencils or pen ink, your eraser might be fine. In this case, you should switch erasers to one that more suits the kind of writing you are doing.


Rubber erasers can come in many sizes, shapes, and colors. The most common of these is the classic pink eraser that you are likely familiar with seeing at the end of your pencil. These work decently for graphite pencils.
Gum erasers are softer than normal rubber erasers. These have a tendency to crumble when used, but this is completely natural for this kind of eraser. Gum erasers are often brown or semi-transparent in color. These are ideal for graphite pencils.
Vinyl erasers are sometimes called plastic erasers. This kind is ultra-tough and can tear through paper rather easily. You can expect this kind of eraser to remove most markings from paper – including ink. They are most often white and erase very cleanly., Some erasers, like those designed to remove pen or soft lead from paper, will naturally be harder than gum erasers or other soft types. However, over time, your eraser can lose elasticity and become so hard that it simply will no longer erase. Press the nail of your finger into the eraser. If it resists you firmly, it may be time to get a new eraser.


To further test your eraser’s ability to do its job, you can take a piece of normal paper and write a short message or doodle in pencil. Then use a clean looking patch of your eraser to attempt and erase the writing. If it smears or does a poor job, your eraser might be at the end of its life.
Before decided your eraser has outlived its usefulness, you may want to use some medium-fine grit (180 grit should suffice) sandpaper to take off the outer skin. Sometimes the inner parts of the eraser will keep potency even after the outside of the eraser has hardened.

, Some erasers are made with cheap rubber or are poorly formulated for erasing. It might seem strange, but the composition of specialty and high quality erasers is a closely guarded trade secret by many companies. If you ever come across an eraser that just doesn’t seem to cut it, save yourself some time and frustration by tossing the cheap one away and finding one that will do the job you need."

Do not dilute the white vinegar with water.
While soapy water and alcohol-based products will dry out your scissors, causing them to rust, vinegar will not., Retrieve a fresh rag. Dip the clean rag into the dish of white vinegar. Allow the vinegar to absorb into the rag.


You may wish to wring out the rag to remove excess vinegar.
Use a thick rag—it will protect your from the blades., Open up the blades of your scissors. Slowly and carefully run the cloth over the blades to remove the adhesive. Dip the cloth in vinegar as needed.


When you wipe the blades, begin at the base of the handles and move down towards the tips.
If the sides of your blades are coated in sticky residue or the residue is not coming off, encircle the blades with the cloth and apply pressure as you wipe down the blades."
"
Remove dirt and lint from your blades.,
Oil your blades.,
Wipe off the excess oil.",How to Clean Adhesive from Scissors3," Once you’ve removed the adhesive, it is important to protect and preserve your blades by cleaning and oiling your scissors. Wipe down the blades, handles, and pivot with a piece of clean, soft fabric. The fabric will remove lint, grime, and residue from the cleaning products you used.


The pivot is the point at which the two blades join.
As you wipe down the blades with the cloth, open and close the scissors so you can clean around the pivot., Open your scissors. Place several drops of oil onto the front and back of the pivot, or adjustment, screw. Apply several more drops of oil to the pivot between the blades. Open and close the blades several times until they move smoothly.


If needed, add more drops of oil to the blades.
When oiling your blades, you may use household sewing machine oil or scissor oil. , Once the blades are opening and closing smoothly, retrieve a clean, soft cloth. Carefully run the cloth over the blades to soak up the excess oil.


Wipe your scissors from the base of the handles to the tip of the blades.
If your scissors are susceptible to rust, wipe a minor amount of oil over each blade. Prior to using the blades, remove the oil with a fresh, soft cloth."

Choose shred speed.,
Identify daily usage.,
Determine multiple page capacity.,
Consider anti-jam technology.",How to Choose a Paper Shredder2," The size of shredded pieces is the most important factor in determining what shredder to buy, but shred speed can also be important. If you have a large volume of paper to shred, it can be time consuming with a low shred speed. The speed of the shredder you should purchase depends on whether you're using the shredder at home or at an office.If you're just using your shredder to shred paper at home, a home shredder should meet your needs. Typically, home shredders shred 5 to 12 sheets of paper in 2 to 8 minutes.
If you shred paper frequently, you may want a higher shredder speed. If you have a home office, for example, a home office shredder may work for you. These types of shredders usually shred 10 to 18 sheets of paper in 7 to 30 minutes.
If you're buying a shredder for a large office, you'll want a very high shredding speed. Go for a heavy duty shredder. These can shred for 45 minutes continually. During this time, 13 to 38 pieces of paper can be shredded.

, Select a shredder rated for the amount of daily usage you think you'll need. This often depends on whether the shredder will be located in a home or in an office setting. Avoid purchasing a shredder that is not powerful enough to meet your daily needs. To determine usage, figure out how many people will use the shredder and how often they will shred paper.Personal shredders are designed for 1 person. Small office shredders are for 1-5 daily users. For larger offices, a general office shredder can support 6-10 people. For 10 or more users, choose a commercial shredder.

, Find out how many sheets a shredder can handle at once. A 5 sheet model may be less costly. If you shred more than the occasional page, you will have to feed a few sheets at a time. Without a multiple page capacity, you may have to unjam the shredder a lot. It's a good idea to choose a shredder with a slightly higher shred capacity than you'll reasonably use. This can cut down on paper jams and other issues.Some commercial shredders will allow you to shred as many as 30 sheets of paper at a time. Most personal shredders only allow a few sheets at a time.
The bin capacity is also important. It's a good idea to get a shredder with a pull out bin, they're much easier to remove and empty and this can help reduce paper jams.Inquire about the shredder's run time. If you collect your documents and shred them in bulk, you will need a shredder that can run for a longer period of time. A run cycle can range from around 2 minutes to around 40 minutes., Whether you are feeding one or many documents into the shredder, there is the potential for a paper jam. Anti-jam features help to limit this problem and reduce unnecessary frustration.It may be particularly important to go for a shredder with anti-jam technology if you shred a lot of paper. The more paper you're shredding, the more likely your shredder is to jam.
Some shredders claim to be 100% jam proof. While it's unlikely any shredder will never jam, jam proof shredders may significantly cut down on jam time.
Certain shredders are designed to shred credit cards, paper clips, and many other items.

Look for a warranty.,
Note energy saving features.,
Make safety a priority.,
Keep the noise level down.",How to Choose a Paper Shredder3," The longer the warranty, the better. Although most warranties are for one year, you may find a longer warranty. The warranty will generally cover the mechanical part of the shredder in the event your shredder breaks down prematurely.Try to keep warranties as long as you can, and hold onto your shredder until the warranty expires. To keep track of how long your warranty will last, make a note of the warranty's expiration date in your calendar.
Ask in store about warranties. Some warranties may come from the company that makes the shredder itself. However, if you're buying your shredder through a large retail chain, like Best Buy, these stores may offer warranties as well.

, In the long run, energy saving features could save you money in utility expenses. If you do not plan to use the shredder often, this may not be an important factor. However, if you're shredding documents every day, look into energy saving technology. About 80% of a shredder's energy consumption comes from shredding papers, so you can rack up your energy bill fast if you use your shredder frequently.Some shredders claim to reduce energy consumption by up to 70%. Others claim to be 100% energy effective.
For the best savings, look for a shredder that promises to maximize energy savings 100% of the time, whether it's being used or not.

, Some shredders have sensors that stop the shredder if hands or other items come too close to the opening. Safety features are important if you have children or animals.Ideally, a shredder should have an automatic shutoff feature. If fingers get too close to a shredder's blades, it should shut off.
Check the shredder's box to learn about safety features. If you're buying in store, you can also talk to a worker about safety concerns.

, Some shredders have a feature that reduces noise by 10 decibels. If you live in an apartment, your neighbors may get annoyed if you have a shredder that's constantly running. Shredders that make a lot of noise can also be irritating for you.Look for paper shredders that promise a quieter job. You may also want to read reviews by other users, specifically looking for reviews that discuss a shredder's noise level.
If possible, test a shredder out in store before purchasing it to evaluate how much noise it makes.

Select stationery that is heavy and can withstand an ink stamp. You don’t want the ink to bleed through to the back of the paper either.

, Pink or red may be the obvious choice for your rose, however you can get creative by selecting a variety of colors. Make sure your veggie base fits completely inside the ink pad so the entire bottom can be inked.


Choose ink that can be painted on the vegetable bottom if you can’t find a pad that fits the bill.

, These will depend upon the amount, length and width of the items you'll be placing inside the case. The shape of a square or rectangle works best for a pencil bag.


Use a ruler or measuring tape to work out the size of the bag; measure the contents and allow for a little extra room around the edges (for ease of movement) to calculate the total size.

, A zipper can be placed either at the short side or long side of a rectangle, depending upon your preference.

The ""r"" sound.,
Sustained ""e""s. Next, when you say your ""e""s, you will make it as long as possible.,
Morphed ""i""s. When you say a short ""i"" sound, you turn it into something more like an ""ee"".,
Equal stressing.,
""Th"" to ""dz"".,
Stressing the last syllable.,
Euh.,
Your ""H's"" should be silent.,
Now, practice practice practice!",How to Fake a Convincing French Accent," The first and most important part of a fake French accent is the ""r."" When you say, for instance, ""Rat,"" you would push your tongue to the back of your throat as if pronouncing a ""gee"" sound. Your ""r"" will turn out to be a rolled/groaned ""rgr"".


It is important to relax the soft part of the back of your mouth as well as the tip of your tongue a bit. When you try to force air between your tongue and the back of your palate, expect to hear the sickly sound of loose flesh flapping away.
Another way to create an authentic French ""r"" sound is to replace the ""r"" with an English ""h"" sound, but try to really rough it up, almost gargling as you make the ""h"" sound.
In Quebec, the 'r' sound that has been aforementioned,is pronounced like 'ear'. So if this sentence - 'where is the park?', it would be pronounced as 'whis the pak (or perk)?'






In words where the ""r"" is hard to pronounce, it may sound non-rhotic altogether. For example, ""carpenter"" can sound like ""cahpentergr"".;
, Example: ""recorder"" can sound completely transformed as ""rgreh-caw-der"".

, For example, ""fish"" will sound more like ""feesh"", but do not make it any longer than you would ""fish"".

, In French, each syllable has about equal stress (DA-DA-DA-DUM), as opposed to English which tends to be iambic (stress comes second, Da-DUM-da-DUM). So it's good to think a little trochaic to counteract the English tendency (stress comes first, DUM-da-DUM-dum). So instead of ""po-' de-'-ment"", think ""'-leece '-part-'"".

, The ""th""s in words are spoken as a ""z."" And if you want to be really accurate, shoot for a ""dz"" sound, like ""dzees"" for ""this"".

, In French, always stress the last syllable of a sentence or before you pause with a rising pitch as if asking a question. (E.g. ""I am from New York(?)."")

, Be sure to throw in lots of gratuitous ""euh""s. ""Euh"" in French is the equivalent of ""Ummm"" or ""Ah..."" in English, a place-holder sound people make when they are thinking about what they are going to say next. It is pronounced more or less as it is written here. Hold on to you your ""euuhhhhhh"" as long as you can and try to start every sentence with at least one good ""euuhhhhhhhhhh"". (Never ever say ""Ummm"" or ""Ah..."" when speaking or faking French!)


To better pronounce ""euh"", start off with an ""eh"" sound (like in ""bed"") and slowly slide your way towards the ""oh"" sound (like in ""so"") BUT do not ever get there! You must end on a sound about halfway between, but make no hint at the ""oh"" sound.

, Instead of how it's 'ow and hospital is 'ospital.

, The more you work on it, the better your accent gets!

Roll your RRRRRRs.,
Practice the TH sound.,
Remember that in French, the stress is almost always on the LAST syllable, not second to last which is common in English or Spanish.,
Learn how to stutter/hesitate.,
Keep the H silent.,
Change the sound of the O. O is not rounded off, like in English where you would pronounce it OH, but rather becomes a British English or New York AW.,
Make the I's sound like EE's.,
Learn French syntax.,
Practice.",How to Do a Credible French Accent," The first step of learning a French accent is to learn how to pronounce the R-sound. Think of it like this: Imagine you have a hair stuck in the back of your throat and you're trying to get it out. How would you sound? Hrrr, hrrr, hrrr. That's a sharp, ""aggressive"" sound, so you need to take away the ""H"" in front, to make the R soft-sounding. It will sound almost like gargling. If you know how Spaniards pronounce J, you're onto something. Not the Mexican way of saying J which is almost the equivalent of an English H sound. The Spanish J is too harsh and sharp, so remember to soften it.;
, Time and again, the French (and many others) prove unable to pronounce the English ""th""-sound. Now, there are two TH-sounds in English: The TH in ""there"" or ""though"" is soft, while the TH in ""with"" or ""think"" is more sharp. Make sure you understand this difference in English. The French pronounce the TH-sound in ""there"" as a Z or even sometimes DZ: ""Dzere are no more bananas"". The sharp TH, the one in 'thing"" and ""theater"", is often just pronounced without the H: ""I tink I can do anything"".

, Also, extend the E's if they are in the last syllable of a word: ""remembehr"". If pronounced with a French accent, the word ""remember"" should rhyme more with ""in the air"" than with ""surrender.""

, Where English speakers might say Ahh or Uhmm when they otherwise do not know what to say (e.g. while you are thinking), such as ""I, uhmm, think you may have a cold"", the French would use their ""Euh"" sound (not pronounced like ""eew, that's gross"") Although there are no letters in English which represent this sound, it is comparable to the I in girl (which, when you think about it is very different from the I in, say, ""fill"", which in turn is different from the I in ""file"") or the O in ""world"" (which is different from the O in for instance ""go"", or the O in ""forty""). Try saying the words ""world"" and ""girl"" without pronouncing the whole word (i.e. stop after wo- and gi-). These two sounds are almost the same. That vowel which is represented by I in girl and O in world is the French way of saying something hesitantly.

, The H is always silent. Words such as ""hamper"", ""honey"" and ""holiday"" become ""amper"", ""oney"" and ""oliday"".

, Americans would pronounce this AH (AH-some, AH-full), but the British would say AW-ful, like the O in ""more"".

, Thin becomes ""theen"". Thin should rhyme with ""mean"", not with ""pin"".

, The syntax (the structure of a sentence) is different in French from in English. In French, when you say ""What did you do this weekend?"" you would say ""Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ce weekend?"" which literally translates into ""What is that which you have done this weekend?"". Obviously, this is complicated, even to the French themselves, so they colloquially would just say ""T'as fait quoi ce weekend?"", which literally translates into ""You have done what this weekend?"" Notice that the verb ""to do"" comes before the person ""you"" in English, but after it in French. When it comes to questions, the French put the person first, then whatever the person does comes second, which is opposite of English. Thus, where an American might say ""Have you done your homework?"", a Frenchman might say ""You have done your homework?""

, Let's sum up by pronouncing a whole English sentence as a Frenchman with poor English skills would (syllable stress in bold): "" I have not remembered to do my homework for more than a month"" becomes "" I ave not remembered to do my omeweuhrk for more dzan a mont""

Pronounce “th” like a “d.” Place your tongue behind your teeth as you say words like “that” and “there.” These words become “dat” and “dere.” Remember to speak with a nasal tone, letting your voice resonate through your nose.Other “th” word examples include this, these, and those.,
Drop the “g” off “-ing” words.,
Lengthen long “o” sounds into two syllables.,
Turn the short “a” into a long “a” sound for some words.,
Memorize Wisconsinite pronunciations for the state and cities.,
Learn local terms for objects.,
Use “interesting” for polite criticism.,
Say “yous” or “yous guys” when referring to others.,
Say “ya know” to start and end thoughts.,
Make polite requests with “real quick” and “one time.” Someone can say to you, “Can you stop by da store real quick?” or “Let me see dat one time.” They aren’t demanding that you be speedy.,
Use “go by” or “come by” for direction.,
Add “‘n so” and “eh” to turn sentences into gentle questions.",How to Do a Wisconsin Accent,";
, Abbreviate these words by leaving out the ending. A word like “going” becomes “goin’.” In Wisconsin, “They’re going fishing” becomes “Dey’re goin’ fishin’.”Another example is, “I’d be happy callin’ dem stop ‘n go lights.”

, The word “toad” normally has one syllable. In Wisconsin, pronounce it with a long “o” and a short i. It’ll sound like “tow-id.”A word such as “rhino” becomes “rhino-uh.” Pronounce the “no” with two syllables so it sounds like the name Noah.

, The “a” in words like bag and drag are pronounced like the “a” in bagel. Draw out the vowel. Bag becomes “bayg” and drag becomes “drayg.”A rag becomes a “rayg” and lag becomes “layg.”

, The “Wi” in Wisconsin is softly pronounced as “Wuh.” The “o” is pronounced like the “a” in “cat,” so you may hear “wuh-Scahnsin.” Milwaukee is pronounced without the “l,” so it sounds like “Muh-WOK-key.” Shawano is pronounced “Shah-no.”Up nort’ is the term for anything north of you, all the way up to the state border. Many people go north to vacation, hunt, and fish., Some objects in Wisconsin have different names than elsewhere. A bubbler is a drinking fountain. Traffic lights are referred to as stop ‘n go lights. The midday meal may be called dinner, but the evening meal is supper. Some people may refer to ATMs as TYME machines., For example, a Wisconsinite may say, “Dat’s an interestin’ lookin’ blouse.” It means the blouse looks strange or unpleasant. The word can be used to describe bad-tasting food without aggression., You becomes “yous.” When referring to a group, say “yous guys.” For example,you may use these words to ask where someone is from. “Where-a-bouts are yous guys from?”, You can start with “Ya know” to show that you’re about to share a thought. Ending a sentence with “ya know?” is a way of asking if someone else agrees or understands what you shared., “Real quick” and “one time” make requests seem softer and less of a hassle.”Once” is also used in place of “one time.” For example, say, “Come by here once” to suggest that someone should come to where you are.

, Instead of “go to” or “come to,” replace the “to” with “by.” For example, say, “Go by da store, den come by me.” It means the person should go to the store, then go to your location.”By” may also be used as a greeting, such as in “How’s by you?” You may answer this with “Fair to middlin’.”

, Both phrases have the same meaning. They are used at the ends of statements to prompt a response. “Eh?” is pronounced like “hay” without the “h.” “‘N so” is pronounced like “en SEW” and stands for “ain’t that so?”Although these two phrases are used the same way, “‘n so?” sounds a little stronger. Your conversation partner may provide a more forceful response to what you said.

Get a cheap voice changer toy.",How to Disguise Your Voice1," There are a variety of smart phone apps for iPhones and Androids that you can use to change the sound of your voice, many of them free. New apps are always coming out, so check out the app store to find out what's available.


Some of them allow you to record your voice and play it back in manipulated form, while others allow you to speak into the phone and project weird robot noises and other big changes. One app, Call Voice Changer, even lets you make calls with your new fake voice.;
, You can use a Digital Audio Workstation (D.A.W) on a Windows or Mac. Garageband, ProTools or Ableton can all be used to record and manipulate your voice, then change it.


Use effects and plugins like distortion, pitch shifters, speed adjustments to make your voice sound gravely, low, or high, according to what you want.
Record yourself saying common or funny phone phrases like, ""What do you want?"" or ""Can I take a message?"" or ""My son won't be coming to school today"" to pull off the gag.

, Play music just loud enough so that your voice can be heard over it. You can use other recorded sounds as well, including traffic noise, white noise and static, or even the sounds of heavy machinery.


Another person can help you by making humming noises or other sounds while you are speaking that have the same effect as recorded sounds.
Put a handkerchief or other piece of cloth over the phone’s voice input area and move it around to create a static effect. Try using different materials for a different effect.

, One of the easiest and fastest ways to change your voice is to buy a little megaphone with silly effects to speak through. Voice changers can be found in magic or joke gift shops, as well as more serious surveillance stores, and even Halloween stores.


These toys are usually available at a wide range of prices, and the cost will usually determine the quality. Even the cheap ones help to make your voice sound a lot different.
A regular megaphone can be used to change the sound of your voice too. Just stand back from the phone, or you'll blow the other person away.

Adopt a relaxed oral position.,
Pronounce vowel sounds laterally.,
Master the /th/ sound.,
Vocalize /r/ sounds.,
Isolate and practice similar sounds you have difficulty with.",How to Fake a Convincing American Accent1," Your face should be mostly at rest when speaking American English. This includes your lips, your jaw, and your tongue. Your tongue, however, should rest in the middle of your mouth behind your front two teeth.


To verify using proper oral posture, sigh. On the exhale, make an /ə/ (love) sound. This is proper American oral posture.
Words with a similar vowel to the /ə/ sound for the oral posture verification technique include glove, dove, and shove.;
, Generally speaking, American vowels are more laterally (side-to-side) wide than they are tall. Rounded vowels, like the /u:/ in boot, the /ɔ:/ in bought, and the /ou/ in boat, are exceptions to this rule.


Most American vowels are made from the front or central part of your mouth. Only /u:/ (boot), /ɔ:/ (bought), and /ou/ (boat) occur in the back of the mouth.
Practice saying common vowels with a wide, lateral shape to your mouth, like the /æ/ in cat, the /i/ in sit, the /ə/ in sofa, and the /i:/ in treat., This sound can be especially difficult if it isn't in your native language or dialect. Stick your tongue forward in your mouth so it is behind your top front teeth. Exhale air while your tongue is in this position to make the /th/ sound.There are two versions of the /th/ sound. One is unvoiced, which means your throat doesn't vibrate when making it, as in think. The other is voiced and vibrates your throat, like this.
Most /th/ words are unvoiced. Some common voiced /th/ words include the, this, that, these, then, they, and there.
While mastering this sound, it's common to accidentally spit or become tongue tied. It may take some time before your mouth is comfortable making this sound.

, To make the /r/ sound, raise your tongue so it approaches, but does not touch, the upward ridge behind your front teeth. Pull back the tip of your tongue slightly so that it bunches and raises a little at its middle. The front of the tongue should be in the front of your mouth, placed relatively low.When making this sound, the corners of your lips should contract slightly, pushing your lips slightly away from your face.
If you speak a non-rhotic dialect of English where you elongate vowels in place of making an American /r/ sound or if you speak a language without this sound, it can take considerable time and effort to train your mouth to get this right., This is especially important if you're a non-native speaker of English. For example, you may have difficulty articulating the difference between /ə/ (love) and /u/ (good). Practice any sounds that give you trouble.You can practice difficult sounds by noting words that trip you up and making a list of similar sounding words. Say these words side-by-side.

If you can breathe in more air, your voice will be stronger, and it's less likely that your voice will crack., If you're like many people, you breathe from your chest without much support from your diaphragm. However, breathing from your diaphragm gives your voice more support, making it stronger.When breathing, make sure you expand your stomach as you breathe in.

, Joining a community choir is a great way to help develop diaphragm breathing, but it's not the only way. You can also try out for community theater or take an acting class, as learning to project also teaches you this type of breathing., Another way you can develop your breathing is to practice theater breathing exercises on your own. One you can try is making an ""fffffffff"" sound. However, as you make the noise, don't change the position of your chest or stomach. When you do need to breathe, imagine it in your stomach and try to breathe from there.You can also switch up the sounds, using ""ssssss,"" ""hummmmm,"" or ""vvvvvvv.""
You can also try reading the nursery rhyme ""The House that Jack Built."" This story is broken up into main thoughts. Try to draw enough breath for each thought, so you don't need to stop in the middle of it to breathe. Speak slowly and deliberately, keeping each thought at the same speed.

, If you try to increase the strength of your voice without breathing properly, you'll just end up shouting. That can cause your voice to crack and will push people away. However, when your breathing is properly supported, you'll project calmness and confidence without shouting., Justified or not, manliness is associated with confidence. If you speak with confidence, you are more likely to convince others of your power. Try not to hesitate or trip over words. If you need to, think about what you're going to say before you say it., As you speak, think about speaking in a lower tone. Just being conscious of your pitch can help you drop your voice to a lower range. It also may help to speak slow and steady, so you don't rush and make your pitch go higher., More manly voices tend to have more chest resonance.You can use exercises to help place your voice more in your chest, rather than just in your mouth or nose.Try the deep breathing technique where you breathe from your diaphragm. But as you do, lean your head back so your throat is basically a straight line. Try breathing in this position for a few seconds, then add in sounds like vowels or consonants.

, A voice coach can work with you to develop the strength and depth of your voice. They can help you access some of the lower ranges to create a more manly sounding voice., If your voice is unnaturally high, you could have a health problem or an imbalance of hormones. Visit your doctor to see if maybe they have a solution that will fix the health problem and possibly deepen your voice., If you're transitioning, you may already be on testosterone. If you aren't and you're wanting to make your voice more manly, you may want to ask your doctor about taking it. Testosterone can increase the thickness of your larynx, which in turn can deepen your voice., Certain patterns of speech are ingrained along gender lines. For instance, women are more likely to lift up in pitch at the end of a sentence (essentially making it more of a question), as well as apologize more often. While you'll be able to figure out some of these on your own just by listening to the women and men around you, a voice coach can help you assess the ways you can change your voice.You can also try recording yourself and playing it back. You'll be able to hear your patterns of speech better.

, In today's world, you know there's an app for everything, including some that analyze your voice's pitch and help you work on lowering it. One app is called Eva, and it's specifically designed for transgender people who are transitioning., Some people who are transitioning will have a surgery performed on their larynx. With this surgery, the surgeon will place silicone implants in your vocal cords, which thickens them, deepening your voice.Other types of surgery loosen the tension in your vocal cords, which deepens your voice.

Raise and emphasize the “short a” vowel.,
Turn the “short o” vowel into the “short a.” As the short a turns into a different vowel, the short o comes into replace it.,
Shift the pronunciation of the “short u.” With this shift, words like “but” and “cut” sound more like “bought” and “caught.”This is the last of the main three vowels most Chicagoans shift; they are the most recognizable differences in this accent.,

, This turns “hot” into “hat” and “pop” into “pap.”You don’t want to exaggerate this shift too much; look up Chicagoans speaking on YouTube to understand the subtlety of this shift.

,


Learning these three vowel shifts will give you a more universal sounding Chicago accent.
Other variations on the pronunciation of vowels vary depending on specific neighborhoods within the city.

, You want the resulting sound to end up somewhere between how you would usually say a “th” and a “d.” The trick is in the placement of your tongue. With a regular “th” sound, your tongue is placed between your teeth as you begin saying it. With the Chicagoan “th,” your tongue starts behind your teeth, though make sure to still keep your teeth apart.


For instance, “There’s that guy from the office” becomes “Dhere’s dat guy from de office.”

, The word ""picture,"" for instance, commonly pronounced in Chicago as ""pitcher."" ""Cincture"" becomes ""cincher,"" sanctuary becomes ""sanchuary,"" and so on.

, In other words, ""little"" and ""bottle"" become ""liddle"" and ""boddle."" Don’t exaggerate the pronunciation of the “d,” or you’ll start sounding like a parody.

, Many Chicagoans slur their words slightly when they speak, letting them run into each other. This is especially true when one word ends with a vowel sound and the next one begins with one as well, though it also occurs with consonant sounds.


For instance, when saying ""Where are you at?"", ""where"" and ""are"" are blended together so that it sounds like ""Wherer,"" whereas ""you"" and ""at"" are contracted to ""y'at."" All together, this phrase should sound like ""Wherr yuh-at?""
If your answer is ""4200 North Pulaski,"" you say ""Forty-two hunnerd,"" not ""Forty-two hundred.""

, People from outside of Chicago often share the misconception that various Chicago landmarks and locations’ names are those seen on the signs. Real Chicagoans typically substitute their own vernacular for these locations, for instance :


It's the ""Sears Tower,"" not Willis Tower.It's ""Marshall Fields,"" not Macy's.It's ""Comiskey Park"" or ""Sox Park,"" never, ever US Cellular Field., In Chicago, the large, multi-lane highways for automobiles that are part of the national Interstate Highway System are not, in fact, ""interstates."" They are instead called expressways or highways. Better yet, call these highways by their honorary Chicago names. See below:


90-94 south of Downtown = ""Dan Ryan"" or ""The Ryan.""
290 = ""Eisenhower"" or ""The Ike.""
90-94 (and 90 after the split) north of Downtown = ""Kennedy.""
94 on the south side after it splits off from 90-94 = ""Bishop Ford""
55 = ""Stevenson.""
94 on the north side after splitting from 90-94 = ""Edens.""

, When you're in Chicago, calling a part of the city by its ""proper"" name can be a dead giveaway that you're not a local. Below are some primary examples of Chicagoan names for different parts of the city:


The downtown financial district is called ""The Loop.""
Anything south of Roosevelt Rd. is called ""The South Side,"" even though this includes more than half of the entire city.
Conversely, anything north of Division is ""The North Side.""

, There are many terms and phrases that Chicagoans use that you'll need to know if you want to have a convincing accent. Some of these aren’t unique to Chicago, as they are also found in other Northern cities. Here are a few examples:


“Soda” is known as “Pop.”
A “refrigerator” is sometimes referred to as an “ice box.”
Athletic shoes are referred to as “gym shoes” rather than “sneakers.”"

Slow down the speed at which you normally speak.",How to Disguise Your Voice2," If you want to talk differently without the aid of electronics or other tricks, you can learn to change the pitch of your voice. This will make you sound very different than you normally sound.


If your voice is naturally low, use your head voice to speak in a higher pitch than you normally do. This can be done by pinching your tongue against the roof of your mouth and talking from the back of your throat. Imagine you have a cold.
If you have a higher voice, speak from lower in your throat and your diaphragm to make your voice much lower. Pretend your voice is coming from deeper in the back of your throat.

, If you start pronouncing the words you use differently, it will sound like someone else is saying them. It can be a funny way to change up certain words and sound different.

Change up the vowels in words. Instead of saying ""there"" say ""thur.""

Speak with an accent if you know how to pull one off convincingly.

, You can do a few little things to the shape of your jaw, lips, and mouth to change the way your voice sounds. Try out the following:


Purse your lips the way you do when you whistle, and then speak. The sound of your voice will be much different.
Try sticking your tongue out a little while you are speaking. This tends to garble your words somewhat.
Open your mouth wide and speak.

, Even if your impression doesn't sound very accurate, if you're trying to sound different than yourself, shoot for a weird accent of a celebrity, or just a person that you know. Here are some good celebrity impressions to shoot for:


Bill Cosby
Christopher Walken
Sarah Palin
Fran Drescher
Al Pacino
Sylvester Stallone

, While your voice may sound basically the same, if you're using words you wouldn't normally use, it can be an effective disguise as well. Try out the following tips for picking words you don't normally use:


Use very smart-sounding or expensive words. Don't say something is ""good"" say that it's ""spectacular"" or ""stupendous."" Don't say that ""Yeah"" say ""That is affirmative.""
Use old words, or words that you've only heard your grandparents use. Don't call something ""cool"" but call it ""keen"" or ""dandy"" or ""groovy.""
Use lots of shortened words or slang words or use lots of text-speak. Any new youth phrases would be great. Or, totes fetch.

, Pause between words and sigh a lot, or draw out the words as you speak them, putting a bunch of extra syllables into them. You could also speed up the way you speak and chatter really quickly, although this is sometimes more difficult.

Choose which regional dialect you'll be faking.,
Familiarize yourself with terms in the dialect.,
Listen to native speakers of the dialect.,
Practice imitating the dialect on your own.",How to Fake a Convincing American Accent2," Southern American English is distinct from Yooper dialect, which is spoken in the upper peninsula of Michigan. For you to pull off a convincing accent, you're going to have to choose one specific dialect and stick with it. Common dialects include:


General American (used in mainstream media, similar to many Midwestern dialects)African American Vernacular English (sometimes called ""ebonics"")
Eastern New England
Southern
New York
Northern
Western, Certain dialects have features that are absent in others. For example, the phrase ""you all"" is spoken as normal in General American, but contracts to ""y'all"" (one word) in Southern dialect. When your dialect is decided, find terms like these with a keyword search for ""slang in .""


Learning slang terms in dialects of American English can also improve your listening skill. Many slang terms, like the ""you all"" variant of Pittsburghese (""yinz""), are difficult to follow without explanation.

, The more you hear the target dialect, the more natural it will become for you. Listen to music made by natives in the target dialect. If you live outside of America, try to make friends who use this dialect through cultural exchanges and meetups.Ask a friend, colleague, or acquaintance who speaks this dialect if you can record them. Make a recording on your phone, and listen carefully to the speaker's pronunciation.

, Play a recording of the dialect you're imitating. Try to mimic it exactly. Replay the recording after speaking to check your pronunciation. Have others listen to you and make suggestions.Practicing speaking in a new way can cause a kind of exhaustion, sometimes referred to as ""language fatigue."" Using facial muscles you're not used to can be tiring. Take plenty of breaks."

Get an accent coach.,
Practice enunciation drills.,
Use slang with caution.",How to Fake a Convincing American Accent3," A speech specialist, like a Speech Language Pathologist (sometimes called a speech therapist), can examine your articulation and make specific suggestions for improvement. What's more, these individuals often have a wealth of exercises they can recommend to improve your accent.Some acting coaches offer courses in impersonating accents. Many times these classes are offered at community colleges and theatres.

, Enunciation is the practice of speaking clearly. Doing enunciation drills in your target dialect is a great way to improve your pronunciation in it. Some drills you might try include:


Practicing /r/ by saying, ""Red lorry, yellow lorry,"" several times in a row. Start at a slow speed and generally increase it until you can say this rapidly without making an error.
Drilling the /th/ sound by saying, ""They thankfully think this thing is the best thing that they can throw the three times they need to throw a thing.""Looking up popular tongue twisters online for sounds you struggle with. Practice these until you can say them without getting tongue tied.
Training your mouth to make the /r/ sound by stretching out the sounds in the word ""eureka."" Say this several times in a row., Slang can make your American English sound more natural. Using the wrong slang word at the wrong time can be rude or betray the fact that you're not a native English speaker. Hold off on using slang until you're sure what it means and you're comfortable using it."

Aim for alliteration.,
Be conscious of consonance.,
Dance with assonance.",How to Create a Tongue Twister1," Alliteration is a literary device by which you string together a group of words that begin with the same consonant sound. The words appear in quick succession, and they emphasize each other.Tongues trip over the tricky tips of a thick alliterative twist. This will make your tongue twister much more difficult to say.


Alliteration can be as simple as two paired words that start with the same sound: ""tongue twist,"" ""loose lips,"" or ""Peter Piper."" Make the alliterative string even harder to say by adding more words: ""tricky tongue twist,"" ""last loose lips,"" or ""Peter Piper picked.""
Make sure that the alliterative words make sense together! A good tongue twister is more than just a string of random words and syllables. Seek to set down a sensible sentence.;
, Consonance describes the effect of consonants repeating within a word or a phrase. Think ""pitter patter."" The more complex the consonant string, the more difficult your tongue twister will be to say. Try to put the consonant sounds together in quick succession.


Consider the tongue twister ""Shelley sells seashells by the seashore."" The repetition of the ""ell"" sound in ""Shelley,"" ""sells,"" and ""seashells"" is a prime example of consonance, and it is part of why the phrase is so hard to say.If possible, put the consonant sounds right next to each other. The closer together the syllables, the more difficult the tongue twister. For instance, ""s"" sounds can be hard to pronounce in rapid succession.

, Assonance is when a string of words repeats the same vowel sound, even if the words begin with different consonant sounds. Assonance is often used to lend a musical effect to poetry and prose, and it can help give your tongue twister a driving rhythm.


Consider the tongue twister ""Men sell the wedding bells."" The short ""-e-"" sound repeats throughout the phrase: Men sell the wedding bells."""
"
Confuse with consonance.,
Reverse the positions of similar syllable sounds.,
Use consonants that are easy to mix up.",How to Create a Tongue Twister2," Trip up tongues by stringing together sounds that are very similar, but not identical. Find letter combinations that are almost alliterative, but not quite: like ""c,"" ""ch,"" and ""cl.""Try to say ""Irish wristwatch."" This tongue twister is hard because ""rish"" is consonant with ""wris,"" and the addition of the ""sh"" sound confuses the two ""ris"" sounds.

, Consider the tongue twister ""She sells seashells by the seashore."" ""She sells"" is a reverse of ""sea shells"" in that the ""s"" and ""sh"" syllables are flipped between the phrases.

, For instance, ""s,"" ""f,"" and ""th"" sound similar enough that they can trip someone up. Similarly, ""ck,"" ""x,"" and ""th"" can blend together when strung together in quick succession.


Try to say ""Theophilus Thistle, the thistle sifter, sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles.""
Try to say ""The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick.""

"
"
Play with words.,
Tell a story.,
Try starting with a name.,
Test your tongue twister.",How to Create a Tongue Twister3," Notice words that are hard to say together. Then, find words that are hard to say with the initial words, and link them all together in a chain. Try making a list of all the similar-sounding words that you can think of. When in doubt, run a web search for words that are consonant, assonant, and alliterative.

, Your tongue twister doesn't need to be the most insightful sentence in the world, and it doesn't have to be funny – but the words should at least make sense together. A nonsensical group of words might be hard to say, but it won't be as impressive as a cogent sentence., A lot of tongue twisters begin with a name: ""Shelly sells seashells by the seashore,"" or ""Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers."" This can give some structure to your phrase.Start with a person's name, and then come up with a sentence that tells a short story about them. Answer these questions:


Where did this person go?
What did this person do?
When did this person do this thing or go to this place?
Why did this person do this thing?, Try to say the phrase five times fast, and notice where you trip up. Ask your friends to say it, and gauge how much trouble they have. Rework your tongue twister if it isn't hard enough. Look for words and sounds that you can switch out with harder-to-say syllables.


Bear in mind that some people have more trouble pronouncing certain syllables than others. A hard tongue twister for one person might be easy for another. Always be respectful of speech impediments!

Familiarize yourself with each. While you don’t have to master mimicking them all, develop an ear to tell them apart so you can catch yourself later on should you slip in mid-sentence from one regional accent to another. Areas with their own distinct accent include:London/Cockney
Suffolk
Dorset/Somerset/Cornwall
Devon
Yorkshire
Lancashire
Liverpool
Northern Ireland
Scottish Highland
Scottish Lowland
North Wales
South Wales;
, Use sources that clearly identify where the speaker comes from, such as person-on-the-street features on the BBC news or even game shows when they introduce new contestants. Listen to interviews with public figures whose background is either widely known or easily researched online or with other reference material.Rely on current sources, since accents may change over time.Be discerning with your sources. Think of American media and how well (or poorly) different mediums reflect the way Americans actually talk. Notice how newscasters and public speakers like politicians often adopt speech patterns found nowhere else in society. Watch the countless number of American actors who butcher other American accents in American-made TV and movies. Pick your sources for British accents with that in mind.
If you do rely on TV or movies, choose British productions instead of American ones that just happen to feature British actors. Be aware that American productions sometimes direct foreign actors to tone down their accents so American audiences have an easier time understanding them. Also stick to films with contemporary settings, as opposed to period pieces, since accents and lingo may change over time.

, Learn the difference between regional accents and the RP, otherwise known as the Queen’s English. Listen to audio clips of the Queen (obviously), other royals, elected officials like Prime Minister David Cameron, and BBC newscasters.Note the uniformity of accent between speakers, regardless of their origins. Learn the difference between sounding “posh” (the RP) and “common” (regional accents.)Historically, British society used to place a great deal of emphasis on the RP as a way to judge each other’s social standing. However, this bias isn’t as prevalent as it once was, and fewer people strive to speak the Queen’s English.Although it's still in use, today you're more likely to hear it from public speakers, such as government officials, newscasters, and actors.
As the center of Britain’s government, finances, and culture, London is where the RP is most likely to be heard., Once you feel like you have a grasp on recognizing various British accents, see how well your ear can pick them out. Ask a friend to find new audio clips of different British speakers. Try to identify each speaker’s origin by their accent alone.

, Hang out with friends and acquaintances who grew up in the same region as you. Imagine that you’re only hearing their accent (and thus yours) for the very first time. Pretend you’re a recent transplant to the area who grew up somewhere else entirely. Pay close attention to the way they pronounce and string words together. In particular, keep an ear out for:Vowels
Consonants
Stressed syllables
Intonations

, When you speak out loud in your own natural accent, pay attention to your body. Note how your throat, mouth, tongue, and jaw work together to produce sounds. Since Americans and Britons use their muscles differently to pronounce the same language,familiarize yourself with how your own muscles produce vocal patterns that are uniquely American; this way, you can better identify those signatures creeping back into your voice when you attempt a British accent later on. American tendencies include:


Speaking with a wide mouth to the point of grinning or almost grinning.Replacing T’s with D’s; for example, pronouncing “batter” as “badder.”Creating sounds in the back of their mouths, in or near their throats.Lumping sounds together; for example, “gotta” instead of “got to.”, Speak American English “correctly” without losing your accent. Use the correct sounds for consonants. Pronounce each word distinctly.Correct your grammar. Start shedding a few of your American tendencies from your normal speech before adding British ones.


For example, instead of saying, “The batter’s gotta run round da bases,” make a point of saying, “The batter has to run around the bases.”

, Whether it's a regional accent or the Queen's English, once you decide on one to develop, listen closely to video samples. Start with short clips of common phrases shared by Americans and Britons.Pay close attention to the following:Vowels
Consonants
Stressed syllables
Intonation

, Opt for a public figure who's been recorded extensively in interviews on a wide variety of subjects, which will likely increase the vocabulary that they use. Choose someone of similar build to yourself so you can mirror them more exactly. Also find someone with the same temperament as you so that you have to ""act"" less; for example, if you’re a quiet introvert by nature, imitating someone who’s more bombastic would probably be more tiring and unconvincing.

, Since the difference in accents is largely produced by the way a speaker physically forms sounds, study the speaker’s throat, mouth, tongue, and jaw as they talk. Note the way Britons refrain from grinning like Americans when they speak and how they open their mouths vertically instead of horizontally;for instance, picture Alan Rickman saying, “Ho ho ho,” in Die Hard.


Although it’s hard to see, another British tendency is to make much more use of the tip of their tongue than Americans do.Strengthen your own tongue by practicing consonant-sounds repeatedly, making sure to use the tip of your tongue to full effect.

, Using video samples, play clips of the speaker talking. Then repeat what they said in your British accent. Use a mirror or a computer’s camera to watch yourself as you do so. Match the way you set your face, throat, and mouth to that of the speaker. Mimic all of their body language as well to mirror them more closely.Start small. Play short clips at first. Find ones where the speaker is using simple, common phrases that you normally use, too, so you can spot the differences between their pronunciation and your own more clearly.
Expand your rehearsals. Once you’ve mastered mimicking short phrases, begin tackling longer speeches. Gradually increase the number of lines you repeat at one time. If you’re watching an interview, practice lengthy answers individually. Then try answering multiple questions with lengthy answers, all in one go. Continue building each rehearsal until you’re performing the speaker’s entire interview.
Also start expanding your sources. Find material where the person you’re imitating experiences strong, genuine emotions as they speak. Note how this effects their speech.

, As you attempt speaking in your British accent for longer stretches, record each one.Play them back and listen for where your British accent weakens and your natural accent (or some other British accent that slipped in there by mistake) emerges. Identify whether that was simply due to fatigue or if it’s a common flaw that you’re repeating elsewhere in similar circumstances.


If replicating a particular sound gives you difficulty, select or come up with a phrase that makes heavy use of it, like a tongue-twister. Practice it repeatedly until you overcome this hurdle., Pick a book to read out loud, preferably by a British author. Start reading small passages in your British accent. Work your way up to entire chapters.Strengthen your ability to maintain your accent for longer and longer stretches. Record yourself as you read to play back later on and find where you’ve slipped.

, Devote significant time each day to “being British.” Stay in character despite any and all distractions. Stick with it until it becomes totally natural, to the point where you say “Ow!” like a Brit whenever you stub your toe accidentally., If you know anyone who’s British, use your accent in conversation with them, the sooner, the better. Identify mistakes you’re making without realizing it as soon as possible, before they become too ingrained.Let the other person know what you’re doing beforehand to avoid offending them should they think that you’re just mocking the way they talk., Once you feel confident that you can speak with a fluent accent, try it out on people who don’t know you. Go shopping and pretend you’re British with the sales staff. Ask people on the street for the time. Engage in as much small talk as you can.Pay attention to the other person. Gauge your performance by their reactions.If they seem incredulous at any point or call you out point-blank, note where you lost them as an area you need to work on more.

, Avoid giving yourself away by using Americanisms in conversation. Immerse yourself in British media (books, films, television) to pick up phrases and key words used in their culture. Learn what’s in common usage by everyday Brits (such as “flat,” “loo,” and “lorry”) and what’s slang used by specific sub-cultures (like Cockney rhyme-speak).


Be wary of relying on some British bands for lingo, since many (especially in rock’s early days) emulated American blues and rock, to the point of adopting Americanisms in their lyrics; the Rolling Stones, for example, often used “dollars” instead of “pounds” in songs like “19th Nervous Breakdown.”

, Learn the metric system. Find out how many pence are in a pound (answer: 100) and other currency standards. Know how to read the weather in both celsius and fahrenheit, since both are used in the UK. Pick up as much as you can about British culture so you don’t end up undermining your perfect British accent by, say, having no idea what or when Boxing Day is.

Pick a new laugh style.,
Imitate a laugh that you like.,
Think about why you want to change your laugh.,
Consider whether there is anything you really need to change.,
Use a sound recorder to study your laugh.,
Find a space where you can be alone.,
Make yourself laugh authentically.,
Try to get to the root of your undesirable laugh.,
Make an effort to use the new laugh in social situations.,
Practice the laugh every chance you get.,
Don't be afraid to let the laugh evolve.,
Introduce your laugh slowly when around friends.",How to Change Your Laugh," If you don't have a style in mind, make it a goal to actively search for a laugh that you like. Look for inspiration everywhere that people are laughing: listen to the people you meet, characters from movies, and television personalities. Listen to loved ones and listen to strangers. Constantly be on the lookout for good laughs.


YouTube is a good source of recorded human speech – as is the Internet, period.
Think about why you like certain laughs. Maybe you like a laugh because it's deep and hearty, or because hearing it makes you yourself laugh.;
, When you hear a laugh that inspires you, try to remember it or record it. When you're alone, find a mirror and try to mimic the laugh you heard. This mimicry may happen naturally, if you spend time around people with compelling laughs – but you can certainly make the process more intentional by choosing which laugh to try.Be aware that if you outright mimic a laugh that's famous from television or a movie, people may notice. Decide whether or not you want this.

, Perhaps there's something that you don't like about your current laugh – it's too loud, or too giggly, or too creepy. Try to cultivate a laugh that deliberately avoids these undesirable qualities. Use this self-awareness to change specific aspects of your laugh, and you may find that you solve your problem.If your laugh is too loud, try to laugh more quietly. If your laugh is too giggly—high-pitched and quick—you might try to laugh more slowly, in a deeper pitch.

, People are often unaware that their breathing needs change when laughing; for instance, many people snort because that is the way the body has adapted to get more oxygen during laughter. Try asking people who are close to you about how your laughter sounds. This can be very illuminating: if there is something annoying or disturbing about your laugh, they will likely tell you!

, Tape yourself laughing, or ask someone else do it for you. Then, play back the recording and listen for what makes your laugh unique or undesirable. Maybe you snort loudly and often; maybe you giggle more than you'd like. As you work to change your laugh, you can record and rerecord your laugh to analyze your progress and tweak the style.


If you have a specific new laugh in mind, consider playing the recording of your original laugh at the same time as a recording of the laugh you'd like to imitate. This way, you may be able to better hear the subtle differences between the two.

, Try laughing in the car, or in a remote area, or in front of the mirror. When you feel ready, start laughing in the way that you want to laugh. Try to practice your laugh and actively tweak the way that you sound.

, Think of something hilarious, or have a friend tell you a joke, or watch something funny. Try to make the laugh genuine so that it will more accurately represent the way that your laugh sounds in real life. If you can't bring yourself to laugh at anything else, just laugh at the absurdity of what you're doing: staring into a mirror and laughing at yourself self-consciously.

, If your laugh is too nasally, focus on the way that you flex your nose when you laugh. Instead, try to direct laughs through your diaphragm: an air channel which sits near your gut, just below your lungs. If your laugh is too loud, try to react a bit more quietly. If you notice that you're snorting a lot,

, Be aware of how you sound when you laugh and speak. You may need to be almost hyper-aware, at first, in order to consciously laugh in the style you've chosen. Over time, however, you may find that the sound becomes more natural.


If you catch yourself slipping back into the old laugh, don't get frustrated. Your old laugh was a habit that evolved naturally through years of jovial interactions with people, and it can be a very hard impulse to break.
The important thing is that you're conscious of the way that you're laughing. If you're conscious of how you sound, it may be easier to actively shift that sound.

, Whenever you're alone, work on the new sound: make yourself laugh, and keep laughing until you're happy with how it sounds. You can do this in the car, in the park, or in front of a mirror. Be aware of the setting – other people may get uncomfortable if you practice your laugh around them when they haven't said anything funny.

, If you choose to strive for a specific style of laughter, it's important to keep in mind that practice can change intent. Just as your natural laugh was shaped by environmental influences—the people with whom you interacted, the movie characters you idolized, the laughs that you liked and subconsciously tried to imitate—so too will your new laugh be influenced by new experience. This doesn't mean that you won't like your laugh; it just means that you don't need to be too picky about the way you sound, as long as you like it.

, Don't spring it on everyone – use it increasingly more often. Get used to your laugh first, and eventually you may not have to think about it at all. Your brain will gradually adapt and remember the tone."

Identify the verb in the sentence.,
Identify the subject in the sentence.,
Identify the direct object in the sentence.,
Put the subject first.,
Spot passive voice.,
Determine whether the direct object is most important.,
Look at your spell-check.,
Pay attention to subject position most.",How to Avoid Using the Passive Voice," To avoid using passive voice, to use active voice, start by figuring out the verb in the sentence. This will make it a lot easier to spot passive voice in your own writing and avoid it.


The verb is the action word in the sentence. It’s not passive. It’s not sitting around being acted upon; it’s active. It’s the catalyst for movement in the sentence.For example, the sentence: Mark kicked the ball. The verb in the sentence is kicked. In this sentence it’s past tense. It’s the action. The act of kicking. The ball is passive because it’s not doing anything; it’s just being kicked.;
, The next step is to isolate the subject in your sentence. Start by figuring out the verb, the action, because this will make it easier to find the subject.The subject of the sentence is the who or what did the action. Let’s go back to our example sentence: Mark kicked the ball. Kicked, as we have already established, is the verb. Ask yourself, who or what did the kicking? Answer: Mark. That’s how you determine the subject.
Recognize that sometimes the subject is not a person. Example: The plane stopped the traffic. The action, and thus, the verb, is the act of stopping. Who or what did the stopping? The plane. Thus, the plane is the subject of the sentence.

, Not all sentences have direct objects. When they do, you should understand that the direct object is passive. It’s not the action. It’s not doing the action. It’s being acted upon.


In the example, Mark kicked the ball, the word ball is the direct object. The ball isn’t active. It’s not the catalyst for movement. It’s being acted upon. It’s the direct object.
Sometimes, people eliminate the direct object and just write something like, Mark kicked. Sometimes they eliminate the subject: The ball was kicked.

, In order to create active voice, you need to make sure that the subject is positioned in front of the verb.


We’ve established that the verb is the action word in the sentence. Make sure the “who or what did the action” comes before the action.The dog wagged its tail is active voice. That’s because the act of wagging is the verb. Who or what did the wagging? The dog. The dog is positioned in the sentence before the verb. Thus, the sentence is in active voice.

, The reverse is true. A sentence is in passive voice if the subject comes after the verb or is eliminated.For example, The tail was wagged by the dog is passive voice. This is because the tail, the direct object, comes before the verb.
Sometimes people eliminate the subject and write a sentence like: The tail was wagged. This is often done to eliminate responsibility or when people don’t know who did the action.

, There can be rare exceptions where you would want to use passive voice; passive voice is not a grammatical error.However, this is the bottom line: It should not be the default choice. It should only be used when there is a logical reason to use it.


Let’s say you’re a news writer. The mayor was arrested by the police. Active voice would be: The police arrested the mayor. The more important point in the sentence is to announce that the mayor, a very prominent person, was arrested! Thus, in this case, it’s logical to write instead: The mayor was arrested by police.
Similarly, in science, it might make more sense to put the object first, not the process. Instead of writing, I poured the hydrogen into the beaker, you might write, the hydrogen was poured into the beaker. Generally speaking, though, active voice is better because it’s tighter and punchier writing. It’s more dramatic, and it puts responsibility where it belongs.

, If you are using Microsoft Word, the spelling and grammar checking device, if set to check grammar, will notify you if the sentence is passive and correct it for you.


Get in the habit of re-reading and checking over all your work. Look at each sentence individually.
Don't be afraid to ask for help. Ask an English teacher or professor to explain the difference between the active and passive voices. Get a grammatically-adept friend to help you look over your work. Don't be afraid to let others help you!

, Sometimes people get confused because the sentence’s tense varies. The papers were graded by the teachers is passive voice (technically it’s just called past tense.) The papers had been graded by the teachers is also passive (it’s called past perfect).


The papers will be graded by the teachers is passive (it’s future tense). The papers will have been graded by the teachers is also passive (it’s future perfect). The papers are being graded by the teachers is present progressive tense and also passive.
Again, the key point is that all of these sentences are passive because the direct object (papers) is in front of the verb, and the subject (who did the action) is located after the verb. The active voice version of this sentence is: The teachers graded the papers.

Remember, the first step is always going to be the hardest, but once you get into doing what you are doing, everything runs better than expected.

,, Rather think about it as something you WANT to do, or as an opportunity of a lifetime. Think about the people that you are going to effect.

, It will be much easier if you walk out in front of the people with a carefree mind.

,(unless you are in a play, in that case, just be the character) When making a speech, standing up with your head high, having good posture and a smile on your face makes the audience see you as a very CONFIDENT person.(regardless if you feel that way or not) Besides, it is almost impossible to think negative thoughts with a smile on your face.

Writing a scientific or technical paper in passive voice.",How to Change a Sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice," The present tense describes action being done in the present moment—not future, not past, and not a hypothetical action. The English language has a simple present tense, a present continuous tense, a present perfect tense, and present perfect continuous tense.All indicate action in the present, but differ in their descriptions of how long the action has been taking place.


Simple present tense combines a subject + verb. For example: “He writes.”
Present continues tense combines a subject + being verb (am, is , are) + verb1 + ing. For Example: “He is writing.”
Present perfect tense combines a subject + have/has + verb. For example: “He has written.”
Present perfect continuous tense combines subject + has/have + been + verb + ing. Example: “He has been writing.”;
, Just as English has multiple present tenses, the language also possesses multiple past tenses. English has a simple past tense, as well as past perfect, past conditional, and past perfect conditional tenses.All past-tense sentences describe something that has already occurred.


Simple past tense combines a subject + verb in the sentence. For example: “He wrote.”
Past perfect tense combines the subject + had + verb. For example: “He had written.”
Past continuous tense combines a subject + being verb (was, were) + verb + ing. For example: “He was writing.”
Past perfect continuous tense combines subject + had + been + verb + ing. For example: “He had been writing.”

, Like present and past tenses, English has multiple forms of the future tense. Each version indicates an action that has not yet occurred—but will occur in the future—and the distinctions between different types of future tense signify the completion or incompletion of the future act.Simple future tense combines a subject + “will” + verb. For example, “He will write.”
Future perfect tense combines the subject + “will have” + verb. For example, “He will have written.”
Future continuous tense combines a subject + “will” + being verb + verb. For example, “He will be writing.”
Future perfect continuous tense combines the subject + “have been” + verb + “ing.” For example, “He will have been writing.”

, Sentences in the active voice typically begin with the subject and describe the action it does to the direct object. To achieve the passive voice, switch this placement by moving the direct object to the beginning of the sentence.This will highlight the object and its reception of the verb.


For example, the sentence “He will write a letter” is in the future tense and active voice.
To change this to passive voice, move the direct object to the beginning of the sentence, while keeping the future tense: “A letter will be written by him.”

, Adding a “be” verb will make the active verb passive, and highlight the way the direct object was acted upon, rather than how the subject performed that action (as in an active-voice sentence).Depending on the tense of the sentence, being verbs include: “is,” “was,” “will be,” “has been,” etc.

, The subject (preceded by “by”) should come at the end of the passive-voice sentence.By stating “by” late in the sentence, you’ll add the subject after the direct object and verb have already been clarified.For example: “The stretch of highway was paved by the construction crew.”In cases where the subject (one who does the action) is unknown, you may not be able to add the word “by.”
For example, if you have received a letter but do not know who sent it, you would write, “The letter was sent to me on November 1st,” but you would not say by whom it was sent.

, While switching from active to passive voice, be sure to maintain the correct tense from the original sentence.Keep any auxiliary verbs: verbs which modify the tense of the main verb. Auxiliary verbs include “be,” “can,” “do” and “have.” Read the passive-voice sentence over to yourself to make sure it has the same tense as the former active-voice sentence. For example:


Active voice, present tense: The cat kills the mice.
Passive voice, present tense: The mice are killed by the cat.
Active voice, past continuous tense: Some boys were helping the wounded men.
Passive voice, past continuous tense: Wounded men were being helped by some boys.
Active voice, future perfect tense: Someone will have stolen my purse.
Active voice, future perfect tense: My purse will have been stolen by someone.

, While the passive voice is discouraged in some instances because it can be a sign of weak writing, there are plenty of situations where it’s appropriate. The active voice firmly places the subject—the one who does the action—at the beginning of the clause, passive voice can obscure the subject, focusing instead on the direct object receiving the action.Be careful when removing emphasis from the subject of a sentence, as in some cases it can be seen as confusing to the reader. Passive voice can also remove the subject of a sentence altogether.
For example, a politician who says, “I have lied to the American people” may be seen as repentant and forthcoming. If the individual were to say “The American people have been lied to,” they politician would be removing any blame from themselves by phrasing the sentence in the passive voice and removing the subject.

, If the subject of your sentence is relatively unimportant, while the direct object and the action done to it are significant, the passive voice can be used. Writers often use the passive voice when describing an event or occurrence in which the direct object or action is more relevant than the subject of the sentence.For example, the sentence “American nuclear devices were first tested in July 1945” places the emphasis on the nuclear testing and leaves the specific researchers anonymous.

, In science writing, the passive voice is used to indicate objectivity and detachment from the topic or investigation of the paper. Within a scientific paper, sections describing “Methods,” “Materials,” or “Processes” are nearly always written in passive voice.For example, instead of writing “My team placed seven stream gages in the river,” you would write, “Seven stream gages were placed in the river.”
Here the passive voice lends anonymity to the action: anyone can replicate the experiment by repeating the same procedures. By using the passive voice, you’re arguing that the results can be replicated regardless of which scientists perform the actions.

Know your audience – it makes the experience easier.,
If you have been asked to speak on a particular subject, for example “The Roman Gladiator” it is essential to know whether the people you will be lecturing to are novices in the subject, or experts.,
The tone of your speech will also differ for small groups.,
Sometimes it is not always possible to find out all this information before the lecture so you need to try to be adaptable.,
Research – The better prepared you are for your speech or lecture, the better the speech will be.,
Be aware than any holes in your research will be noticed and questioned by someone in the audience, so to prevent any awkward moments make sure there are no holes, sweeping statements or uncertainties.,
If you think ”I hope no one asks me ……” you can guarantee someone will, so have an answer.,
Timing – You will be given a time for your speech, sometimes these are flexible (between 10-15 minutes for example) which is good, as going over time is bad manners.,
Use the premise that 2000 words will last approximately 10 minutes talking time.,
Practice the speech at home, and time it.",How to Be an Effective Public Speaker1," Knowing as much as you can about their knowledge, their age, the number of people you will be lecturing or speaking to. If you get some idea of what they hope to achieve from the speech, then that will help you to prepare in a more effective way.;
, This will obviously affect your research and delivery. If they are beginners you do not want to talk over their heads, and if experts you do not want to tell them what they already know.

, A large group lecture (50+) will be far more formal than a small group. For small groups you can include them in the speech, by asking questions or involving them.

, For example I was expecting to lecture to 50-70 people with a great deal of knowledge, and due to bad weather six total beginners turned up. It was a much more informal group than I had prepared for so started by asking them what they expected, what they knew, preconceptions and ideas they may have.

, It is better to be over prepared than under. When I first started I wrote everything down that I wanted to say, including jokes and quips. Many people say this is bad practice but if you are able to read it “naturally” then you can get away with this in the early stages. Only very experienced lecturers and public speakers can talk without notes. The form of these notes will be personal to you, and you should not feel pressured to use a particular method.

, Never assume “no one will notice” or “no one will ask about that”. Always assume someone will ask. Try to think of all the questions you could be asked and make sure that you have an answer.

, However, if you are asked a question you do not know the answer to, then do not be afraid to admit to not knowing, although you can lessen the impact of “I don’t know”, to “I haven’t researched that yet”, or “that is an interesting line of thought, which I hadn’t considered”. Better to bluff why you do know an answer rather than make something up; someone is bound to notice.

, However, if you are told you have 20 minutes make sure you stick to it, as you cannot rush your lecture to finish as this will affect delivery, and you do not want to be stopped before the end. If you have a time slot of 20 minutes, for example, the audience will know this, and will start fidgeting as you go over time, which is distracting for you, and you are certain they are not listening, but rather thinking about their lunch or tea-break.

, So for an hour’s speech you will need approximately 10000-12000 words. It may seem a pain to write this much for a speech, but it is a good guideline for the amount of information you will need. After some experience this will come naturally and you will not need to be so pedantic with the preparation. It is better to have too much information than finish a lecture ten minutes early, as if you are a new public speaker you will not want an extra ten minutes question time. Also if you are being paid to speak they may feel they have not got their money’s worth.

, Remember to speak slower than you would normally in order to be heard and understood.

"
"
So now that you have prepared your speech you have to do the difficult bit which is to deliver it.,
Whilst every public speaker puts on a “persona” when they get on the podium it fits in with their personality.,
To start with, simply concentrate on giving your speech, clearly and succinctly.,
You need to experiment with methods of notes, and go with what feels right for you.,
Always read your notes before you arrive at the venue so it is fresh in your mind which will eliminate a total reliance on notes.",How to Be an Effective Public Speaker2," The more prepared you are the easier delivery will be. There are thousands of amazing speakers out there, so do not be afraid to watch some and observe their styles. However it is essential that to be a good public speaker you have to be you.

, For example if you do not joke in real life, do not do it in lectures – there is nothing worse than the “academic joke” that falls flat. If you are boisterous and lively in life then be like that when you speak. You can be professional and fun at the same time as long as it is appropriate.

, How you do this can vary. As I mentioned for my early public speaking I wrote everything out in full. Some people use index cards, with key words, or headings. However this has never worked for me. When you become more experienced you might be able to work simply with a list of headings, or key information, such as names and dates or slides as prompts.

, A good public speaker is a confident one, so worrying about what note method you are using and whether you are going to forget something vital is not going to help. If you need everything written in full in case your mind “goes blank” then have them. There is nothing wrong with a security blanket; it will make you a better speaker if you have all eventualities covered.

, Also remember that you are the only one who knows EXACTLY what you intend to speak about, so if you miss something out no one else will know.

"
"
Speak directly from your heart.,
Be irrespective of thinking about this fact that ""what others are thinking?"",
Have an attitude of serving the audience, that you want to deliver something to them what you have.

,
Pause between your speech, tell the audience genuinely the reason of pause, they will really enjoy it.,
Consider what it is that you have to say that would be of value to others--have you experienced great adversity, or received some special education?",How to Be a Public Speaker,";
,

,, viz-""I was lost somewhere""


Motivational speaking is, in many ways, a product that must be sold. Why should someone pay to hear you impart your message? Be able to articulate your unique experiences and explain exactly how you can inspire others.

, In order to succeed as a motivational speaker, you must have something special to deliver.

"
"
Make eye contact.,
Have a point and stick to it.,
Speak clearly.,
Adjust your speech for your audience.,
Don't use one tone the entire speech.,
Don't patronize.,
Be interesting.

,
Speak up.,
Be honest.,
Organize what you're saying especially in long speeches.,
Be polite, follow social conventions and be rational.,
Use your hands!,
Watch some videos of great speakers: Martin Luther King , John F. Kennedy (JFK).

",How to Be a Good Speaker," Eye contact is very important. You can look above the people's head because it looks like you're looking right at them, but you're really not! Don't overdo it or you'll risk looking like you're nodding your head or you can appear stiff. It is also a good idea to make eye contact with different people. Do not stare that the same person throughout your speech, this would make them feel uncomfortable. You could try looking to the left, the center of the room, and the right of the room.;
, In some settings you must speak on a certain subject. Even in casual conversation, though, it is important to focus on a limited set of related ideas. If you drift from one tangentially related idea to the next your speech becomes a sort of bad poetry or misplaced filibuster that may quickly bore the listener.

, It may be tempting to say, ""El whooziwhatsit fonctionne bien in thinger teh other day."" It may also not be worth the listener's time to try to figure out what you mean.

, A technical audience will appreciate your use of jargon and acronyms. If your audience has trouble grasping the concepts you are relating, it may be necessary to speak slowly and offer generally familiar examples. Still, make sure not to sound as if you are explaining the concepts to a class of kindergarteners.

, It makes you sound very dry, dull, and boring as a speaker and personality wise. It makes you a much better speaker when you raise your voice a bit here and there. Make it sort of like a debate almost, and it's on something you really care for that's really important! Study Martin Luther King. He is one of the most well-known speakers in history. His tone goes up and down.

, When people are treated like they're idiots or little children, they may become hostile and ignore what you're saying. You sound patronizing when you use sing-song tones in your speech or sigh loudly, or if you belittle the listeners in any way.

,, People have to hear what you are saying even if they are sitting in the back row or there is a lot of noise.

, Remember the story of the boy who cried, ""Wolf!""

, If possible, introduce the topic at the beginning of the paragraph-but make sure it's an original beginning each time!. If there are several ideas or details related to your main point, speak about each one in a deliberate fashion. If you are trying to convey large amounts of information, you may need to outline what you will say at the outset and then summarize what you've said at the conclusion.

, Obviously there are many speakers that do not follow this step and yet have large and doting audiences. You probably aren't one of those speakers.

, Nothing is worse than a speaker with his hands in his pocket or his hands just sitting by his side.

Some colleges and universities will not have a major titled “public relations.”


For example: Buffalo State College has an undergraduate program that is titled “Public Communication” The following is a description of the program given on the Buffalo State College website, “This major allows students flexibility to tailor a program based on strategic communication through the disciplines of public relations, advertising, and related fields. It meets the needs of students preparing for a career in which research, strategic planning, implementation of creative tactics, and evaluation are central, whether to advance an organization, promote a product, or advocate a cause. Compare this major with communication studies, journalism, and media production.” Buffalo State College: Public Communications Major.;
, When applying to colleges/university you want to look for a school that will help you get the most out of being a public relations student. The schools program should give you hands on experience and open doors for you.good way to determine if a school’s public relation major is strong is by seeing if they are accredited. The following quote is a definition of what accredited is off of the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications website, “Accreditation is a system of voluntary self-assessment and external review of educational institutions and of professional programs offered by those institutions.  Accreditation provides an assurance of quality to students, parents, and the public.  In the accrediting process, the performance of educational units is measured against national standards.”


To accredit is to assure basic standards of excellence Another good way to determine the strength of a school’s public relations department is by examining the professors in the department. You want to look for professors work experience and the contributions they have made to public relations as a whole.

, Get acquainted with the ins and outs of your campus library – Public relation students spend a great deal of their time in the library. Public relations require a fair amount of reading, writing and speaking. The library is a place to do 2 out of 3 of those things. Speaking in the library will annoy your peers around you.

, There is a misconception that public relations only consist of giving speeches. If you are not ready to write then being a public relations student is not for you. Public relations students are no strangers to research papers. A strategic campaign will be no less than 30 pages and it should be grammatically correct, follow AP style of writing and detailed. If you write a strategic campaign correctly 30 pages is not enough.

, There is a certain way to write when writing various pieces. An AP style-writing guide can teach you the correct way to write for different pieces. You may have to write a newsletter and if you do not know how to write a news piece this will be your best friend. This book will give you a step-by-step guide in writing anything journalism, public relations or media production related.

, You will have classes that are devoted to public speaking. Giving speeches as an individual or in a group will be the basis of the entire class. (refer to step 4, although speech classes requires speaking you will spend a lot of time writing the speeches as oppose to the time you will spend delivering the speech.)

, Stay up with current events – Knowing what is happening in the world is important. You cannot be a successful public relations student if you don’t keep up with current events. Public relations deals with news and media knowing what is going on will give you a leg up.

, Diversity in your education is fundamental. As much as we would like to eat breathe and sleep public relations we cannot because we will not be successful. Why will you not be successful? A lot of public relation students know how to communicate well but the problem is that they don’t have anything to communicate about. Picking a minor or double majoring will contribute to your success as a public relations student and as a future public relations professional.

, Internships can be done for credit and is a great way to gain experience in your future career in public relations.

, The Importance of Networking“It has been said that the best jobs come from word of mouth… Experts agree that networking is worth your time and effort and can help you get ahead in the professional world.” Your professors, peers and supervisors may have access to resources that you will never know about unless you network.


Adviser's and professors play a major role in your college career. A lot of PR professors either have years of experience in the field of public relations or in other closely related fields. When looking for classes to take or just needing to talk about a career path your professors can help you. When you are not doing well in a class your professor may be able to help you and give you some useful tips on how to keep up with the class.
Seeing your academic advisor is the second most important thing to do besides talking to your professors. Your academic advisor has the degree that you are pursuing and higher degrees than that. They once sat in courses similar to yours. They can help with close to anything academic related. Building a good rapport with these people can help get into grad school or get your dream job. If they know you well they can write a stellar recommendation on your behalf that will go a long way.

Greet royalty with a small bow or curtsy.,
Consider a small nod or bob instead.,
Shake hands only if the offer is extended.,
Let the royal personage take the lead in conversation.,
Use the full formal address in your first reply.,
Use short forms of address for the rest of the conversation.,
Repeat the same greeting when the Royal Family member leaves.,
Contact the Royal Household if you have further questions.",How to Formally Address British Royalty and Aristocracy in Person2," These are the most formal greetings, but they are never required, even for subjects of the Queen. If you are a man and you choose this approach, bow your head slightly at the neck.If you are a woman, give a small curtsy: put your right foot behind your left, then briefly bend at the knees while keeping your upper body and neck vertical.Deep curtsies are not a faux pas, but they are uncommon and difficult to do gracefully.Deep bows from the waist, on the other hand, are never performed in this situation.
Perform this greeting when the royal family member passes by you, or when you are presented., Instead of bowing or curtsying, you may give a small nod (traditionally male) or bob by briefly bending your knees (female). This is a typical choice for people who are not citizens of the Commonwealth, since they have no fealty to British royalty.This is also perfectly acceptable for Commonwealth citizens., The Royal Family's website states that shaking hands is also an acceptable form of greeting, alone or in addition to one of the modes above.However, you should wait for the Royal Family Member to extend his or her hand first, and use only a light touch with one hand.Do not initiate any physical contact yourself.If you are wearing dress gloves (which is certainly not required), men should remove the gloves before shaking hands, while women may leave them on., Wait until he or she greets you before you speak. Avoid changing the subject, and do not ask any personal questions.Foreigners should resist the urge to speak ""proper"" if it comes across as an imitation of an English accent. The Queen and her relatives have spoken with thousands of people around the world, and do not expect you to speak as they do.

, If addressed by royalty, your first response should end with the long form of respectful address. For example, if the Queen asks you ""How are you enjoying the United Kingdom?"" you could respond, ""It's wonderful, Your Majesty."" For all other members of the royal family besides the Queen, your first response should use ""Your Royal Highness"" instead., All female members of the Royal Family, including the Queen, should be addressed as ""Ma'am"", with a short ""a"" as in ""jam"". Address all male members as ""Sir"".If you mention a royal family member in the third person, always use a full title (such as ""The Prince of Wales"") or ""His/Her Royal Highness"". Referring to someone by name (""Prince Philip"" ) may be considered rude.Note that the correct title for the Queen is ""Her Majesty the Queen"". Avoid ""Queen of England"", as that is just one of many titles that refer to a specific country.

, Use the same bow, curtsy, or less traditional greeting as a respectful farewell when the meeting comes to an end., The staff of the Royal Household is happy to answer etiquette questions.

As with any title, you do not need to include the location (""Duke of Mayfair"") unless it is necessary to avoid confusion.
If you are making a formal introduction, say ""His/Her Grace the Duke/Duchess"" followed by the rest of the title.

, In conversation and verbal introductions, avoid reference to all other titles besides Duke or Duchess. Use ""Lady"" and ""Lord"" instead, followed by the last name.The following titles are only used in formal or legal correspondence:


Marchioness and Marquis

Viscountess and Viscount
Baroness and Baron

, This can get slightly complicated, so look up the exact scenario below:Address the son of a duke or marquess as ""Lord"" followed by the first name.
Address to the daughter of a duke, marquess, or earl as ""Lady"" followed by the first name.
If you will be meeting a peer's heir apparent (generally the eldest son), look up his title. He will often use a secondary title of his father's, which is always of a lower rank.
In all other cases, the child has no special title. (""The Hon."" is used only in writing.)

Make the proper movements with your mouth.,
Transition from the D or T sound.,
Say English phrases that put your tongue in the right position.,
Use the butter/ladder method.,
Practice rolling a single R. At this point you should know where your tongue should be inside your mouth when you roll an R. You’ve also practiced this movement by saying other English words that produce the same movement.","How to Roll Your ""R""s1"," The English R sound is made by the movement made between your bottom lip and your top teeth. Alternative, the rolling R sound is made by vibrating your tongue against the back of your top teeth, which is very similar to the way your mouth moves when you say an English T of D.Start by saying the letter R, in English, out loud. Pay attention to how your mouth moves while you say the letter R. You’ll notice that your tongue does not touch the back of your teeth, it sort of just hangs there in mid-air.
Now say the letters T and D, in English, out loud. Pay attention to how your mouth moves when you say T and D. You’ll notice that your tongue touches the back of your upper front teeth — almost like your tongue is pushing your teeth forward.
The placement of your tongue while you say T and D in English is the same placement you need to perfect when attempting to roll your Rs. But in addition to your tongue simply touching the back of your front teeth, it also has to vibrate. It’s this vibration that creates the trill or rolling sound.
The important part of this step is to recognize how your mouth and tongue should move in order to roll your Rs. When you move forward and start practicing the actual rolling R sound, remember to pay attention to your tongue placement.;
, Start this step by placing your mouth and tongue in the practiced location when saying the letters D or T in English. This position will have your tongue resting very lightly against the back of your front teeth. Once your mouth is in this position, breathe out through your mouth only. Keep your tongue relaxed while you do this so it vibrates against your front teeth.The key to this step is to practice getting your tongue to vibrate. By keeping your tongue relaxed in your mouth and breathing out, the flow of air from your lungs should force your tongue to vibrate. If it isn’t vibrating it might be that you aren’t keeping your tongue relaxed enough.
This step, like all others, requires practice. To help you gain success with this step, you might want to try actually saying the sounds associated with the letters T and D in English. As you’re saying either the T or D sounds, add some Rs to the end of the sound so you’re making the sounds “drrr” and “trrr.” Breathe out while doing this and practice getting your tongue to vibrate.
You can also try saying English words that start with D, T, B, or P and have an R as the second letter in the word (e.g. Dracula, train, bronze, pretty). By practicing words that include D, T, B, P and an R you’re essentially practicing a rolling R because your tongue is in the correct position. The key is to get your tongue to vibrate when saying the R so it rolls., In addition to the “drrr” and “trrr” sounds there are English phrases that can help put your tongue in the right position for rolling an R. Use either the phrase ”put it away” or ”putter-up” and you’ll notice your tongue pushes against the back of your front teeth. This is the same position you want your tongue in when rolling your Rs., The words “butter” and “ladder” in English are similar to using a word that starts with D, T, B, or P and has an R as the second letter. These two words also place your tongue against the back of your front teeth, which is the same placement you need to roll your Rs.In the case of these two words, your tongue goes to the back of your front teeth when you say the second syllable of the word — when you say the sounds produced by “tter” and “dder.""
You can say one of the words, or both of them. For example, you can say “butter butter butter ladder ladder ladder” over and over again, or any combination of the two words.
Keep repeating the words faster and faster. The faster you say the words, the higher the chance that your tongue will vibrate. Eventually the “tter” and “dder” parts of the words should take on the trilling sound of a rolling R.

, In the process you’ve hopefully got your tongue to vibrate against the back of your teeth. Now take all you’ve learned and practice saying only a rolling R.It may take weeks before you’re able to move to this step and successfully roll an R. Be patient, it’s not easy.
The key to this step is to be able to produce a successful rolled R without the need to add extra letters or words.
Once you’re able to successfully roll one R, keep practicing over and over. It should eventually become second nature such that you aren’t even thinking about what your mouth is doing when you roll an R.

Sum up the person’s argument.,
Ask for evidence.,
Challenge their assumptions.,
Find an exception.Identify a set of circumstances where the person’s statement would be false.,
Ask the other person to reformulate their argument.Once they concede that the exception exists, they should reformulate their argument to account for the exception.,
Continue to ask questions or raise exceptions.,
Avoid getting nasty.",How to Argue Using the Socratic Method1," Identify what the other person is arguing. For example, someone might say, “It’s best to give money away instead of spending it.” Often, people will believe that they are espousing common sense, which no one would disagree with.If you don’t understand what someone is arguing, ask them to clarify their beliefs. You can ask, “I don’t understand. What are you trying to say?” or “Could you restate that?”;
, Before beginning to really challenge a person’s point of view, you should ask them about their evidence. A person might quickly realize that they are merely repeating something they have heard before without thinking critically. You can ask the following questions to uncover evidence:“Why do you believe that is true?”
“Please explain your reasoning.”
“What has lead you to that belief?”

, Ideas are like building blocks. Your conclusion rests on other blocks, some of which might be unproven. When an idea is unproven, it is an assumption—and assumptions can sometimes be wrong. After asking a person for their evidence, zero in on the ideas which aren’t supported by evidence. These are their assumptions.


For example, someone might say you should give away money because having too much money makes you greedy. This person is assuming someone doesn’t spend all of their available money on necessities.
You can say, “But are you assuming people have money to give away after buying necessities? Is it best for these people to give their money away?”

, For example, is it always good to give away your money? You can think of many situations where a selfless person might cause more harm than good. Consider the following:


The person who wants your money is a drug addict. Ask your opponent, “Should I give my money away to someone who wants to buy drugs?” If the person says no, then follow up and ask why, which will help you tease out the other person’s thinking.
You must provide food and shelter. Formulate this as a question: “Should I give away all my money when my elderly mum is dependent on me?”

, For example, they might say, “People should give their money away if doing so would benefit society.”

, In the example above, you can ask the person to define what “benefits society.” You can also ask questions to pin them down if they are confused.


You should continue this process until you can’t invalidate the statement any more., The Socratic method is not about proving people wrong, so don’t be aggressive in with your questions. If your goal is to win an argument, then you should seek out different Greek philosophers, such as the Sophists. Indeed, the key to the Socratic method is to be humble. Don’t assume that anyone knows anything for sure. Question every premise.


If the other person starts to get flustered, you can say, “I’m just playing Devil’s Advocate” or “I’m trying to understand all sides of your thinking.”
You might enjoy the other person’s confusion a little too much. Try not to gloat. Remind yourself that Socrates didn’t have answers for every question he asked, which is typical of an exchange using the Socratic method.

Conclude by restating your message and saying a simple, ""Thank you.""",How to Give a Speech," Your speech should be able to summed up in a sentence, maybe two. This is what your speech really boils down to: it's what you'll start off with and what you'll return to at the end. It's simple and people can stick to it. And it's easier for you, too!


So what's yours? Did your teacher give you a specific topic to cover? If so, what's your stance? Or is it more personal? Two or three personal stories with a connecting theme can be quite the vivid speech.;
, This will determine the entirety of your speech. You wouldn't deliver the same speech to four year-olds as you would to CEOs! So know your audience. Here are a few things to consider:

, Ask yourself, what's the worst that can happen? People will give you weird looks for not giving a speech according to their ""expectations"". Not more than that. Think of what you will gain, overcoming the fear of public speaking.

Who are they? Age? Gender? Beliefs?
How much do they know about your topic? This will determine the amount of complicated language you can use (hint: if they don't know much, don't use it!).
Why are they there? To be taught something? Because they have to be? Because they're genuinely interested?
How long have they been there? If you're 17th of 18th speeches, take that into account!

, If your subject is you, congratulations! You probably already know you like the back of your hand (or arm or leg, but probably not head). But if it's not, get to researching. The pros and the cons! If people can poke holes in your argument, that's not a very effective speech.


Have at least three points to support your message (that one succinct sentence you're working with). Address the counterargument, but don't focus on it.
Only complicate it as much as your audience can tolerate. Stay away from jargon and technical terms if it's gonna leave your listeners scratching their heads and feeling out of place.

, A speech that's full of dull, meaningless statistics and facts probably won't get you anywhere with any audience. The human mind will tune out in seconds if that's all it hears. Instead, opt for stories -- it's easier to follow the structure-- and make them vivid with things like metaphors and antithesis. The more vivid a picture you can paint, the better.


Self-deprecating humor (making fun of yourself) has its place. Again, this comes down to knowing your audience and the format of your speech. A best man speech? Totally appropriate. Addressing the president of your company about budget locations? Maybe not.
Antithesis is about using opposites. Clinton said, ""I want to nominate a man who’s cool on the outside but who burns for America on the inside"" in his speech about Barack Obama.Pretty vivid stuff.

, Take the sentence ""The fishing industry is bad"" and change it to ""The fishing industry's practices are egregious."" Even something as simple as ""We can solve the problem,"" to ""We can speedily solve the problem"" is more memorable. Your audience might not remember exactly what you said, but they'll remember the emotion you invoked within them.


Think active, too. ""When we have the manpower, we can force change,"" is much more powerful when it's turned around -- ""We can force change when we have the manpower."" Make 'em sit up in their seats, you know?

, When a speech goes viral on YouTube, you know it's good -- and Steve Jobs' 2005 address to Stanford grads did just that. He started with, ""Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.""Boom. Hooked.


So no hemming and ""hawwing"", no apologizing, no ""I wondered...,"" no ""Thank yous,"" just brass tacks. Get right in there. Don't talk about painting -- get right in there and start creating an image for them. They're there for your speech, not how you felt about it or how you feel now. Hook 'em from the get-go by starting strong outta the gate.

, Because forming a speech in your head is a lot of work. Write it out, see how it transitions from point to point, if it covers all your bases, and if it really says what you set out to say. If it doesn't, revamp till it does!


You should have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction and conclusion should both be brief and to the point, the conclusion being a reiteration of the intro. And the body? Well, that's everything else.

, Now that you have everything you want to say figured out (and hopefully on paper), write down your main points. Take this notecard and see if you can cover everything just from looking at it. How does it flow? What parts are you less convinced by yourself on?


Get to the point where you're comfortable delivering it just with the notecard. The more comfortable you are with the speech, the more it'll show when you're delivering it.

, Alright, so this isn't super necessary, but it's definitely a good idea. If you have it memorized, you can make eye contact with your audience and worry about the icing on the cake, like gestures and inflection. Don't stress if you don't have enough time -- but if you do, take advantage of it.


This doesn't mean that you have to go out there unarmed. No, you'll be taking your notecard with you! If your mind blanks, you can take a look-see at it and go right where you need to. You ran over it with the notecard 10 times for this reason.

, This is a grand idea for a couple of reasons:


Delivering it to someone helps you get used to someone looking at you while you're talking. Public speaking can be pretty terrifying, so having a practice audience will help calm your nerves.
Have them actually pay attention. At the end of your speech, ask them what questions popped up in their mind. Were there any holes in your argument? Or did anything confuse them?

, Really, you should be practicing wherever you can. But these two spots will be particularly useful:


Practice in front of the mirror so you can see your body language. What gestures work where? How do you feel about the pauses and what do you do during them?
Practice in the shower because it's probably one of the few times during the day where you can mindlessly go over it. Does your mind blank on any part? If so, review it.

, You probably have some idea of how long your speech should be -- either you were given a specific time slot or you were given a length requirement for the speech. Try to get it comfortably above the minimum and comfortably below the maximum -- that way if you accidentally speed up or slow down, you're still golden.

, Standing like you have a fig leaf over your crotch is not the way to give a captivating speech. Nor should you go the opposite way and lean over the podium. It's best to stand straight, feet shoulder width apart, and use your hands as naturally as possible.


Your speech conveys a certain amount of emotion, right? (Correct answer: Yes.) Take those moments and move with them. You use your hands every day to express emotion -- this speech is no different. You're still communicating to people, just on a bigger scale. Though the scale is different, the gestures remain the same.

, Have you heard about that TED talk where the woman is talking about schizophrenia and her own brain hemorrhage? No? Well, have you heard about that TED talk where the woman is talking about schizophrenia and her own brain hemorrhage and then she whips out a real human brain, spinal cord and all? You can hear the audiences jaws dropping in the video.Talk about painting a vivid picture.


This should be used carefully, though. Don't whip out a different prop every sentence. Stick to one really effective prop, like the brain. Telling a story about your dad's last burning building he ran into? Take out his burned firefighter helmet. Talking about the time you ran into Will Ferrell at your local Starbucks? Whip out your autographed grande, coffee-stained cup when you get to the part about how you fainted after asking. Use them sparingly, but effectively.

, A powerpoint can be a great addition to a speech (for certain topics, at least). Just make sure you use them to your advantage! You want them to listening to you, not awe-struck by the pretty pictures.


Use graphs to illustrate your points, especially if they're hard to understand. Pictures can be more memorable than just being told factoid, regardless of how pivotal it may be.
Don't face the pictures when you're talking! You know what's on there -- keep delivering the speech to your audience, not the screen.

, A lot of people are under the impression scanning the audience is ideal -- and if that makes you nervous, just sort of scan the back wall. No! Resist! Instead, think of it as a one-on-one conversation. Make eye contact with a person over here, a person over there, etc. Draw them in one at a time instead of making them all feel glossed over.

, In general, sure, you should talk at a calm, understandable rate and speak with clarity. This should be your go-to. But to keep your audience awake and to keep your speech dynamic, vary it up. The parts you feel passionate about should be clearly emphasized! Speak loudly and with vigor! Pound your fist if you need to! And then there are parts that will feel more like a lullaby. And even parts that require pauses to let the emotion set in...AND THEN RAMPED BACK UP. It's a lot more effective verbally than over text. You get it.


Show emotion in your tone, too. Don't be afraid to chuckle a bit or show a bit of grief or frustration. You're human. Your audience is looking for a human connection, not a robot spitting words at them.

, There's just as much power in the pauses as there is in the words. Think about the sentence, ""Dihydrogen monoxide killed 50 million people last year. 50 million. Let that sink in."" Now think about the sentence with pauses after each period. Gets a little more serious, doesn't it?


Take your speech and literally write in the pauses if it'll help you. Draw a big ol' slash through the text to indicate a break. Once you have it down, you'll be able to feel where the pauses will go.

, You've gone through the speech, no one's died, and now it's time for your conclusion. Keep it to the point, lock eyes with the audience, thank them, smile, and get off the stage.


Take a deep breath. You did it. Next time you'll be giving a speech on how to give speeches. What were you so nervous about in the first place?

"
"
Do some deep breathing exercises when you feel nervous or before you are about to speak.,
Sit upright in a chair or wherever is comfortable; close your eyes and imagine a peaceful place where you have no worries.,
Practice your presentation.,
Share your fears with your close friends, if they will be in the audience.,
If your speech is written, highlight certain words where you can pause and look up into the audience confidently, and without losing your place.

,
When you are done with it, write in a journal or just on a loose piece of paper how good you felt and what you did right and what you could've improved upon.,
Don't dwell on your presentation if it doesn't go as planned.",How to Be a Fearless Public Speaker,"


Breath in as deeply as you can, hold, and let out the air as slowly as you can; repeat 5 times or until you are calm.;
,


Now imagine you just finishing your speech and all of your peers or coworkers clapping, impressed by your wise words. Now open your eyes. You can also search for other breathing exercises on the internet.

, Then practice it again. Have you done that? Now repeat. Practice in front of your friend(s), family member(s), mirror, pet, and any other audience that you do not feel threatened by. If you know you have practiced extensively, you will be more confident when it is time for you to present your speech.

, Odds are, if they know you are worried, they will want you to succeed and you can look at them if you are nervous about making awkward eye contact.

,, Post this in a notebook, on a fridge, in a calendar, on a personal bulletin board, or in a workspace. You can read this whenever you are discouraged or have to speak again. It will help you remember that you did it before and you can do it again!

, Leave the past in the past. You should take your mistakes and apply them to the next time you speak publicly."

Control your breath.,
Don't rush when speaking.,
Swallow excess saliva.,
Know what you are going to say.,
Walk it out.,
Repeat words that are hard to say.",How to Improve Your Clarity of Speech1," Listen to a singer or watch him on stage and you’ll see how much he pays attention to his breathing. Mick Jagger wouldn't be able to run up and down a stage while belting “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” if he didn’t know how to breathe properly. The same goes for speaking, and proper breathing can greatly improve your speech clarity.


One way to ensure that you’re getting proper breaths is to put one hand on your belly and one on your chest while breathing. You want the hand on your belly to move while your chest stays in place. Breathing with your belly ensures that you get a true full breath that will allow you speak with a full voice.Speak at the top of your breath. Once you’ve inhaled properly, begin speaking and think about your words as your breath slowly and steadily leaves you. This allows your breath to support your words and will allow you to naturally take your time.;
, Talk deliberately, but not so slow that you sound like a robot.


Oftentimes, speaking in public can make people nervous. If you find yourself nervous and rushing, try to remember that it’s ok to slow down. If you are breathing correctly this will help you stay calm and parse out your words.
Also keep in mind that people want to hear what you have to say. Your words have value, so give them a chance to hear them.
The human ear can pick up on a lot very quickly but by making sure that you finish each word completely before starting the next one, you’ll create enough space between words so that everyone can understand you properly.

, Saliva left in the mouth can result in mumbling and distortion of consonants such as ""S"" and ""K"".


Taking a moment to swallow will not only keep your mouth clear, but it will give you time to pause and breathe again.
Take a moment to swallow when you finish a sentence or thought, not during the middle of a sentence. This will also give you a moment to prepare what you're going to say next.

, Whether you’re giving a public speech or just having a casual conversation with a friend, taking at least a moment before speaking to know what you are going to say will help you speak with clarity and prevent you from talking too fast.


Clarity isn’t just about forming words properly, it’s also about getting your message or point of view out as precisely as possible. Oftentimes this means knowing what you want to say so you don’t have to backtrack or fill in your sentences with “um”, “like”, or “uh”.

, If you have to speak publicly and are giving a presentation of some kind you have probably written down at least an outline of your speech. Practice your speech while walking around.


Some actors will use this method to memorize their lines, as getting up and moving can help you remember what you need to say. Practice your speech and say one word for every step you take.
This may seem arduous and slow, but by taking one step for every word you’ll learn to slow down. You don’t have to speak this slowly in your speech or normal conversations but being able to feel comfortable going at a slower pace will improve your speech clarity and allow you to further take your time.

, When we have a hard time pronouncing certain words we often speed up and try to stumble through them resulting in muddled speech. Practice saying these words aloud over and over again until you build the muscle memory to pronounce them correctly.


Words like “Squirrel”, “Brewery”, “Phenomenon”, and “February” are considered some of the hardest words to pronounce in the English language because they may be spelled unlike they sound.To help you learn to pronounce difficult words try spelling the words out phonetically.
Once you feel comfortable with trouble words you will be able to speak with confidence and take your time.

This will improve your enunciation, and help you identify which sounds are difficult for you. Continue to watch yourself in the mirror as you practice the steps below.;
, Surprisingly, this can help a lot. Showing your teeth gives your lips more space, tightens your cheeks, and creates a larger opening for sound. These changes improve your audibility and intelligibility. And if you don't believe it, try saying ""audibility and intelligibility"" with your lips together, and then with your teeth showing.


Aim for a pleasant, happy expression, but not a full-blown smile. Your cheeks shouldn't feel sore after holding a short conversation.

, That's the soft part in the back of the roof of your mouth. Singers are trained to raise the soft palate in order to achieve a fuller, more resonant tone. Try inhaling gently as you make a soft k sound, and your soft palate will rise.A small, unvoiced yawn complements the inhale, by warming up different muscles around your soft palate.Avoid exaggerated yawning or gulping to achieve this. Anything more than a gentle effort is counterproductive.

, Obviously, your tongue will be moving while you speak, but it's still worth practicing a neutral position that doesn't interfere with the passage of sounds. Try hanging your tongue out of your mouth, then gradually pulling it back until it is just behind the lower teeth, touching their base. Your tongue can produce many vowel sounds with minimal movement from this position, mostly by raising and lowering the middle of the tongue instead of the tip.


This is especially important while you are singing, or when trying to address certain types of lisp.

, This allows you to breathe better. Sound is created by the air being forced out of your lungs, so the clearer your breathing, the clearer your speech. Look straight ahead, so your jaw is flat instead of lowered compressing your throat.


When talking to someone roughly the same height as you, maintaining eye contact is a good way to ensure your chin stays raised.

, If you speak quickly, you are much more likely to slur your words. Even if you stutter, the best approach is to pause and attempt the word again, not to rush through it.

, This gets you practice in most common sounds, and is also helpful for ""warming up"" your voice before a speech. Try these common vowels with a few consonants, or even going through the whole alphabet:


""Bah Beh Bee Bih Bo Boo Buh""
""Vah Veh Vee Vih Vo Voo Vuh"" (et cetera)
For more of a challenge, include the vowel ""aw,"" which is similar but distinct from ""ah"" in most dialects. You can also include combination consonants such as ""SL"" and ""PR""

, Diphthongs are vowels that require you to move your tongue from one position to another as you pronounce them. Practice saying these words slowly, identifying the two mouth positions you use during the vowel. Then try to speed up and say the words more quickly while keeping your mouth movements precise. Spend more time in the first part of the vowel than the second, and your speech will sound clearer and more refined.Ache mate paid saint stray
Eye nice rhyme pie height
Voice noise coin
Load toad flow
Crowd sprout found
Air square prayer (not always considered a diphthong, but still good practice)
Cute few ewes
Onion union million
Don't worry too much if you can't identify the two vowel sounds in some of these. Different dialects of English often pronounce diphthongs differently, or even as single vowels.

, Try to articulate each word in a tongue twister, especially one that contains sounds you find difficult to pronounce. Start out slowly, and go faster once you can pronounce it perfectly. Here are a few tongue twisters for common problem sounds, which you can find more of here:


James just jostled Jean gently.
Round the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran.
Silly Susan sells sea shells by the seashore.

, Read a book (or even this article) out loud into a voice recorder. Try to articulate every sound clearly so that you can be heard. It may help to set up the recording device a short distance from yourself, then to increase the distance each time and try to keep your speech just as clear.


You can probably find a voice recorder on your computer or online. Your phone may have a voice recorder too, but it may not be high enough quality for enunciation practice.

, Hold a pencil, chopstick, pen, or similar object horizontal been your teeth, and repeat the speaking drills above. By making your tongue and mouth work much harder around a physical speech impediment, enunciating will become easier when you are speaking normally without any obstruction in the way of your speaking.

, People have trouble understanding speech that is too fast to follow, or slurred because you're speaking too fast for your tongue to follow. Read aloud while concentrating on the flow of the content, slowing down to emphasize important points and speeding up slightly during exciting moments.Children's books (with full paragraphs) are a good choice, since they tend to focus on emotion and have a simple style to follow.


You can also try recording yourself speaking out loud, then counting the number of words per minute you use. Although ""normal"" speed depends on region, culture, and other variables, most people speak at a rate between 120 and 200 words per minute., Read aloud again at a slow or moderate pace, this time focusing on the punctuation. Pause at commas and periods, and take a moment to clear your throat or inhale deeply at the end of a paragraph. Try to include these intentional pauses in your speech as well, so the listener has time to process what you have said, and help you avoid tripping over your words.


If you experience unintentional, gulping pauses, methods of overcoming public speaking could help keep this under control.

, There's an art of projecting your voice, or increasing your volume without sounding hoarse or flat.Look in the mirror and place your hand on your stomach, then breathe in and out deeply. Inhale from the diaphragm, below the stomach, not from the upper lungs. If your shoulders remain level during this exercise, you're doing it right.Maintain this type of breathing as you practice greeting yourself in the mirror from farther and farther distances, or just keep adding volume gradually without forcing too much or experiencing a scratchy sensation.


Focus on this exercise if people ask you to speak up or repeat yourself frequently, or if you are training to give a spoken presentation.

Loosen up your tongue.,
Practice your rolling R sounds with a phrase in Spanish.,
Try a tongue twister in Spanish.,
Alternate tongue twisters.","How to Roll Your ""R""s2"," The rolling R sound requires that your tongue be quite relaxed so it can vibrate freely when you talk. Because a relaxed tongue is not usually required to speak English, you may need to practice relaxing your tongue before you can successfully roll your Rs.Use the phrase ”tee dee va” to loosen your tongue.
Say this phrase over and over again as quickly as you can. Remember to keep your tongue relaxed and loose inside your mouth.
Your tongue is a muscle, so you may need to practice quite a bit before you can naturally relax it enough to roll an R.

, Many people, including children, are taught this rhyme in order to help learn the proper pronunciation of the letter R in Spanish, which produces the same sound as a rolling R. You can use this rhyme to practice your rolling Rs, no matter what language you’re going to use the rolling R for. The tongue twister is ”El perro de san Roque no tiene rabo, porque Ramón Ramirez se lo ha robado.”The English translation of this tongue twister is “The dog of san Roque has no tail, because Ramón Ramirez stole it.""
There are only certain times when the rolled (or trilled) R is used in Spanish: when it is the first letter of a word (e.g. Roque or rabo); or when there is a double R in the middle of a word (e.g. perro). When saying the rhyme, these are the only times you should be rolling the R.
When the letter R appears in a Spanish word by itself in the middle of the word, it shouldn’t be rolled. Instead the sound produced should sound similar to the sound “dd” would make in English. If you need help pronouncing the single R properly, try listening to this video as an example — http://www.studyspanish.com/pronunciation/letter_r.htm.
If it helps, start by practicing only the words that produce the rolling R sound.
Once you’re able to say the individual words properly, move onto saying the entire rhyme.
Repeat the rhyme over and over again, getting faster and faster each time. The key is to be able to say all the words, including the rolling R sound, without proactively thinking about the fact that you’re rolling your Rs.

, The following Spanish tongue twister can be used to practice your rolling R sound, regardless of what language you’re learning: ""Erre con re cigarro, erre con re barril. Rápido corren los carries, cargados de azúcar del ferrocarril.” Start by saying the tongue twister slowly. Once you’ve got the knack of saying the tongue twister, start saying it over and over again at a faster rate.In English this tongue twister translates to “R with R cigar, R with R barrel, swift roll the wagons, carrying sugar of the train.""
Alternate version 1 — ""Erre con erre cigarro, erre con erre barril. Rápido corren los carros, detrás del ferrocarril.”Alternate version 2 — ""Erre con erre guitarra, erre con erre barril. Mira que rápido ruedan, las ruedas del ferrocarril.”

There are only certain times when the rolled (or trilled) R is used in Spanish: when it is the first letter of a word (e.g. Roque or rabo); or when there is a double R in the middle of a word (e.g. perro). When saying the tongue twister, these are the only times you should be rolling the R.
Remember that when the letter R appears in a Spanish word by itself in the middle of the word, it shouldn’t be rolled. Instead the sound produced should sound similar to the sound “dd” would make in English. If you need help pronouncing the single R properly, try listening to this video as an example — http://www.studyspanish.com/pronunciation/letter_r.htm.
As you get faster and faster with the tongue twister, the rolling R sound should come naturally.

, To keep yourself from getting bored, and to ensure you can roll your Rs when saying more than one word or sentence, try a different tongue twister every now and again. This tongue twister is about three sad tigers: ""Tres tristes tigres tragaban trigo en un trigal en tres tristes trastos. En tres tristes trastos tragaban trigo tres tristes tigres.”Alternate version 1 — ""Tres tristes tigres triscaban trigo en un trigal. Un tigre, dos tigres, tres tigres trigaban en un trigal. ¿Qué tigre trigaba más? Todos trigaban igual.”

Alternate version 2 — ""En tres tristes trastos de trigo, tres tristes tigres comen trigo. Comen trigo, tres tristes tigres, en tres tristes trastos de trigo.”

Again, you only need to produce a rolling R sound when the first letter of a word is an R (e.g. Roque or rabo) or when there is a double R in the middle of a word (e.g. perro).
If the letter R appears in a Spanish word by itself in the middle of the word, it shouldn’t be rolled. Instead it should sound something like “dd” would make in English. If you need help pronouncing the single R properly, try listening to this video as an example — http://www.studyspanish.com/pronunciation/letter_r.htm.
As you get faster and faster with the tongue twister, the rolling R sound should come naturally.

Try the Tiger Method.,
Use the Raspberry Method.,
Consider the Vision Dream Method.","How to Roll Your ""R""s3"," The Tiger Method helps to teach you the trick of vibrating your tongue, which is needed in order to roll your Rs. This method evolves as follows:Clear your throat. This should sound something like “ckh.” While clearing your throat, turn the “ckh” sound into a “grrr” sound. The key to these sounds is making the roof of your mouth vibrate.
Say the letter L or N and pay attention to the place where your tongue ends up at the end of the letter. This spot is your alveolar ridge.
Put your tongue on your alveolar ridge and say the words “girl” and “hurl” without removing your tongue from the ridge. Use the ‘clear your throat’ routine to start the word and turn the vibration into a rolled R.

, This method using the sound that results from blowing a raspberry to help learn how to roll your Rs. The steps are as follows:Start by blowing a regular raspberry.
Add your voice to the sound of the raspberry. This can be done by simply using your vocal cords to make noise.
As you’re blowing a raspberry with vocal sound, lower your jaw as part as possible without stopping the raspberry.
Once your jaw is in a lower position, move your tongue to the alveolar ridge without changing anything else you’re doing.
At this point your should be rolling an R. If not, try the method again until you can end with a rolling R.

, This method involves speaking quite loudly, so you’ll want to try this somewhere you won’t be bothering anyone. Follow these steps:Take a deep breath.
Say the word “vision.” Make the middle of the word (which sounds like “zh”) last 3-4 seconds. As you extend the “zh” sound over those 3-4 seconds, increase the volume of the sound. The last part of the word (the ’n’) should be very short, but should also continue to increase in volume. At this point you should be quite loud.
Add the word “dream” to create a phrase. There should be less than a second between finishing the word “vision” and starting the word “dream.” The “dr” part of the word “dream” should be the climax of the phrase.
When you get to the “dr” part of the word “dream,” relax your tongue and make it go floppy. Since you’re speaking very loudly now, the breath coming out of your mouth should make your tongue vibrate. Let this happen (and keep your tongue relaxed).
If successful, it should sound like you’re saying something like “dagadaga.""
You may need to try this several times before you get to the point where you’re making a good rolling R sound.

Prepare for class.,
Remain calm.You might feel panic when called on.,
Answer questions honestly.,
Be as clear as possible.,
Realize no one is judging you.As you listen to a Socratic exchange, you are probably answering the questions yourself and struggling along with your classmate.,
Admit when you are stumped.",How to Argue Using the Socratic Method2," In law school, a professor might call on you at random to discuss a case. There is no way to anticipate the questions your professor will ask. However, you can put yourself in the best position by thoroughly reading your assigned material and briefing cases., However, if you’ve done your reading, then you’ve put yourself in the best position to engage in a Socratic exchange. Take a deep breath and then smile.


It’s best to think of the Socratic questioning as a dialogue between you and your professor. Block out the other students listening in.

, The purpose of the Socratic method is to identify the contradictions and limitations in our own knowledge. For this reason, you need to be honest in your answers. Don’t try to anticipate what you think the professor wants to hear.


If you’re in law school, you should know the facts of the case and the court’s holding. However, apart from the facts, there are rarely “right” or “wrong” answers. Try to get into the spirit of the questioning by understanding its purpose: not to find the right answer, but to understand what you truly think.

, You’ll handle some complicated material in class, so your answers to questions might not be “yes” or “no.” Try to answer as clearly and completely as possible so that your professor understands your point.At the same time, strive to be as brief as possible. There’s no reason to give a long-winded answer if one isn’t required.

, Accordingly, there is no reason to be embarrassed if you are on the receiving end of Socratic questioning and have a deer-in-the-headlights look.

, You might reach a point where you can’t resolve the contradictions in your thinking. At this point you are truly stumped. Feel free to admit that you don’t know how to answer a question.


Remember that the Socratic method is something you can use with yourself throughout your life. You should constantly interrogate what you think is true.

Try tongue twisters.,
Read aloud.,
Practice speaking with a cork in your mouth.,
Pay attention to tone.,
Avoid uptalk.",How to Improve Your Clarity of Speech2," Tongue twisters are a great way to improve your speech clarity as mastering them will allow you learn how to keep your voice clear and speak with confidence. Many actors and public speakers will practice tongue twisters before going on stage to warm their voices up.


Start off slowly and gradually build up until you can say them at a normal conversational speed. When speaking them, exaggerate the words, making your tongue, jaw, and lips work hard. As you become surer of them, begin to project your voice and exaggerate the words more. This helps you gain skill and strengthens the muscles in your mouth for speech.Try some of these tongue twisters to improve your speech clarity:

You know New York, you need New York, you know you need unique New York. (Repeat).
Red leather, yellow leather. (Repeat).
While we were walking, we were watching window washers wash Washington's windows with warm washing water., If you’re reading a book or even just the news in the morning, practice reading it out loud. Doing this will help you become more familiar with how you sound when you speak. Oftentimes when we are talking to people we aren’t really listening to ourselves and how we sound. By reading something out loud in the comfort of your own home you can begin to listen to yourself and pay attention to areas where you may not speak clearly.


You can also record yourself talking and then play it back while taking note of where you may mumble or not speak clearly.

, Many actors and voice actors do this exercise to increase clarity and diction, especially when it comes to something like Shakespeare.By putting a cork between your teeth and speaking aloud you train your mouth to work extra hard to really pronounce every syllable, and the cork will also prevent your tongue from tripping you up on certain words.


This exercise can tire your jaw, which will help you learn to relax it, but you shouldn’t do this for too long so you don’t get sore.
You may also want to have a napkin with you as you produce a lot of saliva with this method.

, Tone also plays into clarity and diction as it can affect how you pronounce certain words.


Are you giving a speech that is supposed to excite people? They may have a harder time understanding you if you are monotone or disinterested.
Your tone, whether you're excited, informative, or conversational will affect how people pay attention to your speech, and can improve your clarity.
Tone is everything from your attitude when speaking to the pitch of your voice. Take note of how high or low your voice is when speaking.

, Uptalk is that nasty habit of ending your sentences with an upward inflection that makes you sound like you’re asking a question.End your sentences on a strong note with authority. Speak with declarative statements and invoke confidence.A lot of times uptalk happens when we don’t feel confident in what we are saying. Maybe someone asks you what you do and you respond with “I’m a designer?” This is uptalk and it makes you sound almost apologetic. Instead, own your response and statements. “I’m a designer.”

Practice jaw exercises to enhance clarity of speech.,
Watch your posture.,
Warm your vocal chords.,
Avoid speaking with clenched teeth.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Improve Your Clarity of Speech3," Relax your jaw to make your speech a lot clearer with some exercises.


Make wide chewing motions while humming gently.
Stretch every muscle in your jaw and face. Open your mouth as wide as possible (as if you were about to yawn), while moving your jaw in circles, and sideways.
Open your mouth wide, as in the previous exercise, and shut it again. Repeat 5 times.
Make a buzzing sound with your lips together, but don’t clench your jaw.

, Just like breathing, your posture plays a large role in your speech clarity, and it’s something that we sometimes forget to take into account.For best speech clarity you should stand straight with your shoulders back and your weight evenly distributed.
Do some shoulder rolls and standing side bends to help with your posture.These simple exercises will also help you with your breathing, and you can even do your jaw strengthening techniques while you stretch.

, Doing vocal warmups will loosen you up and prepare your voice so you can speak clearly and effectively.


Even if you’re not singing, you can do some scales or just hum. Try singing your tongue twisters too.
Do some “Whooos!” going up and down. Picture your voice like a ferris wheel going round and round.
Hum and pat your chest. This can help knock out any phlegm you may have.

,


When you clench your teeth you’re causing a lot of strain on yourself and it can be a sign of stress. And speaking with a clenched jaw will prevent you from opening your mouth enough to enunciate and speak clearly.
If you find yourself clenching your jaw, practice some of the warmups, and take a moment to take a deep breath slowly exhaling by letting your breath buff your cheeks out, as if you’re letting air out of a balloon.

, Your vocal chords are like a machine that needs to stay well oiled. Gargle some lukewarm water with a pinch of salt to keep them limber. This helps relieve tension in the throat."

Speak up.,
Slow down.,
Enunciate.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Vary your pitch.,
Do some vocal exercises.,
Practice reading aloud.,
Record yourself.,
See a voice coach.,
Smile as you speak.",How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice," It's important to be heard when you speak, so raise your voice! If you tend to whisper, mumble or speak with your head down, it is much easier for people to talk over you or ignore you.


However, this doesn't mean you should shout - rather, you should vary the loudness of your speech depending on the situation. For example, if you're addressing a large group of people it will be necessary to speak loudly in order to project your voice.
But speaking too loudly in normal, everyday conversation is unnecessary and can give the wrong impression.;
, Speaking too quickly is a bad habit and it can be difficult for people to keep up with you or even understand what you're saying. This makes it easy for them to tune out and stop listening.


Therefore, it's important to slow down your speech by saying your words more slowly and pausing between sentences - this helps to add emphasis to what you're saying and gives you a chance to take a breath!
On the other hand, it's a good idea not to speak too slowly. Speaking too slowly can be monotonous for your listeners, so they may become impatient and just tune out.
The ideal speaking rate is somewhere between 120 and 160 words per minute. However, if you're giving a speech, it's a good idea to alter the speed at which you speak - speaking slowly can help to emphasize a point, while speaking more quickly can give the impression of passion and enthusiasm., Speaking clearly is possibly the most important aspect of developing a good speaking voice. You need to pay close attention to each and every word you say - pronouncing it fully and correctly.


Make sure to open your mouth, loosen your lips and keep your tongue and teeth in the correct position as you speak. This may also help eliminate or disguise a lisp, if you have one. It might feel odd at first, but if you consistently make the effort to pronounce your words correctly, it will soon come naturally to you., Deep breathing is essential for a full, rich speaking voice. The majority of people breathe too quickly and shallowly when they speak, which results in a more unnatural, nasal tone.


Your breath should come from your diaphragm, not from your chest. To figure out if you're breathing correctly, place your fist on your abdomen, just below your last rib - you should feel your stomach expand and see your shoulders rise and fall as you breathe.
Practice your breathing by inhaling deeply, allowing the air to fill your belly. Breathe in for a count of 5 seconds, then exhale for another 5. Get used to this method of breathing, then try to work it into your everyday speech.
Remember that sitting or standing up straight, with your chin up and your shoulders back, will help you to breathe deeper and project your voice more easily. It will also give you an air of confidence as you speak.
Try to breathe at the end of every sentence - if you use the deep breathing method, you should have enough air to get through the next sentence without having to pause for breath. This will also give your listeners a chance to absorb what you're saying.

, The pitch of your voice can have a real impact on the quality of your speech and the impact it makes on your listeners. In general, speaking in a shaky or unsteady pitch gives the impression of nervousness, while an even voice is more calming and persuasive.Although you shouldn't try to change the natural pitch of your voice (no Darth Vader impressions, please), you should make an effort to control it. Don't let your nerves get the better of you and aim to achieve a fuller, smoother pitch.
You can practice controlling your pitch by humming a tune, or simply by reading a piece of text aloud to yourself. Keep in mind that it's not necessary to maintain a steady pitch at all times - some words should be voiced in a higher pitch in order to add emphasis., Practicing vocal exercises can be a good way to develop your natural speaking voice. Practicing while looking in the mirror is the most effective way to achieve this, as are some of these ways:


Try to loosen your mouth and relax your vocal cords. You can do this by yawning widely, wiggling your jaw from side to side, humming a tune, and gently massaging your throat muscles with your fingers.

Increase your breathing capacity and volume by fully exhaling until all of the air is completely expelled from your lungs, then take a deep breath and hold it for 15 seconds before exhaling again.

Work on your pitch by singing the sound ""ah"", first at your normal pitch, then getting progressively lower. You can also do this with each of the letters of the alphabet.Repeat tongue twisters like:

Red leather, yellow leather.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.



, In order to work on pronunciation, pace and volume, it is a good idea to practice reading aloud.


Pick a passage from a book or magazine, or better yet, find a transcript of a famous speech (such as one by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.) and read it aloud to yourself.
Remember to stand up straight, breathe deeply and open your mouth fully when you speak. Stand in front of a mirror if it helps.
Keep practicing until you are happy with what you hear. Then try to employ the same techniques as part of your everyday speech.

, Even though most people don't like listening to the sound of their own voices, it's a good idea to record yourself speaking.


This can help you to pick up on any faults that you wouldn't normally pick up on, such as mispronunciations and speed or pitch problems.
Nowadays, most phones will have a recording option that you can use to listen to yourself. You could also use a video camera (which could be helpful to check your posture, eye contact and mouth movement).

, If you're really worried about improving your speaking voice - for something like a debate, speech or presentation - then it might be a good idea to book an appointment with a voice coach. They can identify your individual speech issues and help you to correct them.


A voice coach is also a good idea if you have a native or very colloquial accent that you're trying to minimize or eliminate. Getting rid of an accent is a difficult thing to do, so seeing a professional can really help.
If seeing a voice coach seems a little extreme, then consider practising in front of a particularly articulate friend or family member. They may be able to pick up on any issues and give you some helpful pointers. This will also help you to feel more confident about speaking in front of others., People will judge you and the content of your speech more favorably if you use an open, friendly, encouraging tone (as opposed to an aggressive, sarcastic or bored one).


A good way to make your tone more friendly and warm is to smile while you speak. Not a crazed grin, mind you, but even a slight upturn of the corners of your mouth can make the sound of your voice more appealing - even over the phone.
Of course, smiling isn't always appropriate, especially if you're discussing a serious issue. But just remember that inserting emotion into your voice (whatever emotion it may be) can do wonders."

Breathe from your diaphragm to control your voice.,
Vary your vocal pitch.,
Speak slowly to keep people engaged.,
Use a softer voice to avoid sounding aggressive.,
Avoid mumbling to keep your listener from getting confused.,
Record yourself to practice your changes.",How to Develop a Friendly Tone of Voice1," Making your tone of voice friendlier requires you to be aware of how fast you talk and how high and low your voice gets. Use strong breaths from your abdomen for better control.To check if you’re breathing from your diaphragm (the muscle that sits right below your lungs), watch yourself in the mirror while you breathe in. If your shoulders and chest rise, you’re taking shallow breaths without using your diaphragm.
Practice using your diaphragm by placing your hand on your abdomen and pushing it outward while you breathe in.;
, Don’t speak in a monotone voice. Instead, make your voice both high and low as you talk. Stressing important words in your sentence with a higher pitch reassures listeners, while lower pitches can inject calmness into your conversation.End questions on a higher pitch and statements on a lower pitch. If you end statements with a high pitch, you’ll sound like you don’t believe what you just said.The best way to keep up a friendly tone is to have varied pitches while you talk. You don’t want to have a totally high-pitched conversation, as people might think you just inhaled a helium balloon. A completely low-pitched conversation, however, could make your listener think you’re uninterested in your chat with them.

, When you speak too quickly, you sound like you just want your conversation to be over and done. Instead, speak slowly to allow your listener to hear every word you say. This will tell them you actually want to be there talking to them.You don’t need to take thirty seconds to get out every word. Be aware of your speed, and you’ll naturally slow down. Add some pauses to let your listener keep up with you.

, There’s nothing worse than feeling like you’re being yelled at by someone. Keep your voice at a level that allows people to hear you without shouting at them.Breathing from your diaphragm will help with this problem. These controlled breaths let everyone hear you without making you work too hard to push out the sound. Any time you’re struggling to make yourself heard, you’re probably going to end up shouting, which won’t sound friendly.

, If you’re not clearly articulating every syllable of each word, your listener might not understand you. Worse, they may think you’re saying something they can’t hear on purpose. This could make them confused and frustrated.Practice good articulation by saying tongue twisters to yourself for five minutes each morning or night. For example, say these as fast as you can while still keeping the words clear: “James just jostled Jean gently. Jack the jailbird jacked a jeep,” “Kiss her quick, kiss her quicker, kiss her quickest,” and “The shrewd shrew sold Sarah seven silver fish slices.”, Use your smartphone or a camera to take a voice recording or video of you while you speak. Pay close attention to the pitch, speed, and loudness of your voice. Make improvements after each new recording."

Research a good monologue for yourself.,
After you have chosen your monologue, go over it.,
Find some ""key"" words, and emphasize them.,
Try to fill the shoes of your character.,
Don't forget to practice, practice and practice some more!,
Be sure to make eye contact with your audience, as that makes them feel as if they are a part of your monologue.,
Try to keep it real every time.,
Finally, you are ready!",How to Find Emotion in Monologues," Part of the trick to delivering a good monologue is to find one that is a good fit for you. Finding a character similar to yourself is often easier to portray than someone with whom you find it hard to really connect or understand. Here are some ways to connect well:


If you have a certain disposition, such as shy, or outgoing, try to find a good ""fit"" in a character that aligns with your personality traits.
If you have a strong accent, find a monologue that may portray a character who has an accent.
Several websites are handy for finding a good monologue, and you may even be able to find a reputable fellow actor or a director to give you suggestions.;
, Make sure you have memorized it, and know it by heart before you go up on stage. Memorizing the monologue makes a big difference between getting the lead, and getting a smaller role. Also, proving that you can memorize a monologue shows the director you're auditioning for that you're prepared to memorize whatever lines you'll have in the actual performance as your character. Oftentimes, it helps to just simply memorize the monologue before getting filled up with emotion over it. Then, you will know the whole monologue before you polish it up.

, Imagine italicizing the words verbally for further emotion. Find places for inflections, pauses, sounds (like a cough, a cry, a muttering or a gasp), as well as facial expressions and bodily gestures. The whole body performs emotion. Just as someone would not only raise their voice when they become angry, you will want to add these small but important factors. An angry person might also make menacing gestures, grunt, turn red, as well as pace and stomp. They might also raise their voice or make their voice sound strained or upset. These kinds of ""body language"" and sounds add a whole lot of depth and emotion to your monologue.

, Envision how they would react to situations that you face. Think of the way they walk, the way they talk, and the way they interact with others. Think of how mature they would be at their age.


Try to think during certain moments of the day, ""What would my character do, or how would he or she react at this moment?"" Try to place yourself in the feeling and characteristics of the person whom you will portray. The more you envision yourself as your character, the more believable you will be.
Imagine your character's characteristics. Is he or she reclusive? What does he or she do for fun or in his or her free time? Is he or she proud? Is he or she heroic? Is he or she selfish? How does he or she walk? How does he or she talk? The more you know about your character (which may include making up things about him or her), the better you will be able to fill your monologue with emotion.

, Even though you might get stage fright, it is very important that you can be comfortable practicing your monologue in front of people. If you really feel uncomfortable at first, read it to your pets, your reflection in the mirror, or to yourself in an open space. Eventually, you should really try to practice for real people besides the director. Ask family and friends to listen initially.

, You should try to include people to make it seem more real and vivid to them. After all, you will be trying to make an impression on them, and not speak to yourself or into the distance.

, If you find your monologue becoming dull, either change it up (but keeping the same feeling) or take a little break from practicing. If you believe it, the audience believes it.

, You have your monologue memorized by heart, have practiced using emotion both with your speech and your body, and should be comfortable performing it for people. Remember, the more people you are comfortable with watching you, the better you will probably be able to perform for your audition or actual performance. Good luck!

See why empathy matters.",How to Empathize," To feel emotions along with someone else, you've got to be able to feel them in yourself. Are you tuned in to your feelings? Do you notice when you're feeling happy, sad, angry or afraid? Do you let these feelings rise to the surface, and do you express them? If you tend to tamp down your emotions instead of allowing them to be part of your life, work on letting yourself feel a bit more deeply.


It's pretty common to push aside negative feelings. For example, it's more fun to distract yourself with TV or go to the bar than it is to sit down and think about something upsetting that happened. But pushing feelings aside creates a disconnect, a lack of familiarity. When you can't express your own sadness, how can you expect to feel someone else's?
Take time every day to let your emotions surface. Instead of hurriedly blocking out negative feelings, think them through. Be angry and afraid, and deal with the feelings in a healthy way, like by crying, or writing your thoughts down, or discussing how you feel with a friend.;
, Hear what the person is saying, and notice the inflection in their voice. Observe all the little clues that belie a way that someone is feeling. Maybe her lip is trembling and her eyes are glistening. Maybe it's more subtle - she's looking down a lot, or she seems vacant. Put yourself aside and absorb the person's story.



Set aside judgement while you listen. If you find yourself remembering a disagreement you had, or feeling critical about the person's choices, or feeling anything that takes you out of the moment, struggle to reorient yourself into listening mode., Have you ever read a moving story that was so engaging, you forgot yourself? For a few minutes there, you became that character, and you knew exactly how it would feel to see your father for the first time in 10 years, or lose your love to someone else. Feeling empathy in person isn't so different. When you're listening to someone and really trying to understand, a moment will come when you start feeling what the other person is feeling. You'll see a glimpse of what it means to be them.

, Empathy can be painful! It hurts to absorb someone else's pain, and it takes effort to engage on such a deep level. Perhaps that's why empathy is on the decline - it's just easier to keep conversations light, to stay safely self-contained. If you want to be more empathetic, you can't shy away from people's feelings. Realize that they're going to have an effect on you, and that you might come away feeling different. But you'll have a deeper understanding of the other person, a foundation on which to build a more solid connection.

, Ask questions that show you're listening. Use body language that shows you're engaged: make eye contact, lean in a little, don't fidget. Nod, shake your head, or smile when it's appropriate to do so. These are all ways to show your empathy in the moment, to build trust with the person who is sharing feelings with you. If you seem distracted, look away, or give other cues that you're not listening or you aren't interested, the person will probably close up and stop sharing.


Another way to show empathy is to share yourself, too. Making yourself as vulnerable as the other person is can build trust and mutual connection. Let down your guard and get into the conversation.

, Being empathetic toward someone is a learning experience, and it's good to let the knowledge you gained influence your future actions. Maybe that means standing up for someone who gets bullied a lot, because you understand him better now. It might change the way you behave next time you meet someone new, or your views on certain social or political issues. Let empathy influence the way you move through the world.

, Empathy stems from the desire to know more about other people, other experiences. Get curious about what life is like for people who aren't you. Make it a point to learn as much as you can about other things every day. Here are a few ways to act on your curiosity:



Travel more. When you go to places you've never visited, make a point of spending time with people who live there and getting to know more about the way of life.

Talk to strangers. If you find yourself sitting next to someone on a bus, strike up a conversation instead of burying your nose in a book.
Get out of your regular routine. If you tend to hang out with the same people and go to the same places all of the time, mix it up and start meeting new people. Expand your world a little.

, If you notice areas where your empathy is lacking, make it a point to change how you feel, or at least gain a greater understanding of people and groups you don't like. The moment you feel repelled by someone, ask yourself why. Decide that instead of avoiding or badmouthing that person, you're going to put yourself in their shoes. Find out what you can learn by being empathetic toward people you don't like.


Remember that even if you don't reach some kind of agreement, you can still feel empathetic. It's possible to feel empathy for someone you actively dislike. And who knows, once you open yourself up a bit, you might find reasons to change your mind about the person.

, This is a simple way to generate instances of empathy on a daily basis. Instead of considering emotional talk off limits, ask people about their emotions more often, and really listen to their responses. This doesn't mean that every conversation has to get deep, solemn and philosophical. But asking people how they feel can help you engage more fully, and really see the person you're talking to.The other side of the coin is to respond more truthfully when someone asks you how you feel. Instead of saying ""Great!"" when you actually feel down, why not express the truth? See what happens when you put your emotions out there a bit more instead of keeping them contained.

, Absorbing a lot of stories, in the form of novels, films, and other media, is a good way to develop your sense of empathy. Studies show that reading literary fiction actually improves your ability to empathize in real life.It helps you get in the habit of imagining what life would be like if you were someone else. The catharsis of laughing or crying along with character can help you be more emotionally open with people.

, If you're having trouble knowing whether you're empathetic, try practicing empathy with someone else. Make sure the person knows that you want to work on this, so they'll understand if you don't hit just the right note. Ask the person to tell you how they feel, and practice all the steps above to feel along with them. Then tell the person how you feel as a result of what they told you.See if the feelings matched up. If the person expressed sadness, and you felt sad when they were talking, then you read their emotions correctly.
If the feelings didn't match up, you may need to spend more time getting in tune with your own emotions and practice recognizing emotions in other people.

, Empathy is the ability to feel with someone. It requires you to go below the surface and experience the same emotions someone else is experiencing. It's easy to get empathy mixed up with sympathy, which is when you pity someone for their misfortune, and perhaps act on that feeling to try to help. But empathy runs deeper: rather than feeling for someone, you feel with them.


For example, let's say your sister begins to cry as she tells you that her boyfriend just broke up with her. As you watch the tears roll down her face and listen to her describe what happened, you feel your own throat start to tighten. You don't just feel sorry for her, you feel sad, too. That's empathy.
Another way to look at empathy is to see it as a shared understanding, an ability to project yourself into someone else's experience. The idea of trying to walk a mile in someone else's shoes is a description of feeling empathy.
Being empathetic means sharing in any kind of emotion - it doesn't have to be a negative one. Being empathetic is being tuned in to all of a person's feelings and emotions, so that you get a sense of what it's like to be that person.

, You don't have to have a similar background to someone else to feel empathy for them. It's not about having a shared understanding because you've been there, too. In fact, you can feel empathy for people with whom you have nothing in common. Being empathetic is about experiencing what someone else is feeling - whatever it is. It doesn't have to be something you've felt before.


This means you can feel empathy for anyone. A young person can empathize with an elderly person in a nursing home, even though she has clearly never had that experience. A rich person can empathize with someone who is homeless, even if he has always been privileged to have a roof over his head and plenty to eat. You can feel empathy for a stranger on the train you're watching from across the aisle.
To put it another way, being empathetic doesn't mean imagining what life must be like for someone - it means actually feeling what life is like for that person on an emotional level.

, In fact, it's still possible to be empathetic toward someone if you completely disagree with their views and don't even like them very much. The person you don't like is still human, and has the same range of emotions as you. It might not be easy to do, but you can still empathize with that person's pain and suffering, just as you would for someone you love.For example, let's say your neighbor is on the opposite end of the political spectrum from you, and he brings up views you think you are completely wrong at every opportunity. But if you saw him get hurt, you'd come to his aid.
It might be even more important to develop the ability to empathize with people you don't like. Empathy helps us see each other as people in need of love and consideration, no matter what. It creates the possibility of peace.

, George Bernard Shaw said, “Do not do unto others as you would have them do unto you—they might have different tastes.” The ""Golden Rule"" doesn't really apply when it comes to empathy, because it doesn't help you understand what it's like to be someone else. Being empathetic means opening yourself to someone else's point of view, someone else's ""tastes,"" instead of imposing your own experiences and ideas.


Thinking about how you'd like to be treated can serve as a good starting point for respectful and conscientious, but to be empathetic, you have to go a little deeper. It's difficult to do, and it might even feel uncomfortable. But the more you do it, the deeper your understanding of the people around you will be.

, Empathy improves quality of life on both a personal and social level. It helps you feel more connected to the people around you and creates a sense of shared meaning. What's more, humans' ability to experience empathy for people different from them leads to big social gains. It helps individuals and groups get past racism, homophobia, sexism, classism, and other social problems. It's the foundation of social cooperation and mutual aid.Without empathy, where would we be?


A recent study showed that the empathy level among college students has dropped 40% over the last 20 - 30 years.This suggests that empathy is, at least in part, something that can be learned or unlearned.
By getting in touch with your sense of empathy and making it a priority every day, you can improve your ability to be empathetic - and see how your life improves as a result.

Smile to appear and sound approachable.,
Keep your body open and posture straight to be inviting.,
Listen attentively to show empathy.,
Keep the conversation balanced so you’re both chatting.,
Offer genuine compliments to be kind.",How to Develop a Friendly Tone of Voice2," When you smile, your face opens up and stretches. This automatically makes your tone friendlier. Smiling will also make your conversation partner feel comfortable being around you.Practice smiling while you talk by standing in front of your bathroom mirror and saying a few sentences with a big grin on your face.

, Uncross your arms and straighten your shoulders and back. Don’t slouch in the middle of a conversation. Instead, use your body language to look welcoming and positive.If you feel like your arms are flopping awkwardly next to your sides while you’re chatting, lace your fingers together in front of your body. This is still more inviting than crossing your arms over your chest.

, When you have a conversation with someone, it’s important to show interest in what the other person has to say. Nod and keep your eyes on their face while they’re speaking to you. By showing you care, you’ll keep up the friendly tone of the conversation even when you’re not the one doing the talking.Ask follow-up questions based on what they’ve said to keep your friendly chat going. For example, if they tell you they have a cat named Chloe, you could say, “I love animals! How old is Chloe?”, Maintain a back-and-forth with your conversation partner. Don’t tell a story that takes an hour to get through. Instead, use the conversation to learn about each other or get updates on how both of you are doing., Be friendly in what you say in addition to how you say it. Share a nice thought about the other person. Avoid making things up just to be nice, however, as it’ll sound fake.Avoid gossiping and don’t complain too much. These habits will quickly turn a friendly, positive conversation into a negative whining session.
Be careful with your pitch when you compliment people. If you go high on the wrong words, you’ll end up sounding sarcastic. For example, saying “I love those earrings!” with a really high-pitched “love” might make your listener think you’re making fun of their jewelry.

Think about your passions, and base your topic on something you feel strongly about. It will be hard to motivate others if you do not care much about what you are saying.;
, Motivational speeches about how to use a typewriter or sell pay phones will not be well-received in modern times.

, Your audience will expect you to know a lot about the subject of your motivational speech. Read, study and stay current in the field..

, Understand the people you will target as audience members before you get too far into the development of your career. Different groups of people need to be communicated with in different ways.

, You can enroll in your local community college or see what the local Toastmasters have to offer. You want to be comfortable talking to large groups.

, This will give you an opportunity to watch yourself as if you were a member of your audience. You can make improvements where necessary.


Pay attention to the details that will inspire motivation. You want to make eye contact, use proper body language and sound natural and motivational.

, Most motivational speakers are also writers and they provide written materials to support their speaking engagements. Communication is the most important skill when you are a motivational speaker.


Write a blog, keep a website updated and publish articles when you have the opportunity. Continued writing will not only improve your motivational speaking skills, it will serve as good public relations.

, Some motivational speakers have large screens, workbooks and PowerPoint presentations ready when they deliver speeches. Choose tools that you are comfortable with and provide additional support.

, A motivational speech in a conference room or an auditorium will probably be better received than one delivered in your basement.


Make sure the venue is appropriate to the audience size. You want a feeling of intimacy, and a room too small will feel crowded while a place too large will feel empty.

, Advertise your motivational speeches, sell tickets for cheap or speak for free until you build your brand and publish all sorts of materials such as brochures, postcards, signs and e-newsletters.

,, Listen to what your audience says and post your most positive reviews on your website and in your published materials.

Consult an ASCII conversion chart.,
Grab some paper to prepare a worksheet.,
Fill in Column 2.,
Write your letter’s decimal value below Column 3.,
Do the math in Column 2.,
Copy those numbers into Column 3.,
Fill in Column 1.",How to Write Capital and Lowercase Letters in Binary1," Before you convert a letter into binary, you first need to know its numerical representation in the ASCII (or American Standard Conversion for Information Interchange) chart. The ASCII assigns numerical representations to a variety of generic symbols, including letters. These numerical representations start at 0 and end with 225. Search for a given letter (let’s say “A”) in the “Character” column, which may be abbreviated to “CHR.” That letter’s numerical representation is listed in the “Decimal Value,"" or “DEC,” column. Consulting an ASCII chart is the easiest way to determine a letter’s decimal value.To determine an uppercase letter’s decimal value without an ASCII chart, remember the number 65. Write out the entire alphabet in uppercase. Then assign the number 65 to the letter “A.” From there, assign each subsequent letter with each subsequent number (B = 66, C = 67, etc), ending with Z = 90. Now you have the decimal value for each uppercase letter according to the ASCII chart.;
, Create three columns. Label one “Binary Digits,” label the second “Default Value,” and label the third “Calculated Value.” Since binary numbers include eight digits, create eight rows across all three columns. Next, in all eight rows, write the multiplication sign in between Column 1 and Column 2, and then do the same with the ""equals"" sign in between Column 2 and Column 3, so that Column 1 x Column 2 = Column 3 across the board., From top to bottom, list the following numbers under ""Default Value:"" 128; 64; 32; 16; 8; 4; 2; 1. If you read the default values from top to bottom, notice how each number is half that of the preceding value (64 is half of 128; 32 is half of 64; etc). Also note that, if you add the numbers in Column 2 together, you’ll find they equal 225: the highest decimal value assigned in the ASCII chart., Let’s say you’re converting the letter “A,” whose decimal value is 65. Be sure to write “65” all the way down at the bottom, so that each of the eight rows in Column 3 remains empty. Although Column 3 is blank right now, the values that will appear here momentarily will soon add up 65.To convert a letter into binary numbers, you’re essentially doing a math equation in reverse. The decimal value for that letter is the “final” answer,” or your starting point. From here, you’re going to work backwards to determine that letter’s binary number in Column 1.
To better understand how to do this, let’s do the opposite and convert the binary number “01011010” into a letter to see how this table works. From top to bottom, fill in Column 1 with these numbers: 0 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 1- 0 - 1 - 0. Now multiply each number in Column 1 with the corresponding number in Column 2: 0 x 128 = 0; 1 x 64 = 1; 0 x 32 = 0; etc. Write the answer to each in Column 3 and then add them all up: 0 + 64 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 90. Consult the ASCII chart, and you’ll find that a decimal value of 90 represents the letter “Z.”
Now that you’ve converted a binary number into a letter, working your way backwards through the table to do the opposite should be less daunting. The fact that binary numbers are always either “1” or “0” makes the math easy. Each of the calculated values in Column 3 will always be either “0” or one of the default values that you’ve already written down in Column 2.

, Figure out which combination of the default values in Column 2 will add up to your letter's decimal value. For the letter ""A,"" whose decimal value is 65, look at the numbers you've already written down in Column 2 and see which add up to 65. Reading Column 2 from top to bottom, you’ll find the second number down is “64,” and the eighth number is “1.” Add these together and you have 65., Write in “0” for the other rows. So, for the letter “A,” Column 3 should read from top to bottom: 0 - 64 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1., Using either “1” or “0,” enter the appropriate binary digit for each row. Remember: Column 1 x Column 2 = Column 3. If Column 3 is 0, enter “0” in Column 1. If Column 3 is the same number as Column 2, enter “1.” For instance, with the letter “A:” 0 x 128 = 0; 1 x 64 = 64, 0 x 32 = 0; etc. When read from top to bottom, Column 1 will now give you the binary number for that letter, so the binary number for “A” is 0 - 1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1."

Develop fun ways to teach young children the right things to do when speaking in public.,
Teach the children about ""the big finish."",
Truly listen to what the children have to say.",How to Build Confidence in Preschoolers and Toddlers With Public Speaking," Read the poems to them and help them to learn the poems through repetition and even enactment where possible. Then, have the children recite the poems while you're giving them your total attention.

, Even if you are uncomfortable with public speaking, which most people are, your little one needs to know from you that they are not the only one who is nervous when speaking. A child learns by example and does not have the ability to understand the philosophical realm of language and inner struggle. If you only tell them not to be afraid of something, they will agree with you to not do it, but they will not fully get what ""it"" is.

, Suggest that they each take turns standing up and telling everyone else in the group or class about what they drew. Teach them that teamwork and a positive attitude benefits them as well as those around them. This will build self confidence and self respect which will make them feel good about speaking in front of people.

, Have them applaud the speaking child for his or her efforts. This is an important part of growing to appreciate public speaking, especially as not every child will find it a comfortable experience unless they're supported thoroughly. Teach all of the children that it is very important to be kind and to never to laugh or make fun of a speaker. 


Encourage the children to ask questions politely. It is both good for the speaker to learn to field questions from an audience and for the children to learn the skill of asking questions in relation to something they've just learned about.

, The kids can help with designing, locating and making it. They could help hang the curtain or with making props to make it look like a stage.


In many cases, it's probably best to make a portable stage that can be put up and taken down with great ease, so that it's not in the way. Use bamboo poles stuck in buckets (stuff paper or other materials into the bucket to hold in place) to create a prop for hanging stage curtains from and a pole across the top of each pole for hanging curtains from.

, Also demonstrate the wrong things to do. This can be done on a fun basis: Have someone perform all the wrong things like speaking too loudly or too quietly, or too fast, or moving all around the place while talking or facing the wrong way to the audience. You can demonstrate that chewing gum and pulling on their clothes and hair is not the way to talk clearly either. Have some fun with this––the children will laugh a lot but the lessons will still be taken up by their inquiring minds.

, That unlike dancing or playing music, public speaking is not about making a lot of movement, or tapping fingers or feet, or fidgeting. Show energy but don’t be too excited or boring, but just right, to share their ideas. However you wish to accomplish this just remember to focus on what ""to do"" , instead of what ""not to do"" and everyone including yourself will have more fun.


Some public speakers do walk around as they talk; in fact, some of the most engaging ones do this. Children can be encouraged to be expressive with their hands and walking provided that they don't cover their faces or place any part of their sides or back to the audience. As before, and exaggerated performance these mistakes will lighten the mood and help them to laugh at themselves and not judge others.

, It is important that we teach them that what they have to say is important. If we show them that we value it and want to hear what they have to say they will feel more comfortable and respectful with strangers. Part of successful speaking is also learning to be considerate to others by listening.

Understand how stuttering works.,
Step outside of your shame.,
Practice speaking in front of supportive people.,
Stop avoiding speaking situations.,
Address the behavior of people who tease you.,
Join a support group for people who stutter.,
Don't feel the need to cure your stutter completely.",How to Control Stuttering1," When a person stutters, the stuttering may completely block his speech, cause him to repeat sounds, or cause him to ""stick"" on one sound for too long. During a block, the vocal chords push together with great force, and the person is unable to speak until the tension is released. Becoming comfortable with the stutter and practicing the following techniques will make this tension less severe.


While there is no cure for stuttering, these techniques will help you reduce it to manageable levels until it is a much smaller obstacle. People with stutters have won awards in such speech-reliant fields as sports commentary, TV journalism, acting, and singing.;
, Stuttering has nothing to do with lower intelligence, personal mistakes, or bad parenting.It does not mean that you are an especially nervous or anxious person, just that you are exposed to stuttering situations that could make anyone nervous.Realize that your stutter has nothing to do with who you are as a person. It's normal to feel ashamed, but understanding that there's no rational reason behind it may help you feel shame less often and less painfully.

, Most likely your friends and family know you stutter, so there's no reason to feel anxiety about ""revealing"" your stutter to them. Be open about the fact that you'd like to practice your speaking, and read aloud to them or make an effort to join a conversation. This is a good step to take, and one that supportive friends should support if you let them know what you're doing.

, Many people who stutter try to hide the fact, either by avoiding certain sounds, or by avoiding stressful speaking situations entirely. You don't need to go out of your way to speak around bullies, but try not to hold back or switch to safer words when talking to friends, supportive family members, and strangers. The more conversations you hold while stuttering, the more you'll realize that it doesn't hold you back or bother other people nearly as much as you may think.

, Bullies are one thing; they are trying to get you irritated or upset, and it's best to ignore them or report their behavior to people in authority. Friends, on the other hand, are supposed to support each other. If a friend teases you about your stutter in a way that makes you anxious, let her know it bothers you. Remind her if she slips back into old habits, and warn her that you may need to spend less time together if she continues to cause suffering.

, Search online for a stuttering support group in your area, or join an online forum. As with many challenges, stuttering can be easier to deal with if you have a group of people who share their experiences. These are also excellent places to find more recommendations about managing your stutter or reducing your fear of stuttering.


National stuttering associations exist in the United States, India, the United Kingdom, and many other nations.

, A stutter rarely goes away entirely, but that doesn't mean you've failed to control it. Once you're functioning with minimal anxiety in speaking situations, there's no need to panic when your stutter briefly becomes more severe. Reducing your anxiety will help you live with a stutter and minimize the amount of stress it causes.

Get to know the people you’ll be speaking to before you give your talk.,
Stick to your planned delivery style.,
Remember why you’re giving a TED talk.",How to Deliver a TED Talk," TED Talks are about “ideas worth spreading.” Part of this means you should be emotionally invested in what you plan to speak about. Planning a talk on something you’re enthusiastic about will motivate you in the planning and refining of your TED Talk and will carry through to your audience when you deliver it.;
, You don’t have to be the world’s foremost expert in your topic, but you do have to know enough to give accurate information in those areas where you have expertise and to seek out experts and peer-reviewed sources for any material where you’re not an expert yourself., Your TED Talk should be focused on the needs and interests of your audience. Look for places where your audience’s passion matches your own and build on those, as well as taking the following into account:


Your idea should be something your audience hasn’t heard before, or at least not in the way they’ve heard it presented before.
Your idea should be a realistic one, something that your target audience can put into practice or be able to get the right people in their personal networks to put into practice. , Once your idea is something you can relate to your audience and have them relate to you, you have a premise for your talk. Your premise should be one you can state in one or two sentences. You may have to revisit your idea several times to define your premise clearly.

, TED Talks currently are no more than 18 minutes in length. You do not have to use the full 18 minutes for your talk; some ideas can be stated succinctly and completely in 5 minutes or less. You can’t go over 18 minutes, however. If you’re given a shorter time limit when asked to speak at a TED event, use that time limit instead.

, You’re not looking to copy the style of a particular speaker, but to get an overview of possible styles to find what feels right to you. Look at several TED Talk videos in areas similar to what you plan to talk about, as well as videos in areas that interest you that may be outside what you plan to talk about.<

, While the TED Talks in general are about sharing ideas, your TED talk will share your idea primarily in one of three ways:


Education. These TED talks inform the audience about the world around them. Topics often include the biological, physical, or social sciences, as well as information on new technologies and inventions and how they will impact the listeners’ lives. The speakers for these talks often have advanced degrees in one of the sciences, but not always.
Entertainment. These TED talks often cover the creative arts, whether it be writing, art, music, or performing, and delve into the process behind the art.
Inspiration. These TED talks seek to elevate their audience’s perception of themselves and the world around them, to think about things in new ways, and to apply that knowledge to their lives. Many of the speakers of this type of TED talk use their own experiences as examples to others., Once you have established the premise and purpose of your TED talk, you should craft an outline to present your idea in a way that your audience will care about and understand the facts behind them and how it will affect them if they choose to embrace it.


Your outline, however, should be something your audience can discern without being obvious. In other words, you don’t tell them what you’re going to say before you say it (no “Here’s what I’m going to share with you today”) and what you’ve said after you say it (no “And in conclusion …”).If you’ve been scheduled to speak at a TED event, your outline, or a full script, needs to be sent to the event organizer about two months in advance of your appearance. This lets the event organizers provide preliminary feedback., Your introduction should grab your audience by presenting your idea as quickly as possible without drawing excessive attention to yourself as the speaker.


If your idea is one your audience knows is relevant to them, state it clearly early on. If it’s not one your audience realizes is relevant to them, show them how it relates to something they do know is relevant to them,
If your idea is an emotionally heavy one, start with an understated but forthright approach. Let your audience come to feel about the topic instead of dictating their emotions.
Avoid using a string of statistics. A single relevant fact carries more weight, particularly if it comes as a surprise to your audience. , List out what the audience already knows and what they need to know, then organize this information into a series of points, where each point presents information that will help your audience grasp the next point. As you do this, weed out information that your audience doesn’t need to know, even if you may think it’s important.


Keep and devote more time in your talk to information that’s new to your audience and eliminate and devote less time to things they’ve already heard.
Use more evidence that’s supported by your own and your audience’s observations and experience (empirical evidence) than by telling what happened to someone else (anecdotes).
Keep the use of specialized terminology to a minimum and, where possible, present it in such a way that your audience can figure out the definition in context.
Respectfully acknowledge legitimate doubts and contrary evidence.
Save citations until after you’ve made your point or post them in small print at the bottom of relevant slides.
Consider having someone help you gather and select your evidence. , Slides aren’t required for TED talks, although you can use simple slides to support your key points without distracting your audience. You can put the slides together yourself in a presentation program such as PowerPoint or Keynote, or enlist a designer’s help. Keep the following things in mind when preparing slides:


Contact the event organizer for information about the resolution and aspect ratio for slides before you start making any. If the organizer doesn’t provide you any technical specs, use a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and an aspect ratio of 16 to 9.
Use each slide to support only one point in your talk. Avoid using bullet points to make multiple points in your presentation.
Let the slide speak for itself. Don’t put a lot of explanatory text on the slide or devote time to explain what the picture on the slide represents. If your slide features a chart or infographic, keep it simple.
Use only images you own or have permission to use. If you’re using an image under a Creative Commons license, cite the source of the image at the bottom of the slide.
Either fill the entire slide with your image or keep it in the center of the slide; don’t put content in the edges.
Use a sans serif font (Arial, Helvetica, Verdana) of point size 42 or larger. (Sans serif fonts are easier to read from a distance than serif fonts like Times New Roman.) If you are using a custom font, be sure to send it to the organizers in advance. (Presentation software typically can display only the fonts installed on the projecting computer.)

, Instead of providing a summary, your conclusion should be something that leaves your audience with a positive feeling about your idea and how it will affect them if they choose to implement it.


Your conclusion may include a call to action, if appropriate, as long as that call to action isn’t a sales pitch asking them to buy something. , Because you do have a time limit for your TED talk, practicing with a timer will help you pace your talk so you stay within your allotted time and identify places to cut for length.

, The TED organization encourages speakers at its conferences to practice their talks as many times as they can in front of as many different audiences as possible. You can practice in front of any or all of the following audiences:


Yourself in a mirror. This lets you practice your body language.
Family and friends. These can provide initial feedback, but may be more useful as a source of encouragement.
A personal speaker coach.
A speakers’ group, such as Toastmasters.
A class related to the subject of your talk. For example, if your TED talk relates to marketing, you could speak in front of a college marketing class.
A company speaker event, either at your own company or a company connected in some way to your talk., Most TED events also provide opportunities for you to practice your talk, using either or both of these formats:


Online rehearsals through Skype. These let the event organizers provide feedback on how your talk is structured, how well you’ve paced it, and how clearly you deliver it. These online rehearsals usually are scheduled a month in advance of the event.
Dress rehearsals on stage at the event site. These provide you with an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the venue, as well as to prepare for any possible surprises, such as unexpected laughter., Talk to the other TED event attendees on a casual basis during time away from the event stage. This will let you get to know how well your actual audience matches with your imagined audience and also provide some familiar faces in the crowd when you go on stage.

, Although you may have revised the content and presentation of your talk a number of times based on the feedback you’ve gotten from rehearsing it, once you have a style you’re comfortable with, stick with it. Don’t make any last-minute changes to your delivery.

, While you’ve spent time creating and refining your message, it’s not for the sake of the information but about sharing it and your enthusiasm for it with your audience."

Listen to recorded speeches.If you want to become a great speaker, you should first have an idea on what it means to be great.,
Talk slowly.As a public speaker, you should never feel the need to rush through a presentation.,
Minimize filler words and stammering.,
Emphasize or repeat particularly important lines.Even if you have gone over every word of your speech with a fine-toothed comb, there are going to be lines that are most important to the central idea you're discussing.,
Express emotion through inflections.,
Pause for effect.,
Interact with your audience.Speeches can be memorized with enough time and practice, but a truly gifted orator will use parts of his speech as an opportunity to communicate directly to the audience.",How to Be a Great Speaker1," Famous speeches became that way in part because the speaker knew how to wring the most feeling and meaning out of what he was saying. Pay attention to the pauses they take, the words they emphasize, and the steady pace most famous speakers perform at. Public speaking is ultimately an art. There are countless ways you can perform the same speech.


The most famous speeches of the 20th century are easy to access. Their iconic status also goes to show how much power a gifted speaker has to change peoples' minds.;
, Because anxiety tends to make people speak much faster than they normally would, you should be aware of your rate of speech. Make a conscious point of speaking slowly. If your speech is happening at a more manageable rate, it will be easier for you to feel like you're in control.


Speaking slowly does not mean speaking in a monotone. Just because you're taking your time doesn't mean you need to be boring. The best public speakers will keep a steady speaking pace and use that extra time to inject more expression into their act.

, Filler words include things such as ""like"" and ""um"". They are words that only exist in a live presentation because the speaker's mind need a second to catch up with the rest of the speech. Mishaps like this and other verbal slip-ups are most often the result of anxiety. While anxiety is totally natural and is to be expected, it's a good sign you need to slow down. A speaker speaking really slowly is better than one who is stuttering through important lines.


If you need a moment to recollect yourself in the middle of your speech, you should allow yourself the time to pause.While filler language only serves to detract from your presentation, a pause can be beneficial for the audience to digest what you've said so far as well.

, In the case of these especially important lines, it's crucial you bring added attention to them somehow. This can be done by saying them more slowly, more loudly, or repeating the same line twice. Your audience will immediately pick up on the tactic you used and will take extra care to remember that point.

, Although you may feel very anxious going into a speech, it may actually make things easier if you allow yourself the ability to connect emotionally with the topic and express yourself. Raising and lowering your voice to denote certain feelings can do a ton to engage an audience. As a general rule, people like to feel like they're being spoken to by a red-blooded human being. Acting like a robot may seem like a safe route if you're nervous about speaking, but you'll get a lot farther if you're candid with your audience.


Avoid a monotone delivery. This approach is common with people who put too much emphasis into a rote memorization of the speech lines, and didn't leave room for an organic quality.

, Much as with an emphasis technique on a given word, a well-placed silence can say a lot. Pauses are a good thing to place after a particularly heavy or important idea has been stated, or in between relatively unrelated points to serve as a sort of paragraph break. A pause also gives the audience a chance to show their appreciation. Even if you don't need the warmth, members of your audience will feel more confident in your abilities if they see other people in the crowd cheering you on.

, If an audience member has a question, it would be a wasted opportunity not to answer it. The audience will be impressed by your willingness to play off the books and interact seemingly spontaneously.


An audience won't interact with a speaker unless some stakes have already been raised. You have to get an audience interested in what you're talking about if you want them to respond actively.Trying to engage the audience yourself is always a risk. You can't control what an audience member will say, and you'll need to improvise a response to whatever they say. Worse still, getting no response from an audience will embarrass you as a presenter."

To better understand how to do this, let’s do the opposite and convert the binary number “01111010” into a letter to see how this table works. From top to bottom, fill in Column 1 with these numbers: 0 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1- 0 - 1 - 0. Now multiply each number in Column 1 with the corresponding number in Column 2: 0 x 128 = 0; 1 x 64 = 1; 1 x 32 = 32; etc. Write the answer to each in Column 3 and then add them all up: 0 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 122. Consult the ASCII chart, and you’ll find that a decimal value of 122 represents the letter “z.”
Now that you’ve converted a binary number into a letter, working your way backwards through the table to do the opposite should be less daunting. The fact that binary numbers are always either “1” or “0” makes the math easy. Each of the calculated values in Column 3 will always be either “0” or one of the default values that you’ve already written down in Column 2.

, Figure out which combination of the default values in Column 2 will add up to your letter's decimal value. For the letter ""a,"" whose decimal value is 97, look at the numbers you've already written down in Column 2 and see which add up to 97. Reading Column 2 from top to bottom, you’ll find the second number down is “64,” the third one down is ""32,"" and the eighth number is “1.” Add these together and you have 97., Write in “0” for the other rows. So, for the letter “a,” Column 3 should read from top to bottom: 0 - 64 - 32 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1., Using either “1” or “0,” enter the appropriate binary digit for each row. Remember: Column 1 x Column 2 = Column 3. If Column 3 is 0, enter “0” in Column 1. If Column 3 is the same number as Column 2, enter “1.” For instance, with the letter “a:” 0 x 128 = 0; 1 x 64 = 64, 1 x 32 = 32; etc. When read from top to bottom, Column 1 will now give you the binary number for that letter, so the binary number for “a” is 0 - 1 - 1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1."

Speak at a comfortable pace when you are not stuttering.,
Take all the time you need to get through a stutter.,
Keep your breath flowing.,
Practice fake stuttering.,
Lead up to an obstacle with an easier sound.,
Consult a speech therapist.,
Consider an electronic speech aid.",How to Control Stuttering2," There is no need to slow down, speed up, or otherwise alter your speech patterns while you are not actively stuttering. Even if you only speak without interruption for a few words at a time, speak them at your normal rate instead of trying to alter your speech patterns to avoid a stutter. It's more effective to relax and focus on what you're saying, rather than tense up and focus on how you say it.

, A major source of anxiety, and a major reason some people who stutter, is the feeling that you need to push through a word immediately. In fact, slowing down or pausing when you reach a stuttering obstacle can train you to speak more smoothly and with less anxiety., When you get hung-up on a word, your initial reaction will be to hold your breath and try to force the word out. This only worsens the stuttering. You need to focus on your breathing when speaking. When stuck in a block, pause, take a breath, and try again to say the word while gently breathing out. When you breath, your vocal chords relax and open up, allowing you to speak. This is easier said than done, but may become easier with practice.

, Paradoxically, you can help yourself manage your stutter by intentionally repeating difficult sounds. If you're anxious about the times when you can't control your speech, make the sounds deliberately to regain that control.Saying ""d. d. d. dog."" feels different than stuttering ""d-d-d-dog"". You're not trying to force your way through to the full word. You simply say the sound, making it clear and slow, then continue on to the word when you are ready. If you stutter again, repeat the sound until you feel ready to try again.


This can take a lot of practice to become comfortable with, especially if you are used to hiding your stutter instead of accepting it. Practice to yourself first if necessary, then work your way up to using this technique in public.

, A common experience among people who stutter is the feeling of a ""wall"" or obstacle that they know is coming up at a certain sound. Make this obstacle easier to surpass by leading up to it with a sound you have no problems with.For instance, making a nasal ""mmmm"" or ""nnnnn"" sound may help you ""sneak past"" a difficult hard consonant such as k or d. With enough practice, this may make you confident enough to say the difficult sounds normally, and just keep this trick in your bag in stressful situations.


If you have trouble with m and n sounds, you might try an ""ssss"" or ""aaa"" sound instead.

, Hiring a speech therapist to assist you can greatly reduce the effect stuttering has on your life. As with the other techniques described here, the exercises and advice a speech therapist may develop for you are intended to help you control your stuttering and minimize its impact on your speech and emotions, not eliminate it entirely. It may take a lot of practice to use these therapy techniques in the real world, but with patience and realistic explanations, you could improve your speech greatly.


If advice or exercise is not working for you, try to find another therapist. More old-fashioned therapists may advise slowing down your speech, or suggesting other exercises that many modern researchers and people who stutter find counter-productive., If your stuttering still causes you severe anxiety, you could purchase an electronic feedback device, a special device which allows you to hear yourself differently and with a delay. However, these devices can cost thousands of U.S. dollars, and are not a perfect solution. They can be tough to handle in loud environments, such as social gatherings or restaurants. Keep in mind that these devices are useful as an aid, not a cure, and it is still useful to practice anxiety reduction techniques and consult a speech therapist.

Don't ignore the stutter.,
Slow down your speech slightly.,
Provide a relaxed environment where the child can speak.,
Let the child finish his sentences.,
Learn about providing parental feedback.",How to Control Stuttering3," Many children develop a stutter in their first few years of speaking, but while many of them lose the stutter within a year or two, this does not mean you shouldn't help them through it. Speech therapists who are not up to date on modern research may recommend ""waiting until it goes away,"" but it is a far better idea to be conscious of the child's stutter and follow the steps below., If you tend to be a fast speaker, it's possible the child may be copying you by speaking too fast for her language abilities. Try slowing down your speech just a little, keeping a natural rhythm, and make sure you speak clearly., Give the child time to speak at a time and place where they are not being teased or interrupted. If the child is excited about telling you something, pause what you are doing and listen. Children who do not feel they have a place to speak may feel more anxiety over their stutter or become less willing to talk.

, Increase the confidence of the child by listening in a supportive way while he speaks. Don't try to finish his sentence for him, and don't walk away or interrupt when he gets stuck., A relatively modern type of stuttering treatment for children is a system of parental feedback, such as the Lidcombe Program developed in the 1980s. In these systems, a therapist trains the parent or caretaker to assist the child instead of enrolling the child in a therapy program directly. Even if you cannot find a suitable program near you, you can benefit from some of the tenets of this program.Talk to the child about the stutter only if the child wants to.
Compliment the child when they speak without stuttering or have a day with lower levels of stuttering. Do this once or twice a day at consistent times, rather than making a big deal of the stutter by repeating the praise often.
Rarely give negative feedback by pointing out the stutter. Don't do this when the child is upset or frustrated.

Keep a firm posture.A strong posture is one of the most telling signs of confidence.,
Allow yourself to express emotion through your face.If you're nervous, your face will freeze up.,
Stake a claim on your personal area.Whether you're speaking on stage or something more casual, chances are there's a larger physical space you could be occupying.,
Scan your eyes across everyone you're speaking to.Eye contact is essential if you want to foster a connection with the audience he's speaking to.,
Use gestures in tandem with what you're saying.Body language is a powerful tool on the stage, but it's only worth as much as it relates to the topic you're speaking about.,
Keep your movements controlled.Above all, you should keep every noticeable movement of your body under control when you are speaking.",How to Be a Great Speaker2," Suffice to say, it's a look you'll want to have whenever you're speaking publically. Keep your back straight, and your shoulders jutted outward. If you're someone who struggles with a slouched posture, it may take some time to reprogram yourself. However, after enough time doing it, you'll eventually do it without thinking.

, Words alone only go so far in communication. The best speeches are emotionally hard-hitting, and it's intensified when the same feelings are being mirrored by the speaker. Whether rehearsed or not, matching facial expressions will lend your speech with a great air of authenticity.

, Even if you're the most riveting speaker, there is going to be a part of your audience that wants to be engaged visually as well. Getting your audience's eyes to follow you as you stride across the stage will make your presentation (and topic) feel all that more dynamic.


If you're addressing the audience directly with someone, you should walk towards them on the stage. This creates an effect of urgency., This doesn't need to be a constant thing, and you don't need to make eye contact with each individual in the crowd. Instead, simply scanning your eyes around the your audience from side to side can instill a sense of interaction between the speaker and his attendees.

, Think of hand waves and gestures as exclamation marks in your speech. By using your body as an additional form of communication, you can ride home your point on multiple levels.

, Many people will fidget and squirm when they're nervous. This isn't the sort of impression you want to get across if you intend on a successful presentation. Your body language should not be left up to whim or chance. If you're not comfortable with public speaking enough yet to balance the vocal presentation with purposeful body language, it is preferable to keep yourself completely still. Rest assured, unconscious movements are going to work against your presentation.

Structure your speech with a beginning, middle and end.Speeches are like oral essays.,
Include a take-home message.,
Keep time in mind.While great speakers will keep their speaking pace relaxed and take cares not to speed up, you should respect the time of your audience.,
Rehearse your speech.Nothing great ever came about without hard work and practice.,
Thank your audience once the speech is over.Even if you're the one who is performing, your audience members are taking time out of their schedules to hear you speak about your topic.",How to Be a Great Speaker3," They tend to follow a similar format for the most part. If you're writing your speech yourself, you should try breaking it up into sections in order to better organize your points. Even if you haven't written the speech, it's a good idea to know what structural role each part represents. Generally speaking, virtually all speeches will have three parts:


An introduction. This is where you will introduce either yourself or the topic that needs to be discussed.
The main body and supporting points. This is where the details of your argument or discussion are fleshed out. This is by far the biggest part of a speech, and is analogous to all of the paragraphs in an essay between the first and last.
Closing statements and summary. At the end, the audience will be looking for some closure to signal the speech's end. Take this as an opportunity to note the widespread implications of the topic, as well as a to-the-point recap of the ideas you explored in the main body.

, No matter how complex the subject you're talking about is, there should be a line or two from your speech that will be instantly memorable for anyone who is hearing it. This could be the thesis, or central point of what you're trying to say. A take-home message should preferably take the form of an applied request.Telling your audience to do or reflect upon something on their own time will hopefully keep your audience attentive on your subject long after the presentation itself has ended.


Any messages of particular importance should be spoken more boldly, more slowly, or repeated.

, There is no need to have a half-hour speech where all of the same points could be covered in 20 minutes. It's much easier to revise the speech itself than to try to speed through sections of your speech. If you think your speech could be shorter, give it a run through and decide for yourself which lines could be done without.

, Rehearsing your speech is necessary if you want your audience to take something away from your presentation and take you seriously. Perform your speech in front of a mirror and pay attention to the way you look while you're speaking. It also helps to record yourself speaking. That way, you'll be able to see what you're doing right and wrong more clearly.


It's a good idea to give your speech a run-through in front of a friend or family member before going live. That way, the other person can offer you feedback from a fresh perspective.

, For this, they deserve some gratitude. Telling a crowd how much you appreciate lending their time to you will end your speech on a positive note of warmth.

Know how the base units work.,
Understand multiples of ten.,
Learn the common prefixes.,
Use the sentence “King Henry Doesn’t (Usually) Drink Chocolate Milk” to remember these prefixes.,
Draw a diagram to help you remember.,
Start thinking metrically.,
Stop converting to non-metric units.,
Understand the benefits.",How to Understand the Metric System," In the metric system, each form of measurement has one base unit. The most common base units are:length - meter (m)
volume - liter (l)
mass - gram (g)
An easy way to remember the common base units is the mnemonic:
""My Large Giraffe,” where the first letter of each word represents a base unit: m ⇒ meter, l ⇒ liter, and g ⇒ gram: My Large Giraffe.;
, The metric system is a decimal system, meaning every unit gets bigger or smaller by multiples of ten: Smaller measurements are divided by ten; larger measurements are multiplied by ten.


This means that if you move a decimal point within a measurement you change the unit size. For instance, if you move the decimal in 90,000 grams three places to the left, the equivalent measurement is expressed as 90 kilograms.
When converting a small unit to a larger unit, e.g., grams to kilograms, move the decimal to the left. (5,000 grams = 5 kilograms) When you are converting a larger unit to a smaller unit, e.g., kilograms to grams, move the decimal to the right. (5 kilograms = 5,000 grams)

, The common prefixes are milli-,centi-, deci-, deka-, hecto-, and kilo-. In the metric system, you look at the prefix to see the size of the unit, while the base unit tells you what is being measured. For instance, if you are measuring mass, the base is grams. If you want to know the size, then you look at the prefix. When the prefix kilo- is used, it means that the size is 1,000 time larger than the base. A kilogram is 1,000 times larger than the base of 1 gram. , In this sentence, the first letter of each word represents a prefix while “Usually” represents unit or the base unit you are using. This sentence represents the prefixes in this order: kilo-, hecto-, deka-, unit, deci-, centi-, and milli-.Every step in this sentence is either ten times or one-tenth as much as the steps besides it. So if you used 5 kilometers (King) in the sentence you would have: 5 kilometers = 50 hectometers = 500 dekameters= 5000 meters = 50,000 decimeters = 500,000 centimeters = 5,000,000 millimeters.

, Drawing a diagram will not only help you remember, but will help you to understand the relationships between prefixes and base units. Draw a horizontal line. Then, draw seven vertical lines across the horizontal line. Write the first letter of the prefixes above each vertical line: K, H, D, U, D, C, and M. Beneath the vertical line with “U,” write the first letter for the most common units: meters, liters, and grams.


On the diagram, prefixes to the left of the base unit represent larger numbers, and prefixes to the right of the base unit represent smaller numbers.
Each space between the vertical marks to the left or right of the base unit represents a decimal. For example, if the base equaled 6500 meters and you wanted to convert that measurement into kilometers, you would count the lines between “K” and “M.” There are three spaces between “K” and “M.” This means that you would place the decimal three spaces to the left of 6500 meters, which would be 6.5 kilometers.

, Try to use the metric system daily. Start measuring using the base units of the metric system. Learn how long a centimeter is, or how far away a meter is, or how much a gram weighs. It’s important to use the system in addition to memorizing the units and prefixes. Using the system reinforces your understanding.A great place to practice using the metric system is at the grocery store. Look at items that are measured in liters and grams. This will help you understand the quantities used in the metric system.
When you describe an object, use the metric system. Describe the weight in grams, the length in meters, and the volume in liters.
When you cook, measure using metric units. This will help you understand measuring items metrically.

, By only using the metric system, you force yourself to rely on the metric system. There are many benefits to this. You will do less math, including no more fractions, and you will have to remember far less.

, The metric system is used all over the world. The scientific community only uses the metric system. By knowing how it works, you will be able to navigate through many places and participate easier in discussions with people who only use the metric system.

Unlike the imperial system which uses many different terms for measurement - such as ounces, cups, pints, and quarts - the metric system uses one term, which makes it easier to remember and measure.There are only three countries that currently use the Imperial measurement system: Liberia, Myanmar, and the United States of America. Learning the metric system will help you navigate when you travel the world.

Locate a Watt to Amps table.,
Look for the power value (in Watts) that you want to convert.,
Find the corresponding current (in amps).",How to Convert Watts to Amps1," For specialized applications, such as home wiring or automotive wiring, there are specific voltage values. Since these values are always the same, it is possible to construct a chart that links a wattage value to an amperage value. These charts are based on the equations that link wattage, amperes (amps), and voltage in any circuit. If you plan to use this type of table, it can be found online. Just make sure that you are using a table with the correct fixed voltage.For example, a house usually uses 120V AC (in the United States) and a car generally uses 12V DC.
You can use an online amperage calculator to make things even simpler.;
, Once you have your chart, you should skim it to find the value you are looking for. These types of charts usually have several rows and columns. There will be a column labeled “Power” or “Watts.” Start there and locate the exact power of the circuit in you are dealing with., When you have located your Watt measurement in the Power column, follow that same row to the “Current” or “Amps” column. There may be several columns on the table, so be sure to read the column titles and ensure that you get the correct value. Once you find the amp column, double check the value to make sure it is in the same row as your Watt value."

Identify the part of the number that you're going to convert.,
Type the number of tenths of a pound into your calculator.,
Multiply that number by 16.,
Write your original number in pounds and ounces.",How to Convert Tenths of a Pound to Ounces1," Your starting point should be a number like 5.75 pounds. The .75 denotes the tenths of a pound, so that's the part that you would be converting. Note that the number before the decimal, the 5, is your total number of whole pounds.;
, Make sure that you include the decimal. It will probably automatically add a zero, in which case your number will look something like 0.75 pounds.

, There are 16 ounces in every pound, so to convert from tenths of a pound to ounces, you just multiply by 16. The answer will be your total number of ounces.


0.75 times 16 ounces equals 12 ounces.
Note that to reverse this process, you simply have to divide by 16 rather than multiplying. So, if your original quantity is 5 pounds, 12 ounces, you could just divide 12 by 16 to get 0.75 pounds. Then add the 5 back in, and 5 + 0.75 equals a total of 5.75 pounds.

, The number of whole pounds from your original number is all the numbers to the left of the decimal. The number of ounces is the answer that you got when you multiplied the tenths of a pound by 16.


For the example of 5.75 pounds, the answer would be written 5 pounds, 12 ounces.

Determine the number of meters in a yard.",How to Convert Yards to Meters2," There are 0.9144 meters in every yard. Simply multiply that number by the number of yards to get the number of meters. The formula to convert yards to meters is: m=yd X 0.9144.


This calculation was determined in 1958 by the United States and Commonwealth countries, such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.If you are trying to convert, say, 100 yards to meters, you would simply multiple 0.9144 by 100 (answer: 91.44 meters). The formula to calculate 2 yards would be 2 X .09144 meter = 1.8288 meter, and so on. ;
"
"
Use division instead to do the reverse conversion.",How to Convert Yards to Meters3," To convert meters to yards, use division. The formula is yd = m divided by 0.9144.


For example, The formula to convert 50 meters to yards would be 50m divided by 0.9144 = 54.68066492.
A yard was originally thought to be the average length of a person’s stride. It’s a unit of length that equals three feet. You will need to understand what a meter is to determine other units of measurement, such as the newton."

Use an online calculator.,
Use a yard-to-meter conversion chart.",How to Convert Yards to Meters4," Many websites allow you to put in yards to determine meters (or the reverse). You will sometimes see yard abbreviated as “yd” and meter as “m.”Some people need to convert swim times between yards and meters for swim meets. There are also online calculators designed to help you do this. Some of them even allow you to enter an altitude adjustment.They are easy to use and can also generally be used to determine the reverse too. You simply input the number of yards, and watch as the conversion is calculated., If you don’t want to do the multiplication yourself, or use an online calculator, you can easily find yard-to-meter conversion charts online.These charts generally list the yard in one column, and the corresponding meters in the next column.

Find the circuit’s power.,
Find the voltage.,
Set up the equation.,
Solve for current.",How to Convert Watts to Amps2," Look for a label on the circuit you are working with. The power is measured in watts. This value measures the amount of energy used or made in a given amount of time. For example 1 Watt = 1 Joule/ 1 second. This value is necessary to calculate the current, measured in amperes (amps for short). , Voltage is the electrical potential of a circuit and should also be listed on a label along with power. It is created because one side of the circuit is electron dense and the other side is electron poor. This causes an electric field (the voltage) to exist between the two points. This voltage causes current to flow through the circuit in an attempt to discharge the voltage (equalize the charges from one side to the other). You need to know the magnitude of voltage to calculate the current, or amps. , For a DC circuit, the equation is very straight forward. Watts are equal to amps times volts. Therefore, dividing Watts by volts will allow you to calculate amps.Amps = Watts/Volts

, Once you have set up the equation, you can solve for amps. Carry out the division to get the magnitude of the amps. Check your units to make sure that you end up with coulombs per second. 1 Amp = 1 Coulomb / Second.A coulomb is the SI unit for electric charge and is defined as the amount of charge moved in one second by a constant current of one amp.

"
"
Know the power factor.,
Use the single phase equation.,
Solve for current.",How to Convert Watts to Amps3," The power factor in a circuit is the ratio of true power to the apparent power supplied to the system. The apparent power is always greater than or equal to the true power, and thus the power factor will have values from 0 to 1. Look for the power factor posted on the circuit label or schematic., The single phase AC power equation that relates volts, amps, and watts is similar to the equation used for DC power. The difference is the use of the power factor.Amps = Watts / (PF X Volts) where the power factor (PF) is a unitless value.

, Once you have plugged in the values for watts, volts, and power factor, you can simply solve for amps. You should come up with the units of coulombs per second. If you do not, you set up your equation incorrectly and should redo your work.Solving for three phase AC power has more variables than single phase. You will have to decide whether you are using line to line or line to neutral voltage to calculate amps with three phase.

Write down the number you want to convert.,
Underline all the numbers to the left of the decimal point.,
Identify the tenths of a pound.,
Set up your equation.,
Multiply the equation.,
Combine your total number of whole pounds and your total number of ounces.",How to Convert Tenths of a Pound to Ounces2," For this method, your number should include decimals. For example, 4.8125 pounds or 0.25 pounds.

, This number tells you how many whole pounds you have.


If you have 4.8125 pounds, 4 is left of the decimal point, so you'll underline the 4.
If you have a bigger number, as with 17.5 pounds, underline all of the digits before the decimal point. In this case, you'd underline 17.
If the number to the left of the decimal is zero, as with 0.25 pounds, your final answer will only include ounces. You can say ""zero pounds"" if you want, but it's implied if you just list the ounces.

, This should include all of the numbers that you didn't underline in the last step. In other words, it's all the numbers to the right of the decimal point.


For 4.8125 pounds, the tenths are 0.8125.
For 17.5 pounds, the tenths are 0.5.
For 0.25 pounds, the tenths are 0.25

, First, you need to know that there are 16 ounces in every pound. So your equation will be 16 times the total tenths of a pound, which is the number you identified in the previous step., If the answer has decimal places, you can round it to the nearest whole number. Generally, you round down if the decimal is .4 or lower, and round up if the decimal is .5 or higher.16 x 0.8125 pounds = 13 ounces
16 x 0.437 pounds = 6.992 ounces. We can round that to 7 ounces, because 0.9 is higher than 0.5, so we round up.
16 x 0.7 pounds = 11.2 ounces. We can round 11.2 to 11 ounces, because 0.2 is lower than 0.4, so we round down.

, Generally, the larger measure is listed first, so you'll say pounds first, and then the ounces.


4.8125 pounds becomes 4 pounds, 13 ounces.
17.5 pounds becomes 17 pounds, 8 ounces.
0.25 pounds becomes 4 ounces.

"
"
Write down the number you want to convert.,
Circle the number of whole pounds.,
Identify the number of ounces.,
Set up your equation.,
Divide to solve the equation.,
Now combine your previous answers for the number of whole pounds and the converted tenths of a pound.",How to Convert Tenths of a Pound to Ounces3," For this method, your number should begin written as pounds and ounces. For example, 7 pounds, 2 ounces.

, It should be fairly clear from how you wrote the measurement in step 1, but it's just the number of pounds. When you're done with the conversion, this number will be what you write first, to the left of the decimal point.


For 7 pounds, 2 ounces, you would circle the 7.
For 15 pounds, 6 ounces, you would circle the 15.
If your original measurement is only written in ounces, and the total number of ounces is less than 16, the number of whole pounds will just be zero. For example, 13 ounces could be written 0 pounds, 13 ounces.
If your original measurement is just written in ounces, and the total number of ounces is greater than 16, then the the total number of pounds will be included as all the numbers to the left of the decimal point in your answer at step 5. For example, 100 ounces divided by 16 equals 6.25 pounds. We don't have to look at the original measurement to find the total pounds, because it's included before the decimal point in the answer.

, Again, this should be clear from how you've written the measurement in step 1.


If you have 7 pounds, 2 ounces, then there are 2 ounces.

, There are 16 ounces in every pound. To find your tenths of a pound, you want to divide your total number of ounces by 16. This should give you all the numbers that come after the decimal point., If you want, you can round so that you have fewer numbers after the decimal. The answer will be less precise, but simpler. To round, just choose the number you want to end with, then look at the next digit. If it's 4 or less, the first number stays the same. If it's 5 or more, the first number rounds up by 1.


2 ounces divided by 16 equals .125 pounds. If you wanted to round it to the tenths place, which is the number right after the decimal point, you would look at the next number. Here, the next number is 2, and 2 is less than 4, so we would round to .1 pounds.
100 ounces divided by 16 equals 6.25 pounds. In this case, you not only get your tenths of a pound, you also get the total number of whole pounds, which is the number before the decimal.

Say you want to round 6.25 pounds to the tenths place. 5 is the next number, and it is equal to or greater than 5, so you would round up. The rounded answer would be 6.3 pounds.



, This number is your final answer.


7 pounds, 2 ounces can be written as 7.125 pounds.
100 ounces is 6.25 pounds.

Use simple addition and subtraction to estimate a percentage quickly.,
Move the decimal one place to the left to find 10% instantly.,
Add and subtract your 10% estimation to get the percentage you want.,
Continue manipulating your 10% to estimate other percentages.",How to Convert to Percentage1," This is most helpful when figuring out tips, or any other time you might not have a calculator available. Percentages can be added and subtracted as long as they are percentages of the same thing (ie, 5% of a 15lb turkey is cannot be added to 20% of a 5lb turkey). This trick makes it easy to guess simple percentages.For example, say you want to leave a 20% tip with your lunch bill, which is $23.50. With a few simple tricks, you can get an estimate of a 20% tip with relative ease.;
, This is the easiest way to get rough percentages without a calculator. To do it, simply slide the decimal over one place to the left. So 10% of $23.50 is $2.35. Remember, there is always a decimal place at the end of a number, so 25 could also be thought of as 25.00.


10% of 100 is 10.
10% if 35.59305 is 3.559305
10% of 6.2 is 0.62, For example, you need to tip 20% on your bill of $23.50, not just 10%. However, since 20% is simply twice as much as 10%, you can easily find the right amount by doubling what you found for 10%. Therefore:


10% of $23.50 = $2.35
20% = 10% + 10%
20% = $2.35 + $2.35
A 20% tip on a $23.50 meal = $4.70

This works because, at their core, percentages are fractions. 10% = 10/100ths. So, if you added up 10 10% amounts, you would eventually get 100%. If you add two 10% amounts you get 20%, and so on up.

, Once you understand these basics, you can use them to find even more percentages. For example, your waiter might have been rude and unhelpful, and you only want to tip them 15%. Break this down into smaller parts so that 15% = 10% + 5%. Since 5 is half of 10, you can find it easily by cutting your estimate in half. So 15% really equals $2.35 + $1.17, or a $3.52 tip. Other tricks include:


To get 1% of something, move the decimal to the left 2 places. So 1% of 23.50 would equal .235.
25% of a number is always the number divided by 4.
50% of a number is always the number cut in half.
33% of a number is always the number divided by 3."

Look up the current currency exchange rate, which changes by the hour.,
Multiply the amount in pounds by the conversion rate to convert it to dollars.,
Use an online currency calculator to convert currency perfectly at any hour.,
Make sure the online calculator or converter is current with up-to-date exchange rates.,
Convert back to pounds by simply dividing the exchange rate instead of multiplying it.,
Know that currency rates fluctuate based on global demand for that currency.",How to Convert the British Pound to Dollars1," The value of a currency depends on the stock exchange rate at any given time. Real-time quotes can be found on the NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX stock exchanges or other financial websites, but the easiest way to see this is by simply Googling ""Convert dollars to pounds."" No matter where you find it, look up the current ""dollars to pounds"" exchange rate. It should look something like this:

 1 GDP = 1.4635 USD (5/24/16, 2:00PM rate)


GDP Stands for Great British Pound. The symbol is ""£.""


USD Stands for United States Dollar. The symbol is ""$."";
, This is all you have to do to convert currencies. Think of it this way -- if 1GDP=1.4USD{\displaystyle 1GDP=1.4USD}, then 2GDP=2.8USD{\displaystyle 2GDP=2.8USD}, or 1.4∗2.{\displaystyle 1.4*2.} So, for every pound, you end up with an extra 1.4 USD. So just multiply the amount in pounds by the conversion rate to get your number of dollars. Say you want to buy a £35 sweater in London's Heathrow Airport. In dollars, you'd be spending:


Conversion rate:  1 GDP = 1.4635 USD

£35 = ______ USD.

35 * 1.4635


£35 = $51.22


, Remember that currency rates can change by the minute, meaning your hand conversion may not be useful shortly after you find it. This is why the quickest and easiest method to use in converting currency is one of the free online converters. Many phones offer apps as well that are capable of keeping up with changing rates.

 Open your web browser. Clear the address line and type ""currency converter."" Several websites for currency conversion will appear.

Enter or click on British pound in the ""from"" column and enter or click on USD or dollar in the ""to"" field.

 Enter the amount of currency you want to convert from pounds to dollars.

Click ""convert"" to get a perfect representation., There should be a date on the website to indicate the last update. If this is not within 24 hours of your current date, then don't use the site unless you only need rough estimates. That said, sites like the NYSE will have to-the-minute rates, and should be trusted before any 3rd party sites.
, If you want to change pounds back to dollars, simply divide by the exchange rate. Make sure, however, that you're using the GDP → USD conversion rate, and not the USD → GDP rate. The former number tells you how many dollars one pound is worth, the later tells you how many pounds one dollar is worth. Think of it as dollars per pound vs. pounds per dollar -- they are based on the same information, but they are different numbers!

If you have dollars and want to convert to pounds, you can multiply the dollars by the USD → GDP conversion rate, OR divide it by the GDP → USD conversion rate. 


, Currency prices are always in flux. This is because currency, like anything else, is a tradable good. Image a firm in London wants to sell to the US stores. In order to buy their goods, the US store must purchase the goods with pounds, then sell them for US dollar. This means that pounds are flowing out of England and being converted to other money, making the pounds left in England a more valuable good that the US has demand for. There are fewer pounds now, so the value of each pound goes up. Meanwhile, the US market, which spent pounds to get dollars, sees the USD decrease in value, since more of the wealth is in Dollars, giving them less demand. A high demand for a currency usually means that currency increases value.Other things that affect currency include:

Concerns about the safety/health of the country's market (which is why a war-torn country has a low-value currency).

Amount of business interest or growth in a market.

Tourism."

Compare your two units.,
Look up the conversion.,
Write the conversion as a fraction.,
Write a multiplication problem with your original number and the fraction.,
Solve the multiplication problem.,
Cancel units that appear on top and bottom.,
Correct mistakes.",How to Convert Units1," The two units must measure the same thing. For example, in the problem ""convert 2 inches into centimeters,"" both inches and centimeters measure length. If your units measure two different things (like length and weight), you can't convert between them.


People often get confused about length, area, and volume, which are three different things. Remember that ""square"" or ""2"" means area, and ""cubic"" or ""3"" means volume.
You can also write this example as 2 in. = ? cm.;
, Before you can do the math, you need to know how much larger one unit is than the other. If the conversion you find has many decimal places, round to the nearest significant digit. If you don't know what a significant digit is, round to the second or third digit.


For example, if you need to convert 2 inches to centimeters, you need to know that 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters.

, Write this conversion as a fraction, including units. Put the unit you start with on bottom (the denominator), and the unit you're converting to on top (the numerator).For example, write 2.54 cm/1 in.. You can read this as ""2.54 centimeters per inch"".

, Multiplying these two numbers together will give you your answer. To start this, write out the multiplication problem, with units after each value.


2 in. x 2.54 cm/1 in. = ?

, It's important to keep track of your units while you do this. Every unit in the equation should still be there during each step.


2 in. x 2.54 cm/1 in.
= (2 in x 2.54 cm)/1 in.

= (5.08 in. x cm.)/ in.


, If a unit is on the top and bottom of the fraction, cross it out. Whatever you're left with should be your answer.



(5.08 in. x cm.)/ in.

= 5.08 cm.

, If your units don't cancel, start over and try again. You might have put the wrong half of the fraction on top.


For example, if you multiplied 2 inch. x (1 in. / 2.54 cm), your answer will have units of ""in. x in. / cm,"" which doesn't make any sense. You realize the inches will cancel if you flip the fraction, so you try again with 2 inch x (2.54 cm / 1 in.).

Multiply square meters by 10.76.,
Multiply square feet by 0.093.,
Understand what this means.,
See if your answer makes sense.,
Check on an online calculator.",How to Convert Square Meters to Square Feet and Vice Versa1," One square meter (m2) is about equal to 10.76 square feet (ft2). To convert from m2 to ft2, multiply the number of square meters by 10.76. For example:


5 square meters
= 5 m2 x 10.76 ft2/m2
= 5 x 10.76 ft2
= 53.8 ft2

Notice that the m2 units on top and bottom cancel out, leaving only ft2 in the final answer: 5 m2 x 10.76 ft2/m2
;
, One square foot is roughly equal to 0.093 square meters. To convert square feet to square meters, just multiply by 0.093:


400 square feet
= 400 ft2 x 0.093 m2/ft2
= 37.2 square meters.

, Square meters and square feet are two ways to measure the same thing: area. If you cut out a square of paper one meter long and one meter wide, it has an area of one square meter. Similarly, a square of paper one foot long and one foot wide has an area of one square foot. The conversion ""1 square meter = 10.76 square feet"" means that 10.76 of your paper ""square feet"" would fit over one paper square meter.


If you have trouble visualizing the decimal, picture 10 square feet fitting over one square meter, with a little space left over. The extra space has an area of 0.76 square feet.

, It's easy to accidentally use the wrong formula, especially if you have a lot of conversions to do. After you find your answer, compare it to your original measurement to see if you made a mistake:If you converted from square feet to square meters, your answer should be smaller than the original amount.
If you converted from square meters to square feet, your answer should be larger than the original amount.

, These aren't the easiest numbers to memorize, but you can easily look them up online if you forget. It might even be enough to enter something like ""convert 8 square meters to square feet"" into a search engine directly to get the answer.


This is also more accurate than multiplying by hand, since it uses more precise values. (For instance, 1 square foot = 0.092903 square meters, or 1 square meter = 10.7639 square feet.) Most of the time, though, multiplying by hand will give you a ""close enough"" answer.

Know that percentages are just fractions out of 100.,
Create a fraction from word problems.,
Check if the denominator can be easily changed to 100 through multiplication or division.,
Divide the top number by the bottom if you cannot easily convert the fraction.,
Multiply your answer by 100 to convert the fraction into a decimal.,
Try another example to test your conversion skills.",How to Convert to Percentage2," All a percentage is a simple way to display a fraction whose bottom number (known as the denominator) is 100. A percentage tells you how many things you would have if you had 100 total. For example, say 25% of your apple harvest is always spoiled. That means for every 100 apples you harvest, 25 of them will be spoiled, or 25/100. Converting fractions allows you to find percentages in the real world, such as what percentage of apples is spoiled if you get 450 bad apples out of 2,500.


If your fraction already has a denominator of 100, like 25/100, the top number is the percentage.1% means that there is ""1 per every 100."", Sometimes you are not given the fraction, and you need to make it yourself. The hardest part here is figuring out which number goes on top, and which on bottom. The bottom number is always your ""whole amount."" It is your total apple harvest, the amount on the restaurant bill, the number of slices of pie, etc. This is the number you're getting a percentage of. The following examples show how to set up fractions:


Jaime has 4,000 songs. If 500 of them are by the Grateful Dead, what percentage of his music is by the San Francisco jam legends?

You want the percentage of Dead songs out of 4,000 total songs. The fraction would be 500/4,000.


Sally puts $1,000 into a stock. 3 months later, she returns and sees that it has grown to $1,342. What was her percentage of growth?

Because you are trying to find the percentage of 1,000 that grew bigger, your fractions is 1,342/1,000.



, If you can ""make"" the bottom number 100, you can simply take the top number as your percentage, and the conversion is done. Remember, however, that anything you do to the bottom of a fraction needs to be done to the top as well. For example:



Problem: Convert 3/25 to a percentage.
25 is easily turned into 100, since 4x25 = 100.
Multiply both the top and bottom by 4 to rearrange the fraction into 12/100

4 x 3 = 12.
4 x 25 = 100.


The top number is your percentage. Here 3/25 = 12/100 = 12%


, If the bottom number is not easily converted to 100, like in the fraction 16/64, then divide the top number by the bottom. Here, 16 divided by 64 =.25


This number is commonly a decimal, but it can be a larger number if the top of the fraction is bigger than the bottom.

, In the previous example 16/64 = .25. To finish converting 16/64 into a fraction, multiply .25 by 100 by moving the decimal over two places to the right. Therefore, 16/64 = 25%.


This is how you know the percentage when the denominator is 100, since 12/100 multiplied by 100 equals 12.
A decimal point represents, in essence, the percentage of ""one."" For each .1 you add you get closer to making ""a single 1"" (.9 + .1 = 1.0) This is why moving the decimal works to turn decimals into percentages, because your find how many smaller parts make up the whole ""one"" that you are studying, such as ""one"" harvest of 2,566 apples.

, The recommended daily caloric intake is 2000 calories. You eat this much today, but then go out for cake and ice cream later and add an extra 1500 calories to your day. What percentage of the recommended daily calories did you eat today?


Find your total calories.

Here, it is 2000 + 1500, or 3500 calories.


Create a fraction.

Think of the ""whole."" 1 full days worth of calories is 2000. Therefore, you're looking for the percentage of 2000 calories you ate. Your fraction would be 3500/2000.


Divide your total calories (3500) by the recommended amount of calories (2000).

3500 ÷ 2000 = 1.75


Multiply this number by 100 to get the percentage.

1.75 x 100 = 175



You ate 175% of the recommended daily calories."

Know that you cannot use percentages to do any meaningful math.,
Remove the % sign and shift the decimal two places to the left.,
Multiply the decimal by your total amount.,
Reverse this equation to check your answer.,
Use examples to practice.",How to Convert to Percentage3," The number 25% is mostly shorthand -- an easy way for people to compare two numbers, but it cannot be used to do much. For example, saying that 13% of your 2,566 apples are spoiled does not tell you exactly how many of them went bad, it just says that 13 out of every 100 apples is no good. To find the exact number of bad apples, you'll need to convert everything back.

, This conversion will give you a number, usually a decimal, that can be used to do your math. For example, if 13% of your apples went bad, you'd end up with .13 here.


Moving the decimal 2 places to the left is the same thing as dividing by 100.

, Here, you're looking for 13% of 2,566 apples. To get it, simply multiply .13 times 2,566. The resulting number is exactly how many apples went bad, roughly 333.58.

, To make sure you did the math right, divide your number of apples by .13. Your final answer should be 2,566. This is also how you find how many total objects you have based on a percentage. For example:


Jimmy has 20% of all the marbles in class. He has 10 marbles. How many marbles does the class have in total?

20% → .20
10 divided by .20 = 50.

The class has 50 marbles total., You find a blouse that you love for $50, but it is on sale today, 15% off. How much will the blouse cost, total?


Convert 15% into a decimal.

15% → .15, or 15/100.


Multiply this decimal by $50.

.15 times 50 = $7.50.


Subtract the discount from the initial price.

$50 - $7.50 = $42.50.


You can buy the blouse for $42.50.

Find 10% of the price in pounds to get a simple, easily added percentage.,
Add the amount found in the decimal to the amount found in the whole number to finish your estimate.",How to Convert the British Pound to Dollars2," The more decimals in your rate, the more precise your conversion will be. However, if you just need to make an estimation, you can use much simpler rates, like 1 GDP = 1.45 USD, to get a good idea of the conversion.
, For now, ignore the number after the decimal, and instead multiply the pounds by the whole number. So, if you're buying a £20 hat, and the exchange rate is 1.456042, start by multiplying 20 * 1. This is almost always 1 or 0 since the USD and GBP don't often vary by that much.


Problem: Estimate Conversion of £20 into USD using an exchange rate of 1.456042


Step 1: Multiply whole number of conversion rate by price in GDP.

£20 * 1 = £20.




, If you see a hat for £20 and want to know what it will cost you in dollars, you'll likely struggle to multiply 20 by 1.456042. But it will be much easier to multiply by 20 by 1.5, even if you know the final estimate will be a little higher than the actual answer. Note that the smaller your rounding, the more precise the answer will be.


Problem: Estimate Conversion of £20 into USD using an exchange rate of 1.456042


Step 1: Multiply whole number of conversion rate by price in GDP.

£20 * 1 = £20.




Step 2: Round conversion rate to manageable number.

1.456042 → 1.5.




, This is really easy to do, though it seems complex. First, note that 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% = 50%. Second, remember that .1 is the same thing as 10%, meaning .5 is the same thing as 50%. So, if you need to find a tricky conversion decimal, simply find 10% and add it together until you reach the right percentage. And 10% is easy to find -- simply move the decimal one place to the left!


Problem: Estimate Conversion of £20 into USD using an exchange rate of 1.456042


Step 1: Multiply whole number of conversion rate by price in GDP.

£20 * 1 = £20.




Step 2: Round conversion rate to manageable number.

1.456042 → 1.5.




Step 3: Find 10% of the price in pounds and add it until it matches your decimal.

£20 * 10% = £2

£2 * 5 = £10




, Since the whole number is usually 1, this means you simply find 10%, add as many as needed to match the decimal in the conversion rate, and add this to the amount in pounds. So, to finish the example problem:


Problem: Estimate Conversion of £20 into USD using an exchange rate of 1.456042


Step 1: Multiply whole number of conversion rate by price in GDP.

£20 * 1 = £20.




Step 2: Round conversion rate to manageable number.

1.456042 → 1.5.




Step 3: Find 10% of the price in pounds and add it until it matches your decimal.

£20 * 10% = £2

£2 * 5 = £10




Step 4: Add together your whole number and your decimal conversions:


Whole: £20


Decimal: £10


Estimated Amount: £30 The actual conversion (using this rate) would be $29.12, meaning this was a useful estimation.

Write down your problem.,
Find the conversion for one unit.,
Multiply your number by the conversion fraction.,
Cancel out your units.,
Multiply with another conversion fraction the same way.,
Cancel units.,
Repeat until the conversion is done.",How to Convert Units2," Figure out exactly what the problem is asking, and write it as a math problem. Here's an example:


If a bicycle is moving 10 miles per hour, how many feet does it travel in one minute?
Write this as ""10 miles / hour = ? feet / minute"" or ""10 miles / h = ? ft / min"".

, Remember, you can only convert between two units that measure the same thing. In our example, we have units that measure length (miles and feet), and units that measure time (hours and minutes). Start with one pair and find the conversion between them.


For example, 1 mile = 5,280 feet.


, Just as describe in the section above, we can write the conversion as a fraction to cancel out units. Make sure to include every unit in your calculations.


10 miles / h) x 5280 ft / mile
= 52800 miles x ft / h x miles

, One of your units should be on the top and the bottom, so you can cancel them. You aren't done yet, but you're getting closer.


52800 miles x ft / h x miles
= 52800 ft / h

, Choose a unit that hasn't been converted, and write down the conversion as a fraction. Remember to arrange the fraction so the units will cancel out during multiplication.


In our example, we still need to convert hours to minutes. 1 hour = 60 minutes.
Right now, we have 52800 ft / h. Since hours (h) is on the bottom, we want our new fraction to have hours on top: 1 hour / 60 minutes.
52800 ft / h x 1 h / 60 min
= 880 ft x h / h x min


, Another unit should cancel out, just as it did before.


880 ft x h / h x min
= 880 ft / min


, If your answer is in the units you were trying to convert to, you're done with the problem. If you're not there yet, convert another unit with the same method.


Once you're used to this method, you can write all the conversions on one line.For example, we could solve our example problem like this:
10 miles/h x 5280 ft/mile x 1 h/60 min
=10 miles/h x 5280 ft/mile x 1 h/60 min

= 10 x 5280 ft x 1/60 min

= 880 ft / min.

Understand the metric system.,
Learn the prefixes.,
Use the prefixes in conversion.,
Move the decimal point instead of doing calculations.,
Practice more difficult problems.,
Check your answer.",How to Convert Units3," The metric system, also called the decimal system, is designed for easy conversion. To convert from one metric unit to another, you only have to work with round numbers: 10, 100, 1000, and so on.

, Metric unit of measurements use prefixes to show how big or small the measurement is. Here's an example with units of weight, but all other metric units use the same prefixes.The prefixes below are in italics, but you can do most conversions with just the most common one, in bold.



kilogram = 1000 grams

hectogram = 100 grams

dekagram = 10 grams
gram = 1 gram

decigram = 0.1 grams (one tenth)

centigram = 0.01 grams (one hundredth)

milligram = 0.001 grams (one thousandth)

, If you know the prefixes, you don't need to look up the conversion every time you need to convert. The prefixes already tell you the conversion. Here are a couple examples:


To convert from kilometers to meters: kilo means 1000, so 1 kilometer = 1000 meters.
To convert from grams to milligrams: milli means .001, so 1 milligram = .001 gram.

, The best part about metric conversion is skipping all the calculations. Multiplying a number by 10 is the same as moving the decimal point to the right. Dividing a number by 10 is the same as moving the decimal point to the left. Here's an example of how to use this:


Problem: convert 65.24 kilograms to grams.
1 kilogram = 1000 grams. Count the number of zeroes: three. That means we multiply by 10 three times, or just move the decimal three spaces to the right.
65.24 x 10 = 652.4 (multiplied once)

652.4 x 10 = 6524 (twice)

6524 x 10 = 65240 (three times)

The answer is 65240 grams.

, It gets a little trickier when both the units you're converting between have prefixes. The easiest way to solve this is to convert to the base unit (no prefix) first, then convert to the final unit. Here's an example:


Problem: convert 793 milliliters to dekaliters.
1 milliliter = 0.001 liters. There are three zeroes, so we move the decimal point three to the left. (Remember, move left when dividing.)
793 milliliters = 0.793 liters
10 liters = 1 dekaliter, so 1 liter = 0.1 dekaliters. There is one zero, so move the decimal point one to the left.
0.793 liters = 0.0793 dekaliters.

, The mistake that's easiest to make is multiplying instead of dividing, or vice versa. When you get your final answer, check that it makes sense:


If you converted to a larger unit, your number should get smaller. (Just like 12 inches converts to 1 foot.)
If you converted to a smaller unit, your number should get larger. (Just like 1 foot converts to 12 inches.)
If your result doesn't match this, check your work.

Remember that length and area are different.,
Learn to convert feet to meters.,
Convert meters to feet.,
Convert a square meter by using the length conversion twice.",How to Convert Square Meters to Square Feet and Vice Versa2," One common mistake is confusing units of length (feet or meters) with units of area (square feet or square meters). These are different units, and have different conversion formulas. If you're ever confused about which one to use, remember this:


Length uses ""one dimensional"" units because it only has one measurement: put the ruler down once and you're done.
Area uses ""two dimensional"" units because you need to measure twice. For instance, a square has both length and width, and you need to multiply them together to find the area.

, If you have a length measurement in feet, you can only convert it to meters. (You cannot convert it to a square meter, which is a unit of area.) To convert between feet and meters, multiply the measurement in feet by 0.305.


For example, a snake that is 2 feet long is (2 ft) x (0.305 m / ft) = 0.61 meters long.

, To convert the other way around, multiply the length in meters by 3.28:


A 4 meter tall wall is (4 m) x (3.28 ft / m) = 13.12 ft. high.

, There aren't separate length and area conversions just to confuse you. Just as you multiply two length measurements to find the area of a square, you can multiply by the length conversion twice to turn it into an area conversion.Walk through it with this example:


Let's say you want to convert one square meter into square feet. You've forgotten this area conversion, but you remember the one for length: 1 meter = 0.305 feet.
Draw a square and label the length and width 1 meter each.
Since 1 meter = 0.305 ft, you can cross out both meter measurements and write ""0.305 ft"" instead.
To find the area of this square, multiply the length and width: 0.305 ft x 0.305 ft = 0.093 ft2.
Notice that this is the same as the area conversion: 1 square meter = 0.093 square feet.

Insert the value in pounds you're converting into the blank space below.,
Perform the calculation to get the end result in kilograms.",How to Convert Pounds to Kilograms1," This will be represented by the ""lb"" in the formula. You will use this formula to determine the amount of kilograms. One kilogram is equal to 2.2046226218 pounds (from here on this will be shortened to 2.2).

;
, You will first divide 1 kg by 2.2 lbs and then multiply that number by the value you in pounds you are trying to convert.


Example: Say you want to convert 4 pounds into kilograms. You would first divide 1 kg by 2.2 lbs which equals .45. Then multiply .45 by 4 which equals 1.81. Therefore 4 pounds equals 1.81 kilograms.

This prefix means ""1000"" (one thousand). Kilo- is abbreviated as ""k-"", so a kilogram is ""kg"" and a kilometre is ""km"".

, Since kilo- means 1 000, one kilometre (km) is equal to 1000 metres (m). Multiply the number of kilometres by 1 000 to get the same measurement in metres.

For example, 75 kilometres = 75km∗1 000mkm{\displaystyle 75km*1\ 000{\frac {m}{km}}} = 75 000 metres.

To make sure you've set up the conversion correctly, try reading it in plain English: 1000mkm{\displaystyle 1000{\frac {m}{km}}} means ""1 000 metres per kilometre"".


, The base unit does not make any difference in this calculation. As long as you know the definition of the prefix, you can use the same math to convert between it and the base unit. Here are a couple examples:

75 kilograms (kg) = 75kg∗1 000gkg{\displaystyle 75kg*1\ 000{\frac {g}{kg}}} = 75 000 grams (g).

14 kilowatts (kW) = 14kW∗1 000WkW{\displaystyle 14kW*1\ 000{\frac {W}{kW}}} = 14 000 watts (W).


, Another common prefix is mega-, which means one million (1 000 000) and is abbreviated M. Even larger units use the prefix giga-, which means one billion (1 000 000 000) and is abbreviated G.Here are a couple conversions that use these prefixes:

A 3 megawatt (MW) factory produces 3MW∗1 000 000WMW{\displaystyle 3MW*1\ 000\ 000{\frac {W}{MW}}} = 3 000 000 watts (W) of power.

A 2 gigajoule (GJ) explosion releases 2GJ∗1 000 000 000JGJ{\displaystyle 2GJ*1\ 000\ 000\ 000{\frac {J}{GJ}}} = 2 000 000 000 joules (J) of energy.


, To convert to a larger unit of measurement, you'll divide by the conversion factor instead of multiplying. As always, you're less likely to make a mistake if you include the units at each point in your calculation:

65 300 metres is equal to 65 300m∗1 km1 000m{\displaystyle 65\ 300m*{\frac {1\ km}{1\ 000m}}} = 65.3 kilometres.


, What if you want to measure a length shorter than one meter, or the volume of a cup smaller than one litre? That's when you use prefixes that represent a fraction of the base unit. Here are the most common prefixes of this type:

centi- (c) means ""one hundredth"" (0.01). 1 centimetre = 0.01 metres.

milli- (m) means ""one thousandth"" (0.001). 1 millimetre = 0.001 metres.

micro- (µ) means ""one millionth"" (0.000 001). 1 micrometre = 0.000 001 metres.

nano- (n) means ""one billionth"" (0.000 000 001). 1 nanometre = 0.000 000 001 metres.


, These conversions work exactly the same. Just make sure to set up your units so they cancel out, and to keep track of decimals:

Centimetres to metres: 33 centimetres = 33cm∗0.01mcm{\displaystyle 33cm*0.01{\frac {m}{cm}}} = 0.33 metres.

Metres to millimetres: 2.15 metres = 2.15m∗1mm0.001m{\displaystyle 2.15m*{\frac {1mm}{0.001m}}} = 2150 millimetres.


, Probably the most common mistake with these conversions is to accidentally divide instead of multiply or vice versa. There are several ways to catch this mistake:

Check the units in your equation. If you set it up correctly, the original units should cancel out. For example 75km∗1000mkm{\displaystyle 75km*1000{\frac {m}{km}}} gives you an answer in terms of km∗mkm{\displaystyle {\frac {km*m}{km}}}. The km units are on top and bottom, so they cancel out and leave you with m (metres).

Compare the units logically. The smaller unit should always have the larger number next to it. Metres are smaller than kilometres, so it takes more of them to fill the same length. For example, a result of 75 000 metres = 75 kilometres makes sense, since a larger number of metres equals a smaller number of kilometres.


, Every SI prefix represents a different power of ten: 100, 1000, 0.001, and so on. Here are the most common examples written in scientific notation (standard form):

giga- = 1 000 000 000 = 109

mega- = 1 000 000 = 106

kilo- = 1 000 = 103

centi- = 0.01 = 10-2

milli- = 0.001 = 10-3

micro- = 0.000 001 = 10-6

nano- = 0.000 000 001 = 10-9

You can also write a negative exponent as a fraction with a positive exponent in the denominator: 10−2=1102{\displaystyle 10^{-2}={\frac {1}{10^{2}}}}


, Scientific notation makes it much easier to convert between units of very different size. No matter what the final unit you want is, you can start by converting the initial value to the base unit, using scientific notation.

Example: How many centimetres are in 13.78 kilometres?The answer isn't obvious, but you do know that the kilometre is equal to 103 metres.Therefore, 13.78 km = 13.78 * 103 metres. You'll use this in the next step.


, Now that you have a base unit value (with no prefix), you can set up an ordinary conversion to the final unit. Write the conversion in powers of ten notation.

To continue the example, you know want to convert 13.78 * 103 metres into centimetres.The prefix centi- means 10-2, so there is 1cm10−2m{\displaystyle {\frac {1cm}{10^{-2}m}}}


, Set up your conversion using power of ten notation for all values. This gives you a fraction that divides one power of ten by another:


13.78∗103m∗1cm10−2m=13.78∗10310−2 {\displaystyle 13.78*10^{3}m*{\frac {1cm}{10^{-2}m}}={\frac {13.78*10^{3}}{10^{-2}}}\ } cm


, To divide one exponential expression by the other (when they both have the same base), take the top exponent and subtract the bottom exponent. The answer is the new exponent in your answer, with the same base (which is always 10 in these conversion problems).13.78∗10310−2{\displaystyle {\frac {13.78*10^{3}}{10^{-2}}}} cm = 13.78∗103−(−2)=13.78∗105{\displaystyle 13.78*10^{3-(-2)}=13.78*10^{5}} centimeters.

It's usually helpful to write your answer in scientific notation (standard form): 1.378∗106{\displaystyle 1.378*10^{6}} centimeters.


, Once you are comfortable with this process, you can combine the whole process into a couple quick steps:

Write the initial prefix and the final prefix as powers of 10. For base units without prefixes, use 100{\displaystyle 10^{0}}.

Divide the initial power of 10 by the final power of 10. (To do this, subtract the final exponent from the initial exponent.)

Multiply your initial value by this answer.
Example: How many centilitres (cL) are in 85 500 millilitres (mL)?The initial prefix is ""milli-"" = 10−3{\displaystyle 10^{-3}} and the final prefix is ""centi-"" = 10−2{\displaystyle 10^{-2}}.10−310−2=10(−3)−(−2)=10−1{\displaystyle {\frac {10^{-3}}{10^{-2}}}=10^{(-3)-(-2)}=10^{-1}}85 500 millilitres = 85 500∗10−1{\displaystyle 85\ 500*10^{-1}} centilitres.Optionally, write this in scientific notation: 8.55∗103{\displaystyle 8.55*10^{3}} centilitres.

Subtract the first digit of the weight in pounds from the total number and then divide by two.",How to Convert Pounds to Kilograms2," This method is used most frequently by nurses in calculating dosage for a patient since dosage is often in kilograms while the patient's weight is typically in pounds.Example: Convert 46 lbs. Subtract 4 from 46 lbs, which equals 42 lbs. Divide 42 by 2, which equals 21 kilograms. (The answer using the formula is 20.87 kilograms, which can be rounded up to 21 kilograms.)

Try some practice problems.,
Divide the number of minutes by 60 again to convert seconds to hours.",How to Convert Seconds to Minutes," No matter what country you are in or part of the globe, there are always 60 seconds to every minute.


After 60 seconds have passed, there has been one minute.
After another 60 seconds (120 seconds total), two minutes have passed.
After 180 seconds (60 + 60 + 60), three minutes have passed.;
, Every 60 seconds a full minute has passed. Dividing a number tells you how many times one number ""fits"" in the other. Take the question, ""If 360 seconds have passed, how many minutes have passed?"" We need to know how many 60 second chunks fit into 360 seconds, so we divide. 360 / 60 = 6, so our answer is 6 minutes.


Example: How many minutes are in 240 seconds?
1 Minute = 60 Seconds
240 / 60

Answer: There are 4 minutes in 240 seconds.

, Oftentimes the number of seconds will not perfectly convert into minutes. This decimal represents the number of seconds left over. For example, 90 seconds equals 1.5 minutes (90 / 60). This means that there is 1 minute plus an extra half of a minute (.5 of a minute) in 90 seconds. To convert this back to seconds, simply multiply the decimal by 60. Answer: There is 1 minute and 30 (.5 x 60) seconds in 90 seconds.


Example: How many minutes is 7600 seconds?
7600 / 60 = 126.6 minutes
0.6 x 60 = 36 seconds

Answer There are 126 minutes and 36 seconds in 7600 seconds.

, If you did your work correctly, you'll end up with the same number of seconds that you started with. Looking at the previously example, notice that 126.6 x 60 = 7600, so the answer is correct.

, Practice your conversions with the following examples. There are answers at the bottom.


1) Convert 45667 seconds to minutes

Answer: 761min and 7.2 seconds


2) Convert 99800 seconds to minutes

Answer: 1663 min and 18 seconds


3) Convert 4454457555 seconds to minutes

Answer: 74240959 min and 15 seconds



, There are also 60 minutes in an hour, so we use the same process, dividing by 60, to determine how many seconds are in an hour.



Example: How man hours is 7200 seconds?
7200 / 60 = 120 minutes.
120 / 60 = 2 hours

Answer: 7200 seconds equals 2 hours.

Learn the conversion factor.,
Set up your conversion equation.,
Perform the conversion.",How to Convert Newtons to Kilograms1," You can learn from many tables or textbooks that one Newton is equal to 0.10197 kilograms of force.A useful way to write this figure is as a conversion ratio, 0.10197kg1N{\displaystyle {\frac {0.10197kg}{1N}}}. By writing the conversion in a fraction that way, it should remind you that the two are equal, and the value of the fraction is 1.

Recall that any fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal has a value of 1. This is important in conversions because you can multiply any number by 1 without changing its value, but you can convert the units.
;
, If you have a number of Newtons that you wish to convert to units of kg-force, you can use the conversion factor to set up a simple equation. As long as the conversion term is equal to 1, the value of the measurement will be the same.

For example, suppose you have a measurement of 5 N that you wish to convert to kg-force. Set it up as a multiplication problem, as follows:


5N=5N∗0.10197kg1N{\displaystyle 5N=5N*{\frac {0.10197kg}{1N}}}



In setting up the conversion factor, you need to make sure that you write the conversion fraction so the unit you wish to end up with is in the numerator. If you wrote the conversion fraction as 1N0.10197kg{\displaystyle {\frac {1N}{0.10197kg}}}, your result would be incorrect. This would be the conversion to use for the inverse conversion, from kilograms to Newtons.


, If you set up your conversion factor correctly, the final step should be a simple multiplication. You should see that you begin with the unit of Newtons, and your conversion ratio has Newtons in the denominator. As with any fraction multiplication, something that appears both in the numerator and the denominator can cancel out of the equation. This will leave just the desired unit of kg-force.In this example, the problem is set up and can be completed as follows:


5N=5N∗0.10197kg1N=0.50985kg.{\displaystyle 5N=5N*{\frac {0.10197kg}{1N}}=0.50985kg.}

Write the number of pounds.,
Multiply by 16.,
Don't forget the ""ounces"" label.,
Convert back to pounds by dividing by 16.",How to Convert Pounds to Ounces1," If you are converting the weight of a real-life object, you can use a scale to weigh it. If you already know the weight in pounds, just write the number and label it ""lbs"".


Let's follow along with an example. Say that a newborn baby is weighed at the doctor's office and found to be exactly 10 pounds. We would start our conversion by writing 10 lbs on the paper.;
, This is the number of ounces in one pound.


In our example, we would multiply 10 × 16 to get 160.

, Writing ""ounces"" or ""oz"" next to your answer is important. If you don't, it won't be clear which units you converted to. If you're doing this work for school, you may even lose points for forgetting to label.


In our example, we would write our answer as either ""160 ounces"" or ""160 oz."" Both mean the same thing.

, Division is basically the ""opposite"" of multiplication. This means that dividing by the same number that you multiply by will ""undo"" your work. In other words, dividing a number of ounces by 16 will get you an answer in pounds.


In our example, dividing the baby's weight in ounces by 16 gets us 160/16 = 10 lbs. Don't forget the ""pounds"" label.

Review them briefly to find one that has a style and a presentation that you like and find easy to use. The results should be the same, no matter which you choose.For example, the site KylesConverter.com has a very simple read out. There is one large box to enter the number of Newtons, and as soon as you enter the number, the result appears in a second box. You can select the “precision” of your conversion to show the number of decimal places that you want. The precision begins at 1, so only 1 digit will appear unless you change it.


, With the online conversion calculators, you do not need to worry about memorizing a conversion factor. You simply enter the value you wish to convert, and the result appears.On KylesConverter.com, simply type the number 5, for example, into the left-hand box which is labeled “Newtons (N).” The equivalent value of 1 will appear in the right-hand box, labeled “kilograms (kg).”


, Some sites will only provide you with a set number of decimal places. Some will allow you to set the precision level of the conversion. If available, set the precision level to what you desire, and the result with automatically correct.For example, on KylesConverter.com, if you begin with a precision value of 1 and enter 5 Newtons, the result will show as 1 Kg. If you change the precision level to 2, the value in the answer box will change to 0.51 Kg. If you change the precision level again to 5, the value in the answer box will change to 0.50986.

If your calculator is equipped with this, you can use it to convert measurements from one unit to another. The Texas Instruments TI-83, TI-84Plus and TI-86 have this feature.On the TI-86, you can find the “Conv” label above the 5 key. To activate it, you need to press the “2nd” key and then the 5 key.


, You first need to tell the calculator what units you want to convert, and then you can perform your conversion. This will be slightly different on different model calculators, but the basic steps are the same.On the TI-86, begin by pressing “2nd” and “5.” This will open a menu of physical properties that you can convert.


, Upon opening the conversion feature, your screen will show a list of options: Length, Area, Vol (Volume), Time, Temp. Since none of this is what you want, press the “More” key to move to the next screen. You will then see five more options: Mass, Force, Press (Pressure), Energy, and Power. You will want to select the F2 button at the top of the calculator for Force., As soon as you select that you wish to convert “Force,” your screen will show a new list of options, of various units of force. You will need to choose the unit that you are starting with for your conversion.First type in the number of Newtons that you want to convert. Then choose the F1 function key labeled “N.”

In the example, you are converting 5 N to kg-force. Therefore, first enter “5” and then press F1. Your display screen should show “5N” followed by an arrow and a blinking cursor.


, After entering your beginning value and its unit, you need to choose the unit to convert into. The list of units should still be displayed on the screen.In this case, you want to convert Newtons into kilograms of force. You will want to choose the button labeled “kgf,” which is the F4 function key. When you make that selection, your screen display should show “5N→kgf.”


, When the screen display shows the conversion that you want, just press the “Enter” key. The calculator will perform the conversion and show the value on the display screen.With this example, the TI calculators generally display up to 12 digits, so your display should show 0.509858106489.

Don't confuse fluid ounces with ordinary ounces.,
Use troy ounces for precious metals.,
Convert between oz/square inch and lbs/square inch as normal.",How to Convert Pounds to Ounces2," ""Fluid ounces"" (fl oz) are used for volume, or the space something takes up. They are usually used for liquids (like water, milk, juice, etc.). Fluid ounces do not tell an object's weight. This means that 16 fl oz of a certain liquid doesn't necessarily weigh 1 lb.


As an example, one fluid ounce of honey weighs about 1 1/2 ounces.This means that 16 fl oz weighs about 24 ounces, or a pound and a half.

, Troy ounces, which are used to weigh precious metals like gold and silver, are a little heavier than ordinary ounces. There are about 14.6 troy ounces in a pound.This means that to convert a pound to troy ounces, you can multiply by 14.6.


For example, let's say that an old, heavy gold necklace is weighed at exactly half a pound. We can convert to troy ounces by multiplying 0.5 × 14.6 = 7.3 troy ounces.

, ""Ounces per square inch"" are used to measure pressure and surface density (thickness) of thin materials like paper.There are 16 oz/square inch in one lb/square inch, so you can convert by multiplying by 16 just like with normal ounces and pounds.


This is also true for ounces and pounds per cubic inch — just multiply by 16 like normal.

, This is the number of grams in one ounce. The answer you get will be the number of grams you're looking for.


In our example problem, 8 ounces × 28.35 = 226.8 grams of chicken.
Don't forget to label your answer ""grams."" If you're doing this for school, you may lose points if you forget the label.

, The 28.35 number above isn't actually exactly how many grams are in one ounce. The actual number is much closer to this long decimal. If you need your answer to be very accurate, use this. Otherwise, 28.35 is fine.


In our example above, if we wanted to be super-accurate about the amount of chicken in the recipe, we would multiply 8 × 28.349523125 = 226.796185 grams — a very small difference.

Convert the square footage of a sphere by multiplying the surface area by r3{\displaystyle {\frac {r}{3}}}, where r is the sphere's radius.,
Always express your answer in cubic feet after solving.,
Practice with an example.",How to Convert Square Feet to Cubic Feet2," If you make one measurement in feet, you need to make them all in feet. You cannot measure the length in inches and the width in feet, otherwise your answer won't have any meaning. If you need to make the measurements yourself, make sure they are in the same scale. If you've been given different units, you can convert them as follows:


If given inches... divide the measurement by 12 (ex. 24in12=2ft{\displaystyle {\frac {24in}{12}}=2ft}).


If given centimeters... divide by 30.48 (ex. 150cm30.48=4.92126ft{\displaystyle {\frac {150cm}{30.48}}=4.92126ft}).


If given yards... multiply the measurement by 3 (ex. 3yds∗3=9ft{\displaystyle 3yds*3=9ft}).


, A regular, right prism is simply a basic 3D shape like a rectangular box, a cylinder, etc: any shape with two even shapes on the ends and a smooth, regular connection between them.Finding an area's total cubic feet is a way to measure its volume, or how much room the three-dimensional space takes up. For regular prisms, such as rectangles, cylinders, and triangular prisms, all you have to know is the area of the base and the height.

The area of the base is always in square footage, such as 2ft2{\displaystyle 2ft^{2}}. If you've got a room you want cubic footage off, the base is the square footage of the floor.

The height, or how tall the space is, is always measured from base to base, at the same point on each. So if you measure from the corner of the floor, you need to go to the same corner in the ceiling.

A regular prism is one where the two bases are even and equal polygons, such as triangles, squares, circles, diamonds, etc., The easiest way to see this is to think of the volume of a rectangle, found using the basic formula Length∗Width∗Height{\displaystyle Length*Width*Height}. Since square footage is found by multiplying length and width, all you have to do now is account for the height. This same principle applies no matter what the base is -- simply multiply square footage by height.Square Footage = 12ft2{\displaystyle 12ft^{2}}, Height = 3ft{\displaystyle 3ft}


12ft2∗3ft={\displaystyle 12ft^{2}*3ft=} 36 cubic feet



Square Footage = 4ft2{\displaystyle 4ft^{2}}, Height = 6ft{\displaystyle 6ft}


4ft2∗6ft={\displaystyle 4ft^{2}*6ft=} 24 cubic feet



Square Footage = 1.5πft2{\displaystyle 1.5\pi ft^{2}}, Height = 2ft{\displaystyle 2ft}


1.5πft2∗2ft={\displaystyle 1.5\pi ft^{2}*2ft=} 9.42 cubic feet, If you're given the surface area of a sphere and the radius, you can convert to cubic footage with ease. Simply multiply the surface area by the radius, then divide by three:

Surface Area = 314.16ft2{\displaystyle 314.16ft^{2}}, Radius= 5ft{\displaystyle 5ft}


314.16ft2∗53={\displaystyle 314.16ft^{2}*{\frac {5}{3}}=} 523.6 cubic feet




Note, however, that the formula for the volume of a sphere is simply V=43π∗r3{\displaystyle V={\frac {4}{3}}\pi *r^{3}} It is often easier to plug in ""r"" for this equation than to try and convert from square footage., This is a simple way to keep track of measurements whether you're building a garden or finishing up your homework. To finish you answer, you must denote the type of measurements so that a builder, teacher, or friend knows whether ""523.6"" refers to inches, yards, feet, miles, etc. Remember: volume is always cubed. There are three acceptable ways to write the units for cubic feet.


523.6ft3{\displaystyle 523.6ft^{3}}


523.6{\displaystyle 523.6} cubic feet.


523.6{\displaystyle 523.6} feet cubed


, The following question should not be difficult, as long as you remember how the correct equation. The answer can be found by clicking and highlighting after the second bullet.

Convert cubic feet back into square footage by dividing the height from the cubic footage.,
Remember that this conversion only works for regular prisms and spheres.",How to Convert Square Feet to Cubic Feet3," Not all questions are going to tell you outright that they want you to find cubic footage. What you need to remember is that cubic footage is just a measurement of volume -- so any volume question you're asked with feet in the measurements (ft3{\displaystyle ft^{3}}), is likely asking for cubic feet. Some example problems might ask:

If the square footage is 10ft2{\displaystyle 10ft^{2}}, and the height is 5ft{\displaystyle 5ft}, what is the volume?

What is the volume, in feet, of the garden?

How many cubic feet of water could fit in a square box with a base of 23ft2{\displaystyle 23ft^{2}} and a height of 2ft{\displaystyle 2ft}? (Note: ""base"" means the flat bottom, or square footage.


, This is best seen in an example. Say you have a 100 square foot backyard area to plant a garden and need to know how much topsoil to buy. Before buying anything, you need to know how deep your soil will go. This is your ""height"" measurement, telling you how high the soil must go. For example, say you need, at minimum 6-inch holes for each plant:

Make sure all units are in feet:


6in12=.5ft{\displaystyle {\frac {6in}{12}}=.5ft}



Multiply square footage by height:


100∗.5=50{\displaystyle 100*.5=50}



Express answer in cubic feet


You must purchase at least 50ft3{\displaystyle 50ft^{3}} of soil to fill your garden.


, Since it is such a simple conversion to get to square footage, it is simple to undo. For example, you might have a heater capable of filling a 6800ft3{\displaystyle 6800ft^{3}}, but you want to know how much floor-space that covers in your room. To find out, simply divide 6800 by the height of the room, found by simply measuring floor to ceiling:

Example height of the room = 12ft{\displaystyle 12ft}


6800ft312fr=566.67ft2{\displaystyle {\frac {6800ft^{3}}{12fr}}=566.67ft^{2}}


The heater will heat a room with a square footage is 566.67ft2{\displaystyle 566.67ft^{2}} and a height of 12ft.

This strategy is purely for rectangular or cylindrical volumes. It is much more complex for pyramids and spheres. , If your shape curves, bends, twists, or is otherwise irregular, you cannot simply convert from square footage to cubic footage. If the object changes size or thickness as it gains height than the measurement of the base -- your square footage -- will no longer be accurate. These types of problems usually require the integral calculus to solve.Imagine buying a heater for a room with a pointed ceiling. Now imagine how much more of the room you'd have to heat if the room was perfectly square, instead of pointed at the top. While the square footage of the floor is important, it isn't the only thing determining the cubic footage.

Multiply by 30.,
Figure out 10% of your answer.,
Subtract half of 10% from your original answer.",How to Convert Ounces to Grams2," If you're stuck without a calculator, try this trick for converting ounces to grams in your head. Start by multiplying your ounces by 30. This is easy in your head — it's the same as multiplying by 3 and adding a 0.


Let's use the method in this section to convert 8 ounces to grams again. 8 × 30 is the same as 8 × 3 (24), plus a 0 (240).

, To do this, you can just take the zero off. In other words, it's the same as your original number times three.


In our example, 10% of 240 is 24 (we just took the 0 off).

, With this strategy, you can get very close to the 28.35 conversion without even touching a calculator.


Half of 24 is 12. 240 - 12 = 228 grams. This pretty close to our original answer (226.8 grams) — especially for not using a calculator.

Write the value in ounces as a fraction over 1.,
Multiply by (1 gram/0.035 ounces).,
Cancel the units and divide.,
For multiple conversions, arrange your ratios so the proper units cancel.",How to Convert Ounces to Grams3," This section uses fractions to show how the units in the problem relate to each other. Start by writing your number of ounces as the top part of a fraction (the numerator). Put ""1"" in the bottom part (the denominator) with no units.


Let's say that we're doing a chemistry experiment and that, at the end of our reaction, we get 1.23 ounces of product. To start converting this to grams, we would write it like this:



1.23 ounces/1




Don't forget to label the ounces in the numerator. It's important for this kind of conversion.

, This is the conversion ratio for grams and ounces. Basically, it's a fraction that shows how many ounces are in a gram. Ignore the units for now as you multiply. See our article on multiplying fractions if you need help.


In our example, we would multiply like this:



1.23 × 1 = 1.23
1 × 0.035 = 0.035




So our final fraction is 1.23/0.035


, Notice that ""ounces"" appears twice: once in the first fraction's numerator and again in the second fraction's denominator. If you're multiplying fractions and a unit appears once in both the top and bottom, you can remove it from the problem. The units you're left with (grams) are the units for your answer. Now just divide to solve.


In our example problem, we can cancel out the two ""ounces"" because they appear once on the top and once on bottom. This leaves us with grams. To get our answer, we just divide 1.23/0.035 = 35.14 grams.

, One of the nice things about using conversion ratios is that they make it easy to make lots of conversions in a row. All you need to do is use the same process as above, arranging multiple ratios so that all the units cancel except for the ones you want for your answer. See below:


Let's say that we forgot how to convert from ounces to grams, but we do know that there are 16 ounces in a pound, 2.2 pounds in a kilogram, and 1,000 grams in a kilogram. This is enough to get us our answer. We would arrange our ratios like this:



1.23 ounces/1 × 1 pound/16 ounces × 1 kilogram/2.2 pounds × 1,000 grams/1 kilogram




All the units cancel out except for grams, so these are the units for our answer. Now we just need to solve:



= (1.23 × 1,000)/(16 × 2.2 &times) = 1,230/35.2 = 34.94 grams (almost the same as our original answer)

Know the conversion factor between nanometers and meters.,
Write the conversion factor as a fraction.,
Set up a conversion equation.,
Perform the conversion.",How to Convert Nanometers to Meters1," You can look online or in a textbook to find the relationship between nanometers and meters. The relationship between the two units is:1 meter = 1,000,000,000 nanometers (nm)
;
, Recall that any fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal has an overall value of 1. This is useful, because you can use the conversion fraction to change units without changing the value of the measurement. When you begin with nanometers and want to convert to meters, you will use the following conversion factor:1 meter1,000,000,000 nm{\displaystyle {\frac {1{\text{ meter}}}{1,000,000,000{\text{ nm}}}}}

This is the fraction to convert from nanometers into meters. If you want to begin with meters and convert to nanometers, you just need to flip the fraction upside down.


, To convert from one unit to another, you need to set up a simple multiplication equation. You begin with your initial measurement and multiply it by the conversion factor. The result will be your answer.Remember that you can cancel units that appear once in a numerator and once in a denominator. This is the purpose of the conversion fraction. Your original measurement begins with nanometers, and the conversion fraction has nanometers in the denominator. Thus, the units of nanometers will cancel, and what remains will be the answer in meters.

For this conversion, suppose you have measured a germ that is 2,600 nanometers wide. The conversion equation will be:


2,600 nm=2,600 nm∗1 meter1,000,000,000 nm{\displaystyle 2,600{\text{ nm}}=2,600{\text{ nm}}*{\frac {1{\text{ meter}}}{1,000,000,000{\text{ nm}}}}}




, If your conversion factor is correct, the final step should be a simple multiplication. Finish the conversion as follows:2,600 nm=2,600 nm∗1 meter1,000,000,000 nm=0.0000026 m{\displaystyle 2,600{\text{ nm}}=2,600{\text{ nm}}*{\frac {1{\text{ meter}}}{1,000,000,000{\text{ nm}}}}=0.0000026{\text{ m}}}

Learn the length of a mile.,
Learn the length of a kilometer.,
Understand the distances over time.,
Convert a mile to a kilometer.,
Get the speed in MPH.,
Multiply by 1.60934 (the kilometer equivalent).",How to Convert Mph to Kph," The mile is a unit of length actually based on the Roman “mille passus” or “thousand paces.”Though the exact length of the unit varied over time, it is now set at 5,280 feet., A kilometer is a common unit of measurement for length in the metric system. The metric system is a system of measurements in which each unit is a multiple of ten from the previous unit. The meter is the base unit, and a kilometer is equivalent to 1,000 meters., Each unit of distance doesn’t mean anything by itself. In order to calculate each distance as a speed, there must be a time component added. The most common way of measuring miles and kilometers as speeds is in how many miles or kilometers an object travels in one hour—hence per hour, which is the equivalent of saying X number of miles or kilometers divided by one hour.

, Since miles and kilometers are two separate units of measurement, one must first convert one mile of distance to one kilometer of distance before converting them as a distance over time. 1 mile = 1.6093440 kilometers.Alternatively, if you want to convert kilometers to miles, you would need the inverse. 1 kilometer = 0.6214 miles., Now that you know the basics of the distances, you’re ready to convert them as speeds. The only other piece of information you need is the MPH speed that you want to convert. For example, let’s say it’s 95MPH.

, Once you have the correct speed in miles per hour, you can convert it to kilometers by multiplying it by 1.60934. For the example of 95MPH, 95 x 1.60934 = 152.887KPH.


If you are making the conversion for KPH to MPH, then you would instead use the opposite distance conversion (1km = 0.6214 miles) and multiply the KPH x 0.6214. For the previous example, if you take 152.887KPH, 152.887 x 0.6214 = 95MPH.

Learn the relative positions of the units.,
Know the LARS mnemonic.,
Decide how you want to change the exponent.,
Move the decimal as needed.",How to Convert Nanometers to Meters2," The strength and simplicity of the metric system stem from the fact that the units are based on multiples of 10. Therefore, converting from one unit to another is simply a matter of moving the decimal point the correct number of spaces. To use this shortcut tool, you need to know the exponent measures of the units involved.The meter is the basic unit of length measurement in the metric system. Written as a base 10 exponent, 1 m=100 m{\displaystyle 1{\text{ m}}=10^{0}{\text{ m}}}.

The nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. Written as a base 10 exponent, 1 nm=10−9 m{\displaystyle 1{\text{ nm}}=10^{-9}{\text{ m}}}.


, For moving decimal places, “LARS” is a handy memory device. It stands for “Left-Add, Right-Subtract.” This tells you what to do with the decimal point if you wish to either add or subtract to change exponents. If you want to convert your measurement from a small exponent to a larger one, you will be adding units to the exponent, and for each one addition to the exponent, you will move the decimal point one space to the left. Moving from a larger unit of measure to a smaller, you will be subtracting exponents, which will involve moving the decimal point to the right.For example, consider converting kilometers to meters. A kilometer is 103{\displaystyle 10^{3}} meters, but the single meter is 100{\displaystyle 10^{0}}. Thus, you want to subtract 3 in the exponent, so you will move the decimal to the right three places (""Left-Add, RIGHT-SUBTRACT""). Therefore, if you begin with a measure of 1.234 km, you would make the following change to meters:

1.234 km ............(original unit)

12.34 .................(move decimal one space right)

123.4..................(move decimal two spaces right)

1,234 m..................(move decimal three spaces right)




, To convert from nanometers, which are units of 10-9 m, into meters, which are units of 100 m, you are moving from -9 to 0. This requires you to add 9. According to the LARS mnemonic, adding 9 units in the exponent means moving the decimal place 9 spaces to the left (“Left-Add”)., For this example, suppose you have the measurement of a germ at 2,600 nm. You need to move the decimal point 9 spaces to the left. Since this is a whole number with no decimal point showing, you can insert the decimal at the end of the number and then count the spaces to move it. When you run out of numbers, you will fill in all remaining spaces with zeroes.Write 2,600 nm as “2,600. nm” with a decimal point. Then move the decimal as follows:

260.0………. (one space left)

26.00……….(two spaces left)

2.600……….(three spaces left)

.2600……….(four spaces left)

.02600………(five spaces left)

.002600…….(six spaces left)

.0002600……(seven spaces left)

.00002600…..(eight spaces left)

.000002600…..(nine spaces left)

Perform the conversion.",How to Convert Nanometers to Meters3," Perform a simple Internet search for “convert nanometers to meters.” You should get several results with links to a number of different conversion calculators. Look them over and choose the one that you believe will be easiest for you to use. The results should be the same, no matter which conversion calculator you choose. Select one that is easy for entering data with easy-to-read results., When you find an online conversion calculator that you like, it should have a box or space for you to enter your initial measurement of nanometers. You do not need to worry about counting decimal places or knowing conversion factors. Just enter your measurement, and your answer should appear., On some conversion calculators, after you enter your initial measurement, you need to press a “convert” button. On others, the result may be automatic.For example, at the conversion site www.Metric-conversion.net, as soon as you enter the number of nanometers in the first box, an equivalent number of meters will appear immediately in the second box. Entering the number 2,600 in the first box will cause the value of 0.0000026 m to appear in the second box.

Move the decimal point two places to the left to convert a percent to a decimal.,
Express the percent as a fraction of 100.,
Remove the percent sign.","How to Convert Percents, Fractions, and Decimals2"," Unless otherwise noted, in a percent, the decimal point comes at the end of the last number. For example, envision that 75% actually looks like 75.0%. Moving the decimal point two places to the left converts the percent to a decimal. This is the same thing as dividing the number by 100. Examples:75% converts to .75
3.1% converts to .031
0.5% converts to 0.005

, Writing a number as a fraction of 100 is simply another way to write a perce. The number of the percent becomes the numerator of the fraction and 100 becomes the denominator. Simplify the fraction to its lowest form.


Example: 36% turns to 36/100.
To simplify, look for the highest number that goes into 36 and 100. In this case, that would be 4.
Determine how many times 4 goes into 36 and 100. When you simplify, the answer would be 9/25.
To check that you’ve converted correctly, divide 9 by 25 (0.36) and multiply by 100 (36%). This number should equal your original percent.

, Once the percent has been converted to a decimal or fraction, the % sign is no longer appropriate. Remember, percent just means per one hundred, so if you forget to remove the percent sign after converting, your answer will be off by one hundred."
"
Multiply the decimal by 100 to change it to a percent.,
Convert a terminating decimal to a fraction.,
Change a repeating decimal into a fraction.","How to Convert Percents, Fractions, and Decimals3"," Another way of saying this is to move the decimal point two places to the right. A percent just means “per one hundred”, so the decimal becomes “per one hundred” after being multiplied. Don’t forget to add the percent sign after multiplying.Examples include: 0.32 becomes 32%, 0.07 becomes 7%, 1.25 becomes 125%, 0.083 becomes 8.3%.

, A terminating decimal is one that does not repeat. Move the decimal point as many places to the right as you have decimals. This number is now the numerator of the fraction. The denominator is a 1 with as many zeros as you had decimals in the original number. Simplify the fraction at the end.For example: 0.32 has two decimal places. Move the decimal two places to the right and divide by 100: 32/100. With a common factor of 4, the fraction simplifies to 8/25.
Another example: 0.8 only has one decimal place. Move the decimal one place to the right and divide by 10: 8/10. With a common factor of 2, the fraction simplifies to 4/5.
To check your work, simply divide out the fraction and make sure it equals your original decimal: 8/25 = 0.32.

, A repeating decimal is one that has a sequence of numbers that continually repeat. For example, if the number is 0.131313... there are 2 repeating decimals (13 is repeating). Determine how many repeating decimals there are and then multiply the decimal by 10n, where n is the number of repeating decimals.For example, 0.131313... is multiplied by 100 (10 to the power of 2) and we get 13.131313...
To determine the numerator (top number), subtract out the repeating portion of the decimal. For example, 13.131313... - 0.131313... = 13, so the numerator is 13.To determine the denominator (lower number), subtract 1 from the number you multiplied with. For example, 0.131313... was multiplied by 100, so the denominator is 100 - 1 = 99.
The final fraction for 0.131313… is 13/99
Additional Examples:

0.333... becomes 3/9
0.123123123... becomes 123/999
0.142857142857... becomes 142857/999999
If necessary, take the fraction to the lowest term. For example, 142857/999999 becomes 1/7.

Divide the numerator by the denominator to change the fraction to a decimal.,
Determine the number of decimal points.,
Divide the fraction and then multiply by 100 to change to a percent.","How to Convert Percents, Fractions, and Decimals4"," Interpret the fraction bar to mean ""divided by"". This means for any fraction x/y, it is the same as saying x divided by y.For example: The fraction 4/8 yields the decimal 0.5.

, Many numbers don’t divide evenly into each other. When you divide them, you have to decide how many decimal places you want to give in your answer. Oftentimes, the standard is two places. Remember the rules of rounding when truncating a fraction: if the next number is a 5, round the previous number up. For example, 0.145 rounds to 0.15.


For example: The fraction 5/17 yields the decimal 0.2941176470588…
The final decimal can be written simply as 0.29.

, Just as you did to convert the fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. Multiply the resulting decimal by 100 and add a percent sign to finish the conversion.If you had 4/8, dividing 4 by 8 would give you .50, then multiplying that number by 100 would give you 50. Adding a percent sign gives you your final answer by 50%.
Additional Examples:

3/10 = 0.30 * 100 = 30%
5/8= 0.625 * 100 = 62.5%

Since these two types of gallons are not the same, the conversion formula will be different depending on which type of gallon you are converting from.

If the problem does not specify which type of gallon, and you are a student in the United States, it is probably safe to assume that you are converting from US gallons.

Outside of the United States, it is probably safe to assume that you are converting from the imperial gallon.
;
, The formula is L/100km=282.48xmpg{\displaystyle L/100{\text{km}}={\frac {282.48}{x\;{\text{mpg}}}}}.Substitute the number of miles per gallon into the formula, then divide. The quotient will give you the equivalent number of liters per 100 km.

For example, if you are converting 24 miles per imperial gallon to liters per 100 km, you would calculate:L/100km=282.4824{\displaystyle L/100{\text{km}}={\frac {282.48}{24}}}L/100km=11.77{\displaystyle L/100{\text{km}}=11.77}So, 24 MPG (imperial) is equal to 11.77 L/100km.

 1 imperial gallon is equal to 4.55 liters.1 U.S. gallon is equal to 3.79 liters., There are 1.609 kilometers in a mile, so your ratio will look like this:xmi1gallon×1.609km1mi{\displaystyle {\frac {x\;{\text{mi}}}{1{\text{gallon}}}}\times {\frac {1.609{\text{km}}}{1{\text{mi}}}}}. Multiply the number of miles times 1.609 to find out how many kilometers per gallon.For example, to convert 24 MPG, you would calculate:24mi1gallon×1.609km1mi=38.616km1gallon{\displaystyle {\frac {24{\text{mi}}}{1{\text{gallon}}}}\times {\frac {1.609{\text{km}}}{1{\text{mi}}}}={\frac {38.616{\text{km}}}{1{\text{gallon}}}}}


, Your ratio will look different, depending on whether you are working with imperial or US gallons. Since we want to find liters per 100 km, you need to take the reciprocal of your final ratio so that the liters value is in the numerator.If you are working with imperial gallons, you will calculate: 38.616km1gallon×1gallon4.55liters=38.616km4.55liters{\displaystyle {\frac {38.616{\text{km}}}{1{\text{gallon}}}}\times {\frac {1{\text{gallon}}}{4.55{\text{liters}}}}={\frac {38.616{\text{km}}}{4.55{\text{liters}}}}}. Taking the reciprocal, you have 4.55liters38.616km{\displaystyle {\frac {4.55{\text{liters}}}{38.616{\text{km}}}}}.

If you are working with US gallons, you will calculate: 38.616km1gallon×1gallon3.79liters=38.616km3.79liters{\displaystyle {\frac {38.616{\text{km}}}{1{\text{gallon}}}}\times {\frac {1{\text{gallon}}}{3.79{\text{liters}}}}={\frac {38.616{\text{km}}}{3.79{\text{liters}}}}}.Taking the reciprocal, you have 3.79liters38.616km{\displaystyle {\frac {3.79{\text{liters}}}{38.616{\text{km}}}}}.


, To do this you need to get the number of kilometers in the ratio to 1 by dividing. Divide the numerator and the denominator of the ratio by the number of kilometers. You can also think of it as dividing the numerator by the denominator.

For example, for imperial gallons, you would calculate 4.55liters38.616km=.118liters per km{\displaystyle {\frac {4.55{\text{liters}}}{38.616{\text{km}}}}=.118\;{\text{liters per km}}}.

For US gallons, you would calculate 3.79liters38.616km=.098liters per km{\displaystyle {\frac {3.79{\text{liters}}}{38.616{\text{km}}}}=.098\;{\text{liters per km}}}.

For example, if the rate in imperial gallons is .118liters per km{\displaystyle .118\;{\text{liters per km}}}, to calculate liters per 100 km, multiply .188×100=18.8liters per 100 km{\displaystyle .188\times 100=18.8\;{\text{liters per 100 km}}}.

If the rate in US gallons is .098liters per km{\displaystyle .098\;{\text{liters per km}}}, to calculate liters per 100 km, multiply .098×100=9.8liters per 100 km{\displaystyle .098\times 100=9.8\;{\text{liters per 100 km}}}.

There are .62 miles in one kilometer.So, to convert, you would calculate .20liters1km×1km.62mi=.20liters.62mi{\displaystyle {\frac {.20{\text{liters}}}{1{\text{km}}}}\times {\frac {1{\text{km}}}{.62{\text{mi}}}}={\frac {.20{\text{liters}}}{.62{\text{mi}}}}}.

Third, convert the number of liters to the number of US gallons. There are .26 US gallons in a liter.To convert, you would calculate .20liters.62mi×.26gallons.1liters=.052gallons.62mi{\displaystyle {\frac {.20{\text{liters}}}{.62{\text{mi}}}}\times {\frac {.26{\text{gallons}}}{.1{\text{liters}}}}={\frac {.052{\text{gallons}}}{.62{\text{mi}}}}}.

Fourth, since you want to find miles per gallon, take the reciprocal of the fraction:.62mi.052gallons{\displaystyle {\frac {.62{\text{mi}}}{.052{\text{gallons}}}}}.

Last, find the number of miles per gallon by dividing the numerator and the denominator by the number of gallons:.62mi.052gallons=11.92mpg{\displaystyle {\frac {.62{\text{mi}}}{.052{\text{gallons}}}}=11.92\;{\text{mpg}}}.

,How to Convert Minutes to Hours1,
"
Start with your number of minutes.,
Multiply by ""1 hour/60 minutes."",
Solve.,
Multiply by 60 to get back to minutes.,
If your measurement is in hours and minutes, just deal with the minutes.",How to Convert Minutes to Hours2," You can do this a few different ways. For example, if you're working on paper, you might write down the number of minutes and label it with the word ""minutes."" If you're using a calculator, just type in the number.


As an example, let's say that we want to find out how many hours a 150 minute movie will be. In this case, we'll start by writing down 150 minutes. In the next few steps, we'll solve!

, Next, write (or type) a multiplication sign (×), then the fraction 1 hour/60 minutes. This fraction shows how many minutes are in an hour (60). When we multiply, we'll end up with the correct units, too (since the two ""minutes"") cancel out.


This is the same as dividing by 60/1, or 60. If you need help dividing and multiplying fractions, see WikiHow's help article on this topic.

, Now you just need to do the math. The answer you get will be the number of hours you're looking for.


In our example, 150 minutes × 1 hour/60 minutes = 2.5 hours, or 2 1/2 hours. This is the same as 150 divided by 60 or 150/60.

, Taking an hours measurement and multiplying it by 60 will get you minutes again. Technically, you're multiplying by 60 minutes/1 hour so that the two ""hours"" cancel properly.


In our example, multiplying 2.5 hours × 60 minutes/1 hour = 150 minutes — exactly what we started with.

, Sometimes, time measurements are given like this: x hours y minutes. In this case, you can just convert the ""y minutes"" portion to hours, then add it to the ""x hours"" portion. This gives you the total time in (just) hours.


For example, let's say that we need to convert 3 hours and 9 minutes to just hours. To do this, all we need to do is figure out how many hours 9 minutes is, then add it to 3 hours. In other words, 9 minutes × 1 hour/60 minutes = 0.15 hours + 3 hours = 3.15 hours.

"
"
Convert your minutes to hours as normal.,
Multiply the decimal or fraction by 60.,
Write your answer as hours and minutes.",How to Convert Minutes to Hours3," Up until now, we've only discussed how to get answers written in hours. However, since time is often written as hours and minutes, it's nice to know how to do this too. Luckily, this is easy. To start, just convert your minute measurement into hours like you learned in the section above.


Let's follow along with an example problem. If we want to convert 260 minutes to hours, we would multiply 260 minutes × 1 hour/60 minutes = 4.33 hours or 4 1/3 hours.

, Unless your minutes converted perfectly to hours, you'll have an answer with a decimal or fraction in it. You want to multiply this part by 60. Leave the whole number alone — we're only dealing with the ""extra"" decimal or fraction part. Label your answer as ""minutes"".


In our example, we would multiply just the "".33"" by 60. 0.33 × 60 = 20 minutes.
If we use a fraction instead of 0.33, we get the same answer. 1/3 × 60 = 20 minutes.

, The answer you just got is the ""minutes"" part of your final answer. You already know the ""hours"" part — it's the whole number you got when you first converted. Write your answer like this: x hours, y minutes.


In our example, our first answer was 4.33 hours. We just found out that the "".33"" part is equal to 20 minutes, so we would write our answer as 4 hours 20 minutes.

Learn the conversion factor.,
Understand the conversion factor.,
Write down the multiplication problem.,
Cancel out the units.,
Solve the problem.",How to Convert Millimeters to Inches1," One inch is the same length as 25.4 millimeters. You can write this ""conversion factor"" as a fraction: 1inch25.4mm{\displaystyle {\frac {1inch}{25.4mm}}}.

Any two units have a special conversion factor for converting between them. If you don't know what it is, you can look it up online or in a textbook.
;
, The top and bottom of the fraction are the same length, just written in different units. This means the fraction is equal to 1, just like the fractions 33{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{3}}} or 88{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{8}}} simplify to 1.

Remember, multiplying a number by 1 doesn't change its value. That means you can multiply your measurement by this factor and the length will be the same. The only difference is the units: your answer will be written in inches instead of millimeters.


, Make sure to write down all units in your measurement. For example, here's what you would write down to convert 16 millimeters (mm) into inches (in):

16 mm x 1in25.4mm{\displaystyle {\frac {1in}{25.4mm}}} = ?


, If the same unit appears on the top and bottom of a fraction, they cancel out. If you've set up your problem correctly, the millimeters will cancel out and you'll be left with just inches.

16 mm x 1in25.4mm{\displaystyle {\frac {1in}{25.4mm}}} = ?

Cancel out the millimeters:16 x 1in25.4{\displaystyle {\frac {1in}{25.4}}} = ?

Since the only unit left is inches, your answer will be in inches.


, Finish the math problem by hand or on a calculator.

16 x 1in25.4{\displaystyle {\frac {1in}{25.4}}}

= 16 in ÷ 25.4

= about 0.63 inches


"
"
Memorize useful conversions.,
Convert millimeters to centimeters.,
Estimate the centimeter to inch conversion.,
Understand that this is an estimate.",How to Convert Millimeters to Inches2," If you can remember that 1 mm = 125.4{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{25.4}}} inches, that's great. But this conversion doesn't come up very often. It's more useful to memorize these common conversions:

1 cm = about 0.4 inches

1 cm = 10 mm

1 inch = exactly 2.54 cm (you don't need this for this conversion, but it's a good one to know)


, This is easy to do in your head. Just divide the millimeter measurement by 10. All you have to do is move the decimal point one digit to the left. If you're not sure why this works, look at this example:

430 mm= 430 mm x 1cm10mm{\displaystyle {\frac {1cm}{10mm}}}= 43 cm.


, The 1 cm = 0.4 in is close enough for most purposes. But how do you multiply by 0.4 in your head? Here are two different ways to do it, continuing with the same example:

Divide by two, then subtract 1/10 of the cm value: 43 cm ÷ 2 = 21.5→ 1/10 of 43 is 4.3→ subtract the second number from the first: 21.5 - 4.3 = 17.2 in.


Or divide by ten, then multiply by four:43 cm ÷ 10 = 4.3→ 4.3 x 4 = (4 x 4) + (0.3 x 4) = 16 + 1.2 = 17.2 in.


, Learning how to do this will come in handy for quick real-life estimates, where the exact answer is usually not important. It's not a good idea for homework problems that require an exact answer, but you can use it to double check your answer and make sure it's in the right ballpark.

In the example, the exact answer is actually 16.921 inches. The estimate is less than a third of an inch off, which is pretty good for mental math.

Find the density of the material you are measuring.,
Check with your pharmacist for medication densities.,
Prepare to convert from mass to volume.,
Perform the conversion.,
Learn the conversion factor.,
Perform the conversion.,
Review the results.",How to Convert Milligrams to Teaspoons," Because you are trying to convert mass into volume, you need to know the density of the material. Density is a measurement of how much mass fits in a given volume for any substance. Materials that we consider ""heavy"" have a high density, while ""light"" materials have a low density.

Density tables exist online or in many text books for a wide range of substances. You can find a table of density values by searching for “density table,” “liquid density table,” or “solid density table.”

The density of pure water is set at 1000 kg per cubic meter. This is the same as 1000 mg/ml.

For comparison, some other common liquids have the following densities:Alcohol = 800 kg/m3=800 mg/ml

Gasoline = 737 kg/m3=737 mg/ml

Milk = 1050 kg/m3=1050 mg/ml

Mercury = 13590 kg/m3=13590 mg/ml


;
, If you are trying to convert amounts for a prescription, you should check with your pharmacist. A pharmacist is in the best position to provide you with the correct density of whatever compound you need to measure.

You may find the density of your substance printed on the bottle. You might check that before contacting the pharmacist.


, Recall that density is equal to an item’s mass divided by its volume.Rearranging this formula,


Volume=massdensity{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {\text{mass}}{\text{density}}}}.


, When you know the density of the material and the measurement of the sample you wish to convert, perform the division to convert from mass to volume of your substance.For example, suppose you wish to convert 20,000 milligrams each of water, alcohol, gasoline, milk and mercury into milliliters. 20,000 milligrams is equal to 20 grams, which is about the weight of 20 paper clips.The conversions for these five liquids are as follows:

Water: (20,000 mg)/(1000 mg/ml)=20 ml water{\displaystyle (20,000{\text{ mg}})/(1000{\text{ mg/ml}})=20{\text{ ml water}}}

Alcohol: (20,000 mg)/(800 mg/ml)=25 ml alcohol{\displaystyle (20,000{\text{ mg}})/(800{\text{ mg/ml}})=25{\text{ ml alcohol}}}

Gasoline: (20,000 mg)/(737 mg/ml)=27.137 ml gasoline{\displaystyle (20,000{\text{ mg}})/(737{\text{ mg/ml}})=27.137{\text{ ml gasoline}}}

Milk: (20,000 mg)/(1050 mg/ml)=19.048 ml milk{\displaystyle (20,000{\text{ mg}})/(1050{\text{ mg/ml}})=19.048{\text{ ml milk}}}

Mercury: (20,000 mg)/(13590 mg/ml)=1.4717 ml mercury{\displaystyle (20,000{\text{ mg}})/(13590{\text{ mg/ml}})=1.4717{\text{ ml mercury}}}




, Because milliliters and teaspoons are both measurements of volume, the density of the different materials no longer makes a difference. Converting from milliliters to teaspoons is fairly easy because the conversion factor is just 5 to 1. That is, 5 ml = 1 tsp.

If you know a measurement in milliliters, you can convert to teaspoons by just dividing by 5.


, Using the five samples from above, prepare for the conversion to teaspoons.

Water: 20,000 mg = 20 ml/5 = 4 teaspoons

Alcohol: 20,000 mg = 25 ml/5 = 5 teaspoons

Gasoline: 20,000 mg = 27.137 ml/5 = 5.4274 teaspoons

Milk: 20,000 mg = 19.048 ml/5 = 3.8096 teaspoons

Mercury: 20,000 mg = 1.4717 ml/5 = 0.29434 teaspoons


, Pure water is set as the standard for conversion density, with a density of 1.0 grams per milliliter. The densities of all other substances are set in relation to the density of water. Notice that mercury, with an extremely high density, converts to only about a quarter teaspoon for the same mass of water that equals one teaspoon.

To convert measurements of water, do nothing.,
To convert for milk, multiply by 1.03.,
To convert for butter, multiply by 0.911.,
To convert for flour, multiply by 0.57.,
Use an online calculator for other ingredients.",How to Convert Milliliters (mL) to Grams (g)1," One milliliter of water has one gram of mass, and weighs one gram in typical situations, including for cooking recipes and math and science problems (unless another stated). There is no need to do any math: the measurement in milliliters and grams are always the same.


This easy conversion is not a coincidence, but a result of how these units were defined. Many scientific units are defined using water, since it is such a common and useful substance.
You only need to use a different conversion if the water is much hotter or colder than possible in everyday life .;
, Multiple the mL measurement for milk by 1.03 to get its mass (or weight) in grams. This measurement is for whole, full-fat milk. Skim milk is closer to 1.035, but this difference is not significant for most recipes., If you do not have a calculator, multiplying by 0.9 should be easily accurate enough for most recipes., There are many types of flour, but most brands of all-purpose, whole wheat, or bread flour fall pretty close to the same density. Because of the possibility of variation, however, add the flour to your recipe bit by bit, using less or more if necessary based on how the dough or mixture appears.


This measurement was calculated based on a density of 8.5 grams per tablespoon, and a conversion of 1 tbsp = 14.7868 mL., Most common foods can be converted using the aqua-calc food converter online. A milliliter is the same as a cubic centimeter, so select the ""cubic centimeter"" option, enter the volume in milliliters, then type in the food or ingredient you wish to convert.

Understand milliliters and volume.,
Understand grams and mass.,
Learn why you need to know which substance you are converting.,
Learn about density.",How to Convert Milliliters (mL) to Grams (g)2," Milliliters are a unit of volume, or amount of space. One milliliter of water, one milliliter of gold, or one milliliter of air will all take up the same amount of space. If you crush an object to make it smaller and denser, this will change its volume. About twenty drops of water, or 1/5 of a teaspoon, have a volume of one milliliter.The milliliter is abbreviated mL.

, Grams are a unit of mass, or amount of matter. If you crush an object to make it smaller and denser, this will not change its mass. A paper clip, sugar packet, or raisin all weigh about one gram.The gram is often used as a unit of weight, and it can be measured using a scale in everyday situations. Weight is a measurement of the force of gravity on mass. If you traveled to space, you would still have the same mass (amount of matter), but you would no longer have any weight, since there would be no gravity.
The gram is abbreviated g.

, Since these units measure different things, there is no quick formula to convert between them. You have to find the formula based on the object you are measuring. For example, the amount of molasses that fits into a one milliliter container will weigh a different amount than the amount of water that fits into a one milliliter container.

, Density measures how closely the matter in an object is packed together. We can understand density in everyday life even without measuring it. If you pick up a metal ball and are surprised at how heavy it is for its size, that's because it has high density, packing a lot of matter into a small space. If you pick up a crumpled ball of paper of the same size, you can throw it around easily. The paper ball has low density. Density is measured in mass per unit volume. For instance, how much mass in grams fits into one milliliter volume. This is why it can be used to convert between the two measurements.

"
"
Look up the substance's density.,
Convert the density into g/mL if necessary.,
Multiply the volume in milliliters by the density.",How to Convert Milliliters (mL) to Grams (g)3," As described above, density is mass per unit volume. If you are answering a math or chemistry problem, it may tell you what the substance's density is. Otherwise, search for the substance's density online or on a chart.


Use this chart to look up the density of any pure element. (Note that 1 cm3 = 1 milliliter.)
Use this document to look up the density of many foods and beverages. For items that only have a ""specific gravity"" listed, that number equals the density in g/mL at 4ºC (39ºF), and will typically be reasonably close for substances at roughly room temperature.
For other substances, type the name of the substance and ""density"" into a search engine.

, Sometimes, the density is given in units other than g/mL. If the density is written in g/cm3, no changes are necessary, since a cm3 is exactly equal to 1 mL. For other units, try an online density conversion calculator, or do the math yourself:


Multiply the density in kg/m3 (kilograms per cubic meter) by 0.001 to get the density in g/mL.
Multiply the density in lb/gallon (pounds per U.S. gallon) by 0.120 to get the density in g/mL.

, Multiply the mL measurement of your substance by its density in g/mL. This gives you an answer in (g x mL) / mL, but you can cancel the mL units at the top and bottom and end up with just g, or grams.


For example, to convert 10 mL of ethanol to grams, look up the density of ethanol: 0.789 g/mL.Multiply 10 mL by 0.789 g/ml, and get 7.89 grams. Now you know that 10 milliliters of ethanol weighs 7.89 grams.

There are 1,609.344 meters in one mile.Although there are different definitions of miles (such as a nautical mile), this conversion refers to a “statute mile,” sometimes called a ""land mile."" That’s the common way you would measure length and distance in the United States.
Convert mile to meter by using this formula: mi X 1,609.344= m (miles multiplied by 1,609.344 equals meters).
To convert meters to mile, use this formula: m/1,609.344=mi (meters divided by 1,609.344 equals miles).;
, Since both meters and miles start with the letter “m,” it’s important you know which symbol is which before doing mathematical calculations.


The symbol for mile is “mi.” The word “mile” derives from the Latin word for 1,000 since the mile originally was said to be 1,000 paces or 2,000 steps.The letter ""m"" is the symbol for meter. A mile equals 5,280 feet.
The other U.S. Customary Units/Imperial Units of Length are inches, feet, and yards. The Metric system also uses millimeters, centimeters, decimeters, hectometers, and kilometers.
Be aware that meter is often written as metre, but the measurement is the same (1 metre equals 1 meter). Meters are a unit for measuring length, as are miles. The plural form is metres., Nautical miles are a unit of length that is used in marine navigation. It’s equal to a minute of arc along a meridian of the earth.


One international nautical mile equals 1,852 meters or 1,151 statute miles. The formula for converting U.S. nautical miles into meters is m=USnmi/0.00053996 (meters equals U.S. nautical miles divided by 0.00053996).There are many online calculators available to convert nautical miles to meters., One of the easiest ways to change miles to meters is to use an online calculator. There are many such options online.Most of the online calculators ask you to put in the miles and then hit a button that says something like “convert.”You will then be provided the number of meters in the number of miles you inputted.

, You can also find miles to meters conversion tables online.


For example, such tables will report that 10 miles is equal to 16,093.44 meters and that 21 miles is equal to 33,796.224 meters, and so forth.

It's not perfect, eight miles is actually 12.875 kilometers, but it's close enough in a pinch for an approximate equivalent.

, Okay, it's a number that's not seen in the Fibonacci sequence, but you can just break up your miles as a sum of Fibonacci numbers, then convert each of those to kilometers, and add those kilometer answers -- odd but true. It works.


Break 100, for example, into a sum: 89 + 8 + 3, each must be a number of our Fibonacci list as was stated.
Add their conversion as the next numbers for each which are the 144, 13, and 5, which add up to 162. Ah ha: 100 miles or mph (miles per hour) is actually more nearly equal to 160.9344km or kmph (kilometer per hour). Again, that's close enough for personal use, driving and traveling.

, Write that conversion factor down and keep it -- or forget it (maybe look it up each time).

, Break 60 miles, for example, into 55 + 5, each is a number in our Fibonacci list as was stated.


Add their conversion as the next numbers for each which are the 89 and 8, which add up to 97. 60 miles (or miles per hour) is actually equal to approximately 96.56km or kmph, close enough; as you see, it works.

Write the number of miles.,
Multiply by 1.6.,
For precise conversions, multiply by 1.60934.,
To get back to miles, divide by 1.6.",How to Convert Miles to Kilometers1," In this section, you'll learn how to get kilometers from miles. Start by writing the number of miles you want to convert. If you're using a calculator, type it in.


Let's follow along with an example. If we want to convert 50 miles into kilometers, we would start by writing it out like this: 50 miles.;
, Your answer will be the number of kilometers in miles. That's all there is to it!


In our example, we can find the answer like this: 50 × 1.6 = 80 kilometers.
Don't forget the ""kilometers"" label. You can also write ""km"" for short. If you're doing this for homework, you may lose points if you leave it off.
If you need help multiplying decimals, see WikiHow's How to Multiply Decimals.

, One mile isn't exactly 1.6 kilometers. It's actually about 1.609347218694. This is the official U.S. Survey definition.Use as much of this number as you want to get your answer more precise.


If we want to know exactly how far 50 miles is in kilometers, we can just multiply 50 by 1.609347. This gets us 50 × 1.609347 = 80.46735 kilometers — about half a kilometer more.
You only need to do this for really precise conversions. Just use 1.6 for basic purposes!

, Getting back to miles is easy. Since dividing is basically the opposite of multiplying, divide by 1.6 to ""undo"" the multiplication.


In our original example, 80/1.6 = 50 miles — right back where we started.
If you used a different decimal than 1.6, divide by it instead. In our alternate example above, we would divide by 1.609347.

Write the number of miles as a fraction over one.,
Write a fraction with the ratio of kilometers to miles.,
Multiply and cancel units that show up both on top and on bottom.,
Use the units that are left for your answer.,
Continue this pattern to build more complicated conversions.",How to Convert Miles to Kilometers2," By treating your measurements like fractions, you can convert in a way that makes it easy to get the right answer (and units) every time. Start by writing your number of miles as the top part of a fraction (the numerator). In the bottom part of the fraction (the denominator), write a 1.


Let's say that we want to figure out how many kilometers are in 5.4 miles. In this case, we would write a fraction like this: 5.4 miles/1.
When you're converting this way, always include the units in the fractions. They will be important later., Now, you want to make a fraction that shows how many kilometers are in a mile. This is a lot easier than it sounds — see below for help.


We already know that there are about 1.6 kilometers in a mile. We can use this to build our fraction. In the numerator (the top part), we would write ""1.6 kilometers"" and in the denominator (the bottom part), we would write ""1 mile."" This gives us 1.6 kilometers/1 mile.

, Now, just multiply the two fractions. See our article on multiplying fractions if you need help. As you multiply, look for units that show up once in the numerator and once in the denominator. When you find a pair, cross both out.


In our example, we have 5.4 miles/1 × 1.6 kilometers/1 mile. ""Mile"" appears on top in the first fraction and on the bottom in the second, so we can cross both ""miles"" out. Multiplying, we get 8.64.

, In the last step, you should have crossed out all of the units except for one. These are the units in your answer.


In our example, ""kilometers"" are the only units not crossed out, so we know our answer is 8.64 kilometers.

, Now that you know how to do easy conversions, you can use the same approach for longer ones. Just follow the same steps. Write your starting measurement as a fraction over 1, then write your conversions as fractions so that your units cancel (except for the units you want your answer in) and multiply.For example, let's say that you want to know what 5.4 miles is in centimeters. You don't know the conversion for miles to centimeters, but you do know that there are 1.6 kilometers in a mile, 1,000 meters in a kilometer, and 100 centimeters in a meter. This is all you need to set up your problem:



5.4 miles/1 × 1.6 kilometers/1 mile × 1000 meters/1 kilometer × 100 centimeters/1 meter




Notice that all of the units cancel except for centimeters (because it only appears once). Multiplying through, your final answer is 864,000 centimeters.

Learn that one meter equals 3.28 feet.,
Multiply any meter measurement by 3.28 to convert to feet.,
Convert your answer to include inches (optional).",How to Convert Meters to Feet2," One meter is a length measurement, equal to 3.28 feet.You can test this using a meter stick and 1 foot (12 inch) rulers. Lay the meter stick on the ground, and place the rulers end-to-end next to it. Three rulers (3 feet) will almost be as long as the meter stick. If you add a fourth ruler, you'll be able to measure that extra distance: 0.28 ft, which is a little more than three inches.


If you need to be super precise, you can use 1 meter = 3.28084 feet. Because this is extremely close to 3.28 feet, though, you'll almost always want to use the simpler number to make the math easier.

, Since one meter = 3.28 feet, you can convert any meter measurement into feet by multiplying it by 3.28. If you're not sure how to do this, read about multiplying decimals. Here are some examples. If you want, you can try to do the multiplication on your own and see if you get the right answer:


1 meter x 3.28 = 3.28 feet

5 meters x 3.28 = 16.4 feet

2.7 meters x 3.28 = 8.856 feet


, For most math problems, all you need is the answer you got in the last step. But if you are curious how long something is, an answer like ""8.856 feet"" might not mean much to you. Try taking the decimal point and everything after it, then multiplying that by 12 to turn it into inches. This works because 1 foot = 12 inches. It's a conversion just like the one we used for meters and feet. Here are some examples:


3.28 feet = 3 feet + 0.28 feet. Because 0.28 feet x 12 = 3.36, that means 3.28 feet = 3 feet and 3.36 inches

16.4 feet = 16 feet + 0.4 feet. Because 0.4 feet x 12 = 4.8, that means 16.4 feet = 16 feet and 4.8 inches

8.856 feet = 8 feet + 0.856 feet. Because 0.856 feet x 12 = 10.272, so 8.856 feet = 10 feet and 10.272 inches

Understand square meters.,
Understand why you need to use square feet.,
Multiple square meters by 10.8 to get square feet.",How to Convert Meters to Feet3," Square meters, often written as m2, are a measurement of area. Area is used to measure two-dimensional surfaces, like the floor of a room, or a sports field. One square meter is a unit of area equal to a square that is one meter long and one meter wide. You can convert units of area only to other units of area, never to units of length. In this method, we'll convert from square meters (m2) to square feet (ft2).


A square foot is a unit of area equal to a square one foot long and one foot wide.

, Converting from square meters to square feet works fine. It's like saying ""I know four of these big squares will cover this floor. How many small squares will?"" You can't convert to units measured with a ruler (like ordinary feet), because that's like asking ""How long of a ruler would I need to cover the floor?"" No matter how long a straight ruler gets, it can't cover a floor.

, One square meter can fit 10.8 square feet inside it. This means you can multiply any m2 measurement by 10.8 to get the same measurement in ft2.


If you need to be extra precise, multiply by 10.764 instead."
"
Understand cubic meters.,
Multiply cubic meters by 35.3 to get cubic feet.",How to Convert Meters to Feet4," A cubic meter is written m3. It is a unit of volume, which measures space in three dimensions. You can use cubic meters to measure the amount of air in a room, or the amount of water in an aquarium. A cubic meter is an amount of volume equal to a cube one meter long, one meter wide, and one meter tall.


Similarly, a cubic foot (ft3) is equal to a cube one foot long, one foot wide, and one foot tall.

, One cubic meter can fit 35.3 cubic feet inside of it. Notice how this number is bigger than the conversion used above for m2 or plain old meters? That's because you're multiplying the difference three times when you're in three dimensions. The cubic meter is 3.28 times longer than the cubic foot, but it's also 3.28 times wider and 3.28 times taller. 3.28 x 3.28 x 3.28 = 35.3, so the cubic meter is 35.3 times bigger by volume than the cubic foot.


To be more precise, multiply by 35.315 instead."

Place the value in liters/100 kilometer (represented by ""l/100 km"" in the formula) that you want to convert to miles/gallon to replace the blank space below.,
Perform the above calculations to get the end result in miles/gallon or mpg.,
For those looking for an in-depth explanation...,
Below is an example using the formula above to convert 10 liters/100 km to mpg.,
Make a direct conversion, you can divide 235.214 by the number of l/100 km.",How to Convert Liters/100 Kilometer to Mpg," This is based on the fact that 1l/100km = 235.214mpg (that means that if 1 liter could go 100 km then 1 gallon would go 235.214 miles). Notice using an italics l so it is easier to tell which is the letter l versus number 1:


______ l/100 km

*

1 g/100 km
3.7854 l/100 km

*

        1        x g/100 km
*

62.1371 mpg 1 100 km/g

=
 ? mpg

;
, Note the 1/(x g/100km) represents the reciprocal of x g/100 , which was found by the preceding two calculation and then inverting that with 1/x which represents a common button on calculators for reciprocal, l/100 km and miles.

,
The first operation we perform in the formula is to change the volume in gallons to liters. We use the common conversion factor of: 1 gal per 3.78541178 l in the ratio
The next multiplication is to take the reciprocal of the current value. We do this because our current units (gallons/100 kilometer) -- like reading divide as ""/"" as ""per"" -- is volume/distance and our end result needs to be miles/gallon which is distance/volume.
The final step is to convert kilometers to miles. We use the common conversion factor of 1 km = 0.62137119 mi, although in our case we are dealing with 100 km, so we multiple 0.621371 by 100 to get the conversion value of 62.1371

, You can use this to check your work.

10 l/100 km

*

1 g/100 km
3.7854 l/100 km

*

        1    x g/100 km
*

62.1371 mpg 1 100 km/g

Convert every kilogram to 2.2 pounds.,
Multiply your weight in kilograms by 2.2 to get your weight in pounds.,
Use a more precise conversion.,
Estimate the conversion in your head.",How to Convert Metric Weight to Pounds1," A kilogram is a unit of weight equal to 2.2 pounds: 1kg = 2.2 lbs. This means that 2 kg = 4.4 lbs, 3 kg = 6.6 lbs, and so on.


1kg∗2.2lbkg=2.2lbs{\displaystyle 1kg*2.2{\frac {lb}{kg}}=2.2lbs}

Kilograms are abbreviated kg and pounds are abbreviated lbs.
;
, Since each kilogram is 2.2 pounds, all you have to do is multiply the number of kilograms by this number to get your weight in pounds:


100kg=2.2lbkg∗100kg=220lbs{\displaystyle 100kg=2.2{\frac {lb}{kg}}*100kg=220lbs}


38kg=2.2lbkg∗38kg=83.6lbs{\displaystyle 38kg=2.2{\frac {lb}{kg}}*38kg=83.6lbs}


69.42kg=2.2lbkg∗69.42kg=152.724lbs{\displaystyle 69.42kg=2.2{\frac {lb}{kg}}*69.42kg=152.724lbs}


, One kilogram is actually slightly heavier than 2.2 pound. This difference is so small that it doesn't matter in everyday life. If precision is very important, such as in a chemical reaction, use a more precise conversion:


1kilogram=2.20462pounds{\displaystyle 1kilogram=2.20462pounds}, Quickly, without a calculator — what is 78.4 kilograms converted into pounds? The following estimation methods will help you get a close answer if you just need to approximate something, though you should remember they aren't always accurate:Rounding up and down: Round to the closest number you can easily multiply for a rough estimate. In this example, round 78.4 kg to 80 kg, and 2.2 lb/kg to 2 lb/kg:

Estimated Answer: 80 kg * 2 lb/kg = 160 lbs.




Double Decimals: Remember that 78.4∗2.2=(78.4∗2)+(78.4∗0.2){\displaystyle 78.4*2.2=(78.4*2)+(78.4*0.2)} This is still pretty difficult, so round 78.4 to the nearest whole number to get (78 * 2) + (78 * 0.2). Multiply 78 by 2 to get 156. For the second part, you can use the same result (156), then just slide the decimal one place to the left: 156 becomes 15.6. Add the two results together and voila!

Estimated Answer: (78 * 2) + (78 * 0.2) = 156 + (156 * 0.1) = 156 + 15.6 = 171.6 lb




Actual Answer (for comparison): 78.4 kg * 2.2 lb/kg = 172.48 lbs.

Convert between metric weights with powers of ten.,
Convert your measurement into kilograms by moving the decimal the appropriate direction.,
Multiply your converted kilograms by 2.2 to change them into pounds.",How to Convert Metric Weight to Pounds2," The basic metric unit of weight is the gram. All other metric units of weight are equal to the gram multiplied by a power of ten, as described by the prefix. For example, ""kilo-"" means 1000, and a kilogram weighs exactly 1000 grams. ""Milli"" means ""1/1000,"" so each milligram is one one-thousandth the weight of a gram (thus, 1000 milligrams = 1 gram).


1kilogram=1,000grams{\displaystyle 1kilogram=1,000grams}


1milligram=11000gram{\displaystyle 1milligram={\frac {1}{1000}}gram} = 0.001 grams

This article uses American notation, writing decimal marks with a period (.).


, Converting between metric units doesn't even require arithmetic. Instead, move the decimal point one place to the left to divide by 10, or one space to the right to multiply by 10. Here's an example:

To convert 450 grams into kilograms, first work out the conversion for a single gram: 1000 grams = 1 kg, so therefore 1 gram = 11000{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1000}}} kg → 1 gram = 0.001 kg.

The conversion from 1 gram to 0.001 kg involves moving the decimal place to the left three times (1 → 0.1 → 0.01 → 0.001).

Do the same to convert your measurement from grams to kilograms. Start with 450 grams, move the decimal to the left three times, and you get 0.45. Therefore 450 grams = 0.45 kg.


, Once you've got your measurement in kilograms, the process is the same as described in the section above. Simply multiply the kilograms by 2.2 to convert them into pounds. In the last example above, multiply 0.45 kg * 2.2 lb/kg = 0.99 lb. Here's another example to show you the whole process from start to finish:


Convert 3045 grams into pounds.

First, convert grams into kilograms:1 gram = 0.001 kg3045 g = 3.045 kg

Next, convert kilograms to pounds:1 kg = 2.2 lb3.045 kg * 2.2 lb/kg = 6.699 lb

List the number of yards you want to convert.,
Multiply your number of meters by 1.0936 to get the number of yards.,
Provide your ""units"" at the end to complete the problem.,
Use more or less decimal places to get more or less precise answers.",How to Convert Meters to Yards1," A simple conversion from meters to yards is nothing but a simple multiplication problem. All you need to do is start with your number of meters, then multiply.

Ex. Convert 12 meters into yards.
;
, There are 1.0936 yards in every meter. So if 1 meter is 1.0963 yards, then 2 meters is 2.1872, and so on. The easiest way to add all of this at once is through multiplication:Ex. Convert 12 meters into yards.

Ex. 12m∗1.0936metersyards=13.1234{\displaystyle 12m*1.0936{\frac {meters}{yards}}=13.1234}


, In the example, you determined the answer was ""13.1234."" But on a test or a project you need to be sure to answer the simple question, ""13.1234 of what?"" The answer, of course, is 13.1234 yards, but don't forget to add these units to get full credit.

Ex. Convert 12 meters into yards.

Ex. 12m∗1.0936metersyards=13.1234{\displaystyle 12m*1.0936{\frac {meters}{yards}}=13.1234}

Ex. 12meters=13.1234yards{\displaystyle 12meters=13.1234yards}


, The formula ""1 meter = 1.0936 yards"" is simply an approximation, as the real conversion is an infinite string of decimals. The more decimal points you use, the more precise the conversion will be, though there are only rare cases where four decimal places won't be enough. For example, you could also use the following


Rough Calculation: 1 meter = 1.1 yards


Approximate Calculation: 1 meter = 1.0936 yards


Extra Precise Calculation: 1 meter = 1.0936133 yards"
"
Understand that, for estimation purposes, 1 meter = 1.1 yards.,
Write down your number of meters, followed by a plus sign.,
Multiply your number of meters by .1 by moving the decimal one place to the right.,
Add the .1 to your original number of meters to get your final answer.,
Consider subtracting away your overestimation for an even more precise calculation.",How to Convert Meters to Yards2," As noted above, the actual conversion is closer to 1.0936 yards, but you should round up this number to make it easier to calculate by hand. While 1.1 slightly overshoots the actual conversion, it is only by .0064 yards -- not enough to throw off a basic estimation.

Though this method is close, remember that you are slightly overestimating -- your final answer will be slightly larger than the actual conversion., Meters and yards are almost the exact same length. The difference is in the .1, which is easy to calculate. Since anything multiplied by 1 is itself (1∗15=15{\displaystyle 1*15=15}, all you need to do is find the .1 portion and add it to your number of meters.

Ex. Estimate the number of yards in 15 meters?

Ex. 15 meters = 15 yards + ?


, Simply take your number of meters and shift the decimal over one place -- this is the exact same thing as ""multiplying by .1"" So, for the example problem:

Ex. Estimate the number of yards in 15 meters?

Ex. 15meters=15yards+{\displaystyle 15meters=15yards+} ?

Ex. 15meters∗.1=1.5{\displaystyle 15meters*.1=1.5}


, The only math you really have to do is addition! Once you've moved the decimal over, simply add this number to the original number of meters. Thus:

Ex. Estimate the number of yards in 15 meters?

Ex. 15meters=15yards+{\displaystyle 15meters=15yards+} ?

Ex. 15meters∗.1=1.5{\displaystyle 15meters*.1=1.5}

Ex. 15meters=15yards+1.5{\displaystyle 15meters=15yards+1.5}


15meters=16.5yards{\displaystyle 15meters=16.5yards}


, The actual conversion of 15 meters is 16.4042 yards, meaning the estimation was only about .1 yards off. Note that this difference is only going to get bigger with bigger calculations -- 150 meters would estimate to 165 yards, but that's 1.6 yards off from the actual conversion. A good way to eliminate this over-estimation easily is to subtract .1 for every ten yards:

In the first example, you have 16.5 yards. To correct it, you can subtract .1, because there is only one ""10"" in 16. Your final answer is 16.4 yards

For the bigger example, you'd subtract 1.6 yards, because there are sixteen ""10s"" in 165. Your final answer is 163.4 yards."

Write the number of meters, and place your pencil on the decimal point.,
Move your pencil three places to the right.",How to Convert Meters to Millimeters1," If this measurement is not given to you, you will need to measure using a meter stick or tape measure.

The length of one meter stick is equal to 1 meter.

A meter stick is NOT the same as a yardstick. There are 3 feet in a yard, but there are about 3.28 feet in one meter. You will know a measurement is in meters because it will be labeled m{\displaystyle m}.

For example, if the length of a floor is 4 meter sticks long, it is 4m{\displaystyle 4m} long.
;
, Often you will see meters stated in decimals. These means you have a partial meter to convert. If you are measuring, use the centimeter (cm{\displaystyle cm}) or millimeter (mm{\displaystyle mm}) units on the meter stick or tape measure.

For example, if you measure something that is 4 meters long, plus 30 centimeters, it is 4.3 meters long, because there are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. If you measure something that is 4 meters long, plus 30 millimeters, it is 4.03 meters long, because there are 1000 millimeters in a meter., To convert meters to millimeters you need to multiply. Since the metric system is based on multiples of ten, the easiest way to do this is by moving the decimal point to the right.For example, if you are converting 4.3m{\displaystyle 4.3m}, write 4.3{\displaystyle 4.3} and place your pencil on the decimal point.


, Since there are 1,000 millimeters per meter, you need to multiply by 1,000 to convert from meters to millimeters.For example, if your floor is 4.3m{\displaystyle 4.3m} long, you would move your pencil three decimal places to the right, adding two zeros to the number. This gives you 4,300mm{\displaystyle 4,300mm}.

You could also use a calculator or use the standard multiplication algorithm to calculate 4.3×1,000{\displaystyle 4.3\times 1,000}.

On a standard American ruler, millimeters can be measured with the smallest lines on the metric (cm{\displaystyle cm}) side.

Make sure you measure millimeters (small lines) and not centimeters (numbered lines).

You will know a measurement is in millimeters because it will be labeled mm{\displaystyle mm}.

For example, the length of a pencil might be 155mm{\displaystyle 155mm} long.


, Place your pencil on the decimal point. To convert millimeters to meters, you need to divide. Since the metric system is based on multiples of ten, the easiest way to do this is by moving the decimal point to the left.For example, if you are converting 155mm{\displaystyle 155mm}, write 155.0{\displaystyle 155.0} and place your pencil on the decimal point.


, Since there are 1,000 millimeters per meter, you need to divide by 1,000 to convert from millimeters to meters.For example, if your pencil is 155.0mm{\displaystyle 155.0mm} long, you would move your pencil three decimal places to the left. This gives you .155m{\displaystyle .155m}.

Written as an equation, this relationship is represented as: 1 in = 25.4 mm

This official, standardized measurement has been set on international records since 1959.
Both inches and millimeters are units of measurement. Inches belong to the English system of measurement, while millimeters belong to the metric system of measurement.
While inches are used in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, you will often need to convert this unit of measurement to one belonging to the metric system (like millimeters) for scientific purposes.
Conversely, there are 0.0393700787402 inches in one millimeter.;
, To convert a measurement taken in inches, you need to begin the problem by writing down the original measurement.


This measurement will then be converted into millimeters by comparing it to the relationship between inches and millimeters.

Example: 7 inches

, You need to multiply the current inches measurement by the ratio of millimeters to inches, or 25.4 mm / 1 in.


The inches value in this ratio needs to be placed in the denominator since it will have to cancel out the inches value in your original measurement. Once all the inches are canceled out, the millimeters will be the only remaining unit of measurement.

Example: 7 in * (25.4 mm / 1 in) = 177.8 mm * (in/in) = 177.8 mm

, If you did the problem correctly, the answer you come up with should be your final answer in millimeters.



Example: 177.8 mm

, One ruler is 12 inches long or 1 foot. Many rulers list the inches on one side but also list centimeters and millimeters on the other side. If your original measurement is 12 inches or below, you can use one of these rulers to measure the same distance in millimeters.

Find other conversions for kilometers.",How to Convert Kilometers to Miles4," It’s too hard for most people to multiply any number by .062137119. There is a way you can do the calculation in your head.


Let’s say the number of kilometers is 144. Halve it. That gets you 72. Then take a quarter of the half. That’s 18.
Now, add the two together, the half and the quarter: 72 plus 18 in this case. You get 90. That’s the answer., This one's unusual, but it works. These numbers are a series of numbers in which each subsequent number is the sum of the two before.Start with two consecutive Fibonacci numbers. For example, the numbers 5 and 8. There are 8 kilometers in 5 miles. To convert back, read the result in the other direction, as there are 5 miles in 8 km.
This works as an estimate only. For example, take the consecutive Fibonacci numbers 21 and 34. This would tell you there are 34 kilometers in 21 miles and vice versa, when the exact answer is 33.79 kilometers.
In order to convert a number that isn't a Fibonacci number, express the original number as a sum of Fibonacci numbers and do the conversion for each Fibonacci number separately. Say you want to convert 100 miles to kilometers. Number 100 could be a sum of Fibonacci numbers 89 + 8 + 3. The Fibonacci number following 89 is 144, the Fibonacci number following 8 is 13 and Fibonacci number following 3 is 5. So add 144 + 13 + 5 = 162 kilometers in 100 miles.

, Perhaps you don't want to stop with miles. There are many other conversions for kilometers.


Every kilometer is equal to 39,370.07874 inches, 3,280.839895 feet,1,093.613298 yards, and 100,000 centimeters.
Every kilometer is equal to 1,000 meters.

, Whenever it might be unclear which system you're using, use a decimal subscript number to denote the base. For example, 1710 means ""17 in base ten"" (an ordinary decimal number). 1710 = 1116, or ""11 in base sixteen"" (hexadecimal). You can skip this if your number has an alphabetic character in it, such as B or E. No one will mistake that for a decimal number.

, Hexadecimal was adopted in the first place because it's so easy to convert between the two. Essentially, hexadecimal is used as a way to display binary information in a shorter string. This chart is all you need to convert from one to the other:

, It really is as simple as changing the digit into the four equivalent binary digits. Here are a few hex numbers for you to convert. Highlight the invisible text to the right of the equal sign to check your work:


A23 = 1010 0010 0011

BEE = 1011 1110 1110

70C558 = 0111 0000 1100 0101 0101 1000


, In the ""base two"" binary system, n binary digits can be used to represent 2n different numbers. For example, with four binary digits, you can represent 24 = 16 different numbers. Since hexadecimal is a base sixteen system, a one digit number can be used to represent 161 = 16 different numbers. This makes conversion between the two systems extremely easy.


You can also think of this as the counting systems ""flipping over"" to another digit at the same time. Hexadecimal counts ""...D, E, F, 10"" at the same time binary counts ""1101, 1110, 1111, 10000"".

, You use decimal notation every day without having to stop and think about the meaning, but when you first learned it, your parent or teacher might have explained it to you in more detail. A quick review of how ordinary numbers are written will help you convert the number:


Each digit in a decimal number is in a certain ""place."" Moving from right to left, there's the ""ones place,"" ""tens place,"" ""hundreds place,"" and so on. The digit 3 just means 3 if it's in the ones place, but it represents 30 when located in the tens place, and 300 in the hundreds place.
To put it mathematically, the ""places"" represent 100, 101, 102, and so on. This is why this system is called ""base ten,"" or ""decimal"" after the Latin word for ""tenth.""

, This will probably seem obvious, but it's the same process we'll use to convert a hexadecimal number, so it's a good starting point. Let's rewrite the number 480,13710. (Remember, the subscript 10 tells us the number is written in base ten.):


Starting with the rightmost digit, 7 = 7 x 100, or 7 x 1
Moving left, 3 = 3 x 101, or 3 x 10
Repeating for all digits, we get 480,137 = 4x100,000 + 8x10,000 + 0x1,000 + 1x100 + 3x10 + 7x1.

, Since hexadecimal is base sixteen, the ""place values"" correspond to the powers of sixteen. To convert to decimal, multiply each place value by the corresponding power of sixteen. Start this process by writing the powers of sixteen next to the digits of a hexadecimal number. We'll do this for the hexadecimal number C92116. Start on the right with 160, and increase the exponent each time you move left to the next digit:


116 = 1 x 160 = 1 x 1 (All numbers are in decimal except where noted.)
216 = 2 x 161 = 2 x 16
916 = 9 x 162 = 9 x 256
C = C x 163 = C x 4096

, Numerical digits are the same in decimal or hexadecimal, so you don't need to change them (for instance, 716 = 710). For alphabetic characters, refer to this list to change them to the decimal equivalent:


A = 10
B = 11
C = 12 (We'll use this on our example from above.)
D = 13
E = 14
F = 15

, Now that everything is written in decimal, perform each multiplication problem and add the results together. A calculator will be handy for most hexadecimal numbers. Continuing our example from earlier, here's C921 rewritten as a decimal formula and solved:



C92116 = (in decimal) (1 x 1) + (2 x 16) + (9 x 256) + (12 x 4096)
= 1 + 32 + 2,304 + 49,152.
= 51,48910. The decimal version will usually have more digits than the hexadecimal version, since hexadecimal can store more information per digit.

, Here are a few numbers to convert from hexadecimal into decimal. Once you've worked out the answer, highlight the invisible text to the right of the equal sign to check your work:


3AB16 = 93910

A1A116 = 4137710

500016 = 2048010

500D16 = 2049310

18A2F16 = 10091110

For on-the-fly mental calculations, round your conversion factor to an easier value.",How to Convert Inches to Centimeters3," This may seem like a no-brainer, but it's important to remember, especially when dealing with mixed measurements of feet and inches, which are often denoted by apostrophe markings, like this: 6'2"". Remember that in such measurements the number marked by the single apostrophe is feet, each of which contains 12 inches.


For example, in the example above, 6'2"", we would multiply 6 feet by 12 inches/foot to get 72 inches total. To this we'll add the extra two inches from our measurement to get a final value of 74 inches.

This conversion factor will get you an accurate answer in centimeters and satisfy most ""show your work"" requirements, if you're a student. Simply place your value for inches into the blank at the beginning of the conversion factor and multiply through.


This conversion factor will also get you the correct units. Note that the ""inches"" label in the denominator of the conversion factor cancels with the ""inches"" label of the value you plug in, leaving only the ""centimeters"" label in the numerator of the conversion factor for your final answer.
Let's try plugging our example of 74 inches into the conversion factor.

(74 inches × 2.54 centimeters)/(1 inch)
(187.96 inches × centimeters)/(1 inch)
We cancel the ""inch"" labels because they appear once in both the numerator and the denominator, leaving us with a final answer of 187.96 centimeters.



, If you're not interested in showing your work for academic purposes, all you need to do to convert inches to centimeters is multiply your inches value by 2.54 on a calculator. This is essentially the same as performing the calculations in the formula above, and will get you the same result in centimeters.


For example, if we want to know the value of 6 inches in centimeters, we would just multiply 6 × 2.54 = 15.24 cm.

, If you don't have a calculator handy, it's still possible to approximate an inches-to-centimeters conversion by using a ""rounder"" conversion factor to make mental multiplication easier. Instead of using the precise conversion factor of 2.54 centimeters/1 inch, use 2.5 centimeters/1 inch. Note that this will cause your final answer to be slightly inaccurate, so this method is only suitable for situations in which loose estimations are acceptable.


For instance, let's convert 31 inches to centimeters using this quick estimation method:

2.5 × 30 = 75. 2.5 × 1 = 2.5
75 + 2.5 = 77.5 centimeters.
Note that if we had used the precise conversion factor of 2.54 centimeters/1 inch, our answer would have been 78.74 centimeters. These two answers differ by 1.24 centimeters, or about 1.5%.

,How to Convert Inches to Feet1,
"
Start with your number of inches.,
Divide this number by twelve.,
Write your answer in feet.,
Get back to inches by multiplying by 12.,
Use the same steps for decimals and fractions.",How to Convert Inches to Feet2," Write this number down or type it into your calculator. If you wrote it down, be sure to label it ""inches.""


Let's follow along with an example problem. If we want to figure out how tall a 70 inch-tall girl is in feet, we'll start by writing down 70 inches.

, You're looking for the number of times that 12 fits inside your number of inches. If it fits exactly into your inches a certain number of times, you'll get a whole number as your answer. If it doesn't fit perfectly into your number of inches, you'll get a decimal, a fraction, or a mixed number.


In our example, dividing 70 inches by 12 gets us 70 / 12 = 5.83. We can also write this as 5 & 10/12 (5 & 5/6) or 5 remainder 10. See below for more information on remainders.

, The answer you just got is the number of feet you were looking for. Label it ""feet."" If you're doing this for school, you may lose points if you forget the label.


The answer we got was 5.83, so we would write it as 5.83 feet. The girl is 5.83 feet tall.

, Once you have a feet measurement, just multiply by 12 to get back to feet. Since multiplying is basically dividing backwards, you'll end up with your original number of inches.


In our example problem, 5.83 × 12 = 70 inches. This was our original number of inches.

, Inches aren't always written as whole numbers. If you have an inch measurement that's written as a fraction or decimal, use the same process as above. See WikiHow's guides on dividing decimals and dividing fractions if you need help.


Let's use an example problem to show how to do this. We'll figure out how many feet 15.4 inches and 15 & 2/5 inches are. These are the same numbers, just written differently.

Decimal: 15.4 / 12 = 1.28 feet


Fraction: 15 & 2/5 = (75 + 2)/5 = 77/5 inches.



77/5 inches / 12 = 77/5 × 1/12 = 77/60 feet, or 1 & 17/60 feet






"
"
Divide the number of inches by 12.,
Find the remainder.,
Use the whole number as the feet and the remainder as the inches.,
To get back to inches, multiply the feet by 12 and add the inches.",How to Convert Inches to Feet3," Instead of using fractions or decimals, feet measurements are often written as a mix of feet and inches. For instance, you might say that someone is ""five feet, nine inches tall"". Getting these ""feet and inches"" measurements is easy. Start by dividing by 12 — just like normal.


For this section, let's figure out how many feet 28 inches is. To start, we'll divide 28 by 12. 28 / 12 = 2.33.

, When you divide a number and it doesn't ""fit"" perfectly, you'll have a little bit left over. This is called the ""remainder."" For example, when you divide the number 16 by 5, 5 fits in three times, but not perfectly. There is still 1 ""left over."" This means the answer to 16 / 5 can be written 3 remainder (or ""R"") 1. Now, look for the remainder in your division problem.


In our example, 12 goes into 28 twice, plus some left over. 12 × 2 = 24. Since 28 is 4 more than 24, the remainder is 4. We could write our answer, 2.33, as 2 R 4.

, Once you know your whole number answer and its remainder, getting a ""feet and inches"" measurement is easy. Your whole number is the number of feet. Your remainder is the number of inches. Write your answer like this: "" x feet, y inches.""


In our example problem, we got an answer of 2 R 4. Since 2 is the whole number, we know we have two feet in our answer. Since 4 is the remainder, we know we have four inches. So, our answer is 2 feet, 4 inches.

, Getting back to inches for these kinds of measurements is just a little bit harder than normal. Start by multiplying the number of feet by 12. This will give you a number of inches. Now, just add the other number of inches to get an answer that's only in inches.


In our example, we would start by multiplying 2 feet by 12. 2 × 12 = 24 inches. Add the 4 inches to this to get 28 inches. This is our original inches measurement.

Convert 1 gram to .0022lbs.,
Multiply your number of grams to by .0022 to convert to pounds.,
Use a more precise conversion factor if you need a more precise measurement.",How to Convert Grams Into Pounds1," Every single gram is only about .2% of a pound, or .0022lbs. So, 1g=.0022lbs{\displaystyle 1g=.0022lbs}, and every additional gram adds another .0022 pounds. Thus, 2g=.0044lbs{\displaystyle 2g=.0044lbs}, 3=.0066lbs{\displaystyle 3=.0066lbs}, and so on. Thought of another way, this means there are .0022 pounds per gram.

If you remember that a kilogram weighs 2.2 pounds, this conversion is much easier. After all, 1 kilogram = 1000 grams. So, 1 gram must be one one-thousandth the weight of a kilogram, or .0022lbs.;
, This is all it takes. Simply multiply the grams by the pounds per gram, .0022, to convert everything simply into pounds


20g=lbs{\displaystyle 20g=lbs}


20g∗.0022lbsg{\displaystyle 20g*.0022{\frac {lbs}{g}}}

Get the perfect answer without a calculator by adding back 10% of your estimation.",How to Convert Grams Into Pounds2," Left without a calculator? You can still get a rough approximation of the conversion using basic math in place of long decimal division. This trick simply re-writes .0022 so that .0022=2.21000{\displaystyle .0022={\frac {2.2}{1000}}} Furthermore, you can simplify your estimation by simply using ""2"" instead of 2.2. You must remember, however, that this estimation will always underestimate the actual answer, an issue that gets bigger the bigger the number converted:


20g=lbs{\displaystyle 20g=lbs}


20g∗2=40{\displaystyle 20g*2=40}

249841000=24.98{\displaystyle {\frac {24984}{1000}}=24.98}


Estimated Answer: 24.98


, When simplifying the problem in the last step, you used .002 instead of .0022 to get an estimation. But .0022 is really just .002 + .0002 = .0022. You just figured out how to get .002 grams in your last step -- you simply multiply by 2, then divide by 1000. For the second half, you just multiply by 2 and divide by 10,000, giving you .0002. But you already did most of the work! Just divide your estimation by ten and then add this answer back to the estimation. Seen in full:


Convert 12492 grams to pounds:


1g=.0022lbs{\displaystyle 1g=.0022lbs}


.0022lbs=.002lbs+.0002lbs{\displaystyle .0022lbs=.002lbs+.0002lbs}




Step 1-- Find .002 lbs estimation


12492g∗2=24984{\displaystyle 12492g*2=24984}


249841000=24.98{\displaystyle {\frac {24984}{1000}}=24.98}




Step 2-- Find .0002 lbs estimation


24.9810=2.498{\displaystyle {\frac {24.98}{10}}=2.498}




Step 3 -- Add the two estimations together


24.98+2.498=27.48lbs{\displaystyle 24.98+2.498=27.48lbs}

Look at the nutrition label.,
Multiply the fat grams by nine.,
Calculate how many calories there are in the entire product.",How to Convert Grams to Calories1," Most food labels will list how many grams of fat there are for each serving of that specific product. This is how you will calculate the calories.;
, Every gram of fat contains nine calories. To figure out how many calories there are in the fat content, simply multiple the fat grams by nine.


For example, if there are ten grams of fat, you would multiple ten grams of fat by nine calories, for a total of 90 calories. This is how many calories there are in the fat grams.

, To figure out how many total calories there are in the fat content of a product, multiply the original number you received before, by the amount of servings there are on the label.


If a label states there are three servings, you would then multiply 90 by three, for a total of 270 calories.

Know that a carbohydrate is an organic compound.,
Check the nutrition label.,
Find out the number of calories that come from protein.",How to Convert Grams to Calories2," Carbohydrates are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They always contain calories (4 per gram), but calories do not automatically mean there are carbohydrates, because calories are in other macro-nutrients., You will see how many grams of carbohydrates there are per serving. Carbohydrates have four calories per gram. Multiply the number of carbohydrates by four to figure out how many calories there are.


For example, if a product had nine grams of carbohydrates, you would use the equation (9 x 4) to get a total of 36 calories. You would use four as your multiplier because there are four calories in every one gram of carbohydrate.

, Proteins are also listed in grams on food labels. Just like carbohydrates, protein carries four calories per gram. Again, multiply the number of protein grams by four to receive the number of calories.

One pound of body fat is equal to about 3500 calories.A gram and a calorie are different units of measure that can't be converted into one another.

, The quantity of calories per gram of food is dependent upon its ratio of macro-nutrients. The human body can derive energy (employ calories) from three main macro-nutrients: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.You can't weigh food and convert the grams into calories. You have to know how many calories there are in a specific type of macro-nutrient gram to calculate the total calories in it.

, Look on the label of the food your want to calculate the calories for. Each nutrient will be listed in grams. Once you find the one you are looking for, you can multiply that number by the number of calories that specific nutrient has in each gram."

Write the number of grams.,
Divide by 1,000.,
Label your answer.,
To get back to grams, multiply by 1,000.",How to Convert Grams to Kilograms1," Label it ""grams"" or ""g."" If you're using a calculator, just type the number in.


In this section, we'll follow along with an example problem to make things easier. Let's say that we want to convert 20,000 grams to kilograms. To start, we would write ""20,000 grams"" on our paper.;
, A kilogram is one thousand grams. This means that to get kilograms from grams, you just need to divide the number of grams by 1,000.


In our example, we would get kilograms by dividing 20,000 grams by 1,000.



20,000/1,000 = 20






, Don't forget this step! Labeling your answer with the proper units is important. If you're doing this conversion for schoolwork, you can lose points if you don't label. If you're doing it for something else, people may assume the wrong units.


In our case, we would label our answer with the label ""kilograms"" like this:




20 kilograms.





, As discussed above, a kilogram is one thousand grams. This means that if you ever want to get back to grams from kilograms, all you need to do is multiply the number of kilograms by 1,000. Since multiplications is basically the ""opposite"" operation as division, this will ""undo"" the division and give you grams.


To get 20 kilograms back to grams, we just multiply by 1,000 (don't forget to label your answer again):
20 kilograms × 1,000 = 20,000 grams


"
"
Start with your number of grams.,
Shift the decimal point three spaces to the left.,
Add zeroes in any empty spaces.,
To get back to grams, shift the decimal place back.",How to Convert Grams to Kilograms2," Believe it or not, you can convert between grams and kilograms without doing any math. This works because the metric system is a base 10 system of measurements. In other words, metric units are always a multiple of 10 apart from each other — there are 10 millimeters in a centimeter, 100 centimeters in a meter, 1,000 meters in a kilometer, and so on.


In this section, let's convert 37 grams to kilograms. We would begin the same way as in the section above, writing ""37 grams"" on our paper.

, Now, find the decimal point in your number of grams. If you're converting a whole number, this won't usually be written, but you can assume it its to the right of the ones place. Move the decimal point three spaces to the left. Each time you move past a number counts as one space. If you run out of numbers to move past, keep moving it, leaving blank spaces.


In our example, the decimal point in 37 grams is to the right of the 7 (i.e., 37 grams is the same as 37.0 grams). If we go one space at a time, moving the decimal point three spaces to the left looks like this:
37.

3.7

.37

._37 — note that we leave an empty space when we run out of numbers.

, You can't leave empty spaces in your answer, so fill in each one with a zero. You can also put a zero to the left of the decimal place if there aren't any numbers there, but this is optional — it just depends how you like to write your answers.


In our example, we have one empty space between the decimal point and the 3, so we'll fill it in with a zero like this:



.037




Adding the proper label (plus an extra zero to the left of the decimal point for presentation purposes), we get our final answer:
0.037 kilograms

, When you have kilograms, shifting the decimal place three spaces to the right will give you grams again. Fill in any empty spaces with zeroes as normal.


In our example, we can shift the decimal place three spaces to the right like this:



0.037
00.37
003.7
0037. — the zeroes on the left don't matter any more, so we can rewrite this as simply 37 grams.

Though Americans almost always measure height in feet, centimeters are much more common. For an example, say you are 180cm tall.It is almost always easier to convert to inches, then convert to feet later. However, you can directly convert to feet if you have a calculator, which may be more accurate, too.

To check your work, know now that 180cm is roughly 5'10 in feet.


, There are roughly .39 inches in every centimeter. If you are calculating by hand and need an easier approximation, you could even multiply by .4, though you will not be as accurate. Note that this answer to this equation is always smaller than the original number of centimeters.


180cm∗.39incm=70.2inches{\displaystyle 180cm*.39{\frac {in}{cm}}=70.2inches}

The fraction above stands for ""inches per centimeter.""


, There are twelve inches in each foot, and the example has 70.2 total inches. If your divide 70.2 by 12, you get 5.85ft, but be careful -- the decimal is not the number of inches. Since 12∗5=60{\displaystyle 12*5=60}, and 12∗6=72,{\displaystyle 12*6=72,} you know that the height must be above 5ft but below 6ft. So, if you have 5 full feet in 70.2"", than 60 of your inches are accounted for. You just have to deal with the last 10.2"".


180cm=70.2in{\displaystyle 180cm=70.2in}


70.2in12={\displaystyle {\frac {70.2in}{12}}=} 5' + 10.2


, Once you know how many ""perfect feet"" fit into these inches, just add in the leftover to get your final answer!


180cm=70.2in{\displaystyle 180cm=70.2in}


70.2in12={\displaystyle {\frac {70.2in}{12}}=} 5' + 10.2""


180cm = 5'10.2


, If you need super accurate conversions, you must use a more accurate decimal for your conversion from centimeters to inches. To see it in action, note how the example above subtly changes.


180cm∗.393701incm=70.86inches{\displaystyle 180cm*.393701{\frac {in}{cm}}=70.86inches}


70.86in12={\displaystyle {\frac {70.86in}{12}}=} 5' + 10.86""


180cm = 5'10.9"

Multiply the number of Centimeters by 0.0328084 to get the height in Feet.,
Separate the decimal out if you want to get the precise number of inches.,
Multiply the decimal by 12 to convert it to inches.,
Add your inches back to your total feet to get your converted height.",How to Convert Human Height in Centimeters to Feet3," This is a direct conversion, though it does not tell you the number of inches, directly. Instead, it tells you the number of feet  -- so an answer of 6.25ft doesn't mean someone is ""six feet, 2.5 inches."" It means he is ""six and a quarter (25%) feet tall,"" or 6'3"". Continuing the example from other methods:


180cm=180cmx0.0328084ftcm=5.905512ft{\displaystyle 180cm=180cmx0.0328084{\frac {ft}{cm}}=5.905512ft}


180cm=5.905512ft{\displaystyle 180cm=5.905512ft}


, The integer, the whole number in the beginning, is the number of feet (in this case, 5). The decimal is the percentage of a foot added on. But this number isn't really helpful, since we never say ""he is 5.9 feet tall"" We give inches. Separate the two to begin to simple process.


180cm=5.905512ft{\displaystyle 180cm=5.905512ft}


180cm=5ft+.905512ft{\displaystyle 180cm=5ft+.905512ft}


, There are 12 inches in every foot, but you need to find out how many inches are in .905512 feet. To do so, simply multiply. If you have trouble remembering why, think about what you would do if you had 1 foot, and needed to know how many inches there were: 12in∗1ft=12inches{\displaystyle 12in*1ft=12inches}. What if it was 6: 12∗6=72inches{\displaystyle 12*6=72inches}. Now, what if the number was smaller than one, like .905? It's the same philosophy -- you get your inches based on the number of feet by multiplying by 12.


180cm=5.905512ft{\displaystyle 180cm=5.905512ft}


180cm=5ft+.905512ft{\displaystyle 180cm=5ft+.905512ft}


12inft∗.905512ft=10.9inches{\displaystyle 12{\frac {in}{ft}}*.905512ft=10.9inches}


, Simply add back in the integer (the number before the decimal) with your new inches calculation. You've converted!


180cm=5.905512ft{\displaystyle 180cm=5.905512ft}


180cm=5ft+.905512ft{\displaystyle 180cm=5ft+.905512ft}


12inft∗.905512ft=10.9inches{\displaystyle 12{\frac {in}{ft}}*.905512ft=10.9inches}

Use simple percentages to get a basic estimation if you don't have a calculator.,
Multiple your height in centimeters by .10, or 10%.,
Multiply your 10% answer by 4 to estimate your height in inches.,
Divide by 12 to determine how tall someone is in feet.,
Alternatively, divide your 10% answer by 3 to get your rough height in feet.,
Understand that these estimations will always come out a little taller than reality.",How to Convert Human Height in Centimeters to Feet4," Remember that one centimeter equals roughly .39 inches. For estimation purposes, this means your height in inches is roughly 39% of your height in centimeters. To make this easier, round up to 40%. Now, since percentages in multiples of ten are so easy to figure out, you can get a quick approximation of your conversion.Remember that 10% of any number simply moves the decimal one move to the left.

Percentages always add to 100%, but can also be added anywhere in between. Thus, if you need to figure out 40% of a number, you can add 10% + 10% + 10% +  10%., This will give you one tenth of your height. To do so without a calculator, simply move the decimal one place over to the left. Thus, 100 → 10, 9.2 → .92, and .421 → .0421. To continue a common example:


180cm∗10%=18cm{\displaystyle 180cm*10\%=18cm}

Don't forget that 10% = .10, as percentages are just another way to write decimals  (ie. 40% = .4, and 59% = .59, etc.)


, You have 10% of your height, but you need to estimate 40% of it. You can turn 10% into 40% by multiplying by four, and it doesn't matter what your actual percentages are. Simply substitute in your number from before and multiply by 4:


1cm=40%in{\displaystyle 1cm=40\%in}


180cm∗10%=18{\displaystyle 180cm*10\%=18}


10%+10%+10%+10%=40%=10%∗4{\displaystyle 10\%+10\%+10\%+10\%=40\%=10\%*4}


18∗4=72in{\displaystyle 18*4=72in}


, If the number doesn't go in evenly, simply divide it as close as possible, then add in the remaining inches by feet. So, if you get 50 inches, you would have 4 feet, with two inches left over. The person is 4'2. In the example, the answer is 72 inches, or exactly 6 feet, since 72 divided by 12 is 6. This division doesn't have to be hard, since there are really only a few options for human height:

12 inches = 1 foot.

24 inches = 2 feet

36 inches = 3 feet

48 inches = 4 feet

60 inches = 5 feet

72 inches = 6 feet

84 inches = 7 feet, Remember how 1 centimeter converts to .0328084 feet? Just like any other decimal this can be converted to a percentage, meaning 1 centimeter is actually 3.3% of each foot (note: you convert a decimal to a percentage by multiplying it by 100). And, if you divide 10% by 3, you get roughly 3.3%. Now, just substitute your actual percentage for 10% in this equation and you have your estimation!


1cm=3.3%feet{\displaystyle 1cm=3.3\%feet}


180cm∗10%=18{\displaystyle 180cm*10\%=18}


10%3=3.3%{\displaystyle {\frac {10\%}{3}}=3.3\%}


183={\displaystyle {\frac {18}{3}}=} 6 feet, or 72 inches

Remember that a decimal in the answer is not the number of inches. To get that, multiply any remaining decimal by 12., Remember the original estimation for centimeters and inches? You converted .39 to 39%, which was then rounded up to 40%. While this makes the solution easier, it slightly overestimates the conversion by adding this percentage point. As a result, you should know that all estimations will be just a touch higher.

You can make this slightly more precise by subtracting 1% from your initial number. So, instead of using 180cm, use 178.2cm. This is extra helpful if, instead of 180 cm, you get something more difficult, like 182cm. Knowing it will overestimate, cut it to 180.When using precise decimals, 180cm = 5' 10.9"".

When estimating using the above methods, 180 = roughly 6 feet. They are only about an inch off -- but they are still different.

Multiply each digit with its corresponding power of three.,
Add up all of the numbers you got from the previous step.,
Write the answer with the correct base subscripts.,
Use the same logic to convert a ternary number with a decimal point to decimal form.",How to Convert from Ternary to Decimal," Let's use the ternary number 202212 (commonly written as 2022123, to indicate the base in which the number is written) to follow along.;
, Start on the right with 30, then 31, then 32, until you have as many powers of three as there are digits in your ternary number. For our number, 2022123, you would go up to 35, since it has 6 digits, so you would have 243, 81, 27, 9, 3, 1.


If you have a ternary number with n digits, you have to go up to 3n-1, and not 3n, since you start with 30, and not 31.

, The right-most digit belongs with the right-most power of three (30), the second digit on the right belongs to the second power of three of the right (31), and so on.

, In our example (2022123), this goes as follows;


110 (or 30) corresponds with 2, so 2*1=1
310 (or 31) corresponds with 1, so 1*3=3
910 (or 32) corresponds with 2, so 2*9=18
2710 (or 33) corresponds with 2, so 2*27=54
8110 (or 34) corresponds with 0, so 0*81=0
24310 (or 35) corresponds with 2, so 2*243=486

, In our case that would be 1+3+18+54+0+486=563. So 563 is the decimal form of 2022123.

, This is to prevent confusion as to what number is written in which base. In our example, it would look like this: 2022123=56310.

, You can use this method even when you want to covert a ternary number such as 1.1 to decimal. The ""1"" to the left of the decimal point is equal to 30, or 1. The 1 to the right of the decimal is equal to 3-1, or .333... (1/3). Add up 1 and .333 (1/3) and you get 1.333.. (4/3)."

Use this method to convert a binary number with a decimal point to decimal form.",How to Convert from Binary to Decimal2," Let's say we want to convert the binary number 100110112 to decimal. First, write it down. Then, write down the powers of two from right to left. Start at 20, evaluating it as ""1"". Increment the exponent by one for each power. Stop when the amount of elements in the list is equal to the amount of digits in the binary number. The example number, 10011011, has eight digits, so the list, with eight elements, would look like this: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

, Now, just write 10011011 below the numbers 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 so that each binary digit corresponds with its power of two. The ""1"" to the right of the binary number should correspond with the ""1"" on the right of the listed powers of two, and so on. You can also write the binary digits above the powers of two, if you prefer it that way. What's important is that they match up.

, Draw lines, starting from the right, connecting each consecutive digit of the binary number to the power of two that is next in the list above it. Begin by drawing a line from the first digit of the binary number to the first power of two in the list above it. Then, draw a line from the second digit of the binary number to the second power of two in the list. Continue connecting each digit with its corresponding power of two. This will help you visually see the relationship between the two sets of numbers.

, Move through each digit of the binary number. If the digit is a 1, write its corresponding power of two below the line, under the digit. If the digit is a 0, write a 0 below the line, under the digit.


Since ""1"" corresponds with ""1"", it becomes a ""1."" Since ""2"" corresponds with ""1,"" it becomes a ""2."" Since ""4"" corresponds with ""0,"" it becomes ""0."" Since ""8"" corresponds with ""1"", it becomes ""8,"" and since ""16"" corresponds with ""1"" it becomes ""16."" ""32"" corresponds with ""0"" and becomes ""0"" and ""64"" corresponds with ""0"" and therefore becomes ""0"" while ""128"" corresponds with ""1"" and becomes 128.

, Now, add up the numbers written below the line. Here's what you do: 128 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 155. This is the decimal equivalent of the binary number 10011011.

, Now, all you have to do is write 15510, to show that you are working with a decimal answer, which must be operating in powers of 10. The more you get used to converting from binary to decimal, the more easy it will be for you to memorize the powers of two, and you'll be able to complete the task more quickly.

, You can use this method even when you want to covert a binary number such as 1.12 to decimal. All you have to do is know that the number on the left side of the decimal is in the units position, like normal, while the number on the right side of the decimal is in the ""halves"" position, or 1 x (1/2).

The ""1"" to the left of the decimal point is equal to 20, or 1. The 1 to the right of the decimal is equal to 2-1, or .5. Add up 1 and .5 and you get 1.5, which is 1.12 in decimal notation.

As such, it is simpler for converting large numbers in your head because you only need to keep track of a subtotal. The first thing you need to of is to write down the binary number you'll be converting using the doubling method. Let's say the number you're working with is 10110012. Write it down.

, Since you're working with the binary number 10110012, your first digit all the way on the left is 1. Your previous total is 0 since you haven't started yet. You'll have to double the previous total, 0, and add 1, the current digit. 0 x 2 + 1 = 1, so your new current total is 1.

, Your current total is now 1 and the new current digit is 0. So, double 1 and add 0. 1 x 2 + 0 = 2. Your new current total is 2.

, Just keep going. Next, double your current total, and add 1, your next digit. 2 x 2 + 1 = 5. Your current total is now 5.

, Next, double your current total, 5, and add the next digit, 1. 5 x 2 + 1 = 11. Your new total is 11.

, Double your current total, 11, and add the next digit, 0. 2 x 11 + 0 = 22.

, Now, double your current total, 22, and add 0, the next digit. 22 x 2 + 0 = 44.

, Now, you're down to your last number and are almost done! All you have to do is take your current total, 44, and double it along with adding 1, the last digit. 2 x 44 + 1 = 89. You're all done! You've converted 100110112 to decimal notation to its decimal form, 89.

, Write your final answer as 8910 to show that you're working with a decimal, which has a base of 10.

, Doubling is used because the given number is of base 2. If the given number is of a different base, replace the 2 in the method with the base of the given number. For example, if the given number is in base 37, you would replace the ""x 2"" with ""x 37"". The final result will always be in decimal (base 10)."

Check your work.",How to Convert from Decimal to Hexadecimal1," Of the two approaches in this guide, this one is easier for most people to follow. If you're already comfortable with different bases, try the faster method below.


If you're completely new to hexadecimal, you might want to learn the basic concepts.;
, Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a different power of 16, just like each decimal digit represents a power of 10. This list of powers of 16 will come in handy during the conversion:


165 = 1,048,576
164 = 65,536
163 = 4,096
162 = 256
161 = 16
If the decimal number you're converting is larger than 1,048,576, calculate higher powers of 16 and add them to the list.

, Write down the decimal number you're about to convert. Refer to the list above. Find the largest power of 16 that's smaller than the decimal number.


For example, if you're converting 495 to hexadecimal, you would choose 256 from the list above.

, Stop at the whole number, ignoring any part of the answer past the decimal point.


In our example, 495 ÷ 256 = 1.93... , but we only care about the whole number 1.
Your answer is the first digit of the hexadecimal number. In this case, since we divided by 256, the 1 is in the ""256s place.""

, This tells you what's left of the decimal number to be converted. Here's how to calculate it, just as you would in long division:


Multiply your last answer by the divisor. In our example, 1 x 256 = 256. (In other words, the 1 in our hexadecimal number represents 256 in base 10).
Subtract your answer from the dividend. 495 - 256 = 239.

, Refer back to your list of powers of 16. Move down to the next smallest power of 16. Divide the remainder by that value to find the next digit of your hexadecimal number. (If the remainder is smaller than this number, the next digit is 0.)


239 ÷ 16 = 14. Once again, we ignore anything past the decimal point.
This is the second digit of our hexadecimal number, in the ""16s place."" Any number from 0 to 15 can be represented by a single hexadecimal digit. We will convert to the correct notation at the end of this method.

, As before, multiply your answer by the divisor, then subtract your answer from the dividend. This is the remainder still to be converted.


14 x 16 = 224.
239 - 224 = 15, so the remainder is 15.

, Once you get a remainder from 0 to 15, it can be expressed by a single hexadecimal digit. Write this down as a final digit.


The last ""digit"" of our hexadecimal number is 15, in the ""1s place.""

, You now know all the digits of your hexadecimal number. But so far, we've only been writing them in base 10. To write each digit in proper hexadecimal notation, convert them using this guide:


Digits 0 through 9 remain the same.
10 = A; 11 = B; 12 = C; 13 = D; 14 = E; 15 = F
In our example, we ended up with digits (1)(14)(15). In the correct notation, this becomes the hexadecimal number 1EF.

, Checking your answer is easy when you understand how hexadecimal numbers work. Convert each digit back into decimal form, then multiply by the power of 16 for that place position. Here's the work for our example:


1EF → (1)(14)(15)
Working right to left, 15 is in the 160 = 1s position. 15 x 1 = 15.
The next digit to the left is in the 161 = 16s position. 14 x 16 = 224.
The next digit is in the 162 = 256s position. 1 x 256 = 256.
Adding them all together, 256 + 224 + 15 = 495, our original number.

Divide the decimal number by 16.,
Write down the remainder in hexadecimal notation.,
Repeat the process with the quotient.,
Repeat until you get a quotient smaller than 16.,
Complete the number.",How to Convert from Decimal to Hexadecimal2," Treat the division as an integer division. In other words, stop at a whole number answer instead of calculating out the digits after the decimal point.


For this example, let's be ambitious and convert the decimal number 317,547. Calculate 317,547 ÷ 16 = 19,846, ignoring the digits after the decimal point.

, Now that you've divided your number by 16, the remainder is the part that can't fit into the 16s place or higher. Therefore, the remainder must be in the 1s place, the last digit of the hexadecimal number.


To find the remainder, multiply your answer by the divisor, then subtract the result from the dividend. In our example, 317,547 - (19,846 x 16) = 11.
Convert the digit into hexadecimal notation using the small number conversion chart at the top of this page. 11 becomes B in our example.

, You've converted the remainder into a hexadecimal digit. Now to continue converting the quotient, divide it by 16 again. The remainder is the second-to-last digit of the hexadecimal number. This works from the same logic as above: the original number has now been divided by (16 x 16 =) 256, so the remainder is the portion of the number that can't fit into the 256s place. We already know the 1s place, so this remainder must be the 16s place.


In our example, 19,846 / 16 = 1240.
Remainder = 19,846 - (1240 x 16) = 6. This is the second-to-last digit of our hexadecimal number.

, Remember to convert remainders from 10 to 15 into hexadecimal notation. Write each remainder down as you go. The final quotient (smaller than 16) is the first digit of your number. Here's our example continued:


Take the last quotient and divide by 16 again. 1240 / 16 = 77 Remainder 8.
77 / 16 = 4 Remainder 13 = D.
4 < 16, so 4 is the first digit.

, As mentioned earlier, you're finding each digit of the hexadecimal number from right to left. Check your work to make sure you wrote them in the right order.


Our final answer is 4D86B.
To check your work, convert each digit back to a decimal number, multiply by powers of 16, and sum the results. (4 x 164) + (13 x 163) + (8 x 162) + (6 x 16) + (11 x 1) = 317547, our original decimal number.

Recall the decimal equivalents of a fraction from memory.",How to Convert Fractions to Decimals," The fraction consists of three parts: the numerator, which is the top part of the fraction, the slash, which goes between the numbers, and the denominator, which is the bottom part.


The denominator represents how many equal parts there are in the whole. For example, a pizza might be cut into 8 pieces. The denominator for the pizza would then be ""8"". If you cut the same pizza into 12 slices, then the denominator would be 12. Either way they represent the same whole, just cut up differently.
The numerator represents a part, or parts, of the whole. One slice of the whole pizza would be represented by the numerator ""1"". Four slices would be represented by the numerator ""4"".;
, Decimals do not use a slash to indicate what part of the whole they represent. Instead, the decimal point to the left of the numbers signifies that the numbers are below one. With a decimal, the whole is considered to be based on 10, 100, 1000, etc, depending on how many spaces to the right of the decimal the number goes.


Decimals are also often read in a way that demonstrates their similarity to fractions. For example, 0.05 would commonly be read aloud as ""five-hundredths,"" the same as 5/100. The fraction is represented by the numbers placed to the right of the decimal point.

, Fractions and decimals are only differing representations of any value that is less than one. The fact that both are used for many of the same things means that you will often need to convert them in order to add, subtract, or compare them.

, The easiest way to convert a fraction to a decimal is to read the fraction as if it were a division problem, with the number on the top being divided by the number on the bottom.The fraction 2/3, for example, can also be stated as 2 divided by 3.

, You can do this math problem in your head, especially if the numerator and denominator are multiples of each other, with a calculator, or with long division.

, Multiply the decimal equivalent you got by the denominator of the fraction you started with. You should come up with the numerator of the fraction you started with.

, This will help you to understand the relationship between fractions and decimals, as well as improving your other basic math skills.

, A ""power of 10"" denominator is a denominator consisting of any positive number that can be multiplied to make a multiple of 10. The numbers 1,000 or 1,000,000 are powers of 10, but in most practical applications of this method you will probably only be using numbers such as 10 or 100.

, Any fraction that has 5 as the denominator is an obvious candidate, but fractions that have denominators of 25 are just as easily converted. Any number that already has an exponent of 10 as a its denominator will be very easy to convert.

, This second fraction will have a denominator that, when both denominators are multiplied together, creates a multiple of 10. The top of this second fraction (the numerator) will be the same as its denominator. This makes the second fraction equal one.


It is a basic rule in math that multiplying anything by one does not change its value. This means that when we multiply the original fraction we had by a fraction that is equal to one we are not changing its value, we are simply changing how we represent that value.
For example, the fraction 2/2 is really just 1 (because 2 divided by itself is equal to 1). If you are trying to convert 1/5 to a fraction with a denominator of 10, you would multiply it by 2/2. The result would be 2/10.To multiply two fractions simply multiply straight across. Multiply both numerators together and make the result the numerator of the answer. Then multiply the denominators and make the result the denominator of the answer. You will be left with a new fraction.

, Take the numerator of this new fraction and rewrite it with a decimal point at the end. Now look at the denominator and count how many zeros are in the number. Next move the decimal point on your rewritten numerator to the left the number of spaces that are equal to the number of zeros in the denominator.


For instance, you have the number 2/10. The denominator has one zero. So we start by rewriting ""2"" as ""2."" (this doesn't change the value of the number) and then we move the decimal one space to the left. That gives us ""0.2"".
You will quickly learn how to do this with all sorts of numbers with easy denominators. After a while, this process becomes pretty easy. You just look for a fraction with a power of 10 denominator (or one that can be readily made into one) and convert the top number into a decimal.

, You can do this by dividing the numerator by the denominator (the top number by the bottom number), as was done in the second part of this article.


Some basic fraction to decimal conversions you should know by heart are 1/4 = .25, 1/2 = .5, and 3/4 = .75.
If you want to convert the fraction really quickly you can simply use a search engine on the internet to search for the answer. For example, you could type ""1/4 decimal"" or something similar.

, Practicing these will help you memorize these fraction and decimal equivalents., This can be very useful for fractions you use regularly.

Decide which “gallon” measurement you’re using.,
Learn the conversion factors.,
Write the conversion factor as a fraction.,
Set up your conversion equation.,
Perform the conversion.",How to Convert Gallons to Liters1," One of the confusing things about what is called the English measurement system is that the units are not standard. The gallon is a good example. Through history, there have been such units as the dry gallon, wet gallon, ale gallon, wine gallon, corn gallon. Over time, these have been standardized, but there are still three common options. Before you can convert to liters, you need to know which gallon measure you are using. The three modern gallons are:Imperial (or U.K.) gallon. This is the unit commonly used in the U.K. It may be referred to as the Imperial gallon, British gallon, or U.K. gallon.

U.S. liquid gallon. In the U.S., this is the more commonly used measurement. It is sometimes called the U.S. wet gallon.

U.S. dry gallon. This is used for some specific purposes. For most measurements that just say “gallon” in the U.S., the wet gallon is probably the intention.
;
, To convert from gallons to liters, you can find the conversion factor in a textbook or online. The conversion factors for the three standard gallon measurements are as follows:

1 U.K. gallon = 4.5461 liters1 U.S. liquid gallon = 3.7854 liters1 U.S. dry gallon = 4.4049 liters, Recall that any fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal has an overall value of 1. This is useful, because you can use the conversion fraction to change units without changing the value of the measurement. When you begin with gallons and want to convert to liters, you will use the following conversion factors:

For U.K. gallons, use the fraction 4.5461l1gal{\displaystyle {\frac {4.5461l}{1gal}}}For U.S. liquid gallons, use the fraction 3.7854l1gal{\displaystyle {\frac {3.7854l}{1gal}}}For U.S. dry gallons, use the fraction 4.4049l1gal{\displaystyle {\frac {4.4049l}{1gal}}}These are the fractions to convert from gallons to liters. If you want to perform the reverse operation and convert from liters to gallons, simply flip the fraction upside down.


, If you have a number of gallons that you wish to convert to liters, you can use the conversion factor to set up a simple equation. As long as the conversion term is equal to 1, the value of the measurement will be the same.

For example, suppose you have a measurement of 5 gallons (US liq.) that you want to convert to liters. Set it up as a multiplication problem, as follows:


5gal=5gal∗3.7854L1gal{\displaystyle 5gal=5gal*{\frac {3.7854L}{1gal}}}



If you wish to convert 5 gallons (U.K.), set up the problem this way:


5gal=5gal∗4.5461L1gal{\displaystyle 5gal=5gal*{\frac {4.5461L}{1gal}}}




, If you set up your conversion factor correctly, the final step should be a simple multiplication. You should see that you begin with the unit of gallons, and your conversion ratio has liters in the denominator. As with any fraction multiplication, something that appears both in the numerator and the denominator can cancel out of the equation. This will leave just the desired unit of liters in your answer.

Finish the two examples above as follows:


5gal (US liq.)=5gal∗3.7854L1gal=18.927liters{\displaystyle 5{\text{gal (US liq.)}}=5gal*{\frac {3.7854L}{1gal}}=18.927liters}


5gal (UK)=5gal∗4.5461L1gal=22.7305liters{\displaystyle 5{\text{gal (UK)}}=5gal*{\frac {4.5461L}{1gal}}=22.7305liters}

Set up the rate as a ratio or fraction.,
Convert the number of feet to miles.,
Change the value in the denominator to .00028 hours.,
Convert to the unit rate.",How to Convert Feet/Second to Miles/Hour1," The fraction will have feet in the numerator and seconds in the denominator. The number of feet per second should be given to you. The rate should be per second, so you should have a 1 in the denominator.For example if you are converting 500 feet per second to miles per hour, your ratio will look like this:500feet1second{\displaystyle {\frac {500{\text{feet}}}{1{\text{second}}}}}.
;
, There are 5,280 feet in a mile.So, to convert, divide the number of feet by 5,280. Rewrite your ratio in terms of miles per second.

For example, if you are converting 500 feet per second, you would calculate 5005,280=.095{\displaystyle {\frac {500}{5,280}}=.095}. So, your new ratio is .095miles1second{\displaystyle {\frac {.095{\text{miles}}}{1{\text{second}}}}}.


, This is the conversion of 1 second to hours, found by dividing 1 by 3,600 since there are 3,600 seconds in 1 hour.

For example, your new ratio is .095miles.00028hours{\displaystyle {\frac {.095{\text{miles}}}{.00028{\text{hours}}}}}.


, This means the rate of miles per 1 hour. To do this, divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator.For example, .095miles.00028hours=339.29miles1hour{\displaystyle {\frac {.095{\text{miles}}}{.00028{\text{hours}}}}={\frac {339.29{\text{miles}}}{1{\text{hour}}}}}. So, 500 feet per second converts to 339.29 mph.

Convert the number of hours to seconds.,
Convert to the unit rate.",How to Convert Feet/Second to Miles/Hour2," Set up the fraction so that the number of miles is in the numerator. This should be given to you. The rate should be per hour, so you should have a 1 in the denominator.For example if you are converting 50 miles per hour to feet per second, your ratio will look like this:50miles1hour{\displaystyle {\frac {50{\text{miles}}}{1{\text{hour}}}}}.


, Every mile has 5,280 feet in it, so to convert, multiply the number of miles by 5,280.Rewrite your ratio in terms of feet per hour.

For example, if you are converting 50 miles per hour, you would calculate 50×5,280=264,000{\displaystyle 50\times 5,280=264,000}, So, your new ratio is 264,000feet1hour{\displaystyle {\frac {264,000{\text{feet}}}{1{\text{hour}}}}}.


, Since an hour has 3,600 seconds, to convert you would multiply the number of hours by 3,600. Since you are working with a unit rate of 1 hour, you would simply multiply 1 and 3,600. Rewrite your new ratio in terms of feet per seconds

For example, 1×3,600=3,600{\displaystyle 1\times 3,600=3,600}. So, your new ratio is 264,000feet3,600seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {264,000{\text{feet}}}{3,600{\text{seconds}}}}}.


, The unit rate is feet per 1 second. This means you must get the denominator of your fraction to 1. To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator. You can also think of it as dividing the numerator and denominator by the denominator.

For example, 264,000feet3,600seconds=73.33feet1second{\displaystyle {\frac {264,000{\text{feet}}}{3,600{\text{seconds}}}}={\frac {73.33{\text{feet}}}{1{\text{second}}}}}. So, 50 miles per hour converts to 73.33 feet per second.

Set up the rate as a fraction: 1,000feet1second{\displaystyle {\frac {1,000{\text{feet}}}{1{\text{second}}}}}

Convert the number of feet to miles. To do this, divide the number of feet by 5,280: 1,0005,280=.189{\displaystyle {\frac {1,000}{5,280}}=.189}.

Convert the number of seconds to hours. To do this, divide the number of seconds by 3,600: 13,600=.00028{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3,600}}=.00028}.

Convert to the unit rate. To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator: .189miles.00028hours=675mph{\displaystyle {\frac {.189{\text{miles}}}{.00028{\text{hours}}}}=675\;{\text{mph}}}.


,

Set up the rate as a fraction: 15mi1hour{\displaystyle {\frac {15{\text{mi}}}{1{\text{hour}}}}}

Convert the number of miles to feet. To do this, multiply the number of miles by 5,280: 15×5,280=79,200{\displaystyle 15\times 5,280=79,200}.

Convert the number of hours to seconds. To do this, multiply the number of hours by 3,600: 1×3,600=3,600{\displaystyle 1\times 3,600=3,600}.

Convert to the unit rate. To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator: 79,200feet3,600seconds=22feet per second{\displaystyle {\frac {79,200{\text{feet}}}{3,600{\text{seconds}}}}=22\;{\text{feet per second}}}.


, A red car is traveling 65 mph. A blue car is travelling 80 feet per second. Which car is travelling faster?

Convert one of the rates so that both rates are stated in the same units. Then, you just need to compare the two rates. For example, you might convert the blue car's rate of 80 feet per second into miles per hour:

Convert the number of feet to miles: 805,280=.015{\displaystyle {\frac {80}{5,280}}=.015}.

Convert the number of seconds to hours: 13,600=.00028{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3,600}}=.00028}.

Convert to the unit rate: .015miles.00028hours=53.57mph{\displaystyle {\frac {.015{\text{miles}}}{.00028{\text{hours}}}}=53.57\;{\text{mph}}}.



The red car is travelling at a rate of 65 mph. The blue car is travelling at a rate of 53.57 mph. So the red car is travelling faster.

Take a measurement in feet.,
Multiply or divide your measurement by a conversion factor.,
Don't forget to account for inch-measurements.",How to Convert Feet to Meters1," This step is simple - just use a tape measure, ruler, yardstick, or other measuring device to determine the length you want to measure in feet. In many situations, such as in schoolwork, you'll already know the length in feet that you need to convert or this information will be given to you. In these cases, you don't need to measure anything, as you can use the measurement you've been given.;
, Because there are 3.28 feet in a meter, take your measurement (in feet) and divide it by 3.28 to convert to meters. You can also multiply your measurement in feet by 0.3048 to get the exact same answer because there are 0.3048 meters in a foot.


For instance, let's say we want to know how tall we are in meters. If we're exactly 6 feet tall, we would divide 6/3.28 = 1.83 meters. Note that 6 × 0.3048 gives the same answer.
Don't forget to label your new answer in meters.
For rough, on-the-fly calculations, you may want to round your conversion factors to 3.3, 0.3, etc. to make mental math much easier. Use caution, though as these rough values will cause inaccuracies in your results.

, In the real world, it's fairly common that you'll hear distances described not as a whole number foot value (1 foot, 2 feet, 3 feet, etc.), but as some combination of feet and inches (20 feet and 11 inches, etc.). In cases where you must convert a distance in feet and inches to meters, simply divide the inches provided by 12 to find the equivalent number of feet (for fewer that 12 inches, this number will be less than 1.) Then, add this to your foot value and convert to meters as you normally would.


Let's say that we want to convert our height to meters, but we're not 6 feet tall this time. Instead, we're 5 feet 10 inches. We would solve as follows:

10 / 12 = .84
5 + .84 = 5.84 feet total
5.84 / 3.28 = 1.78 meters



You can also account for inches by turning your foot value into a fraction. 5 feet and 10 inches can be though of as 5 10/12 feet because there are 12 inches in 1 foot. Simply multiply 5 by the denominator (12) and add it to the numerator (10) to get one tidy fraction:

5 10/12
((5 × 12) + 10) / 12 = 70/12 feet.

Note that 70/12 = 5.84 - the same value as obtained above. So 70/12 × 0.3048 = 1.78 meters as well.

Learn the conversion factor.,
Set up a conversion equation.,
Perform the conversion.,
Use a shortcut step.",How to Convert Feet to Yards1," It is fairly well known that one yard is equal to three feet. To convert measurements into yards that wee originally taken in feet, you need to write this conversion factor as a conversion ratio. The ratio is 1 yard3 feet{\displaystyle {\frac {1{\text{ yard}}}{3{\text{ feet}}}}}. Because the numerator and denominator values are equal, this conversion fraction is equal to 1.Whenever a fraction has a value of 1, you can use it to multiply any number without changing its value but you will convert the units.
;
, When you begin with a measurement in feet that you want to convert to yards instead, you can set up a simple equation using the conversion ratio. As long as the conversion ratio is correct and is equal to 1, the value of the measurement will be unchanged.For example, suppose you have a measurement of 12 feet that you want to convert into yards. Write a brief multiplication problem, as follows:


12 feet=12feet∗1 yard3 feet{\displaystyle 12{\text{ feet}}=12{\text{feet}}*{\frac {1{\text{ yard}}}{3{\text{ feet}}}}}



When you write the conversion equation, you need to make sure that you write the conversion fraction so the unit you wish to end up with is in the numerator. If you wrote the conversion fraction as 3 feet1yard{\displaystyle {\frac {3{\text{ feet}}}{1{\text{yard}}}}}, your result would be incorrect. This would be the conversion to use for the inverse conversion, from yards to feet.


, After you write out your conversion equation, the final step is going to be a simple division. You will begin with the unit of feet, and your conversion ratio has feet in the denominator. As with any fraction multiplication, something that appears both in the numerator and the denominator can cancel out of the equation. This will leave just the desired unit of yards.In this example, the problem is set up and can be completed as follows:


12 feet=12feet∗1 yard3 feet=4 yards{\displaystyle 12{\text{ feet}}=12{\text{feet}}*{\frac {1{\text{ yard}}}{3{\text{ feet}}}}=4{\text{ yards}}}




, Many people find that converting measurements is easy, except for remembering whether to multiply or to divide. Emphasizing the conversion ratio and canceling the units helps answer this question every time. Once you get good at converting units, you can skip the conversion ratio and just divide the number of feet by 3 to get an equal measurement in yards."
"
Create a conversion equation.,
Make sure your units cancel.,
Plug in your value for feet, then solve.",How to Convert Feet to Meters2," In ""show your work"" type problems, you're often not allowed to convert directly from feet into meters because the conversion factor between feet and meters is not well-known. Luckily, it's fairly simple to set up a unit-conversion equation that uses the commonly-known conversions between inches and centimeters and centimeters and meters to get an answer. Set up a system of conversions as shown below, leaving your value for feet blank for now:

____ ft

*

12 in
1 ft

*

2.54 cm
1 in

*

1 m
100 cm

=
 ? m




Your conversion equation should account for every unit conversion you make on the way from feet to meters. It should also have one of every type of unit appear once in a numerator and once in a denominator, except for meters, which should only appear once, in a numerator.

, If your equation is set up as described above, all of your units (except for meters) should cancel. Remember that if a unit appears both in the numerator and the denominator of a fraction (or of two fractions being multiplied), it can be removed.


A good way to remember this is to think of the fraction line as meaning ""per."" That is, the ""per"" in ""12 inches per 1 foot"", ""2.54 cm per 1 in"", and ""1 m per 100 cm"". When you think of your conversion equation in this way, it's easy to see how and why the units cancel out - you're simply taking an initial value in feet through a string of operations, changing it into inches, then centimeters, until you're finally left with meters.

, Insert your value for feet at the beginning of the equation. Then, using a calculator, perform the calculations listed to get the end result, which will be in meters.


Let's say we want to convert 20 feet to meters. We would solve as follows:

20 ft × (12 in/1 ft) × (2.54 cm/1 in) × (1 m/100 cm)
= 240 in × (2.54 cm/1 in) × (1 m/100 cm)
= 609.6 cm × (1 m/100 cm)
= 6.096 m.

Write the number of kilograms.,
Multiply by 2.2.,
For greater accuracy, multiply by 2.2046.,
To get back to kilograms, divide by 2.2.",How to Convert Kilograms to Pounds1," Converting from kilograms to pounds is simple. Best of all, once you know how to do it, it's something that you can use in a wide variety of situations. Start with the number of kilograms you want to convert.


For example, let's say that you want to convert 5.9 kilograms to pounds. In the next few steps, we'll do just this.;
, Next, just multiply your kilogram measurement by 2.2. The answer you get is the number of pounds that is equal to your kilogram measurement.


In the example from above, you can convert by multiplying 5.9 by 2.2. 5.9 × 2.2 = 12.98 pounds.
Don't forget the ""pounds"" label. If you're doing this calculation for schoolwork, you can lose points if you leave the label off. If you're doing the calculation for something else, the person who reads your work may misunderstand your answer.

, Technically, multiplying kilograms by 2.2 to get pounds is sort of a ""shortcut"" for easier conversions. If you want to get the most accurate result possible, you'll probably want to use a more accurate value for the conversion. 2.2046 should be accurate enough for most purposes.


In the example above, if we use the more-accurate value, we get 5.9 × 2.2046 = 13.00714 pounds. This is a minor difference, but if we're aiming for very precise measurements, this may be the better choice.
If you want to be even more accurate, consider using a conversion factor with more decimal places. At an extreme level of accuracy, one kilogram is equal to 2.2046226218 pounds., Getting from a pounds measurement back to kilograms is as simple as dividing the number of pounds by your conversion factor. In other words, if you used the basic ""2.2"" conversion above, divide by 2.2. If you used 2.2046, divide by 2.2046, and so on.


In the example from above, you can get from 12.98 pounds back to the original kilogram measurement like this: 12.98/2.2 = 5.9 kilograms. Don't forget the label!
Don't mix and match your conversion factors — only divide by the number you originally multiplied by. For instance, since you got 13.00714 pounds when you used the more accurate 2.2046 conversion, you wouldn't divide by 2.2. This would give you 13.00714/2.2 = 5.912 kilograms, which is slightly different from your starting 5.9 kilograms.

To get inches back to feet, divide by twelve.",How to Convert Feet to Inches1," Converting feet to inches is quite simple. First, write out the number of feet you're dealing with. Label this number ""feet"" or ""ft.""It's helpful to follow along with a real-world example to see how feet are converted to inches. Let's say that you want to know how long the wall of your room is in inches. If the wall is eight feet long, start by writing this measurement down, like this:
8 feet;
, Next, multiply your number of feet by 12. Since there are 12 inches in every foot, this will give you your original foot measurement in inches.


In the example problem, you would continue by writing a ""× 12"" after the foot measurement, then multiplying to find the answer, like this:
8 feet × 12 = 96


, Don't forget to give your answer the label ""inches"" or ""in."" to specify that it is in inches.If you don't, your answer may be confusing to someone who reads it (and, if you're doing this for schoolwork, you may lose points.)


In the example problem, label your answer like this:
8 feet × 12 = 96 inches


, If you ever want to get your inch measurement back into feet, just do the reverse of the multiplication you did to get it in inches: in other words, divide it by 12. Don't forget to re-label your answer in feet.


To convert your answer in the example problem back into feet, divide it by 12 like this:
96 inches ÷ 12 = 8 feet

Convert kilograms to pounds to get a decimal answer.,
Divide the decimal digits by 0.0625.,
Write your answer in the form ""x pounds, y ounces."",
Work backwards to get back to kilograms.",How to Convert Kilograms to Pounds2," There are many ways to represent pounds when you're not dealing with a whole number. Two common examples are decimals (i.e., 6.5 pounds) and fractions (i.e., 6 1/2 pounds). Another way to do this is with ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so a pound-and-ounces measurement of, for instance, 6 pounds 8 ounces is like saying 6 8/16 pounds (or 6 1/2 pounds).


To convert kilograms into this sort of pound and ounces measurement, start by doing the standard decimal conversion above. For instance, if you want to convert 7 kilograms to pounds and ounces, start by multiplying 7 × 2.2 = 15.4 pounds


, As mentioned above, one ounce is 1/16 of a pound. This is equal to 0.0625 pounds. If you divide the numbers in your answer to the right of the decimal place by 0.0625, the answer you get will be the number of ounces.


For example, if you want to figure out how to write your 15.4 pound answer above to pounds and ounces, you would get your number of ounces by dividing 0.4/0.0625 = 6.4. This means that the ""0.4"" in ""15.4 pounds"" is equal to 6.4 ounces.


, Once you know the number of pounds and ounces you're dealing with, getting your final answer is as easy as combining them. Write your answer by listing your number of pounds first, then ounces. For example: 10 pounds, 3 ounces.


In the example problem, we have 15 pounds (from our original 15.4 pound measurement). We now know that the 0.4 decimal is equal to 6.4 ounces. This means our final measurement is 15 pounds, 6.4 ounces.


, Getting from pounds and ounces back to kilograms requires two things. First, you need to convert your ounces back to pounds by multiplying them by 0.0625. Then, you need to convert your pounds back to kilograms by dividing by 2.2 (or whatever other value you used).


In the example problem, you would convert back to kilograms like this:



Start with 15 pounds, 6.4 ounces.
Multiply 6.4 × 0.0625 = 0.4 pounds
Add this to 15 to get 15.4 pounds.
Divide 15.4/2.2 to get 7 kilograms.

Write the number of feet.,
Multiply the number of feet by 12.,
Add the remaining inches.,
Divide by 12 and use the remainder to get back to feet and inches.",How to Convert Feet to Inches2," Measurements aren't always given in just feet. Sometimes, especially for certain types of measurements like heights, measurements are given in feet and inches (like, for example, ""100 feet, six inches.) In this case, start by writing just the number of feet — leave the inches out for now.


As another example problem, let's say that you are five feet, three inches tall and that you want to figure out exactly how tall you are in just inches. Start by writing just the number of feet, like this:
5 feet

, This part is exactly the same as when dealing with just feet. Simply multiply by 12 and label your answer in inches.


In the example problem, multiply like this:
5 feet × 12 = 60 inches


, Now, add the leftover inches from the beginning to the answer you just got. This gives you your final answer in inches. Don't forget the label.


In the example problem, finish finding your height in inches like this:
5 feet × 12 = 60 inches + 3 inches = 63 inches


, If you want to get back to the same type of feet-and-inches measurement as we had before, there is a little more work to do this time. To do this, divide by 12, then find the remainder. The answer for dividing by 12 is the number of feet and the remainder is the number of inches (for example, 4 R5 would be four feet, five inches.)


A remainder is just the number ""left over"" when two numbers don't divide evenly. For example, four goes into 12 exactly three times, but five doesn't fit into twelve perfectly — it goes in twice to make 10, then it only fits in partly the third time. 5 × 2 = 10, which is two less than twelve, so we say that we have a remainder of two (or R2). In other words, five goes into twelve twice, then we need to add an ""extra"" two to get to twelve.
In the example problem, get back into feet and inches like this:
63 inches / 12 = 5 R3 → 5 feet 3 inches

Learn the formula.,
Add 459.67 to your original temperature.,
Multiply the sum by 5/9 to get the temperature in Kelvin.",How to Convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin1," There are two ways that you can convert from Fahrenheit to Kelvin, and the first is a simple calculation that makes the conversion directly. The formula to use for this is K = (y °F + 459.67) x 5/9.For example, if you needed to convert 75 F to Kelvin, the formula would look like K = (75 °F + 459.67) x 5/9;
, On the Fahrenheit scale, absolute zero is -459.67 °F, which is equivalent to 0 K.Because the Kelvin scale does not contain negative numbers, you must first add 459.67 to any Fahrenheit number when you want to make the conversion to Kelvin.


In the example of converting 75 °F, the answer to the first step is 75 °F + 459.67 = 534.67

, Remember that 5/9 can also be written as 0.55, where 5 is a repeating decimal. The answer to that product is your temperature in Kelvin.


In the example of 75 °F, the answer to the second step is 5/9 x 534.67 = 297.0388, where 8 is a repeating decimal
The answer to (75 °F + 459.67) x 5/9 = 297.0388
Therefore 75 °F = 297.0388 K

Subtract 32 from your original temperature.,
Multiply the difference by 5/9 for formula 1.,
Divide the difference by 1.8 for formula 2.,
Add 273 to the product or quotient to get your temperature in Kelvin.",How to Convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin2," The second way of converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin involves calculating the temperature in Celsius first, which can be handy if you need to compare all the numbers. The formulas you can use to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius to Kelvin are: formula 1 is K = (y °F – 32) x 5/9 + 273.15; formula 2 is K = (y °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 + 273.15. Both formulas will produce the same result.For example, if you needed to convert 90 °F to Kelvin, the formula 1 would look like K = (90 °F – 32) x 5/9 + 273.15
The formula 2 would look like K = (90 °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 + 273.15

, Regardless of the formula you use, the first step to converting Fahrenheit to Celsius to Kelvin is to subtract 32 from the original Fahrenheit temperature.


In the example of 90 °F, the answer to the first step is 90 °F – 32 = 58

, Remember that 5/9 is also written as 0.55. The answer to the product is your temperature in Celsius.


In the example of 90 °F, the answer to the second step for formula 1 is 58 x 0.5555 = 32.22 °C, where the 2 is a repeating decimal.

, Dividing by 1.8 will give you the same result as multiplying by 5/9. The quotient is your temperature in Celsius.


In the example of 90 °F, the answer to the second step for formula 2 is 58 ÷ 1.8 = 32.22 °C, where the 2 is a repeating decimal.

, The final step of the conversion is adding 273.15 to the product of formula 1 or the quotient of formula 2. This gives the temperature in Kelvin. Absolute zero is equivalent to -273.15 °C and 0 K, and because the Kelvin scale doesn’t have negative numbers, you must add 273.15 to the final result.


In the example of 90 °F, the answer to the third step is 32.22 °C + 273.15 = 305.3722
The answer to both (90 °F – 32) x 5/9 + 273.15 and (90 °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 + 273.15 = 305.3722, where 2 is a repeating decimal.
Therefore, 90 °F = 32.22 °C = 305.3722 K

Know the formula.,
Multiply your original temperature by 9/5.,
Subtract 459.67 from the product to get your temperature in Fahrenheit.",How to Convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin3," To convert Kelvin to Fahrenheit instead, you simply use the same formula, but in reverse. The formula for converting Kelvin to Fahrenheit is F = y K x 9/5 – 459.67.For example, to convert 320 K, you'd use the equation F = 320 K x 9/5 – 459.67

, Remember that 9/5 can also be written as 1.8.


In the example of 320 K, the answer to step one is 320 K x 9/5 = 576.

, Once you’ve multiplied the temperature in Kelvin by 9/5, simply subtract the Fahrenheit temperature of absolute zero (-459.67) from the product.


In the example of 320 K, the answer to step two is 576 – 459.67 = 116.33
The answer to 320 K x 9/5 – 459.67 = 116.33
Therefore, 320 K = 116.33 °F

Determine that you are making the correct conversion.,
Understand the relationship between cubic yards and cubic feet.,
Set up an equation.,
Isolate the variable.,
Divide the number of cubic feet by 27.",How to Convert Cubic Feet to Cubic Yards1," In this method, you should know how many cubic feet you have, and want to find out how many cubic yards that value is equal to. Make sure you are working with cubic units (volume), and not square units (area).

For example, you might want to convert 600 cubic feet to cubic yards.
;
, There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard. This means for every cubic yard, you have 27 cubic feet. You can show this by the proportion 1yd327ft3{\displaystyle {\frac {1yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}}., On the left side will be the unit proportion of cubic yards to cubic feet. On the right side will be a proportion representing the number yards you are trying to find. Create a fraction with an unknown number of yards in the numerator (x{\displaystyle x}), and the number of feet you are converting in the denominator.

For example, if you want to know how many cubic yards are in 600 cubic feet, your equation will look like this:1yd327ft3=x600ft3{\displaystyle {\frac {1yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}={\frac {x}{600ft^{3}}}}.


, To do this, multiply each side of the equation by the number of cubic feet you are trying to convert. Multiply the number of cubic feet by the numerator of the unit proportion on the left side of the equation.

For example:1yd327ft3=x600ft3{\displaystyle {\frac {1yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}={\frac {x}{600ft^{3}}}}1yd327ft3×600=x600ft3×600{\displaystyle {\frac {1yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}\times 600={\frac {x}{600ft^{3}}}\times 600}600yd327ft3=x{\displaystyle {\frac {600yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}=x}


, This will give you the equivalent number of cubic yards. Note that you can simplify this method by simply dividing the number of cubic feet you have by 27.

For example:600yd327ft3=x{\displaystyle {\frac {600yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}=x}22.2yd3=x{\displaystyle 22.2yd^{3}=x}So, 600 cubic feet is equal to 22.2 cubic yards.

Ensure you are making the correct conversion.,
Calculate the conversion rate.,
Multiply the number of cubic feet by the conversion rate.",How to Convert Cubic Feet to Cubic Yards2," For this method you should begin with cubic feet and end up with cubic yards. This method does not work for the opposite conversion (cubic yards to cubic feet). Make sure you are using cubic units and not square units, as the conversion rate will be different.
, For every 1 cubic yard, there are 27 cubic feet. This means that a cubic foot is 127{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{27}}} of a cubic yard. To find the conversion rate, you calculate 1÷27=.03703704{\displaystyle 1\div 27=.03703704}., This will give you the number of cubic yards that are equivalent to the given number of cubic feet. Since feet are smaller than yards, you will end up with fewer yards than feet after converting.

For example, if you want to convert 600 cubic feet to cubic yards, calculate (600)(.03703704)=22.2{\displaystyle (600)(.03703704)=22.2}. So, 600 cubic feet is equivalent to 22.2 cubic yards.

Make sure you are converting correctly.,
Understand the relationship between cubic yards and cubic feet.,
Multiply the number of cubic yards by 27.",How to Convert Cubic Feet to Cubic Yards3," In this method you begin with cubic yards and end up with cubic feet. If you are working with square feet and square yards, this conversion method will not work.
, There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard. That means that the number of cubic feet will be 27 times more than the equivalent number of yards., This will give you the number of cubic feet equivalent to the given number of cubic yards. Since feet are smaller than yards, the number of feet will be greater than the number of yards.

For example, if you wanted to convert 20 cubic yards to cubic feet, you would calculate (20)(27)=540{\displaystyle (20)(27)=540}. So 20 cubic yards is equivalent to 540 cubic feet.

Example: The width of a particular table measures 58.75 centimeters. What is the width of the same table when taken in millimeters?;
, There are 10 millimeters in every 1 centimeter. This means that you will need to find the number of millimeters per centimeter by multiplying the centimeter measurement by 10.The ""millimeter"" is a smaller unit than the ""centimeter,"" even though both are derived from the basic ""meter."" When you convert any larger metric unit to a smaller one, you must multiply the original value.

Example: 58.75 cm * 10 = 587.5 mm

The width of the table in the problem is 587.5 millimeters.



, Read through the problem and make sure that it contains a measurement of length provided in millimeters (mm). It must also instruct you to convert that measurement to its equivalent in centimeters (cm).



Example: The height of a certain door is 1780.9 millimeters. Find the height of the same door when described in centimeters.

, There are 10 millimeters for every 1 centimeter, so you'll need to divide the number of millimeters by 10 to find its equivalent centimeter value.The ""centimeter"" is larger than the ""millimeter,"" and whenever you need to convert a smaller metric unit to a larger one, you must divide the original value.

Example: 1780.9 mm / 10 = 178.09 cm

The height of the door in this problem is 178.09 centimeters.



, Verify that the problem provides a measurement of length in centimeters (cm). It should also indicate that the measurement must be converted into its equivalent number of millimeters (mm).



Example: The length of a certain television screen is 32.4 centimeters. Find the length of the same screen in millimeters.

, There are 10 millimeters in every 1 centimeter, so the centimeter value will be smaller by one decimal place. You should be able to convert centimeters into millimeters by shifting the decimal point one place to the right.


Moving the decimal point of a number to the right increases its value, and every place holder shift equals a value of 10. As such, shifting the decimal to the right once will increase the resulting value by a factor of 10.

Example: Moving the decimal point in ""32.4"" to the right once would result in a value of ""324.0,"" so the length of the screen in this problem equals 324.0 millimeters.

, Look over the problem and verify that it provides a measurement of length described in millimeters (mm). It should also instruct you to convert that value into its equivalent in centimeters (cm).



Example: The height of a particular chair measures 958.3 millimeters. What is the height of the same chair in centimeters?

, There are 10 millimeters for every 1 centimeter, so the millimeter value will be larger by one decimal place. As such, you can convert millimeters into centimeters by shifting the decimal point one place to the left.


Moving the decimal point to the left makes the resulting value smaller, and each decimal place holder represents a factor of 10. This means that shifting the decimal one place to the left will decrease the resulting value by a factor of 10.

Example: Moving the decimal point in ""958.3"" to the left once would result in a value of ""95.83,"" so the height of the chair in this problem measures 95.83 centimeters.

, In this problem, you need to change the centimeter value into its equivalent in millimeters. Do so by either multiplying the centimeter value by 10 or by shifting the decimal one place to the right.

Example: The length of a certain field is 872.5 centimeters. Find the length of the same field in meters.;
, There are exactly 100 centimeters in every 1 meter. As such, you can find the number of meters per centimeter value by dividing the centimeter measurement by 100.The ""centimeter"" is a smaller unit than the ""meter."" Every time you need to convert a smaller metric unit to a larger one, you must divide to find a lesser value.

Example: The counter in a certain kitchen is 344.25 centimeters long. How long is the same counter when measured in meters?

, Since there are precisely 100 centimeters in every 1 meter, the centimeter value will be larger by two decimal places. You can convert the centimeter value to its meter equivalent by simply shifting the decimal point two places to the left.


Shifting the decimal point of a number to the left will cause the value to decrease. Each place holder shift represents a value of 10, so shifting the decimal to the left twice will decrease the final value by a factor of 100 (since 10 * 10 = 100).

Example: Moving the decimal point in “344.25” to the left twice would result in a value of “3.4425,” so the counter in the problem has a length of 3.4425 meters.

, Read through the problem and make sure that the length measurement is described in meters (m). The problem must also require you to change the current value to its equivalent in centimeters (cm).



Example: The store sold a length of fabric measuring 2.3 meters long. Convert the amount of fabric into centimeters.

, There are exactly 100 centimeters in every 1 meter, so the meter value will be smaller than its centimeter equivalent by two decimal places. As a result, converting the meter value to centimeters can be done by merely shifting the decimal point two spaces to the right.


Shifting the decimal place to the right makes the number larger and causes the value to increase. Each place holder represents a factor of 10, and shifting the decimal point to places to the right will ultimately increase the final value by a factor of 100 (since 10 * 10 = 100).

Example: Moving the decimal point in “2.3” to the right twice would result in a value of “230,” so the fabric in the problem measures 230 centimeters long.

, This problem requires you to convert centimeters to meters, so you will need to either divide the centimeter amount by 100 or shift the decimal two places to the left.

 30℃

 0℃

100℃;
, For example, 30 plus 273.15 is 303.15. This is all you need to do to make your conversion. Just add 273.15 and you're done.

 30+273.15=303.15{\displaystyle 30+273.15=303.15}

 0+273.15=273.15{\displaystyle 0+273.15=273.15}

 100+273.15=373.15{\displaystyle 100+273.15=373.15}, Once you've made your calculation, simply add a K and call it a day.

 30+273.15={\displaystyle 30+273.15=}303.15K{\displaystyle 303.15K}

 0+273.15={\displaystyle 0+273.15=}273.15K{\displaystyle 273.15K}

 100+273.15={\displaystyle 100+273.15=}373.15K{\displaystyle 373.15K}, The correct way to say ""292 K"" is simply ""two-hundred and ninety-two Kelvin."" Kelvin is known as the ""absolute temperature,"" and does not use degrees.Each unit is actually called ""a Kelvin."" It doesn't get two degrees hotter, but two Kelvins hotter.


, Absolute zero, or 0 K, is the point where molecules theoretically stop moving. This is the ""perfect"" cold. While absolute zero is not possible to create, scientists have come close. The point of the Kelvin scale is to make this sort of calculation -- absolute zero -- easier to work with., Because 0 K is the lowest temperature possible in the universe, Kelvin has no negative numbers. This makes it much, much easier to work with mathematically. You can better compare temperatures, find differences or averages, and note relationships when you don't have to work with positive and negative temperatures.

Kelvin is also used to measure color temperature -- thus the 3000K, 6000K, etc. settings on cameras and professional lighting kits and bulbs., The Kelvin is defined as 1273.15{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{273.15}}} the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. Accordingly, the number 273.15 is frequently used to convert temperatures to Kelvin. Don't worry if this explanation doesn't make much sense -- it is mostly for high-level chemists and physicists., You cannot go directly from Fahrenheit to Kelvin without converting to Celsius first. The Celsius to Kelvin conversion is much easier than the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion. You will almost definitely need a calculator for this.86℉


, For example, 86 minus 32 is 54. As an interesting aside, know that this is because the freezing point of Celsius is 32 less than Fahrenheit.86−32=54{\displaystyle 86-32=54}

 Multiply the number you just calculated by 59{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{9}}}, or 0.5555.. For example, 54 times 0.5555 is 30. In some formulas, you may also be asked to divide by 1.8, which is the same calculation as multiplying by 0.5555. This finishes the conversion to Celsius.


54∗.5555=30{\displaystyle 54*.5555=30}


54∗59=30{\displaystyle 54*{\frac {5}{9}}=30}


, Once you've subtracted 32 and multiplied by 59{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{9}}}, you're in Celsius. Now just add 273.15 to get to Kelvin and call it a day.


30+273.15={\displaystyle 30+273.15=}303.15K{\displaystyle 303.15K}

Write down the decimal.,
Convert the decimal to a fraction.,
Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator of the new fraction.,
Divide both numbers by the GCF to simplify the fraction.",How to Convert a Decimal to a Fraction1," If the decimal terminates, then it should end after a one or several points after the decimal. Let's say you're working with the terminating decimal .325. Write it down.;
, To do this, count how many numbers there are after the decimal point. With the number .325, there are three numbers after the decimal point. So, put the number ""325"" over the number 1000, which is really the number 1 with three 0's after it. If you were working with the number .3, which is one number after the decimal points, then you could represent it as 3/10.


You can also say the decimal aloud. In this case .325 = ""325 thousandths."" That sounds like a fraction! Write .325 = 325/1000.

, This is how you can simplify the fraction. Find the biggest number that divides evenly into both 325 and 1000. In this case, the GCF of both numbers is 25, because that's the largest number that goes evenly into both numbers.


You don't have to look for the GCF right away. You can also use trial and error to simplify the fractions. For example, if you're working with two even numbers, keep dividing them by 2 until one of them becomes odd or you can't simplify further. If you're working with an even and odd number, try dividing them by 3.
If you're working with numbers that end in a 0 or 5, divide them by 5.

, Divide 325 by 25 to get 13 and divide 1000 by 25 to get 40. The simplified fraction is 13/40. So, .325 = 13/40.

Multiply the equation by another power of 10 to move more numbers to the left of the decimal point.,
Place the variable and constant terms over each other.,
Subtract.,
Solve for x.,
Simplify the fraction.",How to Convert a Decimal to a Fraction2," A periodic decimal is a decimal with a repeating pattern that never ends. For example, 2.345454545 is a periodic decimal. This time, we'll be solving for x. Write x = 2.345454545.

, In this example a single power of 10 will suffice, so write ""10x = 23.45454545...."" You have to do this because if you multiply the right side of the equation by 10, you have to multiply the left side of the equation by 10 too.

, In this example, let's multiply the decimal by 1000. Write,""1000x = 2345.45454545...."" You have to do this because if you multiply the right side of the equation by 1000, you have to multiply the left side of the equation by 1000 too.

, This will set them up to be subtracted. Now, place the second equation over the first, so that 1000x = 2345.45454545 is lined up over 10x = 23.45454545 just as it would be in a regular subtraction problem.

, Subtract 10x from 1000x to get 990x and subtract 23.45454545 from 2345.45454545 to get 2322. Now you have 990x = 2322.

, Now that you have 990x = 2322, you can find ""x"" by dividing both sides by 990. So, x = 2322/990.

, Divide the numerator and denominator by any common factors. Compute the GCD of the numerator and denominator to ensure that you have fully simplified. In this example the GCD of 2322 and 990 is 18, so you can divide both 990 and 2322 by 18 to simplify the numerator and denominator of the fraction. 990/18 = 129 and 2322/18 = 129/55. Therefore, 2322/990 = 129/55. You're done.

Count out how many of each ""place"" you have.,
Add your four numbers together.,
Change any number above ""9"" into a letter.,
Try a few examples to get better at converting.",How to Convert Binary to Hexadecimal2," Binary numbers can only be 1 and 0. Hexadecimal numbers can be 0-9, or A-F, since hexadecimal is base-16. You can convert any binary string to hexadecimal (1, 01, 101101, etc.), but you need four numbers to make the conversion (0101→5; 1100→C, etc.). For this lesson, start with the example 1010.

1010

If you don't have 4 digits, add zeros to the front to make it four digits. So, 01 would become 0001., Each of the four numbers signifies a type of number decimal system number. The last digit is the one's place. You will make sense of the rest of the digits in the next step. For now, write a small one above the last digit.1010


10101{\displaystyle 1010^{1}}

Note that you are not raising anything to any power -- this is just a way to see what digit means what.


, These are the rest of your place holders. If you're curious, this is because each digit represents a different power of 2. The first is 23{\displaystyle 2^{3}}, the second 22{\displaystyle 2^{2}}, etc.

1010


18041201{\displaystyle 1^{8}0^{4}1^{2}0^{1}}


, Luckily, this conversion is easy once you have four numbers and know what they all mean. If you have a one in the first number, you have one eight. If you have a zero in the second column, you have no fours. The third column tells you how many twos, and the second how many ones. So, for our example:1010


18041201{\displaystyle 1^{8}0^{4}1^{2}0^{1}}

 8 0 2 0


, Once you have your new hexadecimal numbers, simply add them up.

1010


18041201{\displaystyle 1^{8}0^{4}1^{2}0^{1}}

 8 0 2 0


8+0+2+0=10{\displaystyle 8+0+2+0=10}


Final answer: The binary number 1010 converts to A in the hexadecimal system.


, This is so you don't get confused when reading hexadecimal (""is that a 1 and a 5, or a 15?""). Luckily, the system is super easy, since you can't have a hexadecimal number bigger than 15. Simply start the alphabet with 10, so that:


10=A{\displaystyle 10=A}


11=B{\displaystyle 11=B}


12=C{\displaystyle 12=C}


13=D{\displaystyle 13=D}


14=E{\displaystyle 14=E}

Cut your string of binary numbers into groups of four, starting from the right.,
Add extra zeros to the front of the first number if it is not four digits.,
Convert one 4-digit group at a time.,
Remove the spaces to create you hexadecimal number.,
Memorize or check a conversion table to see if you got each part right.",How to Convert Binary to Hexadecimal3," Hexadecimal converts 4 binary digits into one hexadecimal unit. So, in order to convert the number, you first need to break it up into groups of four, starting on the right. For example:

Convert 11101100101001{\displaystyle 11101100101001} into a hexadecimal number.


11101100101001=(11)(1011)(0010)(1001){\displaystyle 11101100101001=(11)(1011)(0010)(1001)}


, The zeros will not affect the conversion, but they will make it easier to visualize. Remember, you want all groups of 4-digit binary numbers.

Convert 11101100101001{\displaystyle 11101100101001} into a hexadecimal number.

'11101100101001=(11)(1011)(0010)(1001){\displaystyle 11101100101001=(11)(1011)(0010)(1001)}


(11)(1011)(0010)(1001)={\displaystyle (11)(1011)(0010)(1001)=}(0011)(1011)(0010)(1001){\displaystyle (0011)(1011)(0010)(1001)}


, You'll need to convert each binary set by itself, so separate them on your paper to make them easier to work with. Work on converting each individual string of four into its hexadecimal counterpart. For our example:0011=0+0+2+1=3{\displaystyle 0011=0+0+2+1=3}


1011=8+0+2+1=11=B{\displaystyle 1011=8+0+2+1=11=B}


0010=0+0+2+0=2{\displaystyle 0010=0+0+2+0=2}


1001=8+0+0+1=9{\displaystyle 1001=8+0+0+1=9}


, Once you've converted all the 4-digit parts, simply ram them together to get your final answer. So, for the example above:

(0011) (1011) (0010) (1001)</math>

 3 B 2 9


11101100101001=3B29{\displaystyle 11101100101001=3B29} 


, There are only 16 possible 4-digit combinations of binary numbers. So, if you don't want to figure out each string individually, you can use this conversion table.

Convert the dimensions to centimeters.,
Find the volume of the shape.,
Convert cubic centimeters to liters.",How to Calculate Volume in Litres1," If the dimensions are given in meters, inches, feet, or some other unit of measurement, convert each dimension to centimeters (cm) before calculating the volume. This will make it easier to convert to liters. Consider the following conversions:

1 meter = 100 centimeters.So, if the length of a cube is 2.5 meters, that converts to 2,500 centimeters, since 2.5×100=2,500{\displaystyle 2.5\times 100=2,500}.

1 inch = 2.54 centimeters.So, if the length of a cube is 5 inches, that converts to 12.7 centimeters, since 5×2.54=12.7{\displaystyle 5\times 2.54=12.7}.

1 foot = 30.48 centimeters.So, if the length of a cube is 3 feet, that converts to 91.44 centimeters, since 3×30.48=91.44{\displaystyle 3\times 30.48=91.44}.
;
, How you find the volume will depend on the shape of the three-dimensional object you are measuring, since the volume of each type of shape is calculated differently. To find the volume of a cube, you can use the formula Volume=Length×Width×Height{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\text{Length}}\times {\text{Width}}\times {\text{Height}}}.The volume of a three-dimensional shape will be in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm3{\displaystyle cm^{3}}).

For example, if a fish tank is 40.64 cm long, 25.4 cm wide, and 20.32 tall you would calculate the volume by multiplying these dimensions together:Volume=Length×Width×Height{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\text{Length}}\times {\text{Width}}\times {\text{Height}}}Volume=40.64×25.4×20.32{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=40.64\times 25.4\times 20.32}Volume=20,975cm3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=20,975cm^{3}}


, To do this, use the conversion rate 1liter=1,000cm3{\displaystyle 1\;{\text{liter}}=1,000cm^{3}}. Dividing the volume (in cubic centimeters) of the shape by 1,000 will give you the volume in liters (L).For example, if the volume of the fish tank, in cubic centimeters, is 20,975, to find the volume in liters, calculate 20,975÷1,000=20.975{\displaystyle 20,975\div 1,000=20.975}. So, a fish tank that is 40.64 cm long, 25.4 cm wide, and 20.32 tall has a volume of 20.975 L.

Convert hectoliters to liters.,
Convert decaliters to liters.",How to Calculate Volume in Litres2," There are 1,000 milliliters (mL) in 1 liter (L). So, to convert milliliters to liters, you would divide the number of milliliters by 1,000.For example, if the volume of a carton of almond milk is 1,890 mL, to convert to liters, you would calculate 1,890mL÷1,000=1.89L{\displaystyle 1,890mL\div 1,000=1.89L}.


, There are 100 centiliters (cL) in 1 liter. So, to convert centiliters to liters, you would divide the number of centiliters by 100.For example, if a the volume of a carton of almond milk is 189 cL, to convert to liters, you would calculate 189cL÷100=1.89L{\displaystyle 189cL\div 100=1.89L}.


, There are 10 deciliters (dL) in 1 liter. So, to convert deciliters to liters, you would divide the number of deciliters by 10.For example, if a the volume of a carton of almond milk is 18.9 dL, to convert to liters, you would calculate 18.9dL÷10=1.89L{\displaystyle 18.9dL\div 10=1.89L}.


, There are 1000 liters in 1 kiloliter (kl). So, to convert kiloliters to liters, you would multiply the number of kiloliters by 1,000.For example, if the volume of a kiddie pool is 240 kl, to convert to liters, you would calculate 240kl×1000=240,000L{\displaystyle 240kl\times 1000=240,000L}.


, There are 100 liters in 1 hectoliter (hl). So, to convert hectoliters to liters, you would multiply the number of hectoliters by 100.For example, if the volume of a kiddie pool is 2,400 hl, to convert to liters, you would calculate 2,400hl×100=240,000L{\displaystyle 2,400hl\times 100=240,000L}.


, There are 10 liters in 1 decaliters (dal). So, to convert decaliters to liters, you would multiply the number of decaliters by 10.For example, if the volume of a kiddie pool is 24,000 dal, to convert to liters, you would calculate 24,000dal×10=240,000L{\displaystyle 24,000dal\times 10=240,000L}.

Rewrite this number to drop any insignificant digits.,
Write ""x 10"" after the rewritten number.,
Count how many times you moved the original decimal point.,
Write that number as the exponent over the number 10.,
Decide if the exponent should be negative or positive.,
Round your number as much as necessary.",How to Change Numbers Into and Out of Scientific Notation1," You'll need to start with a very small or a very large number if you want to successfully convert it into scientific notation. For example, 10,090,250,000,000 is very large; 0.00004205 is very small.






;
, This is the first step to beginning to convert the number into scientific notation. If you're working with the number 0.00004205, just write an ""x"" over the decimal point.








, In this case, the first non-zero number is 4, so place the decimal point after the 4 so that the new number reads 000004.205.









This works for large numbers, too. For example, 10,090,250,000,000 would become 1.0090250000000.

, Insignificant digits are any zeros that are not in between other, non-zero digits.









For example, in the number 1.0090250000000, the zeroes at the end are insignificant, but the zeros between the 1 and then 9, and between the 9 and the 2, are significant. Rewrite this number as 1.009025.
In the number 000004.205, the leading zeros are insignificant. Rewrite this number as 4.205.

, Just write 4.205 x 10 for now.








, In the case of 0.00004205 to 4.205, you moved the decimal point over 5 times. In the case of 10,090,250,000,000 to 1.0090250000000, you moved the decimal point 13 times.








, For 1.0090250000000, write x 1013. For 4.25, write x 105.








, If your original number was very large, the exponent should be positive. If your original number was very small, the exponent should be negative.









For example: the very large number 10,090,250,000,000 becomes 1.009025 x 10 13 while the very small number 0.00004205 becomes 4.205 x 10-5.

, This depends on how certain you need to be in your answer. For example, 1.009025 x 1013 might be better off as 1.009 x 1013 or even as 1.01 x 1013, depending on how accurate you need to be.








"
"
Decide if you will be moving the decimal point to the left or to the right.,
Write down how many places you would need to move the decimal.,
Move the decimal point over, adding zeroes for every empty space.,
Write the new decimal point after you've moved over the correct amount of spaces.








,
Add commas to any number over 999.",How to Change Numbers Into and Out of Scientific Notation2," If the exponent on the ""x 10"" part of the number is positive, then you will be moving the decimal places to the right; if the exponent is negative, you will be moving the decimal places to the left.








, In the case of the number 5.2081 x 1012, you will be moving the decimal point over five spaces to the right. If the exponent is a -7, you move left seven places; if the exponent is a 5, move right five places.








, You may have to add them in front of or behind the number, depending on whether you are moving left or right. If you're moving the decimal point over 12 spaces to the right from the number 5.2081, then the new number becomes 5208100000000.








,, Go through the digits, from right to left, putting a comma in front of every group of three digits. For example, 5208100000000 becomes 5,208,100,000,000.

Write the denominator outside the division bracket and the numerator inside of it.,
Place a zero with a decimal point after it above the division bracket.,
Use long division to get your answer.,
Write your answer.",How to Change a Common Fraction Into a Decimal1," Let's say we're working with the problem 3/4. Simply write a ""4"" outside the division bar with a ""3"" on the inside. The ""4"" is your divisor, and the ""3"" is your dividend.;
, Since you're working with a fraction, you know that your answer will be less than one, so this first step is necessary. After you do this, you'll need to place a decimal after the 3 under the division bracket and write an additional zero after it. Though 3 and ""3.0"" are the same, adding the extra zero will allow you to divide 4 into the 3.0.

, When you do long division, you can pretend that the decimal points don't exist and act like you're just dividing 4 into 30, for now. Here is how you do it:


First, divide ""4"" into 3.0, which you can think of as 30. The closest you can get is 4 x 7, or 28, which will give you a remainder of 2. So, write a 7 after the ""0."" above the division bracket and ""28"" below the ""3.0"" under the division bracket. Under that, write 2, your remainder, or what you have left when you subtract 28 from 30.
Next, add another ""0"" to the ""3.0"" so you have ""3.00"", or what you can think of as ""300,"" under the division bracket. This will allow you to drop down another 0 to the right of the ""2"" so you can divide ""4"" into ""20.""
Divide ""4"" into ""20"" to get 5. Write the ""5"" to the right of the ""0.7"" above the division bracket, so you have ""0.75"" written there.

, You'll find that ""3"" divided by ""4"" will give you "".75"". Write down this answer and you're all done.

Set up the long-division problem.,
Place a zero with a decimal point after it above the division bracket.,
Do long division.,
Write your answer.",How to Change a Common Fraction Into a Decimal2," You may not always know that you're going to get an answer with a repeating decimal when you begin long division. Let's say we're converting the common fraction 1/3 to a decimal. Just set it up with the 3, or the denominator, outside the division bracket, and the 1 inside the division bracket.

, Since your answer will be less than one, this will help you put the answer in decimal form. You should also place a decimal point after the ""1"" inside the division bracket.

, Now, to do long division, you'll begin by making the ""1."" into a ""1.0"" so you can divide ""3"" into what you can think of as the number ""10."" Here's where you go from there:


Simply divide 10 by 3. You'll get 3 x 3, or 9, with a remainder of 1. So, write a 3 after the ""0."" above the division bracket, and subtract the answer, 9, from 10 to get a remainder of 1.
Add another ""0"" after the ""1"" below the ""10"" to get ""10"" again. When you divide ""3"" into ""10"" again, you'll have to repeat the process, placing another ""3"" after the first ""3"" above the division bracket along with subtracting another ""9"" from the new ""10"" you have left.
Keep going until you notice a pattern. Notice something funny yet? You'll see that this can go on forever. You can keep dividing 3 into 10, getting a remainder of 1, and writing yet another ""3"" after the decimal point above the division bracket.

, Now that you see that the ""3"" can repeat forever, simply write your answer as "".3"" with a bar over the ""3"" to indicate that it will repeat forever, or as "".33"" with the same bar over both numbers. This is 1/3 in decimal form because you'll never be able to get a perfect, clean decimal out of it.


There are many fractions that have repeating decimals, such as 2/9 ("".2"" repeating), 5/6 ("".83"" with the ""3"" repeating), or 7/9 ("".7"" repeating). This will happen any time you have a denominator that is a multiple of 3 with a numerator that won't go into it cleanly.

Find a number you can multiply by the denominator of the fraction to make it 10, 100, 1000 or any 1 followed by 0s.,
Multiply both the numerator and denominator of the fraction by that number.,
State your answer as the numerator with the decimal point moved to the left for every 0 in the numerator.",How to Change a Common Fraction Into a Decimal3," This can be an easy way to change a common fraction to a decimal without using your calculator or doing long division. First, you simply have to find a way to multiply the denominator of the fraction to get either a 10, 100, 1000, and so on. You can find this number by trying to divide the denominator first by 10, then by 100, then by 1000, until you find a whole number. Here are some examples:


3/5. 10/5 = 2, which is a full number. You know you can multiply 5 x 2 to get 10, so 2 will be your magic number.
3/4. 10/4 = 2.5, so that's not a full number, but 100/4 = 25, which is a full number. So, now you know you can multiply 4 by 25 to get 100, so 25 will be the number you use.
5/16. 10/16 = .625, 100/16 = 6.25, 1000/16 = 62.5, 10,000/16 = 625, which is your first full number. So, now you know you can multiply 16 by 625 to get 10,000, so 625 is your magic number.

, This is pretty straightforward. Simply multiply both the top and bottom of the fraction by the same number. Here's how it will look:3/5 x 2/2 = 6/10
3/4 x 25/25 = 75/100
5/16 x 625/625 = 3,125/10,000

, Now, simply check out the bottom of your denominator to see how many 0s you're working with. If you just have one, then move that decimal point over to the left one digit, and so on, and you'll have your final answer. Here's how you do it:


3/5 = 6/10 = .6
3/4 = 75/100 = .75
5/16 = 3,125/10,000 = .3125

"
Measure the length, width, and depth of an object in inches.,
Write the length of your object.,
Multiply the length by the width of your object.,
Multiply your answer by the depth of your object.,
Label your answer in cubic inches.",How to Calculate Cubic Inches2," To calculate the volume of a rectangular space, all you need to know are the values of its dimensions in inches. You may need to physically measure the object or to convert to inches from a different set of units.


For example, if we wanted to find the volume of a refrigerator, we would find its length, width, and depth in inches. Let's say our fridge is 50 inches (127.0 cm) long, 25 inches (63.5 cm) wide, and 20 inches (50.8 cm) deep.

, The first step in calculating a volume with this process is to write one of your dimensions down. You can multiply these dimensions in any order - for our purposes, let's write the length first.


In our example, we would write 50 first, as our fridge is 50 inches (127.0 cm) long.

, Next, multiply your first dimension by one of the others. Again, you can multiply your dimensions in any order, but, for our purposes, let's multiply the length by the width.


In our example, we would multiply 50 × 25 - the width. 50 × 25 = 1250.

, Finally, multiply the answer you got by multiplying two of your object's dimensions by the remaining dimension. In our case, this means multiplying the product of our object's length and width by its depth.


In our example, we would multiply 1250 × 20 - the depth. 1250 × 20 = 25,000.

, You may know that your final answer refers to a volume in cubic inches, but another person may not. Be sure to use a proper label for your answer that specifies that the volume is in cubic inches.


Acceptable labels include:

""Cubic Inches""
""Inches Cubed""
""Cu. In.""
""In3""

Calculate the volume of a cylinder with v = hπr2.,
Calculate the volume of a cone with v = (1/3)hπr2.,
Calculate the volume of a sphere with v = 4/3πr3.",How to Calculate Cubic Inches3," Cubes are rectangular prisms (boxes) in which every side length and angle is equal. Thus, the volume of a cube can be written as length × width × depth = length × length × length = length3. To get your answer in cubic inches, ensure your length measurement is in inches.

, Cylinders are smooth-sided objects with two circular faces of equal size. The formula v = hπr2 where v = volume, h = height, and r = the cylinder's radius (the distance from the center of either of the circular faces to its edge) gives the volume of a cylinder. Make sure your measurements for h and r are in inches.

, Cones are smooth-sided objects with a circular base that tapers to a point. The formula v = hπr2/3 where v = volume, h = height, and r = the radius of the circular base gives the volume of a cone. As above, ensure your measurements for h and r are in inches.

, Spheres are perfectly round 3-d objects. The equation v = 4/3πr3 where v = volume and r = the radius of the sphere (the distance from its center to its edge) gives the volume of a sphere. As before, make sure your measurement for r is in inches.

Find your weight in pounds.,
Divide your weight in pounds by 14.,
Convert stones to pounds.",How to Calculate Your Weight in Stones1," Pounds are the U.S. standard unit for measuring mass or weight.Most standard scales in the U.S. will weigh you in pounds, including scales at your doctor’s office, and personal scales you can buy.

For example, you might weigh 165 pounds.
;
, One stone is equal to 14 pounds. So dividing pounds by 14 will give you your weight in stones. For example, 16514=11.79{\displaystyle {\frac {165}{14}}=11.79}. So, 165 pounds is about 12 stone. Specifically, it is 11 stone, 11 pounds, since 165 divided by 14 is 11, with a remainder of 11.


, To do this, you need to do the opposite of what you would do to convert pounds to stones. That means you need to multiply the number of stones by 14. If the weight is given in the number of stones and pounds, multiply the number of stones by 14, and add the pounds to the product. Otherwise, just multiply the whole number or decimal by 14.

For example, to convert 10 stone, 8 pounds, you would calculate:10×14+8{\displaystyle 10\times 14+8}=140+8{\displaystyle =140+8}=148{\displaystyle =148}So, 10 stone, 8 pounds is equal to 148 pounds.

Find your weight in kilograms.,
Multiply your weight by .15747{\displaystyle .15747}.,
Convert stones to kilograms.",How to Calculate Your Weight in Stones2," Kilograms are a standard metric unit for measuring mass. People around the world use kilograms to measure weight.

For example, you might weigh 70 kilograms.


, One stone’s weight is 15.747 percent of 1 kilogram. So multiplying the number of kilograms by .15747 will give you your weight in stones. For example, 70×.15747=11.0229{\displaystyle 70\times .15747=11.0229}. So, 70 kilograms is about 11 stone.


, To do this, you need to do the opposite of what you would do to convert kilograms to stones. So, you would divide the number of stones by .15747.

For example, to convert 9 stone to kilograms, you would calculate 9.15747=57.15{\displaystyle {\frac {9}{.15747}}=57.15}. So 9 stone is about 57 kilograms.

,How to Calculate BTU Per Square Foot1,
"
Measure your square footage.,
Determine the necessary heating or cooling capacity.",How to Calculate BTU Per Square Foot2," Measure the square footage of each room you plan to heat or cool and add them together. If you're installing a furnace or central air conditioning system, this typically includes every room. In some homes, the ducts do not connect to the attic or basement.


For a rectangular room, multiply the length and width, measured in feet.
For a triangular room, multiply the length and width, then divide by two.
For a circular room, measure the radius r (the distance from the center to the edge). Calculate πr2, or (3.14)r2 if you do not have a calculator with a π function.
For rooms with odd shapes, divide them into smaller pieces and measure each piece separately.

, The capacity of furnaces and air conditioners is given in BTUs per hour. You need to establish the correct number of BTUs per square foot for your house needed to either heat or cool it. The methods differ for heating and cooling and are described below.


Many furnaces and air conditioners will be labeled ""BTU,"" but this is actually shorthand for ""BTU per hour"" (BTU/h).
At a bare minimum, you can use a figure of 20 BTUs per hour per square foot and multiply this by the total square footage to be heated or cooled, but this does not take into account climate, the amount of insulation you have, or the way you live.


"
"
Figure the total square footage to be cooled.,
Determine the necessary capacity.,
Adjust for special conditions.,
Look at the efficiency rating.",How to Calculate BTU Per Square Foot3," If you're buying a room air conditioner, you only need to figure the room whose window the air conditioner will be installed in; if you're buying a central air conditioner or heat pump, you need to figure the entire square footage of the house served by ductwork, as described under ""Determining How Much to Heat or Cool.""

, One method for determining capacity is refer to the estimates on this index.Note that air conditioners are rated in BTUs per hour, but the label may abbreviate this to just ""BTU.""


To cool 100–150 ft2, you need ~5,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 150–250 ft2, you need ~6,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 250–300 ft2, you need ~7,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 300–350 ft2, you need ~8,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 350–400 ft2, you need ~9,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 400–450 ft2, you need ~10,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 450–550 ft2, you need ~12,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 550–700 ft2, you need ~14,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 700–1,000 ft2, you need ~18,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 1,000–1,200 ft2, you need ~21,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 1,200–1,400 ft2, you need ~23,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 1,400–1,500 ft2, you need ~24,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 1,500–2,000 ft2, you need ~30,000 BTUs per hour.
To cool 2,000–2,500 ft2, you need ~34,000 BTUs per hour.

, If you're buying a room air conditioner instead of a central unit, you can adjust your needs according to the following factors:


Reduce the necessary capacity by 10 percent if the room to be cooled is heavily shaded. However, if the room is very sunny, increase the necessary capacity by 10 percent.
If the room regularly hosts more than 2 people, add 600 BTUs/hour for each person after the second.
If the room to be cooled is a kitchen, increase the necessary capacity by 4,000 BTUs/hour.

, While furnaces are rated by their effectiveness in delivering the heat they generate, air conditioners are rated by how efficiently they use electricity over the course of a typical operating year. One such rating is the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) rating, created by the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, which is the ratio of the unit's cooling output in BTUs divided by the energy in watt-hours needed to run it for the entire operating year. (Note that 1 kilowatt-hour equals 1,000 watt hours.)


For example, take a 4,000 BTU/hour air conditioner run for 1,000 hours during an operating year using 400,000 watt-hours of electric power. This air conditioner would have a SEER rating of 10, since 4,000 x 1,000 / 400,000 = 10.
To find the average power consumption divide the unit's power in BTUs per hour by the SEER rating. Since the SEER rating is in units of BTU per Watt-hour, your answer will be in terms of watts. In the example above, (4,000 BTU/h) / (10 BTU/Wh) = 400 W.
To find the cost per hour of operation, multiply the average power consumption in kilowatts by the cost of your electricity per kilowatt-hour. In our example, the unit's consumption is (400 W) / (1,000 W/kW) = 0.4kW. If your electricity costs 5 cents per kWh, this unit costs 0.4kW x 5 ¢/kWh = 2 ¢/h (cents per hour).
Central air conditioners manufactured in the United States since January 2006 are required to have a SEER rating of at least 13, or 14 to be Energy Star qualified. Room air conditioners are currently exempt from this requirement; many have SEER ratings closer to 10.

Consider your climate.,
Consider age and insulation.,
Multiply the total square footage to be heated by the heating factor.,
Take the efficiency rating of the furnace into account.",How to Calculate BTU Per Square Foot4," In warmer climates, you may need only 30 to 35 BTU per hour per square foot to heat your house adequately. In colder climates, you may need up to 50 to 60 BTU/h/ft2. In general, the further from the equator you live, the greater the number of BTU/h/ft2 you need, but weather patterns and geography modify this somewhat. A map of climate zones for the United States and Canada can be found at http://www.acdirect.com/systemsize.php.


Many product labels abbreviate ""BTU per hour"" (BTU/h) as ""BTU."" You do not need to do any calculations to turn this into BTU/h.

, Newer homes tend to be better insulated than older homes because of revisions to building codes over the years. Better insulated homes need fewer BTUs per hour per square foot than older homes. If your home is new or well insulated, you can use the lower of the two numbers for your climate zone; if it is older or poorly insulated, use the higher number of the range.

, If you live in a 2,500 square foot home and a climate zone with a heating factor of 40 BTUs per square foot, you need a furnace with an output of 100,000 BTUs per hour.

, Furnaces are rated not by the actual BTU output you receive but by the amount of heat they generate. How much of the heat a furnace generates (input heat) that actually reaches you (output heat) is a measure of how efficient the furnace is. The efficiency is expressed in percentage as a ratio of the output to input heat. Most modern furnaces are rated as either 80 or 90 percent efficient.


In the example above, a 100,000 BTU/h input furnace would not be enough to heat a home needing an output of 100,000 BTUs per hour. An 80% efficient furnace would deliver an output of only 80,000 BTU/h (100,000 x 0.8). To find an 80% efficient furnace that does provide enough power, divide the goal by 0.8. In our example, 100,000 BTU/h ÷ 0.8 = 125,000 BTU/h, so you'd need a furnace rated to 125,000 BTU/h input.

So the value for the 3300s would be 5. This value for any century can instead be computed by multiplying 5 times the difference between the (2-digit) century and the highest multiple of 4 in it. For example, the 3400s would be: 5 X (34-32) = 10 (and 10, when reduced by the 7s in it, equals 3). This formula could even be extended further to encompass and compute the entire Year value in one felled swoop, but that formula, at its simplest, would be too complicated to carry around in one’s head and then perform the calculation quickly and precisely, which are the goals of the process explained here.
Note: This process can be used in reverse to find either the Month, Day or Year, if any one of them is missing but the Day-of-the-Week is known.""
Note: The person who put up the example misread the second step, which slows down the formula considerably. The first line of the example should show 6/4 and not 90/4, with all subsequent lines of the example changed accordingly. The result is still the same, but the original way is faster.

Memorize ""2007"" and ""Wednesday"".,
Memorize the following dates.,
To use this algorithm for other years, increase your day by one for each year (2006 is Tuesday, 2005 is Monday).

,
For leap-years, calculate as usual for January and February.",How to Calculate the Day of the Week2," This is your base day and year. The instructions below will demonstrate how to calculate the day of week for any day in 2007. The final steps will show how to move this to other years.

, In 2007, they are all Wednesdays (your base day for that year)


April 4 (4/4), June 6 (6/6), 8/8, 10/10 and 12/12 (December 12). These are easy to remember for Americans or Europeans because of the symmetry.
Also, memorize 7/11, 11/7, 9/5 and 5/9 (Memory aid: The people at the 7/11 work from 9 to 5, and reverse the numbers too).
You now have 1 day-of-week per month from April though December. January, February, and March have your base day (Wednesday for 2007) on 1/31, 2/7, 2/14, 2/21, 2/28, 3/7, 3/14, 3/21, and 3/28. These should be easy to remember because it is 7,14,21,28, and we're doing math by 7s because there are 7 days per week.
You now have 1 day-of-week for every month. From this you should be able to easily calculate the day-of-week for any date in 2007.

,, Add an extra day for other months, so although 2006 is Tuesday and 2007 is Wednesday, 2008 is Friday (for March and beyond)

"
"
Assign a letter of the alphabet to every day of the year.,
Continue through all 365 days of the year this way.,
Know which letter is the Sunday Letter (a self-explanatory term) for the year you care about.,
Put these together to find the day of the week of any date.",How to Calculate the Day of the Week3," Since there are seven days in a week, we use seven letters (A through G). January 1 is A, January 2 is B, and so on. After G, it starts over from A again. So since January 7 is G, January 8 will be A again (as will January 15, 22, and 29).

, (We are ignoring leap years for now). When we reach December 31, we will be back at the letter A for the fifty-third time. Here is a chart of day letters for the whole year:

For 2005, the Sunday Letter is B.
For 2006, it is A. (back one letter from the year before)
For 2007, it is G. (again, back one letter from the year before -- G is considered to be one letter back from A)
2008 is a leap year. For January and February, the Sunday Letter is F (one letter back from the year before), but the leap day, February 29, causes a disruption. For March through December, the Sunday Letter is E.
For 2009, the Sunday Letter is D. (Again, one step back.)

, For an example, let's try June , 2007. The year 2007 is G. We see from the day table that June 3 is G and therefore a Sunday. But we wanted to know about June 4. June 4 is the day after June 3. Therefore, June 4, 2007, is a Monday.

First, here are some useful properties of…



The Gregorian Calendar ,
Years


Years divisible by 4 are leap years,…
with the exception that years divisible by 100 are not leap years,…
with the exception that years divisible by 400 are leap years.,
Months


January, March, May, July, August, October, and December have 31 days.,
Days


In any given year (even a leap year), “Doomsdays” are all on the same day of the week.,
Now that you know how the Gregorian calendar works, you can use your knowledge to…


Calculate the Day of the Week in Your Head From the Year, Month, and Day
Number-days
“Number-days” are numbers that are associated with days of the week by a mnemonic.,

Non-leap years will be referred to throughout the guide as “normal years.” The Gregorian calendar repeats exactly every 400 years. Note that the Gregorian calendar has been reformed in the past and that this algorithm only applies to the Gregorian calendar in its most recent state. For more information on this reform and its consequences for calculating the day of the week, refer to the “Julian calendar” section of the Wikipedia article entitled “Doomsday rule”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule#Julian_calendar.
In this guide, the notation “C.E.” and “B.C.E.” will be used. “C.E.” means “Common Era” and is equivalent to “A.D.” “B.C.E.” means “Before the Common Era” and is equivalent to “B.C.” For more information refer to the Wikipedia article entitled “Common Era”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era. Think of C.E. years as positive and B.C.E. years as negative (but subtract one from them first). For example, think of 1670 C.E. as 1670, but think of 1540 B.C.E. as -1539. Note that there is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar, so you must subtract 1 from 1540 before placing a negative sign in front of it. For a more detailed explanation, see the Wikipedia article entitled “Astronomical year numbering”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering.
In this guide, the formats mm/dd and mm/dd/yyyy will be used to represent dates in compact form. For example, 8/6 is equivalent to August 6th, 7/24/1670 is equivalent to July 24th, 1670 C.E., 12/6/534 is equivalent to December 6th, 534 C.E., and 10/23/-1889 is equivalent to October 23rd, 1890 B.C.E.

, April, June, September, and November have 30 days. February has 28 days during a normal year and 29 days during a leap year. Leap day, that is, the day that only exists during a leap year, is February 29. There is a useful mnemonic to distinguish between months with 31 days and fewer than 31 days. Hold out your right hand. Tap the knuckle of your index finger and say “January.” Tap the gap/dip/valley between the knuckles of your index and middle fingers and say “February.” You can remember that January has more days than February because your knuckle is taller than the gap. Next tap the knuckle of your middle finger and say “March.” Notice as you continue that all of the months with 31 days are on knuckles, while all of the months with fewer days are in gaps. You’re probably wondering: “What do I do once I get to July?” because July is on the knuckle of your pinky. Just go back to the beginning; tap the knuckle of your index finger again and say “August.” Continue from here to get to the rest of the months.

, Here are some easy-to-remember Doomsdays: 4/4, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, 5/9, 9/5, 7/11, and 11/7. A mnemonic for the last four Doomsdays in the list is: “9 to 5 job at a 7-11 gas station.” For example, in the year 2000, April 4, June 6, July 11, and November 7 are all Tuesdays. (Important note: this does not mean that April 4, 2001 was also Tuesday. April 4, 2001 was actually a Wednesday.) You can add or subtract 7 from any Doomsday to get another Doomsday. For example, 5/9, 5/16, and 5/23 are all Doomsdays. You don’t have to just add or subtract 7 at a time though; you can use any multiple of 7. For example, 9/5 and 9/26 are both Doomsdays, because 5+7*3 ≡ 26. Another easy-to-remember Doomsday is 3/0. No this is not a typo; 3/0 is simply another way of thinking about the last day of February. Unlike 2/28 or 2/29, 3/0 is always the last day of February, regardless of whether or not it is a leap year. The world can even think of months as having negative days. For example, 8/8 and 8/-6 are both Doomsdays. To convert 8/-6 into a normal date, simply add the number of days in the 7th month (August). Use the knuckle trick from the previous paragraph to determine that there are 31 days in August. So, 8/-6 is the same as 7/25, because -6+31 ≡ 25. We may also think of months as having days greater than 31. For example, 10/10 and 10/34 are both Doomsdays. To convert 10/34 into a normal date, simply subtract the number of days in the 10th month (October). Our knuckles tell us that October has 31 days, so 10/34 is 11/3, because 34-31 ≡ 3. We can even write June days as March days. For example, 6/6 and 6/-64 are Doomsdays. May (month 5) has 31 days, so 6/-64 ≡ 5/-33. April (month 4) has 30 days, so 5/-33 ≡ 4/-3. March (month 3) has 31 days, so 4/-3 ≡ 3/28. Thus, June -64th is equivalent to March 28th, which is a Doomsday. Be careful to account for leap years when using these tricks to determine Doomsdays in January or February. For example, in ANY year, 3/0 and 3/-14 are both Doomsdays, but in a leap year February has 29 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/15, while in a normal year February has 28 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/14. Thus, February 15th is a Doomsday during leap years, but February 14th is a Doomsday during normal years. You have to be careful when going from March to January as well. Leap year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-13 ≡ 1/18; normal year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-14 ≡ 1/17.

,
Sunday ≡ NONEday ≡ 0
Monday ≡ ONEday ≡ 1
Tuesday ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2
Wednesday ≡ THREE’Sday ≡ 3 (lame, I know)
Thursday ≡ FOUR’Sday ≡ 4
Friday ≡ FIVEday ≡ 5
Saturday ≡ SIXAday ≡ 6
Sunday ≡ SE’ENday ≡ 7 (“se’en” as in a contraction for “seven” that sounds like “sun”)
Because there are seven days in a week, you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 at ANY point during ANY part of ANY day-of-the-week calculation. This is why Sunday is both 0 and 7. Monday could be thought of as -6, 8, 71, etc. Throughout the guide you will see (and have been seeing) congruence symbols, ≡, rather than equals signs, =, because 71 does NOT equal 8, but they are equivalent for the purpose of determining the day of the week. While finding a day of the week we are only interested in the remainder when numbers are divided by 7. All of these congruence are thus “modulo 7,” abbreviated “mod 7.” Numbers are congruent modulo 7 if their remainders are the same when they are divided by 7. This is equivalent to the earlier point that you can add or subtract multiples of 7 as you wish. For example, 1 ≠ 8, but 1 ≡ 8 (mod 7). More examples of the way in which modulo behave are -15 ≡ -1 ≡ 6 (mod 7) and 4 ≡ -3 ≡ 7004 (mod 7). The notation “(mod 7)” will be left off throughout the guide, because all congruences are assumed to be modulo 7.
If you know that August 8, 1953 is a Saturday, then you can quickly determine that August 4, 1953 is a Tuesday, because four days before SIXAday is TWO’Sday. That is, 6-4 ≡ 2. Likewise, if you know that 9/5/1776 is a FOUR’Sday, then you can quickly see that 9/7/1776 is a SIXAday, because 7-5 ≡ 2 and 4+2 ≡ 6. Remember that you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 to a Number-day. If you know that 10/10/-2543 is a SIXAday, then you can quickly determine that 10/2/-2543 is a FIVEday, because 2-10 ≡ -8 ≡ -8+7 ≡ -1, and 6+(-1) ≡ 5. Once again, remember to watch out for leap years, like 18,400. If you know that 2/28/18,400 is a ONEday, then you can quickly determine that 3/3/18,400 is a FIVEday, because 2/28/18,400 ≡ 3/-1/18,400 and 3-(-1) ≡ 4 and 1+4 ≡ 5.

, For example, every Doomsday in 2009 is a Saturday, so the Year-day of 2009 is Saturday. The “Century-day” of any given century is the “Year-day” of the first year of the century. The “Century-year” is the first year of any given century. The Year-day of 1900 is Wednesday, so the Century-day of the 1900s (i.e. the 20th century) is Wednesday. Also, 1900 is the Century-year of the 20th century. Note though, that the Century-year of the century that -1362 lies in (i.e. the -1300s or the 14th century B.C.E.) is -1400, NOT -1300, because -1400 comes before -1300. Remember also that -1400 is equivalent to 1401 B.C.E., NOT 1400 B.C.E.

, These Year-days are called “Big Tuesdays” (just to help you remember them). Years that are divisible by 400 are called “Big Tuesday-years,” and centuries that have Century-days that are also Big Tuesdays are called “Big Tuesday-centuries.” Thus, the Year-day of 1600 is a Big Tuesday. The Century-days of the 2000s, the -4400s, and the 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesdays, the 2000s, the -4400s, and 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesday-centuries, and 2000, -4400, and 96,812,000 are all Big Tuesday-years.

, Subtract 100 from the Century-year until you get to a Big Tuesday-year. Count how many times you subtracted 100. If you subtracted 100 once, then the Century-day is Sunday; if twice, then it’s Friday; if thrice, then it’s Wednesday; if four or more times, then you messed up, because one of every four Century-years is a Big Tuesday-year. For example, the Century-day of the 1800s is Friday, because you subtract 100 twice to get 1600, which is a Big Tuesday-year (because it’s divisible by 400). The pattern looks like this: 1600 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2, 1700 ≡ SUNday ≡ 0, 1800 ≡ FIVEday ≡ 5 ≡ -2, 1900 ≡ THREE’Sday ≡ 3 ≡ -4, 2000 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2 ≡ -5, and so on. Note that you can get from one Century-day day to the next by subtracting two from the initial Century-day. This only works when the larger of the two adjacent centuries is not a Big Tuesday-century. That’s fine though, because you already know that the Century-day of every Big Tuesday-century is TWO’Sday.

, The “Dozen-day” of any given year is the Year-day of the Dozen-year. The Dozen-day can be calculated by adding the Century-day to the result of the division by 12. For example, the Dozen-year of 1234 is 1224, because 1224-1200 ≡ 24 ≡ 12*2, and no larger years that are still less than or equal to 1234 yield a positive difference with 1200 that is divisible by 12. Since the Year-day of 1224 is Thursday, the Dozen-day of 1234 is also Thursday. Note that the Dozen-days for 1235, 1226, and 1229 are all Thursdays as well; while the Dozen-days for 1236 and 1238 are not the same (they are, in fact, Fridays). For another example, we can calculate the Dozen-day of -1713. We first need to find the Century-day of the -1700s. Since we must subtract 100 three times from -1700 to arrive at a Big Tuesday-year, the Century-day is THREE’Sday. Next we must find the Dozen-year. Note that the Dozen-year is not -1712, but rather -1716, because -1716-(-1800) = 84 = 12*7. So, the Dozen-day of -1713 is 3+7 ≡ 3 ≡ THREE’Sday (since we can subtract 7 as we please).

, The “Quad-day” of any given year is the Year-day of the Quad-year. For example, the Quad-year of 1620 is 1620; while that of 1643 is 1640. The Quad-days of 1640, 1641, 1642, and 1643 are all Wednesday; while the Quad-day of 1620 is Saturday. We can calculate the Quad-day as follows. If the given year is 1642, then the Dozen-year is 1636, because 1636-1600 ≡ 12*3. The Century-year, 1600, is a Big TWO’Sday. 3+2 ≡ 5, so the Dozen-day of 1642 is FIVEday. Subtract 4 from the Quad-year, 1640, until you get to the Dozen-year. Multiply the number of times you subtracted 4 by -2, and add this result to the Dozen-day to get the Quad-day. In our example, 1640-4*1 ≡ 1636, 1*-2 ≡ -2, and 5+(-2) ≡ 3, so the Quad-day of 1642 is Wednesday (as mentioned previously). Wednesday, is thus also the Year-day of 1640.

, Add the result to the Quad-day to get the Year-day. In our example, 1642-1640 ≡ 2, and 2+THREE’Sday ≡ FIVEday, so the Year-day of 1642 is Friday.

, For example, if the date were 9/5/1642, you would already know that it was a Friday. If the date were 6/20/1642, then you would subtract 7 days twice to discover that 6/20/1642 is the same day of the week as 6/6/1642, which is a known Doomsday. This means that 6/20/1642 is also a Doomsday, and is therefore a Friday.

, We know 4/4/1642 is a Doomsday, so we add 14 days to discover that 4/18/1642 is a Doomsday. Now we know that 4/18/1642 is a FIVEday, so we simply add 2 days to find that 4/20/1642 is a SE’ENday. Don’t forget that the nearest known Doomsday may not be in the same month. For example, 3/29/1642 is closer to 4/4/1642 than to 3/0/1642. Since 4/4/1642 ≡ 4/-3/1642 ≡ 3/28/1642, we know that 3/29/1642 ≡ FIVEday + 1 ≡ SIXAday.

, For this example, we'll convert the decimal number 98 into octal.

, Remember that ""decimal"" is called base 10 because each digit represents a power of 10. We call the first three digits 1s place, the 10s place, the 100s place — but we could also write this as the 100 place, the 101 place, and the 102 place. Octal, or the base 8 number system, uses powers of 8 instead of powers of 10. Write a few of these powers of 8 in a horizontal line, from largest to smallest. Note that these numbers are all written in decimal (base 10):


82  81  80

Rewrite these as single numbers:
64  8  1
You don't need any powers of 8 larger than your original number (in this case, 98). Since 83 = 512, and 512 is larger than 98, we can leave it off the chart.

, Take a look at your decimal number: 98. The nine in the 10s place tells you that there are nine 10s in this number. 10 goes into this number 9 times. Similarly, with octal, we want to know how many ""64s"" go into the final number. Divide 98 by 64 to find out. The easiest way to do this is to make a chart, reading top to bottom:98÷

1 ← This is the first digit of your octal number.

, Calculate the remainder of the division problem, or the amount left over that doesn't go in evenly. Write your answer at the top of the second column. This is what's left of your number after the first digit is calculated. In our example, 98 ÷ 64 = 1. Since 1 x 64 = 64, the remainder is 98 - 64 = 34. Add this to your chart:


98   34
÷
64   8   1
=
1

, To find the next digit, we move one step down to the next power of 8. Divide the remainder by this number and fill out your chart's second column:


98   34
÷     ÷

64   8   1
=    =

1    4


, Just as before, find the remainder of your answer and write it at the top of the next column. Keep dividing and finding the remainder until you've done this for every column, including 80 (the ones place). Your final row is the final decimal number converted to octal. Here's our example with the full chart filled out (note that 2 is the remainder of 34÷8):


98   34   2
÷     ÷    ÷

64   8   1
=    =    =

1    4    2

The final answer: 98 base 10 = 142 base 8. You can write this as 9810 = 1428


, To check your work, multiply each digit in octal by the power of 8 it represents. You should end up with your original number. Let's check our answer, 142:


2 x 80 = 2 x 1 = 2
4 x 81 = 4 x 8 = 32
1 x 82 = 1 x 64 = 64
2 + 32 + 64 = 98, the number we started with.

Divide this number by 8.,
Find the remainder.,
Divide the answer to your division problem by 8.,
Divide by 8 again.,
Repeat until you find the final digit.,
Understand how this works.",How to Convert from Decimal to Octal2," We'll start with the decimal number 670.


This method is faster than the successive division method. Most people find it more difficult to understand why it works, and may want to start with the easier method above.

, Ignore decimal values for now. You'll see why this calculation is useful soon.


In our example: 670 ÷ 8 = 83.

, Now that we've ""counted by 8"" as many times as we can, the remainder is the small number left over. This is the last digit of our octal number, in the ones place (80). The remainder is always smaller than 8, so it can't be represented by any of the other digits.In our example: 670 ÷ 8 = 83 remainder 6.
Our octal number so far is ???6.
If your calculator has a ""modulus"" or ""mod"" button, you can find this value by entering ""670 mod 8.""

, Set aside the remainder and return to your division problem. Take your answer and divide by 8 again. Note the answer, then find the remainder. This is the second-to-last digit of your octal number, the 81 = 8s place.


In our example: The answer to our last division problem was 83.
83 ÷ 8 = 10 remainder 3.
Our octal number so far is ??36.

, As before, take the answer to your last division problem. Divide it by 8 again, and find the remainder. This is the third-to-last digit of your octal number, the 82 = 64s place.


In our example: The answer to our last division problem was 10.
10 ÷ 8 = 1 remainder 2.
Our octal number so far is ?236.

, When you calculate your last division problem, the answer will be 0. The remainder to this problem is the first digit in your octal number. You have now fully converted the decimal number.


In our example: The answer to our last division problem was 1.
1 ÷ 8 = 0 remainder 1.
Our final answer is the octal number 1236. We can write this as 12368 to show that it is an octal number.

, If you're having trouble understanding this method, here's an explanation:You start with a pile of 670 units.
The first division problem divides these into groups, with 8 units in each group. Anything left over, the remainder, doesn't fit into the octal 8s place. It must be in the 1s place instead.
Now you take your pile of groups, and divide them into sections with 8 groups each. Each section now has 8 groups with 8 units each, or 64 units total. The remainder doesn't fit into these, so it can't fit into the octal 64s place. It must be in the 8s place.
This continues until you discover the entire number.

Select some Start Year by any method you have available, trying to make it no more than 5 years BEFORE the Target Year that you are looking for.,
Look up the value for Day of the Week that you have for the Target Year in the above table.,
Compute the number of years from the Start Year to the next Leap Year.,
To find the first occurrence of your Target Year after the Start Year, add the DOW Gap (from step 2) to the Start Year that you chose for step 1.,
In the event that you overshot or undershot the Start Year and, thus, missed the actual Target Year, you can make adjustments quickly by computing the prior or next yearly occurrences of the Target Date as follows: Compute the Leap Gap from the Target Year to the next Leap Year exactly as you did in step 3, above.","How to Calculate in Your Head the Year when You Know the Month, Day and Day of the Week"," (Do not worry if you turn out to be wrong because you will be able to make up for this later in step 5.) Using the method explained in another WikiHow article of mine (see first link), compute the Day of the Week for the Month and Day that have for the Target Year, but in this case for the Start Year.;
, If that value is less than the value (from step 1) for the Day of the Week in the Start Year, add 7 to it. Now subtract the value for the Day of the Week for the Start Year (from step 1) from the value for the Day of the Week for the Target Year that you just looked up and perhaps adjusted. Let's call this result the Day of the Week (DOW) Gap.

, Let's call this the Leap Gap. If the month is January of February, add 1 to the Leap Gap, but if this makes the result 5, then change it to 1 (this will happen when the Start Date is in January or February in an actual leap year).

, But add 5 to this if the DOW Gap is equal to the Leap Gap or subtract 1 from it if the DOW Gap is greater than Leap Gap (but if the Dow Gap is 6 and the Leap Gap is 1, do both, that is, add 4). This is the first occurrence of the Target Year after the Start Year. If this turns out to be the actual Target Year you are looking for, your task is done.

, Now, go to the table to the right and find that Leap Gap (numbers 1-4) among the numbers in red outside the circle. To find the occurrences of the Target Year PRIOR to the first one you found in step 4, move counter-clockwise from the point at which you entered the circle, subtracting the indicated numbers (inside the circle) from the last Target Year to jump to the next prior Target Year. To jump to the NEXT occurrences of the Target Year AFTER the first one you found in step 4, move clockwise from the point at which you entered the circle, adding the indicated numbers (inside the circle) to the last Target Year to jump to the next subsequent Target Year. (This is why we call those numbers in the circle the Jump numbers.) You can keep going round and round the circle as long as like as long you stay within a century (see tips).

Understand the scales.,
Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature.,
Divide the result by 1.8.,
Check your answer.","How to Convert Between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin1"," The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales begin at a different number—where 0° Celsius is freezing, that equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit is 32°. In addition to starting at a different temperature, the two scales rise at different rates as well. For instance, the range from freezing to boiling in degrees Celsius is 0-100°, and the same range in degrees Fahrenheit is 32-212°., Since freezing for Fahrenheit is 32 and freezing for Celsius is 0, you begin the conversion by subtracting 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature.For example, if your initial Fahrenheit temperature is 74°F, just subtract 32 from 74. 74-32 = 42., The range for freezing to boiling in Celsius is 0-100 whereas it's 32-212 in Fahrenheit. This is the same as saying that for every 180° Fahrenheit range, there is only a 100° Celsius range. You can express that as 180/100, which when simplified equals 1.8, so to finish the conversion you must divide by 1.8.


For the example from step one, divide your result, 42, by 1.8. 42/1.8 = 23°C. Therefore, 74°F can be converted to 23°C.
Note that 1.8 is the equivalent of 9/5. If you don't have a calculator or prefer working with fractions, you can divide your result from the first step by 9/5 instead of 1.8.

, Here are a few conversions so you can see whether your result makes sense. If you get a result that doesn't fit this scale, check your math again. You may have forgot to subtract before dividing."

Multiply the Celsius temperature by 1.8.,
Add 32 to the result.,
Check your answer.","How to Convert Between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin2"," Since the same rules in the scale differences apply when converting Celsius to Fahrenheit as the opposite, you'll still be using the difference of 32 and the scale difference of 1.8. You just use them in the reverse order.

, If instead, you want to convert the temperature from degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, you can simply reverse the process. Begin by multiplying the Celsius temperature by 1.8.For example, if you're working with the temperature 30°C, you should first multiply it by 1.8, or 9/5. 30 x 1.8 = 54., Now that you have corrected for the differences in scale, you still must correct for the difference in starting points as in step one. To do this, add 32 to the Celsius x 1.8 temperature, and you will have the final temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.


Add 32 to 54, which was the result from step 3. 54 + 32 = 86°F. Therefore, 30°C is equivalent to 86°F.

, If your answer doesn't fit between two lines of this chart, you've probably made a math error. Remember to multiply by 1.8 before adding 32."

Understand the scales.,
Add 273.15 to your Celsius temperature.,
Check your answer.","How to Convert Between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin3"," Scientists understand the Celsius scale as derived from the Kelvin scale.Though the gaps between Celsius and Kelvin are even larger than the gaps between Celsius and Fahrenheit, one thing that Celsius and Kelvin have in common is that they rise at the same rate. Whereas the ratio for Celsius to Fahrenheit is 1:1.8, the ratio for Celsius to Kelvin is 1:1.If it seems odd that freezing for Kelvin would be such a high number--273.15--it's because the Kelvin scale is based around absolute zero, which is 0°K.

, Though 0°C is the freezing temperature of water, scientists actually understand 0°C as 273.15°K.Since the two scales rise at the same rate, then converting Celsius to Kelvin always means simply adding 273.15.


For example, if you're working with the temperature 30°C, just add 273.15 to that. 30 + 273.15 = 303.15°K.

, Here's a rough scale so you can test whether your answer makes sense. Note that the Celsius and Kelvin scales increase at the same rate, so the two numbers are always exactly 273.15 apart.


If you start with an integer value of degrees Celsius, your result in kelvins will end in the decimal .15.
The lowest possible temperature is -273.15ºC = 0 kelvins. If your result involves negative kelvins, you either made a math mistake or the problem uses impossible values.

"
"
Understand the scales.,
Subtract 273.15 from your Kelvin temperature.,
Check your answer.","How to Convert Between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin4"," The 1:1 ratio for each degree Celsius and Kelvin still applies while converting Kelvin to Celsius. You mostly need to remember the 273.15 number and perform the opposite operation as when you convert Celsius to Kelvin.

, If instead you need to convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius, you can simply reverse the operation and subtract 273.15. Let’s say you're starting with a Kelvin temperature of 280°K. Just subtract 273.15 from 280 to get the Celsius temperature. 280K - 273.15 = 6.85°C.

, If the two values you have don't fit the pattern described in this table, check for math mistakes.


If you start with an integer value of kelvins, your result in degrees Celsius will end in the decimal .15 (if Celsius is negative) or .85 (if Celsius is positive).
Note how the difference between kelvins and Celsius becomes less important for very large numbers. Once you're dealing with 6+ digits, the difference is often within your margin of error.

Understand the scales.,
Multiply by 1.8.,
Subtract 459.7 from the result.,
Check your answer.","How to Convert Between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin5"," One of the most important things to remember while converting between Kelvin and Fahrenheit is the rise ratio. Since Kelvin has a 1:1 ratio with Celsius, it has the same ratio to Fahrenheit as Celsius, which is to say that for every 1°K, Fahrenheit changes by 1.8°F., In order to correct for the 1K:1.8F scale, the first step in converting Kelvin to Fahrenheit is multiplying by 1.8.


Let’s say you're starting with a temperature of 295°K. Just multiply that number by 1.8. 295 x 1.8 = 531.

, Just as we must correct for the starting point of the scale by adding 32 when converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, we must also do the same when converting Kelvin to Fahrenheit. However, 0°K = -459.7°F.Since the number we have to add is actually a negative number, that means we must simply subtract the number.


Just subtract 459.7 from 531. 531 - 459.7 = 71.3 °F. Therefore, 295°K = 71.3 °F.

, If your conversion doesn't fit between two lines of this table, try again. You may have made a math mistake, or forgotten to multiply before subtracting.


If you start with an integer value of kelvins, your answer in degrees Fahrenheit will end in the decimal .67 (if ºF is negative) or .33 (if ºF is positive).

Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature.,
Multiply that number by 5/9.,
Add 273.15 to this number.,
Check your answer.","How to Convert Between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin6"," On the other hand, to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to a Kelvin temperature, it’s easiest to convert to Celsius and then make the conversion to Kelvin from there. This means we begin by subtracting 32.


Let’s say the temperature is 82°F. Subtract 32 from that number. 82 - 32 = 50.

, When converting Fahrenheit to Celsius, the next step is to multiply by 5/9–or divide by 1.8 if you have a calculator around.


50 x 5/9 = 27.7, which is the Fahrenheit temperature now converted to Celsius.

, Since the difference between Celsius and Kelvin = 273.15, you can then get the Kelvin temperature by adding 273.15.


273.15 + 27.7 = 300.8. Therefore, 82°F = 300.8°K.

, Compare your result to this table to see if it makes sense. If it doesn't seem to fit the scale, try again. Make sure you subtract before multiplying."

Continue to divide until you reach 0.,
Write out the new, binary number.",How to Convert from Decimal to Binary2," For this example, let's convert the decimal number 15610 to binary. Write the decimal number as the dividend inside an upside-down ""long division"" symbol. Write the base of the destination system (in our case, ""2"" for binary) as the divisor outside the curve of the division symbol.


This method is much easier to understand when visualized on paper, and is much easier for beginners, as it relies only on division by two.
To avoid confusion before and after conversion, write the number of the base system that you are working with as a subscript of each number. In this case, the decimal number will have a subscript of 10 and the binary equivalent will have a subscript of 2.

, Write the integer answer (quotient) under the long division symbol, and write the remainder (0 or 1) to the right of the dividend.Since we are dividing by 2, when the dividend is even the binary remainder will be 0, and when the dividend is odd the binary remainder will be 1.

, Continue downwards, dividing each new quotient by two and writing the remainders to the right of each dividend. Stop when the quotient is 0.

, Starting with the bottom remainder, read the sequence of remainders upwards to the top. For this example, you should have 10011100. This is the binary equivalent of the decimal number 156. Or, written with base subscripts: 15610 = 100111002

This method can be modified to convert from decimal to any base. The divisor is 2 because the desired destination is base 2 (binary). If the desired destination is a different base, replace the 2 in the method with the desired base. For example, if the desired destination is base 9, replace the 2 with 9. The final result will then be in the desired base.

Increment the exponent by one for each power. Make the list up until you've reached a number very near the decimal system number you're starting with. For this example, let's convert the decimal number 15610 to binary.

, Choose the biggest number that will fit into the number you are converting. 128 is the greatest power of two that will fit into 156, so write a 1 beneath this box in your chart for the leftmost binary digit. Then, subtract 128 from your initial number. You now have 28.

, Using your new number (28), move down the chart marking how many times each power of 2 can fit into your dividend. 64 does not go into 28, so write a 0 beneath that box for the next binary digit to the right. Continue until you reach a number that can go into 28.

, 16 can fit into 28, so you will write a 1 beneath it's box and subtract 16 from 28. You now have 12. 8 does go into 12, so write a 1 beneath 8's box and subtract it from 12. You now have 4 .

, Remember to mark a 1 beneath each number that does go into your new number, and a 0 beneath those that don't.

, The number will be exactly the same from left to right as the 1's and 0's beneath your chart. You should have 10011100. This is the binary equivalent of the decimal number 156. Or, written with base subscripts: 15610 = 100111002.

22(x+3) + 9 - 5 = 32;
, Remember the order of operations: PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, and Addition/Subtraction. You can't resolve the parentheses first because x is in the parentheses, so you should start with the exponent, 22. 22 = 4


4(x+3) + 9 - 5 = 32

, Just distribute the 4 into (x +3). Here's how:


4x + 12 + 9 - 5 = 32

, Just add or subtract the remaining numbers. Here's how:


4x+21-5 = 32
4x+16 = 32
4x + 16 - 16 = 32 - 16
4x = 16

, To do this, just divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find x. 4x/4 = x and 16/4 = 4, so x = 4.


4x/4 = 16/4
x = 4

, Just plug x = 4 back into the original equation to make sure that it checks out. Here's how:


22(x+3)+ 9 - 5 = 32
22(4+3)+ 9 - 5 = 32
22(7) + 9 - 5 = 32

Apply the distributive property, if necessary.,
Cancel the variable on one side of the equation.,
Keep the equation balanced.,
Simplify the equation by combining like terms.,
Move the constants to one side of the equation, if necessary.,
Cancel the variable’s coefficient.,
Check your work.",How to Solve Equations with Variables on Both Sides1," The distributive property states that a(b+c)=ab+ac{\displaystyle a(b+c)=ab+ac}.This rule allows you to cancel out parentheses by multiplying each term in the parentheses by the number outside the parentheses.For example, if your equation is 2(10−2x)=4(2x+2){\displaystyle 2(10-2x)=4(2x+2)}, use the distributive property to multiply the terms in parentheses by the number outside the parentheses:2(10−2x)=4(2x+2){\displaystyle 2(10-2x)=4(2x+2)}20−4x=8x+8{\displaystyle 20-4x=8x+8}
;
, To cancel the variable, complete the opposite operation as stated in the equation. For example, if the term is subtracted in the equation, cancel it by adding. If the term is added in the equation, cancel it by subtracting. It is usually easiest to cancel the variable with the smaller coefficient.For example, in the equation 20−4x=8x+8{\displaystyle 20-4x=8x+8}, cancel the term −4x{\displaystyle -4x} by adding 4x{\displaystyle 4x}:20−4x+4x=8x+8{\displaystyle 20-4x+4x=8x+8}.


, Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side as well. So if you add or subtract to cancel the variable on one side of the equation, you must add or subtract to the other side as well.For example, if you added 4x{\displaystyle 4x} on one side of the equation to cancel the variable, you must also add 4x{\displaystyle 4x} to the other side of the equation:20−4x+4x=8x+8+4x{\displaystyle 20-4x+4x=8x+8+4x}


, You should now have the variable on one side of the equation.

For example:20−4x+4x=8x+8+4x{\displaystyle 20-4x+4x=8x+8+4x}20=12x+8{\displaystyle 20=12x+8}


, You want the variable term on one side, and the constant on the other side. To move the constant to one side, add or subtract from each side of the equation to cancel the term on one side.For example, to cancel the +8{\displaystyle +8} constant on the variable side, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:20=12x+8{\displaystyle 20=12x+8}20−8=12x+8−8{\displaystyle 20-8=12x+8-8}12=12x{\displaystyle 12=12x}


, To do this, perform the operation opposite from the one denoted in the equation. Usually this will mean dividing to cancel a coefficient being multiplied by a variable.Remember that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side of the equation as well.

For example, to cancel out the coefficient 12 from the equation, you would divide each side of the equation by 12:12=12x{\displaystyle 12=12x}1212=12x12{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{12}}={\frac {12x}{12}}}1=x{\displaystyle 1=x}


, To make sure your answer is correct, substitute your solution back into the original equation. If the equation is true, your answer is correct.

For example, if 1=x{\displaystyle 1=x}, substitute 1 for the variable in the equation and calculate:2(10−2x)=4(2x+2){\displaystyle 2(10-2x)=4(2x+2)}2(10−2(1))=4(2(1)+2){\displaystyle 2(10-2(1))=4(2(1)+2)}2(10−2)=4(2+2){\displaystyle 2(10-2)=4(2+2)}20−4=8+8{\displaystyle 20-4=8+8}16=16{\displaystyle 16=16}

Example 3: x5+7x3−9x=0{\displaystyle x^{5}+7x^{3}-9x=0} does not follow this pattern, but notice you can factor out an x:(x)(x4+7x2−9)=0{\displaystyle (x)(x^{4}+7x^{2}-9)=0}You can now treat x4+7x2−9{\displaystyle x^{4}+7x^{2}-9} as a quadratic, as shown in example 2.


, These special cases look difficult to factor, but have properties which make the problem much easier:


Sum of cubes: A polynomial in the form a3+b3{\displaystyle a^{3}+b^{3}} factors to (a+b)(a2−ab+b2){\displaystyle (a+b)(a^{2}-ab+b^{2})}.Difference of cubes: A polynomial in the form a3−b3{\displaystyle a^{3}-b^{3}} factors to (a−b)(a2+ab+b2){\displaystyle (a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})}.Note that the quadratic portion of the result is not factorable.Note that x6{\displaystyle x^{6}}, x9{\displaystyle x^{9}}, and x to any power divisible by 3 all fit these patterns.


, Polynomials that do not look like the examples above may not have any obvious factors. But before you try the methods below, try looking for a two-term factor (such as ""x+3""). Grouping terms in different orders and factoring out part of the polynomial may help you find one.This is not always a feasible approach, so don't spend too much time trying if no common factor seems likely.


Example 4: −3x3−x2+6x+2=0{\displaystyle -3x^{3}-x^{2}+6x+2=0}This has no obvious factor, but you can factor the first two terms and see what happens:(−x2)(3x+1)+6x+2=0{\displaystyle (-x^{2})(3x+1)+6x+2=0}Now factor the last two terms (6x+2), aiming for a common factor:(−x2)(3x+1)+(2)(3x+1)=0{\displaystyle (-x^{2})(3x+1)+(2)(3x+1)=0}Now rewrite this using the common factor, 3x+1:(3x+1)(−x2+2)=0{\displaystyle (3x+1)(-x^{2}+2)=0}

Realize that the associative property says that regrouping the addends (added numbers) doesn’t change the sum of the equation.",How to Solve Integers and Their Properties1," The commutative property of addition states that changing the orders of the numbers doesn’t affect the sum of the equation. Do the addition as follows:


a + b = c (where both a and b are positive numbers the sum c is also positive)
For example: 2 + 2 = 4;
, Do the addition as follows:


-a + -b = -c (where both a and b are negative, you get the absolute value of the numbers then you proceed to add, and use the negative sign for the sum)
For example: -2+ (-2)=-4

, Do the addition as follows:


a + (-b) = c (when your terms are of different signs, determine the larger number's value, then get the absolute value of both terms and subtract the lesser value from the larger value. Use the sign of the larger number for the answer.)
For example: 5 + (-1) = 4

, Do the addition as follows:


-a +b = c (get the absolute value of the numbers and again, proceed to subtract the lesser value from the larger value and assume the sign of the larger value)
For example: -5 + 2 = -3

, The sum of any number when added to zero, is the number itself.


An example of the additive identity is: a + 0 = a
Mathematically, the additive identity looks like: 2 + 0 = 2 or 6 + 0 = 6

, When adding the additive inverse of a number, the sum is equal to zero.


The additive inverse is when a number is added to the negative equivalent of itself.
For example: a + (-b) = 0, where b is equal to a
Mathematically, the additive inverse looks like: 5 + -5 = 0

, The order in which you add numbers does not affect their sum.


For example: (5+3) +1 = 9 has the same sum as 5+ (3+1) = 9

It does not contain an equals sign and cannot be solved. An algebraic equation, however, can be solved, and does include a series of algebraic expressions separated by an equals sign. Here are some examples:



Algebraic expression: 4x + 2

Algebraic equation: 4x + 2 = 100;
, Combining like terms just means adding up (or subtracting) the terms of the same degree. This means that all x2 terms can be combined with other x2 terms, that all x3 terms can be combined with x3 terms, and that all constants, numbers that are not attached to variables, such as 8 or 5, can be added up, or combined, as well. Here's an example:


3x2 + 5 + 4x3 - x2 + 2x3 + 9 =
3x2 - x2 + 4x3 + 2x3 + 5 + 9 =
2x2 + 6x3 + 14

, If you're working with an algebraic equation, which means there is an expression on either side of an equals sign, then you can simplify it by factoring out a common term. Look at the coefficients of all of the terms (the numbers before the variables, or the constants) and see if there is a number that you can ""factor out"" by dividing each term by that number. If you can do this, then you have simplified the equation and are on your way to solving it. Here's how:


3x + 15 = 9x + 30

You can see that each coefficient can be divisible by 3. Just ""factor out"" the number 3 by dividing each term by 3 to get your simplified equation.


3x/3 + 15/3 = 9x/3 + 30/3 =
x + 5 = 3x + 10

, The order of operations, also known by the acronym PEMDAS, explains the order in which you should perform different mathematical operations. The order is: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. Here's an example of how the order of operations works:


(3 + 5)2 x 10 + 4
First, follow P, the operation in the parentheses:
= (8)2 x 10 + 4
Then, follow E, the operation of the exponent:
= 64 x 10 + 4
Next, do multiplication:
= 640 + 4
And last, do addition:
= 644

, If you're solving an algebraic equation, then your goal is to get the variable, often known as x, on one side of the equation, while placing the constant terms on the other side of the equation. You can isolate x by division, multiplication, addition, subtraction, finding the square root, or other operations. Once you've isolated x, you can solve for it. Here's how:


5x + 15 = 65 =
5x/5 + 15/5 = 65/5 =
x + 3 = 13 =
x = 10

, A linear algebraic equation is nice and simple, containing only constants and variables to the first degree (no exponents or fancy stuff). To solve it, simply use multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction when necessary to isolate the variable and solve for ""x"". Here's how you do it:


4x + 16 = 25 -3x =
4x = 25 -16 - 3x
4x + 3x = 25 -16 =
7x = 9
7x/7 = 9/7 =
x = 9/7

, If the equation has exponents, then all you have to do is find a way to isolate the exponent on one side of the equation and then to solve by ""removing"" the exponent by finding the root of both the exponent and the constant on the other side. Here's how you do it:


2x2 + 12 = 44

First, subtract 12 from both sides.


2x2 + 12 -12 = 44 -12 =
2x2 = 32

Next, divide both sides by 2.


2x2/2 = 32/2 =
x2 = 16

Solve by taking the square root of both sides, since that will turn x2 into x.


√x2 = √16 =
State both answers:x = 4, -4

, If you want to solve an algebraic expression that uses fractions, then you have to cross multiply the fractions, combine like terms, and then isolate the variable. Here's how you would do it:


(x + 3)/6 = 2/3

First, cross multiply to get rid of the fraction. You have to multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other.


(x + 3) x 3 = 2 x 6 =
3x + 9 = 12

Now, combine like terms. Combine the constant terms, 9 and 12, by subtracting 9 from both sides.


3x + 9 - 9 = 12 - 9 =
3x = 3

Isolate the variable, x, by dividing both sides by 3 and you've got your answer.


3x/3 = 3/3 =
x =1

, If you're working with an algebraic expression with radical signs, all you have to do is find a way to square both sides so you can ""get rid"" of the radical sign and solve for the variable. Here's how you do it:


√(2x+9) - 5 = 0

First, move everything that isn't under the radical sign to the other side of the equation:


√(2x+9) = 5
Then, square both sides to remove the radical:
(√(2x+9))2 = 52 =
2x + 9 = 25

Now, solve the equation as you normally would by combining the constants and isolating the variable:


2x = 25 - 9 =
2x = 16
x = 8

, The absolute value of a number represents its value regardless of whether it is positive or negative; the absolute value is always positive. So, for example, the absolute value of -3 (also known as |3|), is simply 3. To find the absolute value, you have to isolate the absolute value and then solve for x twice, solving both for x with the absolute value simply removed, and for x when the terms on the other side of the equals sign have changed their signs from positive to negative and vice versa. Here's how to do it:


Here's how you solve for the absolute value by isolating the absolute value and then removing it:

|4x +2| - 6 = 8 =


|4x +2| = 8 + 6 =
|4x +2| = 14 =
4x + 2 = 14 =
4x = 12
x = 3

Now, solve again by flipping the sign of the term on the other side of the equation after you've isolated the absolute value:


|4x +2| = 14 =
4x + 2 = -14
4x = -14 -2
4x = -16
4x/4 = -16/4 =
x = -4

Now, just state both answers: x = -4, 3

Check your work.",How to Solve for X2," Let's say you're working with this problem where the x term includes an exponent:


2x2 + 12 = 44

, The first thing you should do is combine like terms so that all of the constant terms are on the right side of the equation while the term with the exponent is on the left side. Just subtract 12 from both sides. Here's how:


2x2+12-12 = 44-12
2x2 = 32

, In this case, 2 is the x coefficient, so divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of it. Here's how:


(2x2)/2 = 32/2
x2 = 16

, Taking the square root of x2 will cancel it out. So, take the square root of both sides. You'll get x left over on one side and the square root of 16, 4, on the other side. Therefore, x = 4.

, Just plug x = 4 back in to the original equation to make sure it checks out. Here's how:


2x2 + 12 = 44
2 x (4)2 + 12 = 44
2 x 16 + 12 = 44
32 + 12 = 44
44 = 44

, To cross multiply, simply multiply the denominator of each fraction by the numerator of the other fraction. You'll be essentially multiplying in two diagonal lines. So, multiply the first denominator, 6, by the second numerator, 2, to get 12 on the right side of the equation. Multiply the second denominator, 3, by the first numerator, x + 3, to get 3 x + 9 on the left side of the equation. Here's how it will look:


(x + 3)/6 = 2/3
6 x 2 = 12
(x + 3) x 3 = 3x + 9
3x + 9 = 12

, Combine the constant terms in the equation to subtract 9 from both sides of the equation. Here's what you do:


3x + 9 - 9 = 12 - 9
3x = 3

, Just divide 3x and 9 by 3, the x term coefficient, to solve for x. 3x/3 = x and 3/3 = 1, so you're left with x = 1.

, To check your work, just plug x back in to the original equation to make sure that it works. Here's what you do:


(x + 3)/6 = 2/3
(1 + 3)/6 = 2/3
4/6 = 2/3
2/3 = 2/3

, You have to move the part of the equation with the square root sign to one side of the equation before you can proceed. So, you'll have to add 5 to both sides of the equation. Here's how:


√(2x+9) - 5 + 5 = 0 + 5
√(2x+9) = 5

, Just as you would divide both sides of an equation by a coefficient that is being multiplied by x, you would square both sides of an equation if x appears under the square root, or the radical sign. This will remove the radical sign from the equation. Here's how you do it:


(√(2x+9))2 = 52

2x + 9 = 25

, Combine like terms by subtracting both sides by 9 so that all of the constant terms are on the right side of the equation while x remains on the left side. Here's what you do:


2x + 9 - 9 = 25 - 9
2x = 16

, The last thing you have to do to solve for x is to isolate the variable by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, the coefficient of the x term. 2x/2 = x and 16/2 = 8, so you're left with x = 8.

, Plug 8 back in to the equation for x to see if you get the right answer:


√(2x+9) - 5 = 0
√(2(8)+9) - 5 = 0
√(16+9) - 5 = 0
√(25) - 5 = 0
5 - 5 = 0

Check your work.",How to Solve for X5," Let's say you're trying to solve for x in the following problem:|4x +2| - 6 = 8

, The first thing you have to do is to combine like terms and get the terms inside the absolute value sign on one side. In this case, you would do it by adding 6 to both sides of the equation. Here's how:


|4x +2| - 6 = 8
|4x +2| - 6 + 6 = 8 + 6
|4x +2| = 14

, This is the first and easiest step. You'll have to solve for x twice whenever you work with absolute value. Here's how you do it the first time:


4x + 2 = 14
4x + 2 - 2 = 14 -2
4x = 12
x = 3

, Now, do it again, except set the first part of the equation equal to -14 instead of 14. Here's how:


4x + 2 = -14
4x + 2 - 2 = -14 - 2
4x = -16
4x/4 = -16/4
x = -4

, Now that you know that x = (3, -4), just plug both numbers back in to the equation to see that it works. Here's how:


(For x = 3):

|4x +2| - 6 = 8
|4(3) +2| - 6 = 8
|12 +2| - 6 = 8
|14| - 6 = 8
14 - 6 = 8
8 = 8


(For x = -4):

|4x +2| - 6 = 8
|4(-4) +2| - 6 = 8
|-16 +2| - 6 = 8
|-14| - 6 = 8
14 - 6 = 8
8 = 8

Isolate a variable in one equation.,
Substitute the value of the isolated variable into the other equation.,
Solve for the variable.,
Solve for the remaining variable.,
Check your work.",How to Solve Equations with Variables on Both Sides2," This might already be done. If not, use the rules of algebra to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Remember that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side.

For example, for the equation y+1=x−1{\displaystyle y+1=x-1}, to isolate the y{\displaystyle y} variable, you would subtract 1 from both sides:y+1=x−1{\displaystyle y+1=x-1}y+1−1=x−1−1{\displaystyle y+1-1=x-1-1}y=x−2{\displaystyle y=x-2}


, Make sure you substitute the entire expression for the variable. This will give you an equation with only one variable, allowing you to solve for the variable.For example, if your first equation is 2x=20−2y{\displaystyle 2x=20-2y}, and you determined y=x−2{\displaystyle y=x-2} in the second equation, you would substitute x−2{\displaystyle x-2} for y{\displaystyle y} in the first equation:2x=20−2y{\displaystyle 2x=20-2y}2x=20−2(x−2){\displaystyle 2x=20-2(x-2)}


, To do this, move the variable to one side of the equation. Then, move the constants to one side of the equation. Then, isolate the variable using multiplication or division.

For example:2x=20−2(x−2){\displaystyle 2x=20-2(x-2)}2x=20−2x+4{\displaystyle 2x=20-2x+4}2x=24−2x{\displaystyle 2x=24-2x}2x+2x=24−2x+2x{\displaystyle 2x+2x=24-2x+2x}4x=24{\displaystyle 4x=24}4x4=244{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{4}}={\frac {24}{4}}}x=6{\displaystyle x=6}


, To do this, plug the value of the variable you already solved into one of the equations. This will give you an equation with only one variable. Solve for the variable using the rules of algebra. You can use either equation to solve for the remaining variable.

For example, if you found that x=6{\displaystyle x=6}, you can substitute 6 for x{\displaystyle x} in the second equation:y=x−2{\displaystyle y=x-2}y=(6)−2{\displaystyle y=(6)-2}y=4{\displaystyle y=4}


, Plug the values for both variables into one of the equations. If the equation is true, your solutions are correct.

For example, if you found that x=6{\displaystyle x=6} and y=4{\displaystyle y=4}, plug these back into the original equation and solve:2x=20−2y{\displaystyle 2x=20-2y}2(6)=20−2(4){\displaystyle 2(6)=20-2(4)}12=20−8{\displaystyle 12=20-8}12=12{\displaystyle 12=12}

You may be able to find this by factoring as described above, or the problem may provide one. If so, skip down to the synthetic division instructions. If you do not know a root, continue to the next step to try to find one.

The root of a polynomial is the value of x for which y = 0. Knowing a root c also gives you a factor of the polynomial, (x - c).


, The ""rational roots"" test is a way to guess at possible root values. To begin, list all the factors of the constant (the term with no variable).Example: The polynomial 2x3+x2−12x+9{\displaystyle 2x^{3}+x^{2}-12x+9} has the constant term 9. Its factors are 1, 3, and 9.


, This is the coefficient in the first term of the polynomial, when it is arranged from the highest-degree term to the lowest. List all of that number's factors on a separate line.


Example (cont.): 2x3+x2−12x+9{\displaystyle 2x^{3}+x^{2}-12x+9} has a leading coefficient of 2. Its factors are 1 and 2.


, If the polynomial has a rational root (which it may not), it must be equal to ± (a factor of the constant)/(a factor of the leading coefficient). Only a number c in this form can appear in the factor (x-c) of the original polynomial.


Example (cont.): Any rational roots of this polynomial are in the form (1, 3, or 9) divided by (1 or 2). Possibilities include ±1/1, ±1/2, ±3/1, ±3/2, ±9/1, or ±9/2. Don't forget the ""±"": each of these possibilities could be positive or negative.


, None of these are guaranteed to be roots, so you'll need to test them with the original polynomial.


Example: (1/1=1) is a possible root. If it turns out to be an actual root, plugging it into the polynomial should result in zero.2(1)3+(1)2−12(1)+9=2+1−12+9=0{\displaystyle 2(1)^{3}+(1)^{2}-12(1)+9=2+1-12+9=0}, so 1 is confirmed to be a root.This means the polynomial has the factor (x-1).

If none of the possibilities work out, the polynomial has no rational roots and cannot be factored.


, Synthetic division is a way to find all the factors of a polynomial, if you already know one of them. To set it up, write a root of the polynomial. Draw a vertical line to its right, then write the coefficients of your polynomial arranged from highest degree exponent to lowest. (You do not need to write the terms themselves, just the coefficients.)


Note: You may need to insert terms with a coefficient of zero. For example, rewrite the polynomial x3+2x{\displaystyle x^{3}+2x} as x3+0x2+2x+0{\displaystyle x^{3}+0x^{2}+2x+0}.


Example (cont.): The rational roots test above told us that the polynomial 2x3+x2−12x+9{\displaystyle 2x^{3}+x^{2}-12x+9} has the root 1.Write the root 1, followed by a vertical line, followed by the coefficients of the polynomial:(1|21−129){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1|&2&1&-12&9\end{pmatrix}}}


, Copy the first coefficient onto the answer line. Leave a blank line in between the two numbers for later calculations.


Example (cont.): Carry the 2 down to the answer line:(1|21−1292){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1|&2&1&-12&9\\\\&2\end{pmatrix}}}


, Write the answer directly below the next term, but not on the answer line.


Example (cont.): Multiply the 2 by the root, 1, to get 2 again. Write this 2 in the following column, but on the second row instead of the answer line:(1|21−12922){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1|&2&1&-12&9\\&&2\\&2\end{pmatrix}}}


, The second coefficient column now contains two numbers. Sum them together and write the result on the answer line directly below them.


Example (cont.): 1 + 2 = 3(1|21−129223){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1|&2&1&-12&9\\&&2\\&2&3\end{pmatrix}}}


, Just as you did before, multiply the latest number on the answer line by the root. Write your answer underneath the next coefficient.


Example (cont.): 1 x 3 = 3:(1|21−1292323){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1|&2&1&-12&9\\&&2&3\\&2&3\end{pmatrix}}}


, As before, add up the two numbers in the column and write the result on the answer line.


Example (cont.): -12 + 3 = -9:(1|21−1292323−9){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1|&2&1&-12&9\\&&2&3\\&2&3&-9\end{pmatrix}}}


, The last number on your answer line will always be zero. If you get any other result, check your work for mistakes.


Example (cont.): Multiply -9 by the root 1, write the answer under the final column, then confirm that the sum of the final column is zero:(1|21−12923−923−90){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1|&2&1&-12&9\\&&2&3&-9\\&2&3&-9&0\end{pmatrix}}}


, You have now divided the polynomial by the term (x - c), where c is your factor. The answer line tells you the coefficient of each term in your answer. The x portion of each term has an exponent one lower than the original term directly above it.


Example (cont.): The answer line is 2 3 -9 0, but you can ignore the final zero.Since the first term of the original polynomial included an x3{\displaystyle x^{3}}, the first term of your answer is one degree lower: x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}. Therefore, the first term is 2x2{\displaystyle 2x^{2}}Repeat this process to get the answer 2x2+3x−9{\displaystyle 2x^{2}+3x-9}.You have now factored 2x3+x2−12x+9{\displaystyle 2x^{3}+x^{2}-12x+9} into (x−1)(2x2+3x−9){\displaystyle (x-1)(2x^{2}+3x-9)}.


, You may be able to factor your answer into smaller parts using the same synthetic division method. However, you may be able to use a faster method to finish the problem. For example, once you have a quadratic expression, you can factor it using the quadratic formula.

Remember, to start the synthetic division method, you'll need to know one root already. Use the rational roots test again to get this. If none of the rational root possibilities check out, the expression cannot be factored.


Example (cont.) You've found the factors (x−1)(2x2+3x−9){\displaystyle (x-1)(2x^{2}+3x-9)}, but the second factor can be broken down further. Try the quadratic equation, traditional factoring, or synthetic division.The final answer is (x−1)(x+3)(2x−3){\displaystyle (x-1)(x+3)(2x-3)}, so the roots of the polynomial are x = 1, x = -3, and x = 3/2.

Realize that the associative property of multiplication means that the order in which you multiply does not affect the product of the equation.,
Understand that the multiplicative identity of an integer states that any integer multiplied by 1 is itself.,
Recognize the distributive property of multiplication.",How to Solve Integers and Their Properties2," Multiplying a*b = c is also the same as b*a=c. However, the sign of the product can change depending on the signs of the original numbers:

If both a and b have the same signs, the sign of the product is positive. For example:






When a and b are positive numbers and not equal to zero: +a * + b = +c
When a and b are both negative numbers and not equal to zero: -a*-b = +c


If a and b have unlike signs, the sign of the product is negative. For example:

When a is positive and b is negative: +a * -b = -c








However, understand that any number multiplied by zero, equals zero.

, Unless the integer is zero, any number multiplied by 1 is the number itself.

For example: a*1 = a






Remember, any number multiplied by zero, equals zero.







, The distributive property of multiplication says that any number ""a"" multiplied by the addends ""b"" and ""c"" in parenthesis, is the same as ""a"" multiplied by ""c"" plus ""a"" multiplied by ""b"".


For example: a(b+c) = ab + ac
Mathematically, this looks like: 5(2+3) = 5(2) + 5(3)
Note that there is no inverse property for multiplication because the inverse of a whole number is a fraction, and fractions are not an element of integer.

Check whether your cubic contains a constant.,
Factor an x out of the equation.,
Use the quadratic formula to solve the portion in parentheses.,
Use zero and the quadratic answers as your cubic's answers.",How to Solve a Cubic Equation1," As noted above, cubic equations take the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0. b, c, and d can be 0 without affecting whether the equation is cubic or not — this basically means that a cubic equation doesn't have to include all of the bx2, cx, or d terms to be a cubic. To start using this relatively easy method of solving cubics, check to see whether your equation has a constant (i.e., a d value). If it doesn't, you can use the quadratic equation to find the answers to the equation after a little mathematical legwork.


If, on the other hand, your equation does contain a constant, you'll need to use another solving method. See below for alternate approaches.;
, Since your equation doesn't have a constant, every term in the equation has an x variable in it. This means that one x can be factored out of the equation to simplify it. Do this and re-write your equation in the form x(ax2 + bx + c).


For example, let's say that our starting cubic equation is 3x3 + -2x2 + 14x = 0. Factoring a single x out of this equation, we get x(3x2 + -2x + 14) = 0.

, You may have noticed that the portion of your new equation contained in parentheses matches the form of a quadratic equation (ax2 + bx + c). This means that we can find the values for which this quadratic equation equals zero by plugging a, b, and c into the quadratic formula ({-b +/-√ (b2- 4ac)}/2a). Do this to find two of the answers to you cubic equation.


In our example, we would plug our a, b, and c values (3, -2, and 14, respectively) into the quadratic equation as follows:



{-b +/-√ (b2- 4ac)}/2a

{-(-2) +/-√ ((-2)2- 4(3)(14))}/2(3)
{2 +/-√ (4 - (12)(14))}/6
{2 +/-√ (4 - (168)}/6
{2 +/-√ (-164)}/6




Answer 1:



{2 + √(-164)}/6
{2 + 12.8i}/6




Answer 2:



{2 - 12.8i}/6





, While quadratic equations have two solutions, cubics have three. You already have two of these — they're the answers you found to the ""quadratic"" portion of the problem in parentheses. In cases where your equation is eligible for this ""factoring"" method of solving, your third answer will always be 0. Congratulations — you've just solved your cubic.


The reason this works has to do with the fundamental fact that any number times zero equals zero. When you factor your equation into the form x(ax2 + bx + c) = 0, you essentially split it into two ""halves"": one half is the x variable on the left and the other is the quadratic portion in parentheses. If either of these ""halves"" equals zero, the entire equation will. Thus, the two answers to the quadratic portion in parentheses, which will make that ""half"" equal zero, are answers to the cubic, as is 0 itself, which will make the left ""half"" equal zero.

Ensure your cubic has a constant.,
Find the factors of a and d. To solve your cubic, start by finding the factors of a (the coefficient of the x3 term) and d (the constant at the end of the equation).,
Divide the factors of a by the factors of d. Next, make a list of the values you get by dividing each factor of a by each factor of d. This will usually result in lots of fractions and a few whole numbers.,
Use synthetic division or check your answers manually.",How to Solve a Cubic Equation2," While the method described above is convenient because you don't have to learn any new mathematical skills to use it, it won't always be able to help you solve cubics. If your equation in the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0 has a nonzero value for d, the factoring trick above won't work, so you'll need to use either the method in this section or the one below to solve.


For example, let's say we're given the equation 2x3 + 9x2 + 13x = -6. In this case, getting a 0 on the right side of the equals sign requires us to add 6 to both sides. In our new equation, 2x3 + 9x2 + 13x + 6 = 0, d = 6, so we can't use the factoring trick above.

, As a quick reminder, factors are the numbers that can multiply together to make another number. For example, since you can make 6 by multiplying 6 &time; 1 and 2 × 3, 1, 2, 3, and 6 are the factors of 6.


In our example problem, a = 2 and d = 6. The factors of 2 are 1 and 2. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.


, The integer solutions to your cubic equation will either be one of the whole numbers in this list or the negative of one of these numbers.


In our equation, taking the factors of a (1, 2) over the factors of d (1, 2, 3, 6) gets this list: 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/6, 2, and 2/3. Next, we add the negatives to the list to make it complete: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/3, -1/3, 1/6, -1/6, 2, -2, 2/3, and -2/3. Our cubic equation's integer solutions are somewhere in this list.

, Once you have your list of values, you can find the integer answers to your cubic equation by quickly plugging each integer in manually and finding which ones equal zero. However, if you don't want to spend the time doing this, there is a slightly quicker method that involves a technique called synthetic division. Basically, you'll want to synthetically divide your integer values by the original a, b, c, and d coefficients in your cubic equation. If you get a remainder of 0, your value is one of the cubic equation's answers.


Synthetic division is a complex topic — see the link above for more information. Here's a sample of how to find one of the solutions to our cubic equation with synthetic division:



-1 | 2 9 13 6
__| -2-7-6
__| 2 7 6 0

Since we got a final remainder of 0, we know that one of our cubic's integer solutions is -1.

Write out the values of a, b, c, and d. For this method of finding a cubic equation's solutions, we'll be dealing heavily with the coefficients of the terms in our equation.,
Calculate Δ0 = b2 - 3ac.,
Calculate Δ1= 2b3 - 9abc + 27a2d.,
Calculate Δ = Δ12 - 4Δ03) ÷ -27a2.,
Calculate C = 3√(√((Δ12 - 4Δ03) + Δ1)/ 2).,
Calculate the three roots with your variables.",How to Solve a Cubic Equation3," For this reason, it's wise to record your a, b, c, and d terms before you begin so you don't forget what each one is.


For example, for the equation x3 - 3x2 + 3x - 1, we would write a = 1, b = -3, c = 3, and d = -1. Don't forget that when an x variable doesn't have a coefficient, it's implicitly assumed that its coefficient is 1.

, The discriminant approach to finding a cubic equation's solution requires some complicated math, but if you follow the process carefully, you'll find that it's an invaluable tool for figuring out those cubic equations that are hard to crack any other way. To start, find Δ0, the first of several important quantities we'll need, by plugging the appropriate values into the formula b2 - 3ac.


In our example, we'd solve as follows:




b2 - 3ac

(-3)2 - 3(1)(3)
9 - 3(1)(3)
9 - 9 = 0 = Δ0





, The next important quantity we'll need, Δ1, requires a little more work, but is found in essentially the same way as Δ0. Plug the appropriate values into the formula 2b3 - 9abc + 27a2d to get your value for Δ1.


In our example, we'd solve as follows:



2(-3)3 - 9(1)(-3)(3) + 27(1)2(-1)
2(-27) - 9(-9) + 27(-1)
-54 + 81 - 27
81 - 81 = 0 = Δ1





, Next, we'll calculate the discriminant of the cubic from the values of Δ0 and Δ1. A discriminant is simply a number that gives us information about the roots of a polynomial (you may already unconsciously know the quadratic discriminant: b2 - 4ac). In the case of the cubic, if the discriminant is positive, then the equation has three real solutions. If the discriminant is zero, then the equation has either one or two real solutions, and some of those solutions are shared. If it is negative, then the equation has only one solution. (A cubic equation always has at least one real solution, because the graph will always cross the x-axis at least once.)


In our example, since both Δ0 and Δ1 = 0, finding Δ will be a piece of cake. We'd simply solve as follows:



Δ12 - 4Δ03) ÷ -27a2

(0)2 - 4(0)3) ÷ -27(1)2

0 - 0 ÷ 27

0 = Δ, so our equation has 1 or 2 answers.





, The last important value we need to calculate is C. This important quantity will allow us to finally find our three roots. Solve as normal, substituting Δ1 and Δ0 as needed.


In our example, we would find C as follows:




3√(√((Δ12 - 4Δ03) + Δ1)/ 2)

3√(√((02 - 4(0)3) + (0))/ 2)

3√(√((0 - 0) + (0))/ 2)

0 = C






, The roots (answers) to your cubic equation are given by the formula (b + unC + (Δ0/unC)) / 3a, where u = (-1 + √(-3))/2 and n is either 1, 2, or 3. Plug in your values as needed to solve — this requires lots of mathematical legwork, but you should receive three viable answers!


In our example, we might solve by checking the answer when n is equal to 1, 2, and 3. The answers we get from these tests are the possible answers to our cubic equation — any that give an answer of 0 when plugged into the equation are correct. For example, if we got an answer of 1 for one of our tests, since plugging 1 into x3 - 3x2 + 3x - 1 gives an answer of 0, 1 is thus one of the answers to our cubic equation.

Look at your problem.,
Check the equation for varying terms and constant terms.,
Prepare to move the numbers around so that the varying terms are on one side and the constant terms are on the side such as in 16x−5x=32−10{\displaystyle 16x-5x=32-10} (that equation is solved in example 2).,
Move the varying terms to one side of the equation.,
Bring all the constant terms onto the other side of the equation.,
Divide both sides by the coefficient of x{\displaystyle x}.",How to Solve a Simple Linear Equation1," A simple linear equation might look like 7x−10=3x−6{\displaystyle 7x-10=3x-6}.

, Varying terms are numbers like 7x{\displaystyle 7x}, 3x{\displaystyle 3x}, 6y{\displaystyle 6y} or 10z{\displaystyle 10z}, where the number changes depending on what you plug into the variable, or letter. Constant terms are numbers like 10{\displaystyle 10}, 6{\displaystyle 6} or 30{\displaystyle 30}, where the number never changes.

Usually, equations won't come with varying terms and constant terms lined up on separate sides. In the example above, the left-hand side (LHS) has both varying and constant terms, as does the right-hand side (RHS).


, In order to do this, you may have to subtract or add the numbers you want to move from both sides. In the next step, you'll see how to do that in example 1.

The equation 16x−5x=32−10{\displaystyle 16x-5x=32-10} does have all the varying terms on one side (LHS), while all the constant terms are on the other side (RHS). 


, It doesn't matter to which side you move the varying terms.

In example 1, 7x−10=3x−6{\displaystyle 7x-10=3x-6} can be rearranged by choosing to subtract either 7x{\displaystyle 7x} or 3x{\displaystyle 3x} from both sides. Choosing to subtract 7x{\displaystyle 7x}, you have:(7x−7x)−10=(3x−7x)−6−10=−4x−6{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(7x-7x)-10&=(3x-7x)-6\\-10&=-4x-6\end{aligned}}}


, That is: move the constant terms so that they are on the opposite side of the equation from where the varying terms are.

We see that −6{\displaystyle -6} must be subtracted from both sides:−10−(−6)=−4x−6−(−6)−4=−4x{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}-10-(-6)&=-4x-6-(-6)\\-4&=-4x\end{aligned}}}


, The coefficient of x{\displaystyle x} (or y{\displaystyle y}, or z{\displaystyle z}, or any letter) is the number in front of the varying term. 

The coefficient of x{\displaystyle x} in −4x{\displaystyle -4x} is −4{\displaystyle -4}. So divide both sides by −4{\displaystyle -4} to get the value of x=1{\displaystyle x=1}.

Our answer to the equation 7x−10=3x−6{\displaystyle 7x-10=3x-6} is x=1{\displaystyle x=1}. You can check this answer by plugging 1{\displaystyle 1} back into every x{\displaystyle x} variable and seeing if both sides of the equation equal the same number:7(1)−10=3(1)−6−3=−3{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}7(1)-10&=3(1)-6\\-3&=-3\end{aligned}}}

Determine what the unknowns are and assign them variables.,
Set up the equations.,
Solve


By the Method of Elimination
In this method we first solve for a variable by eliminating the other variable.",How to Solve a System of Two Linear Equations," For example, let x = price of one apple, y = price of one orange.;
, For example:


If 4 apples and 5 oranges cost $2, write 4x + 5y = 2. (Eq. 1)
If 3 apples and 4 oranges cost $1.55, write 3x + 4y = 1.55. (Eq. 2)

, Let's solve for x by eliminating y. The steps are


Multiply Eq. 1 by the coefficient of the other variable (y) in Eq. 2
Multiplying Eq. 1 by 4, we get 16x + 20y = 8






Multiply Eq. 2 by the coefficient of the other variable (y) in Eq. 1
Multiplying Eq. 2 by 5 we get 15x + 20y = 7.75






Subtract the two equations
We get x = 0.25.
Therefore, price of an apple in the example is $0.25






To find the value of the other variable (y), plug in the value of x obtained in any of the equations we had.
Plugging in x = 0.25 in Eq. 1 we get,
4(0.25) + 5y = 2
=> 1 + 5y = 2
=> 5y = 2 - 1
=> 5y = 1
=> y = 1/5 = 0.20
Therefore, price of an orange in the example is $0.20

A.",How to Solve Complex Cases of Quadratic Equations1," When a = 1 - Solving quadratic equations types x² + bx + c = 0.


Solving this type of quadratic equations results in solving a popular puzzle: finding two numbers knowing their sum and their product. Solving becomes simple and doesn't need factoring.
Example 1. Solve: x² - 26x - 72 = 0.
Solution. Both real roots have opposite signs. Write down the factor-pairs of c = -72. They are:
(-1 , 72)(-2 , 36)(-3 , 24)...Stop!The sum of the 2 real roots in this set is 21 = -b. The 2 real roots are -3 and 24.
Example 2. Solve: -x² - 26x + 56 = 0.
Solution. Roots have opposite signs. Write down factor-pairs of c = 56:
(-1, 56) (-2, 28)...Stop!. This sum is 26 = b. According to the Diagonal Sum Rule, when a is negative, the answers are -2 and 28.
Example 3. Solve x² + 27x + 50 = 0.
Solution. Both real roots are negative. Write factor-sets of c = 50:
(-1, -50) (-2, -25)..Stop! This sum is -27 = -b. The 2 real roots are -2 and -25.
Example 4. Solve: x² - 39x + 108 = 0.
Solution. Both real roots are positive. Write the factor-sets of c = 108:
(1, 108) (2, 54) (3, 36)...Stop! This sum is 39 = -b. The 2 real roots are 3 and 36.;

Understand the inequality signs.,
Combine like terms, or otherwise simplify the inequality.,
Move the variable to one side of the inequality.,
Isolate the variable.",How to Solve a Simple Linear Inequality1," An inequality is like an equation, except instead of saying that the two values are equal, an inequality shows a “greater than” or “less than” relationship. The >{\displaystyle >} sign means “greater than.” The <{\displaystyle <} means “less than.”For example, 2x+32>−15+x{\displaystyle 2x+{\frac {3}{2}}>-15+x} means that the value on the left side of the inequality is greater than the value on the right side.
;
, You can solve inequalities using the same algebraic principles you would use to  solve an equation.You might need to combine variables, multiply to cancel out fractions, or use other operations to make the numbers easier to work with. Remember that you need to keep the inequality balanced, so whatever operation you perform on one side of the inequality, you must also perform on the other side.

For example, if solving the inequality 2x+32>−15+x{\displaystyle 2x+{\frac {3}{2}}>-15+x}, you would first multiply each part by 2 to cancel out the fraction:2(2x+32)>2(−15+x){\displaystyle 2(2x+{\frac {3}{2}})>2(-15+x)}4x+3>−30+2x{\displaystyle 4x+3>-30+2x}


, To do this, add or subtract variables from one side of the inequality. Remember that whatever you do to one side, you must also do to the other side.

For example, in the inequality 4x+3>−30+2x{\displaystyle 4x+3>-30+2x}, to move the variable to one side, you would subtract 2x{\displaystyle 2x} from both sides of the inequality:4x+3>−30+2x{\displaystyle 4x+3>-30+2x}4x+3−2x>−30+2x−2x{\displaystyle 4x+3-2x>-30+2x-2x}2x+3>−30{\displaystyle 2x+3>-30}


, In order to solve the inequality, the variable should be on one side, without coefficients or constants. Divide to cancel out coefficients, and add or subtract to remove constants. Once you have isolated the variable, you have solved the inequality.

For example, in the inequality 2x+3>−30{\displaystyle 2x+3>-30}, to isolate the x{\displaystyle x} you need to subtract 3 from both sides, then divide both sides by 2:2x+3−3>−30−3{\displaystyle 2x+3-3>-30-3}2x>−33{\displaystyle 2x>-33}2x2>−332{\displaystyle {\frac {2x}{2}}>{\frac {-33}{2}}}x>−1612{\displaystyle x>-16{\frac {1}{2}}}

Understand the mathematical definition of absolute value.,

Isolate the absolute value term(s) in your equation.,
Set up the equation for the positive value.,
Solve the positive equation.,
Set up the equation for the negative value.,
Solve the negative equation.,
Check the result of your positive equation.,
Check the result of your negative equation.,
Note your valid solutions.",How to Solve Absolute Value Equations," The definition states that |p|={pif p≥0−pif p<0{\displaystyle |p|={\begin{cases}p&{\text{if }}p\geq 0\\-p&{\text{if }}p<0\end{cases}}}.This formula tells you that if a number p{\displaystyle p} is positive, the absolute value is simply p{\displaystyle p}. If a number p{\displaystyle p} is negative, then the absolute value is the negative value of −p{\displaystyle -p}. Since two negatives make a positive, the absolute value of −p{\displaystyle -p} is therefore positive.For example, |9| = 9; |-9| = -(-9) = 9. 
;
, The absolute value of a number represents how far away from 0 the number is on a number line.Absolute value is denoted by bars surrounding the term or terms (|x|{\displaystyle |x|}). The absolute value of a number is always positive.For example, |−3|=3{\displaystyle |-3|=3} and |3|=3{\displaystyle |3|=3}. Both -3 and 3 are three numbers away from 0.


, The absolute value should be on one side of the equation. Any numbers that are not included inside the absolute value symbols should be moved to the other side of the equation.Note that an absolute value can never equal a negative number, so if, after isolating the absolute value, your absolute value equals a negative number, the equation has no solution.For example, if your equation is |6x−2|+3=7{\displaystyle |6x-2|+3=7}, then subtract three from both sides of the equation to isolate the absolute value:|6x−2|+3=7{\displaystyle |6x-2|+3=7}|6x−2|+3−3=7−3{\displaystyle |6x-2|+3-3=7-3}|6x−2|=4{\displaystyle |6x-2|=4}


, An equation involving absolute value will have two possible solutions. To set up the positive equation, simply remove the absolute value bars, and solve the equation as normal.For example, the positive equation for |6x−2|=4{\displaystyle |6x-2|=4} is 6x−2=4{\displaystyle 6x-2=4}.


, To do this, use algebra to solve for the variable. This will give you the first possible solution to the equation.

For example:6x−2=4{\displaystyle 6x-2=4}6x−2+2=4+2{\displaystyle 6x-2+2=4+2}6x=6{\displaystyle 6x=6}6x6=66{\displaystyle {\frac {6x}{6}}={\frac {6}{6}}}x=1{\displaystyle x=1}


, To set up the negative equation, rewrite the equation without the absolute value bars, and take the negative value of the number on the other side of the equation.For example, the negative equation for |6x−2|=4{\displaystyle |6x-2|=4} is 6x−2=−4{\displaystyle 6x-2=-4}.


, Use algebra to solve for the variable as you would for any other equation. The result will be your second possible solution to the equation.

For example:6x−2=−4{\displaystyle 6x-2=-4}6x−2+2=−4+2{\displaystyle 6x-2+2=-4+2}6x=−2{\displaystyle 6x=-2}6x6=−26{\displaystyle {\frac {6x}{6}}={\frac {-2}{6}}}x=−13{\displaystyle x={\frac {-1}{3}}}


, You must always plug possible solutions back into the original equation to verify that they are real solutions.To check your positive equation, plug the value for x{\displaystyle x} derived from the positive equation back into the original absolute value equation. If both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is true.

For example, if the solution to the positive equation was x=1{\displaystyle x=1}, plug 1{\displaystyle 1} into the original equation and solve:|6x−2|=4{\displaystyle |6x-2|=4}|6(1)−2|=4{\displaystyle |6(1)-2|=4}|6−2|=4{\displaystyle |6-2|=4}|4|=4{\displaystyle |4|=4}


, Just because one solution is true, it does not mean that both are true. You must also plug the solution from the negative equation back into the original equation to verify it is a real solution.

For example, if the solution to the negative equation was x=−13{\displaystyle x={\frac {-1}{3}}}, plug −13{\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{3}}} into the original equation and solve:|6x−2|=4{\displaystyle |6x-2|=4}|6(−13)−2|=4{\displaystyle |6({\frac {-1}{3}})-2|=4}|−2−2|=4{\displaystyle |-2-2|=4}|−4|=4{\displaystyle |-4|=4}


, A solution is valid if, after plugging it back into the original equation, it yields a true equation. It is possible to have two valid solutions, but you may have one solution, or no solution.

For example, since |4|=4{\displaystyle |4|=4} and |−4|=4{\displaystyle |-4|=4} are both true, then both solutions to the equation are valid. So, |6x−2|+3=7{\displaystyle |6x-2|+3=7} has two possible solutions: x=1{\displaystyle x=1}, x=−13{\displaystyle x={\frac {-1}{3}}}.

Evaluate the expression.,
Factor the numerator.,
Cancel out shared factors.,
Rewrite the expression with the remaining factors.,
Complete any multiplication in numerator or denominator.",How to Simplify Rational Expressions1," To use this method, you should see a monomial in the numerator and in the denominator of your rational expression. A monomial is a polynomial with one term.For example, the expression 4x16x2{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{16x^{2}}}} has one term in the numerator, and one term in the denominator. Thus, each is a monomial.

The expression 4x+416x2−2{\displaystyle {\frac {4x+4}{16x^{2}-2}}} has two binomials and thus cannot be solved using this method.
;
, To do this, write out the factors you would multiply together to get the monomial, including the variable. For more information on how to factor, read Factor a Number. Rewrite the expression using the factors in the numerator and the denominator. For example, 4x{\displaystyle 4x} would factor as 2×2×x{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times x} and 16x2{\displaystyle 16x^{2}} would factor as 2×2×2×2×x×x{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times x\times x}. So, factored out, your expression will look like this: 2×2×x2×2×2×2×x×x{\displaystyle {\frac {2\times 2\times x}{2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times x\times x}}}


, To do this, cross out factors in the numerator and denominator that match. These cancel out because you are dividing a factor by itself, which equals 1.For example, you can cross out two 2s and one x in the numerator and the denominator:2×2×x2×2×2×2×x×x{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {x}}}{{\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {2}}\times 2\times 2\times {\cancel {x}}\times x}}}


, Remember that terms cancel to 1. So if you have canceled all the terms in the numerator or denominator, you will still be left with 1.  

For example:2×2×x2×2×2×2×x×x{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {x}}}{{\cancel {2}}\times {\cancel {2}}\times 2\times 2\times {\cancel {x}}\times x}}}12×2×x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2\times 2\times x}}}


, This will give you your final, simplified rational expression.

For example:12×2×x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2\times 2\times x}}}14x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4x}}}

 Know that sometimes the varying terms and the constant terms will be separate.,
 Simplify both sides.,
Next, divide both sides by the coefficient of x{\displaystyle x}.",How to Solve a Simple Linear Equation2," Sometimes, half of your work will be done for you. You'll have all the varying terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other side. If this is the case, all you have to do is the following.
, For the equation 16x−5x=32−10{\displaystyle 16x-5x=32-10}, we just have to subtract the numbers from one another.
, Remember that the coefficient of x is the number in front of the varying term. 

In this example, the coefficient of x{\displaystyle x} in 11x{\displaystyle 11x} is 11{\displaystyle 11}. That division is 11x/11=22/11{\displaystyle 11x/11=22/11} to get x=2{\displaystyle x=2}. The answer to the equation 16x−5x=32−10{\displaystyle 16x-5x=32-10} is x=2{\displaystyle x=2}.

In these cases, the new method directly selects the probable root pairs basing on the (c/a) setup and by, in the same time, applying the rule of signs.",How to Solve Complex Cases of Quadratic Equations2,"


Example 5. Solve: 7x² + 90x - 13 = 0.
Solution. Roots have opposite signs. Both a and c are prime numbers. Since 1 (or -1) is not a real root, there is a unique root pair:
(-1/7, 13/1). Since its diagonal sum is: -1 + 91 = 90 = b, the answers are opposite in sign. The 2 real roots are 1/7 and -13.
Example 6. Solve: 7x² - 57x + 8 = 0.
Solution. Both roots are positive. The c/a setup: (1, 8)(2, 4)/(1, 7).
Probable root pairs: (1/7 , 8/1) (2/1 , 4/7) (2/7 , 4/1)
Diagonal Sum of first set:(1 + 56) = 57 = -b.
The 2 real roots are 1/7 and 8.
NOTE. You can simplify the c/a setup before proceeding. Eliminate the pair (2, 4) from the numerator because it gives even-number diagonal sums (while b is odd). The remainder c/a: (1, 8)/(1, 7) leads to unique probable root pair: (1/7, 8/1) that gives the 2 real roots 1/7 and 8.
Example 7. Solve: 6x² - 19x - 11 = 0.
Solution. Roots have opposite signs. Write the c/a setup:
(-1, 11)/(1, 6)(2, 3)
Eliminate the pair (1, 6) because it gives larger diagonal sum (while b = -19).
The remainder c/a: (-1, 11)/(2, 3) leads to 2 probable root pairs: (-1/2, 11/3) and (-1/3, 11/2). The first diagonal sum is: -3 + 22 = 19 = -b. The 2 real roots are -1/2 and 11/3.

When the constants a and c are large numbers and may contain themselves many factors, solving is considered complicated because there are many permutations involved.",How to Solve Complex Cases of Quadratic Equations3," The Diagonal Sum Method proceeds basing on the (c/a) setup. The numerator of the setup contains all factor pairs of c. The denominator contains all factor pairs of a.


Next, this new method transforms a multiple steps solving process into a simplified one by doing a few operations of elimination.
Example 1. Solve: 45x² - 74x - 55 = 0.
Solution. Roots have opposite signs. Write down the (c/a) setup.
Numerator. All factors-sets of c: (-1, 55) (-5, 11).
Denominator. All factors-sets of a: (1, 45) (3, 15) (5, 9).
Smart students can use mental math to calculate all diagonal sums and find the one that fits.
The best way is to proceed elimination of the factor pairs that do not fit.
Eliminate the pairs: (-1, 55)/(1, 45)(3, 15) since they give larger diagonal sums (while b = -74).
The unique remainder (c/a) is: (-5, 11)/(5, 9) that gives as 2 real roots: -5/9 and 11/5.
Example 2. Solve: 12x² - 272x + 45 = 0.
Solution. Both roots are positive. Write down the (c/a) setup.
Numerator: (1, 45) (3, 15) (5, 9)
Denominator: (1, 12) (2, 6) (3, 4)
First eliminate the pairs with (1, 12),(3, 4) since they will give odd-number diagonal sums (while b is an even number).
Next, look for a setup (c/a) that gives a large diagonal sum. It should be the setup:(1, 45)/(2, 6) that leads to 2 probable root pairs:
(1/2 , 45/6) and (1/6, 45/2). The second diagonal sum is: 2 + 270 = 272 = -b. The 2 real roots are 1/6 and 45/2.
Example 3. Solve: 40x² - 483x + 36 = 0.
Solution. Both roots are positive. Write down the c/a setup.
Numerator: (1, 36) (2, 18) (3, 12) (6, 6).
Denominator: (1, 40) (2, 20) (4, 10)
First eliminate the pairs (2, 18)(6, 6)/(2, 20)(4, 10) because they give even-number diagonal sums (while b is odd).
The remainder c/a leads to 3 probable root pairs: (1/40, 36/1), (3/1, 12/46), (3/40, 12/1). The third diagonal sum is : 3 + 480 = 483 = -b. The 2 real roots are 3/40 and 12.
Example 4. Solve: 12x² + 5x - 72 = 0.
Solution. Roots have opposite signs. Write the (c/a) setup.
Numerator: (-1, 72)(-2, 36)(-3, 24)(-4, 18)(-6, 12) (-8, 9)
Denominator: (1, 12) (2, 6) (3, 4).
First, eliminate the pairs (-2, 36),(-4, 18),(-6, 12)/(2, 6) since they give even-number diagonal-sums (while b is odd).
Next, eliminate the pairs (-1, 72),(-3, 24)/(1, 12) since they give large diagonal sums ( while b is small).
The remainder (c/a) is (-8, 9)/(3, 4) that gives as 2 real roots: -8/3 and 9/4.
Example 5. Solve: 24x² - 59x + 36 = 0.
Solution. Both roots are positive. Write the (c/a) setup.
Numerator: (1, 36) (2, 18) (4, 9) (6, 6)
Denominator: (1, 24) (2, 12) (4, 6) (8, 3)
First, eliminate the pairs (2, 18),(6, 6)/(2, 12),(4, 6) that give even-number diagonal sums (while b is odd).
Next, eliminate the pairs (1, 36)/(1, 24) that gives large diagonal sums (while b = -59).
The remainder c/a is (4, 9)/(8, 3) that gives as 2 real roots: 4/3 and 9/8.

Approach the inequality as you would an equation.,
Reverse the inequality sign whenever you multiply or divide by a negative number.,
Reverse the inequality sign whenever you take the reciprocal of both sides.",How to Solve a Simple Linear Inequality2," Use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to move the variable to one side and isolate it. Once you have isolated the variable, you have solved the inequality.
, When using algebra to solve the inequality, pay close attention whenever you multiply or divide. When you multiply or divide the inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the direction of the inequality sign.For example, to solve the inequality −5x>20{\displaystyle -5x>20}, you need to divide each side by −5{\displaystyle -5} to isolate the variable. Thus, you need to reverse the direction of the inequality sign:−5x>20{\displaystyle -5x>20}−5x−5>20−5{\displaystyle {\frac {-5x}{-5}}>{\frac {20}{-5}}}x<−4{\displaystyle x<-4}


, This is only the case if both sides are negative, or if both sides are positive.The reciprocal of a number is shown by x=1x{\displaystyle x={\frac {1}{x}}}.For example, to solve the inequality 6<1x{\displaystyle 6<{\frac {1}{x}}}, you would isolate the x{\displaystyle x} by taking the reciprocal of both sides. Since both sides are positive, you need to reverse the inequality sign:6<1x{\displaystyle 6<{\frac {1}{x}}}16>x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}>x}

Combine like terms on the right side of the inequality: 3x+2<6+2x{\displaystyle 3x+2<6+2x}

Divide both sides by -6.,
Solve this compound inequality: 14<2x+4<22{\displaystyle 14<2x+4<22}.",How to Solve a Simple Linear Inequality3,", Since you are dividing by a negative number, you need to reverse the inequality sign:−6x>30{\displaystyle -6x>30}−6x−6>30−6{\displaystyle {\frac {-6x}{-6}}>{\frac {30}{-6}}}x<−5{\displaystyle x<-5}


, An inequality with more than two parts is called a compound inequality.You can solve these the same way you would simple inequalities.

Assess the rational expression.,
Find a monomial factor common to the numerator and denominator.,
Cancel out the common factor.,
Rewrite the expression after cancelling out the monomial.",How to Simplify Rational Expressions2," To use this method, you should see at least one binomial in your expression. It can be in the numerator, denominator, or both. A binomial is a polynomial with two terms.For example, the expression 4x16x2−2x{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{16x^{2}-2x}}} has two terms in the denominator. Thus, the denominator contains a binomial.


, The factor must be common to all terms in the expression. Factor out this term and rewrite the expression.For example, the monomial 2x{\displaystyle 2x} is common to each term in the expression 4x16x2−2x{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{16x^{2}-2x}}}. So after factoring this term out of the numerator and denominator, your expression will look like this: 2x(2)2x(8x−1){\displaystyle {\frac {2x(2)}{2x(8x-1)}}}.


, The monomial term factored out of the numerator and denominator cancels to 1, since you are dividing that term by itself.For example:2x(2)2x(8x−1){\displaystyle {\frac {2x(2)}{2x(8x-1)}}}2x(2)2x(8x−1){\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2x}}(2)}{{\cancel {2x}}(8x-1)}}}


, This will leave you with your simplified rational expression. If you factored correctly, there will be no more factors that are common to each term in the numerator and denominator.

For example:2x(2)2x(8x−1){\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2x}}(2)}{{\cancel {2x}}(8x-1)}}}28x−1{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8x-1}}}

Evaluate your expression.,
Factor the numerator’s polynomial into two binomials.,
Factor the denominator’s polynomial into two binomials.,
Cancel out binomial factors common to the numerator and denominator.A binomial factor is an expression in parentheses.You can factor these out, because dividing a factor by itself equals 1.,
Rewrite your expression with the remaining factors.",How to Simplify Rational Expressions3," This method works for expressions that have second-degree polynomials in the numerator and denominator. A second-degree polynomial is a polynomial with one term raised to the power of 2.For example, the expression x2−4x2−2x−8{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}-4}{x^{2}-2x-8}}} has a second degree polynomial in the numerator and the denominator, so you can use this method to simplify it.


, You are looking for two binomials that, when multiplied together using the FOIL method, result in the original polynomial. For more information on how to factor a second-degree polynomial, read Factor Second Degree Polynomials (Quadratic-Equations). Rewrite your expression with the factored numerator.	

For example, x2−4{\displaystyle x^{2}-4} can be factored as (x−2)(x+2){\displaystyle (x-2)(x+2)}. So, your expression now looks like this: (x−2)(x+2)x2−2x−8{\displaystyle {\frac {(x-2)(x+2)}{x^{2}-2x-8}}}.


, Again, you are looking for two binomials you can multiply together to get the original polynomial. Rewrite your expression with the factored denominator.

For example, x2−2x−8{\displaystyle x^{2}-2x-8} can be factored as (x+2)(x−4){\displaystyle (x+2)(x-4)}. So, your expression now looks like this: (x−2)(x+2)(x+2)(x−4){\displaystyle {\frac {(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)(x-4)}}}.


,

For example:(x−2)(x+2)(x+2)(x−4){\displaystyle {\frac {(x-2)(x+2)}{(x+2)(x-4)}}}(x−2)(x+2)(x+2)(x−4){\displaystyle {\frac {(x-2){\cancel {(x+2)}}}{{\cancel {(x+2)}}(x-4)}}}


, Remember that if you canceled out all the factors, you are left with 1. This will give you your final, simplified expression.

For example:(x−2)(x+2)(x+2)(x−4){\displaystyle {\frac {(x-2){\cancel {(x+2)}}}{{\cancel {(x+2)}}(x-4)}}}x−2x−4{\displaystyle {\frac {x-2}{x-4}}}

Absolute value inequalities usually take one of the following forms:
│𝑥│< or │𝑥│>𝑎 ; │𝑥±𝑎│<𝑏 or │𝑥±𝑎│>𝑏 ; │𝑎𝑥2 +𝑏𝑥│<𝑐
In this article, the focus will be on inequalities of the form |f(x)|<a or |f(x)|>a , where 𝑓(𝑥) is any function, and a is a constant.;
, Remember that an absolute value of x can either be positive x or negative x. The absolute value inequality │𝑥│< 3 can also be transformed into two inequalities: -x < 3 or x < 3.


For example,│x−3│>5 can be transformed into – (𝑥−3)>5 or 𝑥−3>5.
│3𝑥+2│ <5 can be transformed into – (3𝑥+2)<5 or 3𝑥+2<5.
The term “or” means that either of the two will satisfy the given absolute value problem.

, If it helps, temporarily replace the inequality sign with an equal sign until the end.

, Remember that if you divide by a negative number to isolate x on one side of the inequality sign, you will also have to switch the inequality sign. For example, if you divide both sides by -1, -x>5 will become x<-5.

, From the values above, you need to write the range of values that can be substituted in for x. This range of values is often referred to as a solution set. Since you would have to solve two inequalities from the absolute value inequality, you will then have two solutions. In the example used above, the solution can be written in two ways:


-7/3<x<1
(-7/3,1)

, Pick a number within your solution set, and plug it in for x. If it works, great! If not, go back and check your arithmetic.

The variable is the symbol (usually a letter like x or y) for a number you do not yet know. The constant is a number that remains consistent. The coefficient is a number before a variable, which is used to multiply it.


For example, in the linear equation 2x + 4y = 8, x and y are variables. The constant is 8. The numbers 2 and 4 are coefficients.;
, A system of equations with two variables can be written as follows:
ax + by = p
cx + dy = q
Any of the constants (p, q) can be zero, with the exception that each equation must have at least one variable (x, y) in it.

, When you have a linear system, you can use a matrix to rewrite it, then use the algebraic properties of that matrix to solve it. To rewrite a linear system, you use A to represent the coefficients matrix, C to represent the constants matrix, and X to represent the unknown matrix.


The linear system above, for example, can be rewritten as a matrix equation as follows: A x X = C.

, An augmented matrix is a matrix obtained by appending columns of two matrices. If you have two matrices, A and C, which looks like this:
You can create an augmented matrix by putting them together. The augmented matrix would look like this:


For example, consider the following linear system:
2x + 4y = 8
x + y = 2
Your augmented matrix would be a 2x3 matrix that looks like this:

, You can perform certain operations on a matrix to transform it while keeping it equivalent to the original. These are called elementary operations. To solve a 2x3 matrix, for example, you use elementary row operations to transform the matrix into a triangular one. Elementary operations include:


swapping two rows.
multiplying a row by a number different from zero.
multiplying one row and then adding to another row.

, You want to produce zero in your second row, so multiply in a way that lets you do that.


For example, say you have a matrix that looks like this:
You can keep the first row and use it to produce zero in the second row. To do that, first multiply the second row by two, as follows:

, In order to get to zero for the first row, you may need to multiply again, using the same principle.


In the example above, multiply the second row by -1, as follows:
When you complete the multiplication, your new matrix looks like this:

, Next, add the first and second rows to produce zero in the first column of the second row.


In the example above, add the two rows together as follows:

, At this point, you have a triangular matrix. You can use that matrix to get a new linear system. The first column corresponds to the unknown x, and the second column corresponds to the unknown y. The third column corresponds to the free member of an equation.


For the example above, your new system would therefore look like this:

, Using your new system, determine which variable can be determined easily, and solve for it.


In the example above, you’ll want to “backsolve” – moving from the last equation to the first when solving for your unknowns. The second equation gives you an easy solution for y; since the x has been removed, you can see that y = 2.

, Once you’ve determined one of the variables, you can substitute its value into the other equation to solve for the other variable.


In the example above, replace the y with a 2 in the first equation to solve for x as follows:

Define ""like terms"" by their variables and powers.,
Factor by writing numbers as the product of two factors.,
Use the acronym PEMDAS to remember the order of operations.",How to Simplify Algebraic Expressions1," In algebra, ""like terms"" have the same configuration of variables, raised to the same powers. In other words, for two terms to be ""like"", they must have the same variable or variables, or none at all, and each variable must be raised to the same power, or no power at all. The order of variables within the term does not matter.


For example, 3x2 and 4x2 are like terms because each contains the variable x raised to the second power. However, x and x2 are not like terms because each term has x raised to a different power. Similarly, -3yx and 5xz are not like terms because each term has a different set of variables.

, Factoring is the concept of representing a given number as the product of two factors multiplied together. Numbers can have more than one set of factors - for instance, the number 12 can be formed by 1 × 12, 2 × 6, and 3 × 4, so we can say that 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 are all factors of 12. Another way of thinking of this is that a number's factors are the numbers by which it is evenly divisible.


For example, if we wanted to factor 20, we might write it as 4 × 5.
Note that variable terms can also be factored - 20x, for instance, can be written as 4(5x).
Prime numbers can't be factored because they are only evenly divisible by themselves and 1.

, Sometimes, simplifying an expression means nothing more than performing the operations in the expression until no more can be done. In these cases, it's important to remember the order of operations so that no arithmetic errors are made. The acronym PEMDAS can help you remember the order of operations - the letters correspond to the types of operations you should perform, in order. If there is multiplication and division in the same problem, you must complete those operations from left to right when you get to that point. The same goes for addition and subtraction. The image above gives the incorrect answer. The last step did not work the addition and subtraction from left to right. It did the addition first. It should show 25-20 = 5 and then 5 + 6 = 11.

Write your equation.,
Identify like terms.,
Combine like terms.,
Create a simplified expression from your simplified terms.,
Obey the order of operation when combining like terms.",How to Simplify Algebraic Expressions2," The simplest algebraic equations, those involving just a few variable terms with whole number coefficients and no fractions, radicals, etc., can often be solved in just a few steps. As with most math problems, the first step to simplifying your equation is to write it out!


As an example problem, for the next few steps, let's consider the expression 1 + 2x - 3 + 4x.;
, Next, search your equation for like terms. Remember that like terms have both the same variable(s) and exponent(s).


For example, let's identify like terms in our equation 1 + 2x - 3 + 4x. 2x and 4x both have the same variable raised to the same exponent (in this case, the x's aren't raised to any exponent at all). In addition, 1 and -3 are like terms, as neither has any variables. So, in our equation, 2x and 4x and 1 and -3 are like terms.

, Now that you've identified like terms, you can combine them to simplify your equation. Add terms together (or subtract in the case of negative terms) to reduce each set of terms with the same variables and exponents to one singular term.


Let's add the like terms in our example.

2x + 4x = 6x

1 + -3 = -2




, After combining your like terms, construct an expression from your new, smaller set of terms. You should get a simpler expression that has one term for each different set of variables and exponents in the original expression. This new expression is equal to the first.


In our example, our simplified terms are 6x and -2, so our new expression is 6x - 2. This simplified expression is equal to the original (1 + 2x - 3 + 4x), but is shorter and easier to manage. It's also easier to factor, which, as we'll see below, is another important simplifying skill.

, In extremely simple expressions like the one dealt with in the example problems above, identifying like terms is simple. However, in more complex expressions, like ones that involve terms in parentheses, fractions, and radicals, like terms which can be combined may not be immediately apparent. In these cases, follow the order of operations, performing operations on the terms in your expression as necessary until only addition and subtraction operations remain.


For example, let's consider the equation 5(3x-1) + x((2x)/(2)) + 8 - 3x. It would be incorrect to immediately identify 3x and 2x as like terms and combine them because the parentheses in the expression dictate that we're supposed to do other operations first. First, let's perform the arithmetic operations in the expression in accordance with the order of operations to obtain terms we can use. See below:

5(3x-1) + x((2x)/(2)) + 8 - 3x
15x - 5 + x(x) + 8 - 3x
15x - 5 + x2 + 8 - 3x. Now, since the only operations left are addition and subtraction, we can combine like terms.
x2 + (15x - 3x) + (8 - 5)
x2 + 12x + 3

Use factoring to simplify fractions.",How to Simplify Algebraic Expressions3," Factoring is a way to simplify expressions by removing factors that are common across all the terms in the expression. To start, find the greatest common factor that all of the terms in the expression share - in other words, the largest number by which all the terms in the expression are evenly divisible.


Let's use the equation 9x2 + 27x - 3. Notice that every term in this equation is divisible by 3. Since the terms aren't all evenly divisible by any larger number, we can say that 3 is our expression's greatest common factor.

, Next, divide every term in your equation by the greatest common factor you've just found. The resulting terms will all have smaller coefficients than in the original expression.


Let's factor our equation by its greatest common factor, 3. To do so, we'll divide each term by 3.

9x2/3 = 3x2

27x/3 = 9x
-3/3 = -1
Thus, our new expression is 3x2 + 9x - 1.



, Your new expression isn't equal to your old one, so it isn't accurate to say that it's simplified. To make our new expression equal to the old one, we'll need to account for the fact that it has been divided by the greatest common factor. Enclose your new expression in parentheses and set the greatest common factor of the original equation as a coefficient for the expression in parentheses.


For our example expression, 3x2 + 9x - 1, we would enclose the expression in parentheses and multiply by the greatest common factor of the original equation to get 3(3x2 + 9x - 1). This equation is equal to the original, 9x2 + 27x - 3.

, You may now be wondering why factoring is useful if, after removing the greatest common factor, the new expression must be multiplied by it again. In fact, factoring allows a mathematician to perform a variety of tricks to simplify an expression. One of the easiest of these involves taking advantage of the fact that multiplying a fraction's numerator and denominator by the same number gives an equivalent fraction. See below:


Let's say our original example expression, 9x2 + 27x - 3, is the numerator of a larger fraction with 3 in the denominator. This fraction would look like this: (9x2 + 27x - 3)/3. We can use factoring to simplify this fraction.

Let's substitute the factored form of our original expression for the expression in the numerator: (3(3x2 + 9x - 1))/3
Notice that now, both the numerator and the denominator share the coefficient 3. Dividing the numerator and denominator by 3, we get: (3x2 + 9x - 1)/1.
Since any fraction with ""1"" in the denominator is equal to the terms in the numerator, we can say that our original fraction can be simplified to 3x2 + 9x - 1.

Simplify fractions by dividing through by common factors.,
Use square factors to simplify radicals.,
Add exponents when multiplying two exponential terms; subtract when dividing.",How to Simplify Algebraic Expressions4," As noted above, if the numerator and denominator of an expression share factors, these factors can be removed from the fraction entirely. Sometimes this will require factoring the numerator, denominator, or both (as was the case in the example problem above) while other times the shared factors are immediately apparent. Note that it is also possible to divide the numerator terms by the expression in the denominator individually to obtain a simplified expression.


Let's tackle an example that doesn't necessarily require drawn-out factoring. For the fraction (5x2 + 10x + 20)/10, we may want to divide every term in the numerator by the 10 in the denominator to simplify, even though the ""5"" coefficient in 5x2 isn't bigger than 10 and thus can't have 10 as a factor.

Doing so gets us ((5x2)/10) + x + 2. If we like, we may want to rewrite the first term as (1/2)x2 to get (1/2)x2 + x + 2.



, Expressions under a square root sign are called radical expressions. These can be simplified by identifying square factors (factors that are themselves squares of an integer) and performing the square root operation on these separately to remove them from under the square root sign.


Let's tackle a simple example - √(90). If we think of the number 90 as the product of two of its factors, 9 and 10, we can take the square root of 9 to give the whole number 3 and remove this from the radical. In other words:

√(90)
√(9 × 10)
(√(9) × √(10))
3 × √(10)
3√(10)



, Some algebraic expressions require multiplying or dividing exponential terms. Rather than computing each exponential term and multiplying or dividing manually, simply add exponents when multiplying and subtract when dividing to save time. This concept can also be used to simplify variable expressions.


For example, let's consider the expression 6x3 × 8x4 + (x17/x15). In each occasion where it's necessary to multiply or divide by exponents, we'll subtract or add the exponents, respectively, to quickly find a simplified term. See below:

6x3 × 8x4 + (x17/x15)
(6 × 8)x3 + 4 + (x17 - 15)
48x7 + x2


For an explanation of why this works, see below:

Multiplying exponential terms is essentially like multiplying long strings of non-exponential terms. For example, since x3 = x × x × x and x 5 = x × x × x × x × x, x3 × x5 = (x × x × x) × (x × x × x × x × x), or x8.
Similarly, dividing exponential terms is like dividing long strings of non-exponential terms. x5/x3 = (x × x × x × x × x)/(x × x × x). Since each term in the numerator can be canceled out by a matching term in the denominator, we're left with two x's in the numerator and none in the bottom, giving us an answer of x2

Find the next point from the vertex on the parabola that has coordinates with two integers.,
Find the value of a.",How to Quickly Determine the Equation of a Parabola in Vertex Form," The parabola should be on a graph on a coordinate plane with x and y coordinates.

, The equation for parabolas that have openings facing the top and bottom use y=a(x−h)2+k{\displaystyle y=a(x-h)^{2}+k}. But if the parabola's opening faces the left or right, it will use x=a(y−h)2+k{\displaystyle x=a(y-h)^{2}+k}.
, There is only one vertex per parabola. The vertex is the point on the tip of the parabola.
, The x coordinate of the vertex will replace h and the y coordinate will replace k.
, If the parabola is facing up , then a is positive. But if the parabola is facing down, a is negative.
, Find the rise and run between this point and the vertex.

Examples of coordinates with two integers are: (−4,3){\displaystyle (-4,3)}, (0,2){\displaystyle (0,2)}, and (9,9){\displaystyle (9,9)}.

Examples of coordinates without two integers are: (2.5,−1){\displaystyle (2.5,-1)}, (6.97,7.1){\displaystyle (6.97,7.1)}, (−1.01,0){\displaystyle (-1.01,0)}.

Remember that the rise is the difference in y and the run is the difference in x.


, Note the absolute value of the run. This will be the denominator of a. To find the numerator of a, simply divide the rise by the run.

For example; if the rise is 2 and the run is 1, the denominator would be 1 and the numerator would be 2 divided by 1 which is 2. Thus, a would be 2.

The process of finding a could be simplified to rise/run2{\displaystyle rise/run^{2}}.


, This might be handy if you have to factor it out properly.

If you have y=(x−4)2+4{\displaystyle y=(x-4)^{2}+4}, in standard form, it will be y=x2−8x+20{\displaystyle y=x^{2}-8x+20} which could be factored neatly into y=(x−10)(x+2){\displaystyle y=(x-10)(x+2)}.


,, Replace h with the y coordinate of the vertex and k with the x coordinate.

In the example shown in the picture, the vertex is the origin, (0, 0) so there will be no h and k, simplifying the equation to x=ay2{\displaystyle x=ay^{2}}.


, If the parabola opens to the right, a is positive. But if it opens to the left, then a is negative.
, Calculate the rise and run between this point and the vertex.
, Note the absolute value of the rise. This will be the denominator of a. To find the numerator of a, divide the run by the rise.

If the rise is 5 and the run is 20, then a will be 4/5 because we can get 4 by dividing 20 and 5.

Remember that a could also be calculated by dividing the rise by the run squared. But for a parabola that opens sideways, it is run divided by the rise squared.

Use present tense to move the story forward.,
Try past tense to explore a character’s past.,
Go for present tense when discussing the work.",How to Write in First Person1," The first person point of view has two different tenses, present tense and past tense. Present tense “I” focuses on the actions and thoughts of the narrator as they unfold in the present. It can be a good option for moving the story forward, carrying the reader through a narrative as events and moments are happening.For example, a first person present tense narrator would be, “I open the window and yell at him to leave me alone. I close the window and try to focus on the latest soap opera on television.”;
, The past tense is a good option if you are writing a story that explores the main character or narrator’s past. It is a more popular tense than present tense and is often easier to do. Writing in the past tense can make the story feel more like it is being told, rather than happening in the present moment.For example, a first person past tense narrator would be, “I opened the window and yelled at him to leave me alone. I closed the window and tried to focus on the latest soap opera on television.”

, In most cases, the first person point of view is not recommended for an academic essay. But your instructor may allow you use the first person when discussing a work of literature or a scholarly work. Use the present tense to give the discussion immediacy and an intimate tone.If you are using APA style, you can use the first person point of view to discuss your research steps in a research paper. For example, you may write, “I studied sample A” or “I interviewed subject B.” In general, you should avoid the first person point of view and only use it sparingly in your research paper.

Confirm that the matrices can be multiplied.,
Mark the dimensions of the matrix product.,
Find the first dot product.,
Find the second dot product.,
Find the remaining two dot products.,
Confirm that all four of the dot-products are in the correct location in the matrix product.",How to Multiply Matrices," You can only multiply matrices if the number of columns of the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.


These matrices can be multiplied because the first matrix, Matrix A, has 3 columns, while the second matrix, Matrix B, has 3 rows.;
, Create a new blank matrix that will mark the dimensions of the matrix product, the product of the two matrices. The matrix that represents the product of Matrix A and Matrix B will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix. You can draw blank boxes to indicate the number of rows and columns in this matrix.


Matrix A has 2 rows, so the matrix product will have 2 rows.
Matrix B has 2 columns, so the matrix product will have 2 columns.
The matrix product will have 2 rows and 2 columns.

, To find a dot product, you need to multiply the first element in the first row by the first element of the first column, the second element of the first row by the second element of the first column, and the third element in the first row by the third element in the first column. Then, add their products to find the dot product. Let's say you've decided to solve for the element in the 2nd row and 2nd column (bottom right) of the matrix product first. Here's how you do it:


6 x -5 = -30
1 x 0 = 0
-2 x 2 = -4
-30 + 0 + (-4) = -34
The dot product is -34 and it belongs on the bottom right of the matrix product.

When you multiply matrices, the dot product will go in the position of the row of the first Matrix and the column of the second matrix. For example, when you found the dot product of the bottom row of Matrix A and the right column of Matrix B, the answer, -34, went in the bottom row and right column of the matrix product.



, Let's say you want to find the term on the bottom left of the matrix product. To find this term, you simply have to multiply the elements on the bottom row of the first matrix with the elements in the first column of the second matrix and then add them up. Use the same method you used to multiply the first row and column -- find the dot product again.


6 x 4 = 24
1 x (-3) = -3
(-2) x 1 = -2
24 + (-3) + (-2) = 19
The dot product is -19 and it belongs on the bottom left of the matrix product.

, To find the term on the top left of the matrix product, start by finding the dot product of the top row of Matrix A and the left column of Matrix B. Here's how you do it:


2 x 4 = 8
3 x (-3) = -9
(-1) x 1 = -1
8 + (-9) + (-1) = -2
The dot product is -2 and it belongs on the top left of the matrix product.

To find the term on the top right of the matrix product, just find the dot product of the top row of Matrix A and the right column of Matrix B. Here's how you do it:


2 x (-5) = -10
3 x 0 = 0
(-1) x 2 = -2
-10 + 0 + (-2) = -12
The dot product is -12 and it belongs on the top right of the matrix product.

, 19 should be in the bottom left, -34 should be on the bottom right, -2 should be on the top left, and -12 should be on the top right.

Find the y-intercept.,
 Include the x and y intercepts in the graph.",How to Graph Transformations of Functions," Although it may seem silly, you always write out the function given so you can refer back to it.

, The basic function is just the function in its natural state. Its natural state is the function without any transformations.

The basic function of, f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, is just f(x)=x2{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}}

 The basic function of, f(x)=(−x+3)3−1{\displaystyle f(x)=(-x+3)^{3}-1}, is just f(x)=x3{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}}


, By determining the basic function, you can graph the basic graph. The basic graph is exactly what it sounds like, the graph of the basic function. The basic graph can be looked at as the foundation for graphing the actual function. The basic graph will be used to develop a sketch of the function with its transformations.

For the basic function, f(x)=x2{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}}, its basic graph is just a parabola.


, The left/right shift determines whether the graph will shift to the right or left c units, where c is just used as a variable representing any number.

In a function where c is added to the variable of the function, meaning the function becomes f(x)=f(x+c){\displaystyle f(x)=f(x+c)}, the basic graph will shift to the left c units.

In a function where c is subtracted from the variable of the function, meaning the function becomes f(x)=f(x−c){\displaystyle f(x)=f(x-c)}, the basic graph will shift to the right c units.

 For the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, the basic graph will shift to the right 2 units.

 For the function f(x)=(−x+3)3−1{\displaystyle f(x)=(-x+3)^{3}-1}, the basic graph will shift to the left 3 units.


, Now that you have determined the function left/right shift, you must redraw the basic graph including the left/right shift.

 If your function is f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3} it has a right shift 2 units. The redrawn basic graph will shift to the right 2 units

If your function is f(x)=(−x+3)3−1{\displaystyle f(x)=(-x+3)^{3}-1} it has a left shift 3 units. The redrawn basic graph will shift to the left 3 units.


, The left/right flip determines if the graph will flip over the y-axis. This flip means the original graph will be flipped the opposite direction across the y-axis, either to left or right.

 If the variable of the function is multiplied by -1, meaning the function becomes f(x)=f(−x){\displaystyle f(x)=f(-x)}, the basic graph will flip across the y-axis.

 For the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, the basic graph will not flip across the y-axis because the variable of the function is not multiplied by -1.

For the function f(x)=(−x+3)3−1{\displaystyle f(x)=(-x+3)^{3}-1}, the basic graph will flip across the y-axis because the variable of the function is multiplied by -1.


, Now that you have determined if the graph has a left/right flip, you must the flip to the basic graph including the left/right shift. All this means is that graph of the basic graph will be redrawn with the left/right shift and left/right flip.

For the function f(x)=(−x+3)−1{\displaystyle f(x)=(-x+3)-1}, it will flip across the y-axis so the redrawn basic graph will now include the left shift 3 units as well as flip across the y-axis.


, The up/down flip determines if the graph will be flipped across the x-axis. This flip means that the original graph will flip the opposite direction across the x-axis, either up or down.

If the entire function is multiplied by -1, meaning the function becomes f(x)=−f(x){\displaystyle f(x)=-f(x)}, the basic graph will flip across the x-axis.

For the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, it will flip across the x-axis because the entire function is multiplied by -1.

For the function f(x)=(x+3)3−1{\displaystyle f(x)=(x+3)^{3}-1} it will not flip across the x-axis because the entire function is not multiplied by -1.


, Now that you have determined if the function has an up/down flip, you must redraw the basic graph including the left/right shift, , if needed, the left/right flip, and up/down flip.

For the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, the redrawn basic graph will shift to the right 2 units and flip across the x-axis.


, The up/down shift determines if the graph will be shifted up or down c units, where c is variable representing a number.

In a function where c is added to the entire function, meaning the function becomes f(x)=f(x)+c{\displaystyle f(x)=f(x)+c}, the basic graph will shift up c units.

In a function where c is subtracted from the entire function, meaning the function becomes f(x)=f(x)−c{\displaystyle f(x)=f(x)-c}, the basic graph will shift down c units.

 For the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, the basic graph will shift up 3 units.

 For the function f(x)=(x+3)3−1{\displaystyle f(x)=(x+3)^{3}-1}, the basic graph will shift down 1 unit.


, Now that you have determined the up/down shift, you must redraw the basic graph include the left/right shift, left/right flip and/or up/down flip, and the up/down shift.

For the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, the redrawn basic graph will shift to the right 2 units, flip across the x-axis, and shift up 3 units.

For the function f(x)=(x+3)3−1{\displaystyle f(x)=(x+3)^{3}-1}, the redrawn basic graph will shift to the left 3 units, flip across the y-axis, and shift down 1 unit.


, Now that you have a sketch of what the function looks like with its transformations, you must find where the function touches the x-axis or its x-intercept(s). A x-intercept is just an ordered pair,(x,y), where y is always 0.

To find the x-intercepts, you set the entire function to zero and solve for x.

For the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, let's find the x-intercepts:

 −(x−2)2+3=0{\displaystyle -(x-2)^{2}+3=0}

 −(x−2)2=−3{\displaystyle -(x-2)^{2}=-3}

 (x−2)2=3x−2=3{\displaystyle (x-2)^{2}=3x-2={\sqrt {3}}}


x=−3+2{\displaystyle x=-{\sqrt {3}}+2}  and x=3+2{\displaystyle x={\sqrt {3}}+2}

 so for the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, its x-intercepts are (3+2,0){\displaystyle ({\sqrt {3}}+2,0)} & (−3+2,0){\displaystyle (-{\sqrt {3}}+2,0)}




, Now that you have found your functions x-intercept(s), you need to find where the function cross the y-axis or its y-intercept. A y-intercept is just an ordered pair, (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)}, where x is always 0.

To find a functions y-intercept, you set x=0 and find f(0){\displaystyle f(0)}.

For the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, let's find its y-intercept: f(0)=−(0−2)2+3=−(−2)2+3=−4+3)=−1{\displaystyle f(0)=-(0-2)^{2}+3=-(-2)^{2}+3=-4+3)=-1} so the y-intercept is (0,−1){\displaystyle (0,-1)}


, Now that you have a sketch of the functions graph and found the functions x-intercept(s) and y-intercept, your final step is to redraw the graph in step 11 including each x and y intercepts.

For the function f(x)=−(x−2)2+3{\displaystyle f(x)=-(x-2)^{2}+3}, the graph of function shifts to the right 2 units, flips across the x-axis, shifts up 3 units, crosses the x-axis at (−3+2,0){\displaystyle (-{\sqrt {3}}+2,0)} & (3+2,0){\displaystyle ({\sqrt {3}}+2,0)}, and crosses the y-axis at (0,−1){\displaystyle (0,-1)}.

Simplify any radical expressions that are perfect squares.,
Simplify any radical expressions that are perfect cubes.",How to Simplify Radical Expressions2," A perfect square is the product of any number that is multiplied by itself, such as 81, which is the product of 9 x 9. To simplify a perfect square under a radical, simply remove the radical sign and write the number that is the square root of the perfect square.


For example, 121 is a perfect square because 11 x 11 is 121. Thus, you can simplify sqrt(121) to 11, removing the square root symbol.
To make this process easier, you should memorize the first twelve perfect squares: 1 x 1 = 1, 2 x 2 = 4, 3 x 3 = 9, 4 x 4 = 16, 5 x 5 = 25, 6 x 6 = 36, 7 x 7 = 49, 8 x 8 = 64, 9 x 9 = 81, 10 x 10 = 100, 11 x 11 = 121, 12 x 12 = 144;
, A perfect cube is the product of any number that is multiplied by itself twice, such as 27, which is the product of 3 x 3 x 3. To simplify a radical expression when a perfect cube is under the cube root sign, simply remove the radical sign and write the number that is the cube root of the perfect cube.


For example, 343 is a perfect cube because it is the product of 7 x 7 x 7. Therefore, the cube root of the perfect cube 343 is simply 7.

If you have one radical expression multiplied by another, combine them as a single radical using the property: sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab).",How to Simplify Radical Expressions5," For example, replace sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) by sqrt(12).


The above identity, sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab) is valid for non negative radicands. Don't apply it if a and b are negative as then you would falsely assert that sqrt(-1)*sqrt(-1) = sqrt(1). The left-hand side -1 by definition (or undefined if you refuse to acknowledge complex numbers) while the right side is +1. If a and/or b is negative, first ""fix"" its sign by sqrt(-5) = i*sqrt(5). If the radicand is a variable expression whose sign is not known from context and could be either positive or negative, then just leave it alone for now. You could use the more general identity, sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) = sqrt(sgn(a))*sqrt(sgn(b))*sqrt(|ab|) which is valid for all real numbers a and b, but it's usually not worth the added complexity of introducing the sign function.
This identity only applies if the radicals have the same index. You can multiply more general radicals like sqrt(5)*cbrt(7) by first expressing them with a common index. To do this, temporarily convert the roots to fractional exponents: sqrt(5)*cbrt(7) = 5^(1/2) * 7^(1/3) = 5^(3/6) * 7^(2/6) = 125^(1/6) * 49^(1/6). Then apply the product rule to equate this product to the sixth root of 6125.

For example, try listing all the factors of the number 45: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. 9 is a factor of 45 that is also a perfect square (9=3^2). 9 x 5 = 45.

, 9 is a perfect square because it is the product of 3 x 3. Take the 9 out of the radical sign and place a 3 in front of it, leaving 5 under the radical sign. If you ""throw"" the three back in under the radical sign, it will be multiplied by itself to create 9 again, which will multiply with 5 to create 45 again. 3 root 5 is just a simplified way of saying root 45.


That is, sqrt(45) = sqrt(9*5) = sqrt(9)*sqrt(5) = 3*sqrt(5).

, The square root of a to the second power would be |a|. You can further simplify this to just ""a"" only if the variable is known to be positive. The square root of a to the third power is broken down into the square root of a squared times a -- this is because you add exponents when you multiply variables, so that a squared times a is equal to a cubed.


Therefore, the perfect square in the expression a cubed is a squared.

, Now, take a squared and pull it out of the radical to make it a regular |a|. The simplified form of a cubed is just |a| root a.

Give the narrator a distinct voice.,
Filter the actions of the story through the narrator.,
Use the “I” to keep the pace and action moving forward.,
Read examples of first person narratives.",How to Write in First Person2," First person narrators often have a particular way of seeing the world, which is based on their backstory. Give your first person narrator a narrative voice that is distinct and particular to them. Consider the narrator’s age, class, and background. Use these elements to create the voice of the first person narrator.For example, if your narrator is a Latino teenager who lives in the Bronx, they will have a distinct narrative voice that may use Spanish phrases and teenage slang as well as standard English.

, With a first person narrator, you want the reader to view the world of the story through their perspective. This means describing scenes, other characters, and settings from the point of the view of the narrator. Try to filter all the action in the story through the first person narrator so the reader gets a sense of their point of view.For example, rather than say, “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. A killer spider skittered towards me and I thought, I’m dead,” focus on describing the action straight from the viewpoint of the narrator. You may write, “This couldn’t be what I was seeing. A killer spider skittered towards me. I’m dead.”

, Try not to let the first person narrator get bogged down by backstory or long descriptions, especially if you’re writing in the present tense. Keep the pace and action of the story moving forward. Focus on keeping your narrator in the action in every scene.For example, rather than write, “I tried to talk to Sara about how I felt but she didn’t want to listen to what I had to say,” you may put this content in a scene with dialogue and action. You may write instead, “‘Sara, why won’t you talk to me?’ I was determined to get her to listen to what I had to say.”

, To get a better sense of the first person point of view, read examples of this perspective in literature. Look at present and past tense examples so you can look at how other writers use it in their work. There are several well known examples of the first person point of view in writing, including:To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee

Moby Dick by Herman Melville

The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald

Lucy by Jamaica Kincaid
""Shooting an Elephant,"" an essay by George Orwell
""The Death of the Moth,"" an essay by Virginia Woolf

"
"
Avoid starting every sentence with “I.” Though you are writing from the perspective of the “I” in the first person point of view, you do not want every sentence to begin with “I.” Doing this can make the narrative feel repetitive and stilted.,
Do not report on the action using the “I.” Allow the first person narrator to describe a scene or moment from their point of view.,
Try not to place distance between the reader and the “I.” Using “I thought,” “I saw,” or “I felt” in the narrative can create distance between the reader and the first person perspective.",How to Write in First Person3," Try to vary up your sentences so you do not start with “I” in every sentence or have “I” in sentence after sentence.For example, rather than have two sentences like, “I ran down the stairs, my heart pounding. I could hear the killer spider skittering on the wall behind me,” you can write, “I ran down the stairs, my heart pounding. Behind me, the killer spider skittered on the wall.”

, Do not use the passive voice when describing a scene or moment through your first person narrator. This can make the narrative sound like a report or a summary of events, rather than let the reader experience the events as they unfold.

For example, rather than write, “I bumped into Marsha and she told me she left her homework at home. I felt sorry for her and told her not to get so upset,” you may place the reader right in a scene.
You may write, “As I turned the corner of the gym, I bumped into Marsha. ‘I forgot my homework at home,’ she complained. I put my hand on her shoulder and tried to comfort her. ‘Don’t be too upset,’ I said to her.”

, Avoid using them when you are writing in the first person, as they can weaken the narrative.For example, rather than write, “I felt sad about losing her as a friend,” you may write, “Sadness filled my body as I realized I was losing her as a friend.”
You can also often simply remove “I thought” or “I saw” in a sentence to make the first person point of view stronger. For example, rather than write, “I passed her in the hall and almost stopped to talk to her. Then, I thought, why bother, she’s just going to reject you anyway,” remove ""I thought"" and tighten up the action in the sentence.
You may write, “I passed her in the hall and almost stopped to talk to her. But I kept walking. Why bother, she’s just going to reject me anyway.”

Read the piece out loud.,
Tighten up the word choice and language.,
Show the piece to others.",How to Write in First Person4," Once you have completed a draft of the story in the first person, read it out loud. Listen to how each sentence sounds in the narrative. Notice if you repeat “I” too often or in every sentence. Pay attention to the voice of the first person narrator and note if it feels consistent throughout the piece.You should also pay attention to the tense in the story. Make sure the story does not shift from present to past tense or vice versa. It should stay in the same tense the entire time.

, As you polish and revise the story, make sure your word choice and language is strong. Look for any words that you can replace with more unique terms. Check for any language that does not feel as clear or concise as it could be. Make sure your word choice and language suit the first person narrator in the story., You should show your draft to others and get their feedback. Ask friends and peers to read the first person narrative. Have them give you feedback and apply their critiques to the story to make it stronger.

You may also show the story to a writing group to get their criticisms and critiques. Be open to the feedback of others and use it to improve the first person narrator in your story.

Multiply the variables.,
Write your final answer.",How to Multiply Polynomials2," A problem involving a monomial and a binomial will involve one polynomial that only has a single term. The second polynomial will have two terms, which will be separated by either a plus sign or a minus sign.


A polynomial problem involving a monomial and a binomial will look something like: (ax) * (bx + cy)

Example: (2x)(3x + 4y)

, Rewrite the problem so that all the terms are separate by distributing the single-term polynomial to both terms in the two-term polynomial.


After this step, the new rewritten form will look something like: (ax * bx) + (ax * cy)

Example: (2x)(3x + 4y) = (2x)(3x) + (2x)(4y)

, The constants refer to the numerical digits in the problem. These are multiplied as they usually would be according to the standard times table.


In other words, during this part of the problem, you are multiplying a, b, and c together.
Example: (2x)(3x + 4y) = (2x)(3x) + (2x)(4y) = 6(x)(x) + 8(x)(y)

, The variables refer to the letters in the equation. When you multiply these variables, different variables will simply be combined together. When you multiply a variable by a like variable, though, you raise that variable by another power.


In other words, you are multiplying the the x and y portions of the equation.
Example: (2x)(3x + 4y) = (2x)(3x) + (2x)(4y) = 6(x)(x) + 8(x)(y) = 6x^2 + 8xy

, This type of polynomial problem is also simple enough to usually avoid the need for combining like terms.

A polynomial problem involving two binomials will look something like: (ax + by) * (cx + dy)

Example: (2x + 3y)(4x + 5y)

, FOIL is an acronym used to explain how terms are distributed. Distribute first terms, outside terms, inside terms, and last terms.


After this, your rewritten polynomial problem will effectively look like: (ax)(cx) + (ax)(dy) + (by)(cx) + (by)(dy)

Example: (2x + 3y)(4x + 5y) = (2x)(4x) + (2x)(5y) + (3y)(4x) + (3y)(5y)

, The constants refer to the numerical digits in the problem. These are multiplied as they usually would be according to the standard times table.


In other words, during this part of the problem, you are multiplying a, b, c, and d together.
Example: (2x)(4x) + (2x)(5y) + (3y)(4x) + (3y)(5y) = 8(x)(x) + 10(x)(y) + 12(y)(x) + 15(y)(y)

, The variables refer to the letters in the equation. When you multiply these variables, different variables will simply be combined together. When you multiply a variable by a like variable, though, you raise that variable by another power.


In other words, you are multiplying the the x and y portions of the equation.
Example: 8(x)(x) + 10(x)(y) + 12(y)(x) + 15(y)(y) = 8x^2 + 10xy + 12xy + 15y^2

, This type of problem is complex enough to potentially produce like terms, meaning two or more end terms that share the same ending variable. If this happens, you should add or subtract the like terms as needed to determine your final answer.


The result will look something like: acx^2 + adxy + bcxy + bdy^2 = acx^2 + abcdxy + bdy^2

A polynomial problem involving a monomial and a three-term polynomial will look something like: (ay) * (bx^2 + cx + dy)

Example: (2y)(3x^2 + 4x + 5y)

, Rewrite the problem so that all the terms are separate by distributing the single-term polynomial to both terms in the three-term polynomial.


Rewritten, the new equation should look similar to: (ay)(bx^2) + (ay)(cx) + (ay)(dy)

Example: (2y)(3x^2 + 4x + 5y) = (2y)(3x^2) + (2y)(4x) + (2y)(5y)

, The constants refer to the numerical digits in the problem. These are multiplied as they usually would be according to the standard times table.


Again, for this step you are multiplying a, b, c, and d together.
Example: (2y)(3x^2) + (2y)(4x) + (2y)(5y) = 6(y)(x^2) + 8(y)(x) + 10(y)(y)

, The variables refer to the letters in the equation. When you multiply these variables, different variables will simply be combined together. When you multiply a variable by a like variable, though, you raise the power of the variable.


So multiply the the x and y portions of the equation.
Example: 6(y)(x^2) + 8(y)(x) + 10(y)(y) = 6yx^2 + 8xy + 10y^2

, Due to the single-term monomial at the beginning of this equation, you don't need to combine like terms.


When finished, the final answer should be: abyx^2 + acxy + ady^2

Example substituting sample values for constants: 6yx^2 + 8xy + 10y^2

Canonical form requires the denominator to be a whole number (or a polynomial if it contains indeterminate) if at all possible.,
Now the denominator is rationalized, but the numerator is a mess.,
If the denominator is a negative integer, then multiply numerator and denominator by -1 to make it positive.

",How to Simplify Radical Expressions7,"


If the denominator consists of a single term under a radical, such as /sqrt(5), then multiply numerator and denominator by that radical to get *sqrt(5)/sqrt(5)*sqrt(5) = *sqrt(5)/5.

For cube or higher roots, multiply by the appropriate power of the radical to make the denominator rational. If the denominator was cbrt(5), then multiply numerator and denominator by cbrt(5)^2.


If the denominator consists of a sum or difference of square roots such as sqrt(2) + sqrt(6), then multiply numerator and denominator by its conjugate, the same expression with the opposite operator. Thus /(sqrt(2) + sqrt(6)) = (sqrt(2)-sqrt(6))/(sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))(sqrt(2)-sqrt(6)). Then use the difference of squares identity to rationalize the denominator, simplifying (sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))(sqrt(2)-sqrt(6)) = sqrt(2)^2 - sqrt(6)^2 = 2-6 = -4.

This works for denominators like 5 + sqrt(3) too since every whole number is a square root of some other whole number. This works for a sum of square roots like sqrt(5)-sqrt(6)+sqrt(7). If you group it as (sqrt(5)-sqrt(6))+sqrt(7) and multiply it by (sqrt(5)-sqrt(6))-sqrt(7), your answer won't be rational, but will be of the form a+b*sqrt(30) where a and b are rational. Then you can repeat the process with the conjugate of a+b*sqrt(30) and (a+b*sqrt(30))(a-b*sqrt(30)) is rational. In essence, if you can use this trick once to reduce the number of radical signs in the denominator, then you can use this trick repeatedly to eliminate all of them.
This even works for denominators containing higher roots like the 4th root of 3 plus the 7th root of 9. Just multiply numerator and denominator by the denominator's conjugate. Unfortunately, it is not immediately clear what the conjugate of that denominator is nor how to go about finding it. A good book on algebraic number theory will cover this, but I will not.



, You now have whatever you started with up there times the denominator's conjugate. Go ahead and expand that product like you would for a product of polynomials. See if anything cancels or simplifies and combine like terms if possible.

Remember that subtracted numbers are negative.",How to Multiply Binomials1," It will be impossible to solve the questions on your next test if you don't know what they are asking. Luckily, the terminology is not incredibly hard:



Terms: A term is simply a part of the equation being added or subtracted. It can be a constant, variable, or both. For example, in 12 + 13x + 4x2, the terms are 12, 13x, and 4x2.


Binomial: This is just a complicated way to say ""an expression with two terms,"" like x+3 or x4 - 3x.


Powers: this refers to an exponent on a term. For example, we could say that x2 is ""x to the second power.""
Any question asking you to ""Find the terms of two binomials (x+3)(x+2),"" ""find the product of two binomials,"" or ""expand the two binomials"" is asking you to multiply binomials.;
, FOIL is a simple guide for multiplying two binomials. FOIL stands for the order you need to multiply the parts of the binomials together: F is for First, O is for Outer, I is for Inner, and L is for Last. The names refer to the order in which the terms are written. Let's say we are multiplying the binomials (x+2) and (x+5). The terms would be:



First: x & x

Outer: x & 5

Inner: 2 & x

Last: 2 & 5

, This is the ""F"" of FOIL. In our example, (x+2)(x+5), the first terms are ""x"" and ""x."" Multiply these together and jot down the answer: ""x2.""



First Term: x * x = x2


, These are two outermost ""ends"" in our problem. So, in our example (x+2)(x+5), they would be ""x"" and ""5."" Together they make ""5x""



Outer Term: x * 5 = 5x

, The two numbers closest to the center will be your inner term. For (x+2)(x+5), this means you multiply ""2"" and ""x"" to get ""2x.""



Inner Term: 2 * x = 2x

, This does not mean the last two numbers, but rather the last number in each parentheses. So, for (x+2)(x+5), we multiply the ""2"" and the ""5"" to get ""10.""



Last Term: 2 * 5 = 10

, Combine the terms by adding them together to create a new, larger expression. From our previous example, we get the equation:


x2 + 5x + 2x + 10

, Like terms are parts of the equation that have the same variable and power. In our example, the terms 2x and 5x both share an x, and can be added together. No other terms are alike, so they stay put.



Final Answer: (x+2)(x+5) = x2 + 7x + 10


Advanced Note: To learn how like terms work, remember the basics of multiplication. 3 * 5, for example, means that you are adding three fives together to get 15 (5 + 5 + 5). In our equation, we have 5 * x ( x + x + x + x + x) and 2 * x (x + x). If we add all the ""x""s in the equation we get seven ""x""s, or 7x.

, When a number is being subtracted, it is the same as adding a negative number. If you forget to keep the minus sign throughout your calculations you will end up with the wrong answer. Take the example (x+3)(x-2):



First: x * x = x2


Outer: x * -2 = -2x


Inner: 3 * x = 3x

Last: 3 * -2 = -6


Add all terms together: x2 - 2x + 3x - 6

Simplify to final answer: x2 + x - 6

For example, if you are multiplying 2x−7{\displaystyle 2x-7} and 5x+3{\displaystyle 5x+3}, you would set up the problem like this:(2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}
;
, A binomial is an algebraic expression with two terms.The FOIL method does not work when multiplying trinomials, or a binomial by a trinomial.

A term is a single number or variable, such as 3{\displaystyle 3} or x{\displaystyle x}, or it could be a multiplied number and variable, such as 3x{\displaystyle 3x}.Read Multiply Polynomials for instructions on multiplying other types of polynomials.

For example, you could NOT multiply (2x−4)(3x2−2x+8){\displaystyle (2x-4)(3x^{2}-2x+8)} using the FOIL method, because the second expression is a trinomial, with three terms.

You could multiply (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, because both expressions are binomials, with two terms each.


, Most algebra problems will already be arranged this way, but if not, make sure the first term in each expression contains the variable, and the second term in each expression contains the coefficient.

Setting up the problem this way makes simplifying easier.

A coefficient is a number without a variable.

For example, you would change (2x−7)(3+5x){\displaystyle (2x-7)(3+5x)} to (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}.


, The F in FOIL stands for “first.”

Remember when multiplying a variable by itself, such as x×x{\displaystyle x\times x}, the result is a squared variable (x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}).

For example, if your problem is (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, you would first calculate:(2x)(5x){\displaystyle (2x)(5x)}=10x2{\displaystyle =10x^{2}}


, The O in FOIL stands for “outside,” or “outer.” The outside terms are the first term of the first expression, and the last term of the second expression.

Pay close attention to addition and subtraction. If the second binomial is a subtraction expression, that means in this step you will be multiplying a negative number.

For example, for the problem (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, you would next calculate:(2x)(3){\displaystyle (2x)(3)}=6x{\displaystyle =6x}


, The I in FOIL stands for “inside,” or “inner.” The inner terms are the last term of the first expression, and the first term of the second expression.

Pay close attention to addition and subtraction. If the first binomial is a subtraction expressions, that means in this step you will be multiplying a negative number.

For example, for the problem (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, you would next calculate:(−7)(5x){\displaystyle (-7)(5x)}=−35x{\displaystyle =-35x}


, The L in FOIL stands for “last.”

Pay close attention to addition and subtraction. If either binomial is a subtraction expression, that means in this step you will be multiplying a negative number.

For example, for the problem (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, you would next calculate:(−7)(3){\displaystyle (-7)(3)}=−21{\displaystyle =-21}


, To do this, write out the new terms you created during the FOIL process. You should have four new terms.

For example, after multiplying (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, your new expression is 10x2+6x−35x−21{\displaystyle 10x^{2}+6x-35x-21}.


, To do this, combine like terms. Usually you will have two terms with the  x{\displaystyle x} variable that need to be combined.

Pay close attention to positive and negative signs as you add or subtract.

For example, if your expression is 10x2+6x−35x−21{\displaystyle 10x^{2}+6x-35x-21}, you would simplify by combining 6x−35x{\displaystyle 6x-35x}. Thus, the expression simplifies to 10x2−29x−21{\displaystyle 10x^{2}-29x-21}

Make sure the linear equation is in the form y = mx + b.,
Plot the b number on the Y-axis.,
Convert m into a fraction.,
Start extending the line from b using slope, or rise over run.,
Continue extending the line, using a ruler and being sure to use the slope, m, as a guide.",How to Graph Linear Equations," This is called the y-intercept form, and it's probably the easiest form to use to graph linear equations. The values in the equation do not need to be whole numbers. Often you'll see an equation that looks like this: y = 1/4x + 5, where 1/4 is m and 5 is b.



m is called the ""slope,"" or sometimes ""gradient."" Slope is defined as rise over run, or the change in y over the change in x.







b is defined as the ""y-intercept."" The y-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the Y-axis.







x and y are both variables. You can solve for a specific value of x, for example, if you have a y point and know the m and b values. x, however, is never merely one value: its value changes as you go up or down the line.





;
, Your b is always going to be a rational number. Just whatever number b is, find its equivalent on the Y-axis, and put the number on that spot on the vertical axis.
For example, let's take the equation y = 1/4x + 5. Since the last number is b, we know that b equals 5. Go 5 points up on the Y-axis and mark the point. This is where your straight line will pass through the Y-axis.







, Often, the number in front of x is already a fraction, so you won't have to convert it. But if it isn't, convert it by simply placing the value of m over 1.


The first number (numerator) is the rise in rise over run. It's how far the line travels up, or vertically.






The second number (denominator) is the run in rise over run. It's how far the line travels to the side, or horizontally.






For example:
A 4/1 slope travels 4 points up for every 1 point over.
A -2/1 slope travels 2 points down for every 1 point over.
A 1/5 slope travels 1 points up for every 5 points over.



, Start at your b value: we know that the equation passes through this point. Extend the line by taking your slope and using its values to get points on the equation.


For example, using the illustration above, you can see that for every 1 point the line rises up, it travels 4 to the right. That's because the slope of the line is 1/4. You extend the line indefinitely along both sides, continuing to use rise over run to graph the line.
Whereas positive-value slopes travel upward, negative-value slopes travel downward. A slope of -1/4, for example, would travel down 1 point for every 4 points it travels to the right.

, Extend the line indefinitely and you're done graphing your linear equation. Pretty easy, isn't it?

You can use either form to graph a quadratic equation; the process for graphing each is slightly different. If you're doing a homework problem, you'll usually receive the problem in one of these two forms - in other words, you won't be able to choose, so it's best to understand both. The two forms of quadratic equation are:



Standard form. In this form, the quadratic equation is written as: f(x) = ax2 + bx + c where a, b, and c are real numbers and a is not equal to zero.

For example, two standard form quadratic equations are f(x) = x2 + 2x + 1 and f(x) = 9x2 + 10x -8.



Vertex form. In this form, the quadratic equation is written as: f(x) = a(x - h)2 + k where a, h, and k are real numbers and a does not equal zero. Vertex form is so named because h and k directly give you the vertex (central point) of your parabola at the point (h,k).

Two vertex form equations are f(x) = 9(x - 4)2 + 18 and -3(x - 5)2 + 1


To graph either of these types of equations, we need to first find the vertex of the parabola, which is the central point (h,k) at the ""tip"" of the curve. The coordinates of the vertex in standard form are given by: h = -b/2a and k = f(h), while in vertex form, h and k are specified in the equation.;
, To be able to solve a quadratic problem, the variables a, b, and c (or a, h, and k) usually need to be defined. An average algebra problem will give you a quadratic equation with the variables filled in, usually in standard form, but sometimes in vertex form.


For example, for the standard form equation f(x) = 2x2 +16x + 39, we have a = 2, b = 16, and c = 39.
For the vertex form equation f(x) = 4(x - 5)2 + 12, we have a = 4, h = 5, and k = 12.

, Remember that, for standard form equations, h = -b/2a.


In our standard form example (f(x) = 2x2 +16x + 39), h = -b/2a = -16/2(2). Solving, we find that h = -4.
In our vertex form example (f(x) = 4(x - 5)2 + 12), we know h = 5 without doing any math.

, For standard form equations, remember that k = f(h). In other words, you can find k by replacing every instance of x in your equation with the value you just found for h.


We have determined in our standard form example that h = -4. To find k, we solve our equation with our value for h replacing x:

k = 2(-4)2 + 16(-4) + 39.
k = 2(16) - 64 + 39.
k = 32 - 64 + 39 = 7



In our vertex form example, again, we know the value of k (which is 12) without having to do any math.

, The vertex of your parabola will be the point (h, k) - h specifies the x coordinate, while k specifies the y coordinate. The vertex is the central point in your parabola - either the very bottom of a ""U"" or the very top of an upside-down ""U."" Knowing the vertex is an essential part of graphing an accurate parabola - often, in schoolwork, specifying the vertex will be a required part of a question.


In our standard form example, our vertex will be at (-4,7). So, our parabola will peak 4 spaces to the left of 0 and 7 spaces above (0,0). We should plot this point on our graph, being sure to label coordinates.
In our vertex form example, our vertex is at (5,12). We should plot a point 5 spaces to the right and 12 spaces above (0,0).

, A parabola's axis of symmetry is the line running through its middle which divides it perfectly in half. Across this axis, the left side of the parabola will mirror the right side. For quadratics of the form ax2 + bx + c or a(x - h)2 + k, the axis is a line parallel to the y-axis (in other words, perfectly vertical) and passing through the vertex.


In the case of our standard form example, the axis is a line parallel to the y-axis and passing through the point (-4, 7). Though it's not part of the parabola itself, lightly marking this line on your graph can eventually help you see how the parabola curves symmetrically.

, After having figured out the vertex and axis of the parabola, we next need to know whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards. Luckily, this is easy. If ""a"" is positive, the parabola will open upwards, while if ""a"" is negative, the parabola will open downwards (i.e., it will be turned upside-down.)


For our standard form example (f(x) = 2x2 +16x + 39), we know we have a parabola opening upwards because, in our equation, a = 2 (positive).
For our vertex form example (f(x) = 4(x - 5)2 + 12), we know we have also have a parabola opening upwards because a = 4 (positive).

, Often, on schoolwork, you'll be asked to find a parabola's x-intercepts (which are either one or two points where the parabola meets the x axis). Even if you're not to find them, these two points can be invaluable for drawing an accurate parabola. However, not all parabolas have x-intercepts. If your parabola has a vertex opens upward and has a vertex above the x axis or if it opens downward and has a vertex below the x axis, it won't have any x intercepts. Otherwise, solve for your x intercepts with one of the following methods:


Simply set f(x) = 0 and solve the equation. This method may work for simple quadratic equations, especially in vertex form, but will prove exceedingly difficult for more complicated ones. See below for an example

f(x) = 4(x - 12)2 - 4
0 = 4(x - 12)2 - 4
4 = 4(x - 12)2

1 = (x - 12)2

SqRt(1) = (x - 12)
+/- 1 = x -12. x = 11 and 13 are the parabola's x-intercepts.



Factor your equation. Some equations in the ax2 + bx + c form can be easily factored into the form (dx + e)(fx +g), where dx × fx = ax2, (dx × g + fx × e) = bx, and e × g = c. In this case, your x intercepts are the values for x which make either term in parentheses = 0. For example:

x2 + 2x + 1
= (x + 1)(x + 1)
In this case, your only x intercept is -1 because setting x equal to -1 will make either of the factored terms in parentheses equal 0.


Use the quadratic formula. If you can't easily solve for your x intercepts or factor your equation, use a special equation called the quadratic formula designed for this very purpose. If it isn't already, get your equation into the form ax2 + bx + c, then plug a, b, and c into the formula x = (-b +/- SqRt(b2 - 4ac))/2a. Note that this often gives you two answers for x, which is OK - this just means your parabola has two x intercepts. See below for an example:

-5x2 + 1x + 10 gets plugged into the quadratic formula as follows:
x = (-1 +/- SqRt(12 - 4(-5)(10)))/2(-5)
x = (-1 +/- SqRt(1 + 200))/-10
x = (-1 +/- SqRt(201))/-10
x = (-1 +/- 14.18)/-10
x = (13.18/-10) and (-15.18/-10). The parabola's x intercepts are at approximately x = -1.318 and 1.518

Our previous standard form example, 2x2 + 16x + 39 gets plugged into the quadratic formula as follows:
x = (-16 +/- SqRt(162 - 4(2)(39)))/2(2)
x = (-16 +/- SqRt(256 - 312))/4
x = (-16 +/- SqRt(-56)/-10
Because finding the square root of a negative number is impossible, we know that no x intercepts exist for this particular parabola.



, Though it's often not necessary to find an equation's y intercept (the point at which the parabola passes through the y axis), you may eventually be required to, especially if you're in school. This process is fairly easy - just set x = 0, then solve your equation for f(x) or y, which gives you the y value at which your parabola passes through the y axis. Unlike x intercepts, standard parabolas can only have one y intercept. Note - for standard form equations, the y intercept is at y = c.


For example, we know our quadratic equation 2x2 + 16x + 39 has a y intercept at y = 39, but it can also be found as follows:

f(x) = 2x2 + 16x + 39
f(x) = 2(0)2 + 16(0) + 39
f(x) = 39. The parabola's y intercept is at y = 39. As noted above, the y intercept is at y = c.


Our vertex form equation 4(x - 5)2 + 12 has a y intercept that can be found as follows:

f(x) = 4(x - 5)2 + 12
f(x) = 4(0 - 5)2 + 12
f(x) = 4(-5)2 + 12
f(x) = 4(25) + 12
f(x) = 112. The parabola's y intercept is at y = 112.




, You should now have a vertex, direction, x intercept(s), and, possibly, a y intercept for your equation. At this point, you can either attempt to draw your parabola using the points you have as a guideline, or you can find more points to ""fill out"" your parabola so that the curve you draw is more accurate. The easiest way to do this is simply to plug in a few x values on either side of your vertex, then plot these points using the y values you obtain. Often, teachers will require you to obtain a certain number of points before you draw your parabola.


Let's revisit the equation x2 + 2x + 1. We already know its only x intercept is at x = -1. Because it only touches the x intercept at one point, we can infer that its vertex is its x intercept, which means its vertex is (-1,0). We effectively only have one point for this parabola - not nearly enough to draw a good parabola. Let's find a few more to ensure we draw an accurate graph.

Let's find the y values for the following x values: 0, 1, -2, and -3.
For 0: f(x) = (0)2 + 2(0) + 1 = 1. Our point is (0,1).

For 1: f(x) = (1)2 + 2(1) + 1 = 4. Our point is (1,4).

For -2: f(x) = (-2)2 + 2(-2) + 1 = 1. Our point is (-2,1).

For -3: f(x) = (-3)2 + 2(-3) + 1 = 4. Our point is (-3,4).

Plot these points to the graph and draw your U-shaped curve. Note that the parabola is perfectly symmetrical - when your points on one side of the parabola lie on whole numbers, you can usually save yourself some work by simply reflecting a given point across the parabola's axis of symmetry to find the corresponding point on the other side of the parabola.

Recognize linear functions as simple, easily-graphed lines, like y=2x+5{\displaystyle y=2x+5}.,
Use the constant to mark your y-intercept.,
Find the slope of your line with the number right before the variable.,
Break the slope into a fraction.,
Starting at your y-intercept, follow your ""rise"" and ""run"" to graph more points.,
Use a ruler to connect your dots and graph your linear function.",How to Graph a Function1," There is one variable and one constant, written as F(x)ory=a+bx{\displaystyle F(x)ory=a+bx} in a linear function, with no exponents, radicals, etc. If you've got a simple equation like this, then graphing the function is easy. Other examples of linear functions include:


F(n)=4−2n{\displaystyle F(n)=4-2n}


y=3t−120{\displaystyle y=3t-120}


F(x)=23x+3{\displaystyle F(x)={\frac {2}{3}}x+3};
, The y-intercept is where the function crosses the y-axis on your graph. In other words, it is the point where x=0{\displaystyle x=0}. So, to find it, you simply set x to zero, leaving the constant in the equation alone. For the earlier example, y=2x+5{\displaystyle y=2x+5}, your y-intercept is 5, or the point (0,5). On your graph, mark this spot with a dot.
, In your example, y=2x+5{\displaystyle y=2x+5}, the slope is ""2."" That is because 2 is right before the variable in the equation, the ""x."" Slope is how steep a line is, or how high the line goes before going to the right or left. Bigger slopes mean steeper lines.
, Slope is about steepness, and steepness is simply the difference between movement up and down and movement left and right. Slope is a fraction of rise over run. How much does the line ""rise"" (go up) before it ""runs"" (goes to the side)? For the example, the slope of ""2"" could be read as 2up1over{\displaystyle {\frac {2up}{1over}}}.

If the slope is negative, that means the line goes down as you move to the right.


, Once you know your slope, use it to plot out your linear function. Start at your y-intercept, here (0,5), and then move up 2, over 1. Mark this point (1,7) as well. Find 1-2 more points to create an outline of your line.
, To prevent mistakes or rough graphs, find and connect at least three separate points, though two will do in a pinch. This is the graph of your linear equation!

Make sure your sentence expresses a complete thought.,
Use correct punctuation.,
Include a subject and verb.",How to Write a Sentence1," A sentence is a group of words that together express a complete idea that has meaning. When writing, it is a good idea to read your sentences aloud and ask yourself, ""Does this sentence make sense? Does it express a complete idea?""For example, ""Eggs near river"" is not a sentence because it does not express a complete idea.
""I ate eggs near a river yesterday"" is a sentence because it has a clear, complete meaning.
""Because I ate eggs"" is a sentence fragment because it is incomplete; ""because"" sets the reader up for a cause-and-effect, but there is no effect here.
""Because I ate eggs near a river, I got wet"" is a sentence because it completes the cause-and-effect established by the word ""because."";
, Sentences in English begin with a capital letter and end with a punctuation mark. Proper terminal (end) punctuation includes a period (.), question mark (?) or exclamation mark (!). Punctuation marks inform the reader when your sentence is finished, as well as the tone of voice they should use when reading.


An exclamation mark indicates surprise, whereas a question mark indicates confusion or questioning.

, A subject is a person or thing that is being discussed in the sentence. The verb is the action word, which describes what the subject is doing.


For example, in the sentence ""I ate eggs"", ""I"" is the subject and ""ate"" is the verb. "

Distribute each term.,
Multiply each of the constants.,
Multiply each of the variables.,
Combine like terms and write your final answer.",How to Multiply Polynomials5," Each has two three-term polynomials with either a plus sign or a minus sign between terms.


A polynomial problem involving monomial and two binomials will look something like: (ax^2 + bx + c) * (dy^2 + ey + f)

Example: (2x^2 + 3x + 4)(5y^2 + 6y + 7)
Note that the same practices used to multiply two three-term polynomials should also be applied to polynomials with four or more terms.

,


The second polynomial refers to the (dy^2 + ey + f) portion of the equation.
Example: (5y^2 + 6y + 7)

, Each piece of the first polynomial should be broken up and distributed to the second polynomial as a whole.


At this point, the equation is something along the lines of: (ax^2)(dy^2 + ey + f) + (bx)(dy^2 + ey + f) + (c)(dy^2 + ey + f)

Example: (2x^2)(5y^2 + 6y + 7) + (3x)(5y^2 + 6y + 7) + (4)(5y^2 + 6y + 7)

, Distribute each newly single-term polynomial over all of the terms in the remaining three-term polynomial.


Essentially, the equation at this point is something along the lines of: (ax^2)(dy^2) + (ax^2)(ey) + (ax^2)(f) + (bx)(dy^2) + (bx)(ey) + (bx)(f) + (c)(dy^2) + (c)(ey) + (c)(f)

Example: (2x^2)(5y^2) + (2x^2)(6y) + (2x^2)(7) + (3x)(5y^2) + (3x)(6y) + (3x)(7) + (4)(5y^2) + (4)(6y) + (4)(7)

, The constants refer to the numerical digits in the problem. These are multiplied as they usually would be according to the standard times table.


In other words, during this part of the problem, you are multiplying a, b, c, d, e and f portions.
Example: 10(x^2)(y^2) + 12(x^2)(y) + 14(x^2) + 15(x)(y^2) + 18(x)(y) + 21(x) + 20(y^2) + 24(y) + 28

, The variables refer to the letters in the equation. When you multiply these variables, different variables will simply be combined together. When you multiply a variable by a like variable, though, you raise that variable by another power.


In other words, you are multiplying the the x and y portions of the equation.
Example: 10x^2y^2 + 12x^2y + 14x^2 + 15xy^2 + 18xy + 21x + 20y^2 + 24y + 28

, This type of problem is complex enough to potentially produce like terms, meaning two or more end terms that share the same ending variable. If this happens, you should add or subtract the like terms as needed to determine your final answer. If not, no additional addition or subtraction is needed.


Example: 10x^2y^2 + 12x^2y + 14x^2 + 15xy^2 + 18xy + 21x + 20y^2 + 24y + 28

Add together the two answers from multiplication.,
Simplify the equation to get your final answer.,
Always use distribution to tackle larger multiplication problems.",How to Multiply Binomials2," Take the example (x+4)(x+1)(x+3). We need to multiply the binomials one at a time, so multiply the any two by either FOIL or distribution of terms. Multiplying the first two, (x+4) and (x+1) with FOIL would look like this:



First: x*x = x2


Outer: 1*x = x

Inner: 4*x = 4x

Last: 1*4 = 4

Combine terms: x2 + x + 4x + 4
(x+4)(x+1) = x2 + 5x +4


, Now that part of the equation has be multiplied you can handle the leftover binomial. In the example, (x+4)(x+1)(x+3), the leftover term was (x+3). Put it back along with the new equation, giving you: (x+3)(x2 + 5x + 4).

, This is distribution of terms. So, for the equation (x+3)(x2 + 5x + 4), you need to multiply the first x by the three parts of the second parenthesis, ""x2,"" ""5x,"" and ""4.""


(x * x2) + (x * 5x) + (x * 4) = x3 + 5x2 + 4x

Write this answer down and save it for later.

, Take the equation, (x+3)(x2 + 5x + 4). Now, multiply the second part of the binomial by all three parts in the other parentheses, ""x2,"" ""5x,"" and ""4.""


(3 * x2) + (3 * 5x) + (3 * 4) = 3x2 + 15x + 12

Write this answer down next to the first answer.

, You need to combine the answers from the previous two steps, as they make up the two parts of your final answer.


x3 + 5x2 + 4x + 3x2 + 15x + 12

, Any ""like"" terms, terms that share the same variable and power (like 5x2 and 3x2), can be added together to make your answer simpler.


5x2 and 3x2 become 8x2

4x and 15x become 19x
(x+4)(x+1)(x+3) = x3 + 8x2 + 19x + 12


, Since you can use distribution of terms to multiply equations of any length, you now have the tools needed to solve larger problems, like (x+1)(x+2)(x+3). Multiply any two binomials together using either distribution of terms or FOIL, then use the distribution of terms to multiply the final binomial to the first two. In the following example, we FOIL (x+1)(x+2), then distribute the terms with (x+3) to get the final answer:


(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = (x+1)(x+2) * (x+3)
(x+1)(x+2) = x2 + 3x + 2
(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = (x2 + 3: + 2) * (x+3)
(x2 + 3x + 2) * (x+3) = x3 + 3x2 + 2x + 3x2 + 9x + 6

Simplify to final answer: x3 + 6x2 + 11x + 6

Know how to set up ""general formulas."",
Know that squared binomials can be rewritten.,
Use FOIL to solve the new equation.,
Use the general equation a2 + 2ab + b2 to solve your problems.,
Remember to insert the entire term into the general equation.",How to Multiply Binomials3," General formulas allow you to simply plug in your numbers instead of calculating FOIL every time. Binomials that are raised to the second power, like (x+2)2, or the third power, like (4y+12)3, can be fit into a preexisting formula easily, making solving fast and easy. To find the general formula, we replace all of the numbers with variables. Then, at the end, we can plug our numbers back in to get our answer. Start with the equation (a + b)2, where:



a stands for the variable term (ie. 4y - 1, 2x2 + 3, etc.) If there is no number, then a = 1, since 1 * x = x.

b stands for the constant being added or subtracted (ie. x + 10, t - 12).

, (a + b)2 may look more complicated than our earlier example, but remember that squaring a number is just multiplying it by itself. Thus, we can rewrite the equation to look more familiar:


(a + b)2 = (a + b)(a + b)

, If we use foil on this equation we'll get a general formula that looks like the solution to any binomial multiplication. Remember that in multiplication, the order you multiple does not matter


Rewrite as (a+b)(a+b).

First: a * a = a2


Inner: b * a = ba

Outer: a * b = ab

Last: b * b = b2.

Add the new terms: a2 + ba + ab + b2


Combine like terms: a2 + 2ab + b2


Advanced Note: Exponents and radicals are considered to be hyper-3 operations, while multiplication and division are hyper-2. This means that properties of multiplication and division do not work for exponents. (a+b)2 does not equal to a2 + b2. This is a very common mistake among people.

, Let's take equation (x+2)2. Instead of doing FOIL all over again, we can plug in the first term for ""a"" and the second term for ""b"",


General Equation: a2 + 2ab + b2

a = x, b = 2
x2 + (2 * x * 2) + 22


Final Answer: x2 + 4x + 4.
You can always check your work by performing FOIL on the original equation, (x+2)(x+2). You will get the same answer every time if done correctly.
If a term is subtracted, you still have to keep it negative in the general equation.

, Given the binomial (2x+3)2, you must remember that a = 2x, not simply a = 2. When you have complex terms, you need to remember that both the 2 and the x are squared.


General equation: a2 + 2ab + b2

Substitute for a and b: (2x)2 + 2(2x)(3) + 32

Square every term: (22)(x2) + 14x + 32


Simplify to final answer: 4x2 + 14x + 9

Quadratic functions


Rational functions


Logarithmic functions


Graphing inequalities (not functions, but still useful information).


, Zeros, also called x-intercepts, are the points where the graph crosses the horizontal line on the graph. While not all graphs even have zeros, most do, and it is the first step you should take to get everything on track. To find zeros, simply the entire function to zero and solve. For example:


F(x)=2x2−18{\displaystyle F(x)=2x^{2}-18}


Set F(x) equal to zero: 0=2x2−18{\displaystyle 0=2x^{2}-18}


Solve: 0=2x2−18{\displaystyle 0=2x^{2}-18}


18=2x2{\displaystyle 18=2x^{2}}


9=x2{\displaystyle 9=x^{2}}


x=3,−3{\displaystyle x=3,-3}, This is usually points where the graph does not exist, like where you are dividing by zero. If your equation has a variable in a fraction, like y=14−x2{\displaystyle y={\frac {1}{4-x^{2}}}}, start by setting the bottom of the fraction to zero. Any places where it equals zero can be dotted off (in this example, a dotted line at x=2 and x=-2), since you cannot ever divided by zero. Fractions, however, are not the only places you can find asymptotes. Usually, all you need is some common sense:

Some squared functions, like F(n)=n2{\displaystyle F(n)=n^{2}} can never be negative. Thus there is an asymptote at 0.

Unless you're working with imaginary numbers, you cannot have −1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {-1}}}For equations with complex exponents, you may have many asymptotes.


, Simply pick a few values for x and solve the function. Then graph the points on your graph. The more complicated the graph, the more points you'll need. In general, -1, 0, and 1 are the easiest points to get, though you'll want 2-3 more on either side of zero to get a good graph.For the equation y=5x2+6{\displaystyle y=5x^{2}+6}, you might plug in -1,0,1, -2, 2, -10, and 10. This gives you a nice range of numbers to compare.

Be smart selecting numbers. In the example, you'll quickly realize that having a negative sign doesn't matter -- you can stop testing -10, for example, because it will be the same as 10.


, This gives you an idea of the general direction of a function, usually as a vertical asymptote. For example -- you know that eventually, y=x2{\displaystyle y=x^{2}} gets really, really big. Just one additional ""x"" (one million vs. one million and one) makes y much bigger. There are a few ways to test end behavior, including:

Plug in 2-4 large values of x, half negative and half positive, and plot the points.

What happens if you plugged in ""infinity"" for one variable? Does the function get infinitely bigger or smaller?

If the degrees are the same in a fraction, like F(x)=x3−2x3+4{\displaystyle F(x)={\frac {x^{3}}{-2x^{3}+4}}}, simply divide the first two coefficients (1−2{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{-2}}} to get your ending asymptote (-.5).If the degrees are different in a fraction, you must divide the equation in the numerator by the equation in denominator by Polynomial Long Division.


, Once you have 5-6 points, asymptotes, and a general idea of end behavior, plug it all in to get an estimated version of the graph.
, Graphing calculators are powerful pocket computers that can give exact graphs for any equation. They allow you to search exact points, find slope lines, and visualize difficult equations with ease. Simply input the exact equation into the graphing section (usually a button labeled ""F(x) = "") and hit graph to see your function at work.

Define a simple sentence.,
Make simple sentences a bit more informative.,
Try writing a simple sentence.,
Pay attention to singular and plural subjects and verbs.",How to Write a Sentence2," The simple sentence is the most basic of the sentences. It includes a subject, a verb, and it expresses a complete thought. This is known as an independent clause, because it can stand on its own.Here is an example: ""Janet writes.""


In the above example, the subject is ""Janet"". She is the person being discussed.
""Writes"" is the verb. It is the action that the subject (Janet) is doing.
Remember, the subject can be a person (I or Janet), place (Baltimore or Bathroom), thing (Chocolate), or idea (Jealousy). , You can add direct objects and indirect objects to simple sentences to add more information.Here is an example: ""Janet writes romance novels.""


The phrase ""romance novels"" is the direct object here: they are what Janet writes, so they receive the action of the verb.
Simple sentences can also have compound subjects or compound verbs.

A compound subject could look like this: ""Janet and Sujata write romance novels."" ""Janet and Sujata"" is a compound subject here, since there are two people doing the action.
A compound verb could look like this: ""Janet writes and publishes romance novels."" Janet is doing two things here, writing and publishing, so this is a compound verb.



, When you begin to write your own simple sentence, begin with the subject. Think about what the sentence is going to be about. Next, choose your verb. To do this, think about what the subject of your sentence is doing. Is the subject walking, running, reading, sitting, cooking, or something else?

, When choosing your subject and verb, make sure that the two words agree in number. The rule is that a singular subject needs a singular verb, and plural subjects need plural verbs. A singular subject and verb looks like this: ""My son is a doctor"".
A plural subject and verb looks like this: ""My sons are doctors"".

Define a compound sentence.,
Try writing a compound sentence.,
Pay attention to meaning when writing a compound sentence.",How to Write a Sentence3," A compound sentence is made up of two simple sentences. The two simple sentences are joined by a comma (,) followed by one of seven words called coordinating conjunctions. The seven coordinating conjunctions are: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. To help you remember, use the mnemonic FANBOYS. Here are some examples of compound sentences. Note the use of the coordinating conjunction.


He was happy, for he just passed his exam.
The road was long, and we could not see the end.
She was not wrong, nor was she entirely right.
She would have fallen, but Sally helped support her.
Deon is smart, or Deon is lucky.
I am eating steak, yet I really wanted lamb.
Jack was wet, so he changed his clothes.

, Begin by choosing a subject and a verb for the first part of the sentence, the same way you did while writing a simple sentence. Next, choose the appropriate coordinating conjunction based upon the meaning of the sentence. Finally, choose a related subject and verb for the second part of the compound sentence.


You may want to use ""and"" to express a continuing thought or meaning, or you can use ""but"" as part of an explanation. There are many possibilities.

, By writing compound sentences, you can greatly expand on the meaning of the sentence when compared to a simple sentence. Be sure to use the second part of the sentence to expand or elaborate upon the thought expressed in the first part.


Be careful not to overuse compound sentences, particularly those that use ""and."" They do not always indicate a clear relationship and may seem cluttered."

Define a complex sentence.,
Join dependent clauses with a simple sentence.,
Try writing a complex sentence.,
Use complex sentences to better explain your thoughts.,
Create periodic sentences.",How to Write a Sentence4," A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and what is known as a dependent clause. A dependent clause is a group of words that contain a subject and a verb but do not express a complete thought by themselves. In other words, a dependent clause is not a simple sentence by itself.There are several words, called subordinating conjunctions, that indicate the beginning of a dependent clause.


Examples of subordinating conjunctions are as follows: after, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, even though, if, in order to, since, though, unless, until, whatever, when, whenever, whether, and while. Examples of dependent clauses by themselves are as follows: ""Because Yao shares his books"", ""Before eating my breakfast"" and ""Until I have more money"".

, Notice that while the above examples of dependent clauses have a subject and verb, they do not express a complete thought. In order to express a complete thought, the dependent clause needs to be joined with a simple sentence. Here are some examples.


Because Yao shares his books, he is kind. -or- Yao is kind because he shares his books.
Before eating my breakfast, I have to walk my dog. -or- I have to walk my dog before eating breakfast.
Until I have more money, I won't be able to buy an engagement ring. -or- I won't be able to buy an engagement ring until I have more money.

, When writing a complex sentence, you need to combine one simple sentence with a dependent clause. Make sure you use the dependent clause to clarify what is happening in the simple sentence.

, Complex sentences are useful because they often show a clear and specific relationship between the parts of the sentence. For instance, ""before"" tells readers that the dog needs to be walked prior to eating breakfast; ""because"" helps to explain why Yao is kind.

, Periodic sentences begin with the dependent clause and end with an independent clause. You do not provide a comma before the dependent clause if the independent clause comes first. Commas are only used if the dependent clause is introducing the simple sentence.Periodic sentences are great for building up tension or interest, since the the dependent clause ""builds up"" to the meaning or complete thought at the end.
For example: ""As I sat waiting in traffic, I realized I would be late for class.""

"
"
Watch for sentence fragments.,
Avoid run-ons.,
Keep watch for comma splices.,
Stay parallel.,
Vary your sentence structure.",How to Write a Sentence5," Sentence fragments happen when a dependent clause is made to stand on its own. They can also happen if a sentence lacks a subject or a verb.Here are some examples of sentence fragments:


""Although I was late to the party."" The ""although"" here is what's known as a subordinating conjunction, and it creates a subordinate clause, which cannot stand on its own.This is a fragment because it does not provide a complete thought; there's meaning here that isn't explained (Although...what?).
""Hit something with my car."" While you might use type of language in everyday speech, it's technically a fragment because it lacks a subject (who did the hitting). You could correct it as ""I hit something with my car.""

, Run-on, or fused, sentences happen when you include more than one independent clause (a clause with a subject and verb that expresses a complete idea) in your sentence.


For example, this is a run-on sentence: ""I went to the store I got bread and milk."" Each of the parts, I went to the store and I got bread and milk have a subject and verb, and each expresses a clear, complete idea.
You can fix run-ons in a few ways. You can separate the clauses with a semicolon, or you can use a comma and a conjunction, or you can break the clauses up into separate sentences:


I went to the store; I got bread and milk. The semi-colon shows the close relationship between clauses here.

I went to the store, and I got bread and milk. This conjunction shows less of a close relationship than the semi-colon, but it communicates that they're connected ideas.

I went to the store. I got bread and milk. This full break indicates that the ideas aren't all that related.



, Comma splices are related to run-on sentences because they both improperly connect independent clauses. Comma splices are very common errors, but are often considered major errors by teachers.For example, this is a comma splice: ""I texted my friend, she didn't reply.""

Both of these are independent clauses, because they have subjects and verbs and express a complete thought.


You can fix comma splices the same ways you fix run-on sentences:

With a semi-colon: ""I texted my friend; she didn't reply.""
With a comma and coordinating conjunction: ""I texted my friend, but she didn't reply.""
By splitting into two sentences: ""I texted my friend. She didn't reply.""



, If you have a fairly complex sentence, it can be easy to lose track of the nouns or verbs in it. However, if you don't maintain parallel structure, your sentences become difficult to read and lose a lot of their impact.For example, this sentence lacks parallel structure: ""I enjoy fishing, swimming, and hike.""

Instead, keep all the verbs in the same form: ""I enjoy fishing, swimming, and hiking.""


This can be a particular problem if you have a lot of clauses in your sentence. For example: ""My teacher told me that I should submit my essay on time, that I should proofread it carefully before turning it in, and to not email her the night before.""

Instead, keep all the clauses in the same structure: ""My teacher told me that I should submit my essay on time, that I should proofread it carefully before turning it in, and that I should not email her the night before.""



, A common mistake, especially with beginning writers or writers in a language they are still learning, is to write all your sentences in the same basic structure. Varying your sentences makes your writing read more smoothly and is more pleasant for the reader.For example, consider how repetitive this is: ""I saw a zombie. I started to run. I tripped over a rock. I got up again. I kept running."" All of the sentences have the same word order (subject-verb-direct object) and begin with the same subject.
Now look at a spiced-up version: ""I saw a zombie and started to run, but I tripped over a rock. Panicked, I picked up myself up and kept running.""

",How to Graph Linear Equations Using the Intercepts Method," Identify both. For the sake of clarity, let the independent be x and the dependent be y.;
,, This will generate a coordinate for your y-intercept. First, substitute x to zero. Then, subtract the product from both sides of the equation. Note that the operation you will perform with both sides depends on the sign of your number. In this case the number is zero so we will use its opposite, subtraction. After that, divide three from both sides. And, VOILA! You have the answer.

, (x,y) Since x=0, your coordinate pair will be similar to: (0,y).

Know what the formula is used for.,
Write down the formula.,
Solve for the positive value.,
Solve for the negative value.",How to Memorize the Quadratic Formula1," The formula is used to find the value of x{\displaystyle x} in a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation takes the form of ax2+bx+c=0{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0}.Remember that a quadratic equation will have two roots (two values for x{\displaystyle x}). Using the quadratic formula will provide you with these roots.

, The formula is x=−b±b2−4ac2a{\displaystyle x={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}}, where the variables a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c} are derived from the coefficients in the quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0}. Plug the values of these variables into the formula.

For example, in the equation 4x2+6x+2=0{\displaystyle 4x^{2}+6x+2=0}:a=4{\displaystyle a=4}b=6{\displaystyle b=6}c=2{\displaystyle c=2}

Plugging these values into the equation: x=−6±62−4(4)(2)2(4){\displaystyle x={\frac {-6\pm {\sqrt {6^{2}-4(4)(2)}}}{2(4)}}}


, This means solving the equation x=−b+b2−4ac2a{\displaystyle x={\frac {-b+{\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}}. This will give you the first root of the equation.

For example:x=−6+62−4(4)(2)2(4){\displaystyle x={\frac {-6+{\sqrt {6^{2}-4(4)(2)}}}{2(4)}}}x=−6+62−328{\displaystyle x={\frac {-6+{\sqrt {6^{2}-32}}}{8}}}x=−6+36−328{\displaystyle x={\frac {-6+{\sqrt {36-32}}}{8}}}x=−6+48{\displaystyle x={\frac {-6+{\sqrt {4}}}{8}}}x=−6+28{\displaystyle x={\frac {-6+2}{8}}}x=−48{\displaystyle x={\frac {-4}{8}}}x=−12{\displaystyle x={\frac {-1}{2}}}So, the first root of the equation is x=−12{\displaystyle x={\frac {-1}{2}}}


, This means solving the equation x=−b−b2−4ac2a{\displaystyle x={\frac {-b-{\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}}. This will give you the first root of the equation.

For example:x=−6−62−4(4)(2)2(4){\displaystyle x={\frac {-6-{\sqrt {6^{2}-4(4)(2)}}}{2(4)}}}x=−6−62−328{\displaystyle x={\frac {-6-{\sqrt {6^{2}-32}}}{8}}}x=−6−36−328{\displaystyle x={\frac {-6-{\sqrt {36-32}}}{8}}}x=−6−48{\displaystyle x={\frac {-6-{\sqrt {4}}}{8}}}x=−6−28{\displaystyle x={\frac {-6-2}{8}}}x=−88{\displaystyle x={\frac {-8}{8}}}x=−1{\displaystyle x=-1}So, the first root of the equation is x=−1{\displaystyle x=-1}

Realize that ""take with me/you"" and ""bring with me/you"" do not have the same meaning.,
Identify the direction of motion.,
Think before you speak.,
Correct yourself when you make a mistake.,
Do not become discouraged.",How to Use Take With You and Bring With You," Chances are you already know this, but if not it is an important first step. Even if you do recognize the differences at first glance, your subconscious mind may make these mistakes regardless.;
, Both of these phrases refer to a person carrying an object to a location. The key to using them correctly is identifying if the motion will be to the speaker's location or not.


If the motion will be towards the speaker then the speaker should use bring. For example, while calling someone from your house about an upcoming visit: ""Please bring the book you want to show me when you come to my house tomorrow.""
If the motion will be to someplace other than the speaker's current location use the work ""take."" For example, when calling a friend about a visit you have planned at their house tomorrow: ""Should I take the book I want to show you with me to your house tomorrow?"" Also when the location is neither the speaker's or the listener's current location, use ""take"". For example: ""Do you think I should take a jacket when we go hiking tomorrow?""

, If you are interested in correcting your own usage then try to think a bit before you speak. This has other benefits as well.

, If you do this you will remember better each successive time.

, It will take time to change your habits, so do not be angry with yourself if you are slow to change.

Understand the role of indefinite articles in the English language.,
Memorize the rule.,
Say the word out loud.,
Don’t forget that acronyms work in the same way.,
Remember that when a letter begins with “h” it may require “an.” Words that begin with “H” can be confusing when you’re trying to decide whether to use “a” or “an.” This is when it becomes important to remember that you are looking for a vowel ‘’’sound’’’ not just a letter that is a vowel.,
Remember that “U” doesn’t always make a “U” sound.",How to Use the Word An," In the English language there are only two indefinite articles: “a” and “an.” The two words have the exact same meaning. If you say “I want to read an book” or “I want to read a book,” the meaning is exactly the same. However, the first one is not grammatically correct.There are many situations which might require the use of an indefinite article. For example:


If you are referring to something/someone for the first time (such as “I’ve found a good job” or “She has a daughter.”)
When you are naming someone as a part of a specific group (“Jenny is a doctor” or “Robert is an engineer.”)
When referring to something non-specific (“I can come over on a Thursday.”)
When talking about an example of something (“The elephant has a long trunk” or “That is an enormous ball.”)
When talking about a singular object (“I would like an egg” or “I need a pound of flour.”);
, If a word starts with a vowel sound then you should use the indefinite article “an” before it. On the other hand, if a word starts with a consonant sound you should use the indefinite article “a” before it.Generally, this will mean that if the word starts with a vowel you should use “an,” but it is important to remember that this is not true all of the time. This is because the rule is focused on the sound, and not the actual letter that the word starts with.
For example, although “one-day event” begins with a vowel (“O”) you would not say, “an one-day event.” In this case, the first word makes a consonant sound, and you would say, “a one-day event.” If you think about it, the “O” in one does not make an “O” sound, but it actually makes a “W” sound because the word “one” is actually pronounced more like, “won.”
In the alphabet, there are 6 vowels. These include: “A,” “E,” “I,” “O,” “U,” and sometimes “Y.” “Y” is only used as a vowel in some words such as “gym” and “baby,” but acts as a consonant in other words such as “young” and “beyond.” When you pronounce a vowel, the air flows freely through your mouth without having to be interrupted by your tongue or throat to pronounce it.
All the other letters in the alphabet are considered consonants, which means that you have to interrupt the flow of air through your mouth when you pronounce it. For example, you have to use your tongue to say the “L” in “limit,” you use your tongue to stop the flow of air when you pronounce the “H” in “hurt.”, If you are a native English speaker, saying the phrase out loud can help you decide whether you should use “an” or “a.” Usually, when you say it out loud, it will sound strange to you if you have chosen the wrong one.


For example, if you aren’t sure whether to say “a apple” or “an apple” say them both out loud. You will probably realize that “a apple” sounds strange to you, and it may even feel a bit weird to say it that way. Then it becomes clear to you that “an apple” is the right choice.
Even if you are not a native speaker of English, saying the word out loud can be helpful in figuring out whether the word begins with a vowel sound. If the beginning of the word flows freely through your mouth without the need to use your tongue or throat to stop the air, then it is probably a vowel sound. For example, if you say “owl” out loud you will see that the “ow” sound flows very freely and is not stopped at any point.

, Many people think that acronyms are an exception to the rule, but they actually work in exactly the same way. If the acronym starts with a vowel sound when you sound it out, then you should use “an.” If it uses a consonant sound you should use “a.”For example, you would say “an FBI agent” because the “F” in “FBI” makes a vowel sound (“eff”). On the other hand, you would not say “an CT scan” because the “C” in “CT” does not make a vowel sound. Instead, you would say “a CT scan.”

, In many American English words, the “H” is silent making the word begin with a vowel sound.For example, in “hour,” “honor,” “herb,” and “heir” the “H” is always silent and the words begin with vowel sounds. Thus, you would say, “an hour,” “an honor,” “an herb,” and “an heir.”
For words like “horse,” “human,” and “humble person” the “H” is not silent so the word makes a consonant sound. Thus, you would say “a horse,” “a human,” and “a humble person.”

, Often, if a word begins with a “U” it doesn’t make a vowel sound so you need to use “a” instead of “an.” This is tricky because “U” is a vowel, but often makes a “Y” sound when used at the beginning of a word.For example, in the word “University” the “U” is a long “U” and sounds like “yew,” which is a consonant sound. Therefore, you would say “a University” not “an University.”
On the other hand the “U” in “Umbrella” really does make a “U” sound, so you would say “an umbrella” not “a umbrella.”

Choose the subject of your sentence.,
Next, add in the verb.,
Include the direct object.,
Learn how to structure your sentence when the direct object is an entire phrase.",How to Use the Verb Suggest1," The subject of a sentence is the person, place, thing or idea that is doing the action. To begin your sentence, choose who or what will be doing the suggesting.


People are the most likely types of nouns to suggest something, as they frequently convey thoughts or ideas through language. Choose a person's name to use in an example sentence using the word suggest, such as ""Sally"".
But what other kinds of nouns work with the verb suggest? Sometimes, things can be suggestive. For instance, “evidence” is often used in coordination with “suggest,” as in, “The evidence suggests the dog ate his homework.”
Other nouns might not work as well; for instance, you might have a hard time making a sentence with “drinking glass” as the subject and “suggest” as the verb, as it’s difficult for a glass to suggest something (though not impossible).;
, After you have chosen the subject of your sentence, it's time to add the verb ""suggest"". In general, a verb is a word that expresses an action, feeling or a state of being. You will need to conjugate the word ""suggest"" depending on the subject.


In our example, the subject ""Sally"" is a third person singular noun. The third person singular form of “suggest” is “suggests,” so your sentence will read “Sally suggests.”
If the subject of your sentence was in first person singular, such as ""I"", you would use the first person singular form of the verb, which is simply ""suggest"". In this example, your sentence would read ""I suggest"".

, The direct object of a sentence is the thing that the verb is being done to. It can be a noun, pronoun, phrase or clause. In relation to the verb ""suggest"", the direct object is the thing that is being suggested.


To find the direct object of your example sentence, ask yourself what Sally is suggesting? If you can answer that question, you've found your direct object. For instance, maybe Sally is suggesting ice cream for dessert.
In this case, “ice cream” is the noun that becomes the direct object. Add this direct object to the end of the sentence, after the verb ""suggests“. This forms the sentence: ""Sally suggests ice cream for dessert.”

, Sometimes, the direct object is a bit more complicated, when a verb phrase or clause acts as a noun.


For instance, if Sally suggested going to eat ice cream, the sentence would sound like this one: “Sally suggests we go eat ice cream.”
In this case, the direct object is the whole clause, “we go eat ice cream” because Sally is suggesting that whole idea; therefore, the whole idea is acting as one noun. This makes it a direct object. "

The subjunctive mood is used in dependent clauses that do the following: “in grammar, designating or of that mood of a verb used to express condition, hypothesis, contingency, possibility, etc., rather than to state an actual fact: distinguished from imperative , indicative.” - Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary.,
We use the present subjunctive to express a command or wish.,
The past subjunctive is used to talk about an imaginary situation.,
Check out this break-down to understand further:

Non-Subjunctive Phrases

To be - ""He goes to Starbucks."",
The subjunctive can also be used with the present perfect and the past perfect.,
The subjunctive also has a few other miscellaneous uses.",How to Use the Subjunctive Mood," In other words, the subjunctive mood is used to express something that is not necessarily true at present.

, It is always used with the word 'that' before the subject. To form the present subjunctive, simply use the bare infinitive form of the verb with 'that' and your subject before it. To make a present subjunctive clause negative, place ""not"" in front of the bare infinitive. Only some verbs can take the subjunctive, such as 'request', 'demand' and 'ask'. You must study those verbs as there is no rule to it. Here are some examples of this kind of usage:


I demanded that my boyfriend attend Thanksgiving dinner with my family.

""demanded"" is in the past tense; ""attend"" is the present tense verb - it is in the subjunctive mood.


I demanded that my boyfriend not attend Thanksgiving dinner with my family.

The ""not"" makes the clause negative.



, It is mostly used in the second conditional sentence (e.g. If I were Obama, I would not bomb Libya.) It is also used after verbs such as 'wish' (e.g. I wish I were Obama). The past subjunctive does NOT need the 'that'. To form the past subjunctive, you only need the simple past form of the verb. The only irregular past subjunctive is 'to be', which is always 'were' in the past subjunctive.


If I had a lot of money, I would buy a Ferrari.

It's saying if something were true (that is not true) then something else would be true.



,
To be – ""I was happy.""
Third person singular form of regular verbs – ""He plays sports.""

,

(Note: the past perfect is formed with the auxiliary had + past participle, the present perfect is formed with the auxiliary have + past participle)
For the past perfect: ""If I had gone to Walmart yesterday, I would have run into an old friend"" can be made into a subjunctive sentence by changing the ""if I had"" to ""had I,"" resulting in: ""Had I gone to Walmart yesterday, I would have run into an old friend.""
For the present perfect: an example of an indicative sentence is: ""Jason has completed his homework."" A similar subjunctive sentence may be formed thus: ""It is imperative that by tomorrow Jason have completed his homework.""

,


The subjunctive with ""should"": ""I recommended that Don should see a doctor,"" ""We shall have a deal, if you should decide to accept it""
The subjunctive can be formed by inversion

Inversion by omission of the conjunction, ""if"":

Inversion with should: Should you feel hungry,... (equivalent to If you (should) feel hungry)
Inversion with were as simple past subjunctive: Were you here,... (equivalent to If you were here,...)
Inversion with were in compound forms: Were he to shoot,... (equivalent to If he were to shoot, i.e. If he shot)
Inversion with had in the pluperfect (already mentioned in this article)



Where a conjunction like whether, although or even if is omitted. (Note: all but the second and third examples are generally archaic)

Be he called on by God, ... (equivalent to ""If he be (i.e. If he is) called on by God, ..."")
Be they friend or foe, ... (equivalent to ""(No matter) whether they be friend or foe, ..."")
Be he alive or be he dead (from Jack and the Beanstalk).
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home (from ""Home! Sweet Home!""; meaning ""even if"" or ""even though"")



The subjunctive appears in fixed phrases:

Long live the King!
God save the queen.
God bless America!
Heaven forbid!
Be that as it may, (meaning ""that may be true, but...)
Come what may, (meaning ""no matter what happens,"" this phrase begins a clause)
As it were, (preceded by a comma that ends a non-literal clause, it means ""figuratively speaking"")
Suffice (it) to say
Far be it from (or for) me (to), (Used to express reluctance to do something which one thinks may be resented: ""far be it from me to speculate on his reasons"")

Sing to the tune of “Pop Goes the Weasel.” If you don’t remember this song, it is the one that begins “Ring around the mulberry bush….” This is a common song and lyric used to remember the quadratic formula, and it is quick and easy to memorize.The lyrics are:x equals negative b,plus or minus the square root,of b-squared minus 4ac,all over 2a.


,
Sing to the tune of “Row, Row, Row Your Boat.” Most people know this song and already have the tune memorized.,
Make up your own song.",How to Memorize the Quadratic Formula2,", It is a catchy song that can easily get stuck in your head, which makes it ideal for helping to memorize the formula.The lyrics are:X equals opposite b,plus or minus the square root,b-squared minus 4ac,divided by 2a.


, This method can be especially effective if you pick a tune that is meaningful to you and create your own lyrics for it. You can make the song as silly or catchy as you want, but make sure to not make it too complicated, or it will be difficult to remember.

Write down the lyrics of the song so that you remember it. Even better, make a video of yourself singing it. Then you can listen to the video during your study sessions and sing along with it. You could also post it to  YouTube or another website so that it can help others who are also trying to remember the formula.

Create an expression mnemonic associating familiar names and numbers.,
Invent a story.,
Create name mnemonics.",How to Memorize the Quadratic Formula3," Use names of famous people, or people you know, that begin with the letter of the variable.For example, if your sister’s name is Becky, your friend’s name is Ann, and your dog’s name is Cody, you can memorize “Negative Becky, plus or minus the square root of Becky squared minus 4 Ann-Cody, over 2 Anns.”


, Associate all of the symbols, numbers, and variables with images and actions that help you remember the formula. Inventing a unique, silly story can help memorize quickly. This method is good for visual learners, as it will help you make a visual representation of the formula.

For example, you can associate a negative/minus sign with being sad, and a positive/plus sign with being happy. You can associate a radical sign with an umbrella, and a fraction with a subway. The variables can stand for the first letter in the name of a person or animal.

For example, for the quadratic formula you could make up the following story: “A sad bison approached an umbrella that could have been happy or sad. Underneath the umbrella was a square bison and four sad alley cats. They all stood over a subway where 2 aardvarks were dancing.”

Write down your story so that you can re-read it as you try to memorize the formula.


, Come up with silly sounding names or phrases that can help you remember each part of the formula.It is extra helpful to visualize what that person or thing might look like. Coming up with your own names and images can help the mnemonic stick by making it meaningful for you.

For example, to remember the first part of the formula, −b±{\displaystyle -b\pm }, you could use the name “Negbee, Prime Minister” and visualize what such a leader might look like. To remember b2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}}, you could say the phrase “Square Root Beer Square” and visualize a square made out of Root Beer wearing glasses.

Change the form of the word ""suggest"" depending on which pronoun is used.,
Change ""suggest"" to ""suggested"" in the past tense.,
Change ""suggest"" to ""will suggest"" in the future tense.",How to Use the Verb Suggest2," Sometimes a pronoun is used instead of a noun. A pronoun is a replacement for a noun, such as ""you"", ""we"". ""it"", ""he"" or ""she"".When using “I” or “You” in its singular form, pair it with “suggest,” such as “I suggest picking flowers,” or “You suggest it to the group.”
When using “We” or “You” in the plural form, you also pair it with “suggest.” For instance, the sentence could be “We suggest a different color,” or “You (all) suggest eating out.”
In fact, the only time you use the form “suggests” is with third person singular, such as in the ""Sally"" example above or when using “he” or “she.” The third person plural “they” uses “suggest” rather than “suggests.”

, A past tense verb tells your reader (or listener) that the action happened in the past, rather than right now. The past tense of “suggest” is “suggested.”


If you made a suggestion to your boss yesterday, you could say, “I suggested it to Rob yesterday, but he didn't like the idea.”
Keep in mind that “suggested” is the past tense no matter whether the noun or pronoun is first, second, or third person or whether it is singular or plural.

, Like past tense, the future tense is all the same for “suggest.” Future tense tells your reader that the action will happen in the future. The future tense for “suggest” is “will suggest”, no matter whether you are using first person singular (“I”) or third person plural (“they”).


If your girlfriend wants to make a suggestion in a meeting tomorrow, she might say, “I will suggest that idea tomorrow.”
Additionally, if you want to tell someone else what your girlfriend is going to do, you can say: ""she said she will suggest that tomorrow.”

Know the meaning of the word ""suggest"".,
Understand how the word ""suggest"" works within the structure of a sentence.",How to Use the Verb Suggest3," “Suggest” is the verb form of “suggestion.” When you make a suggestion, you offer an opinion.


The word “suggest” is similar to the word ""demand"", in that they are both putting forth a request. However, “demand” is a very strong word; when you demand something, you are not giving the person you are talking to much of a choice. You are willing them to do something.
The word “suggest”, on the other hand, is more of a request. You want your idea to be heard, but you are not requiring that it be fulfilled. When you suggest to a group that you go for ice cream, you are hopeful that you will be able to go, but you are open to other thoughts and ideas.

, “Suggest” is a transitive verb. Therefore, a sentence containing the word ""suggest"" must have a subject, the verb “suggest,” and a direct object.


All sentences must have a subject. A subject is a noun or a pronoun, which is a person, place, thing, or idea. A pronoun stands in for a noun; it is a way of referring to something without saying the same word over and over again. Examples of pronouns include ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" and ""they"".
All sentences must also have a verb. Whereas the noun or pronoun does the action, the verb is the action; i.e. it tells what the noun is doing.
Some verbs are called transitive verbs, which means they must have a direct object. A direct object is also noun or pronoun. However, this time, the action is happening to the noun, rather than performing the action."

Translate the quote accurately.Ensure your translation is faithful to the tone and meaning of the original quote.",How to Use Quotes in a Press Release," For example, if you are writing about a new company opening, the quote should be about what the company will bring to the area in which it will be located. Quote a company spokesperson or corporate head about sustainability, new jobs, the company's commitments to protecting the environment, and being a good community partner.


If your press release is announcing a performer who is making an appearance in your community, get a quote from the performer about something he or she has done for charity. Be sure to ask the person how the gesture made him feel, as this will give the reader a glimpse of the performer's good character.
For instance, if a renowned singer was coming to play a concert in your city, she might be recognized not only as an award-winning artist, but as a philanthropist who has donated money to a local nonprofit which offers free music lessons to kids. A quote like “It’s important that everyone be empowered to follow their dreams just like I was by teachers who believed in me,” will show she is not just interested in making money, but promoting positive change in the community.
Use quotes to address any problems that might be solved or alleviated by the subject of your press release. For instance, if you are writing about a new store, find a quote that illustrates how the shop will boost the economy, give shoppers more choices, or add to the ambiance of the place in which it is opening. Quote an industry leader who supports the new store’s opening. “I expect the new store to add 400 jobs and $100,000 to the local economy in the first quarter of the year alone,” is a perfect quote to show the benefits of the new store. If you're promoting an event, use a quote that details the family fun or affordability aspects of the event.;
, Including a quote in a press release can inspire readers or journalists to follow up with a desired behavior.If the press release is about a rock band’s tour, for instance, you could use a quote from fans who have seen the band to declare the tour a great success and encourage other people to attend their concerts. “This band sounded amazing, everyone who listens to them needs to see them live!” is a rave review, likely to move readers to catch the band on tour. If the press release is about an author’s new publication, you could quote reviewers who reviewed it favorably to lead into a sales pitch about where the book is sold.

, Quotes should illustrate why the story matters on a human level. What people say, think, and feel can be expressed in a powerful quote. A solid quote can break through the humdrum of a press release loaded with facts and statistics. Use quotes to demonstrate the real world effects the press release describes.For instance, when reporting that your celebrity client donated a cool million to the Children’s Cancer Research Center, you might draw attention to the fact that over 10,000 children per year are diagnosed with cancer in the US alone. But quoting a child who was able to access treatment at the center will underscore the importance of your client’s donation. Something heartwarming like “I’m so happy the doctors here are giving me a chance to live again.”
While the bulk of your text will relate hard data, quotes from actual people will help put a face on whatever it is you are writing about.

, The more accessible you make your subject, the more interest you will generate.


For instance, “The double-quark boson hydrosphere will eliminate the need for conventional synthetic external H2O protective gear and increases the likelihood that saturation will not occur” is a cumbersome quote and includes words which the average reader cannot define. By contrast, a company leader who explains “Our new rain poncho’s molecular technology makes it the best on the market” is far more easily understood by the average reader and journalist.

, Unless you’re fluent in the languages you’re translating, you’ll need a translator (or better yet, two) to ensure the quotes are translated into the target language appropriately. Be sure the quotes match the tone as well as the meaning of the original quote. Get the text double-checked by another translator. Clear up any points of disagreement before publishing.


When you quote the translated individual, indicate they were speaking originally in another language. For instance, “Speaking through a translator, Mr. Di'Marco reported ‘Third quarter profits are expected to rise by twenty percent.’”

, Generally, a quote should represent what someone said, not a part of what someone said. If a journalist or media outlet decides the full quote is unnecessary or too cumbersome, that’s their call. When issuing a good press release, however, it’s always best to provide the full quote.For instance, a market analyst might decide that a company’s stock is “Worth investing in, assuming its profits next quarter continue to rise.” Releasing a press release which quotes the analyst as saying only the stock is “Worth investing in” is a misrepresentation of the analyst’s actual comments. You might no even do this deliberately. Often, you might fail to include the last bit for brevity or because you’re excited to report good news about a client. Failure to provide a full quote could lead to the deterioration of the relationship between you and the journalists who you distribute press releases to, as well as between you and the analyst whose words you quoted only partially.

, Unless you have a truly exceptional and memorable quote, you should wait to introduce quotes until after the basic purpose of the press release has been laid out. The third paragraph is a good point at which to begin bringing in quotes. Introducing quotes up front means that the quotes are being used without any real context in which to understand them, which leads readers to confusion or misunderstanding., You may take some creative license when crafting a quote on behalf of the individual you’re representing, but before putting it in print, run it by them to ensure they’re comfortable with “your” statement. If you’re quoting an industry wonk or talking head, it’s best to represent what they said verbatim, but you’ll want to run it by them before publication anyways., Similarly, don’t attribute quotes to a company; get a quote from an employee or project leader to give your press release more personality. Use full names to ensure the quote is attributed correctly.


When attributing quotes, stick with the verb “said.” Other speech-related verbs are loaded with some positive or negative connotation.“CEO Harvey Mitner said ‘The Oxy-jet 9000 is the best window squeegee on the market’” is one example of how to credit someone effectively using “said.”
Place the attribution at the end of the first sentence. If the source has more to say, have his or her quote continue in the next few sentences. For example, you might write, “’Our new burger will blow away the competition,’ head chef Hal Mavner said. ‘There’s no other burger with a flavor profile like it.’”
If you quote the same source again later, just refer to them by their surname.

, Limit the number of quotes you use per press release. Use them sparingly to avoid boring readers. A good press release will use quotes to spice up the bulk of their analytical or descriptive text. Quotes should typically be no more than three sentences., Do not use nonstandard spellings in your quotes. There are some occasions where you can utilize abbreviations which conform to a journalistic writing style, such as Sen. for Senator, $3 instead of three dollars, and St. Instead of Street., It’s always best to avoid substituting your own words for those of someone else. Let the press release speak for itself (or rather, for the person on whose behalf it was released).

, Make it clear when reporting why and how the press release was issued, and what the exact policy, commitment, or statement refers to.A press release announcing a candidate for political office is leaving the race might be framed alternately as either a response to a corruption scandal, or in response to health problems. It is the task of the journalist to accurately represent or reasonably speculate upon the event(s) which precipitated the press release.

, Pull-out quotes are those which, when the article is printed, are enlarged in a sidebar or adjacent text box to attract readers’ attention and really hammer home someone’s perspective. Pull-out quotes are also sometimes used onscreen in TV reporting, where they serve the same function., If possible, get the original transcript translated twice by two different translators and check for discrepancies. If any exist, try to clear them up or find another more direct quote. Note the original language of the press release in the article.

Identify the antecedent.,
Memorize the personal pronouns.,
Choose subject pronouns if the pronoun is performing the action.,
Choose object pronouns when the pronoun is receiving the action.,
Put object pronouns after prepositions.,
Show ownership with possessive pronouns.",How to Use Pronouns1," The antecedent is the noun that a pronoun is replacing. Every pronoun must have a clear antecedent. The antecedent usually appears before the pronoun in a sentence or in the previous sentence.


“Gabby always wanted to go to the zoo, and now she had her chance.”

In this example, Gabby is the antecedent of she.


""The gulls were chattering as they flew.”

Gulls is the antecedent of they.

;
, Personal pronouns are pronouns that refer to people or things. They are the most basic form of pronouns. Personal pronouns should always be the same number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) as their antecedent. There are three types of personal pronouns: subject, object, and possessive.First person singular: I, me, mine

First person plural: we, us, ours

Second person, singular and plural: you, yours

Third person masculine singular: he, him, his

Third person feminine singular: she, her, hers

Third person neuter singular: it, its

Third person plural (all genders): they, them, theirs

, The subject pronouns are I, we, you, he, she, it, and they. Subject pronouns are usually used at the beginning of sentences or clauses. They will usually come before a verb. If your pronoun is doing the action, you should use a subject pronoun.“She drives to work every day.”


She is doing the action of driving. Therefore, she is the subject.


“They practice basketball in the morning.”


They are doing the action of practicing. Therefore, you use a subject pronoun.



, The object pronouns are me, us, you, him, her, it, and them. If the pronoun is receiving the action, it is called a direct object. Object pronouns are always used when the antecedent is a direct object. “Bob threw it across the room.”


It is receiving the action of throwing. Therefore, you use an object verb.


“Dad patted him on the back.”


Him is receiving the action of patting. Therefore, you use an object verb.



, Object pronouns also come after prepositions. In this case, the pronouns are replacing the indirect object. Prepositions are words like “before,” “to,” “after,” “through,” and “above.” They indicate position. After prepositions, always use the object pronouns.“Mark passed the ball to him.”
“Alice walked in between them.”
“The teacher walked in front of her.”

, Possessive pronouns are pronouns that indicate that something belongs to someone or something else. The possessive pronouns are mine, ours, yours, its, his, hers, and theirs.“The car is hers.”
“The blue house is theirs.”
”That book is a favorite of mine.”

Capitalize proper nouns.,
Use capitalization with proper adjectives.,
Capitalize titles of works.,
Use a capital at the beginning of a sentence.,
Capitalize the first word of a full sentence in a quotation.,
Use capitalization when referring to a period or an event.,
Employ capitalization with the pronoun “I.” One of the most notable words to make sure to capitalize is the pronoun “I.” I refers to oneself, and is as a result, a unique and a specific usage of a word.,
Capitalize people’s names.,
Capitalize family relationships.,
Remember to capitalize people’s titles.,
Capitalize names for members of a group.,
Identify when to capitalize directions.,
Use lowercase for job titles.,
Capitalize seasons only in certain situations.,
Learn how to capitalize animal breeds and plant species.",How to Use Proper Capitalization," Proper nouns are unique items and they will always begin with a capital letter. More specifically, proper nouns name specific people, places, and things. Capitalizing proper nouns helps readers identify specific and important items in a sentence or paragraph. Consider:


Some examples of proper nouns are January, China, and Declaration of Independence.
Words like month, country, and document are not proper nouns because they do not name specific nouns.
Also remember days, months, and holidays, such as Tuesday, August, and Halloween.
Other proper nouns include the names of people, such as John, Dad, or Kate Brown.
Finally, proper nouns also include the names of buildings, landmarks, and companies, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Statue of Liberty, or Verizon.;
, Proper adjectives are used when a proper noun is employed as an adjective. Proper adjectives, like proper nouns, name a specific adjective and should be capitalized. This is an important and sometimes neglected rule of capitalization, and you should be careful when writing and capitalizing proper adjectives. For example:


Countries can be turned into proper adjectives by adding ""n"" or ""ian."" For example: America to American, Italy to Italian, or Germany to German. Some exceptions include England, Japan, and France. Their proper adjectives are English, Japanese, and French. Some examples include: Isn't that South American music amazing? My brother got me some Mexican food at the restaurant.
Also remember that prefixes attached to a proper adjective should not be capitalized, such as ""pro-Communist"" or ""anti-American."" However, when a prefix is created from a proper noun, such as ""Afro"" (which is created from Africa), it should be capitalized such as when you write ""Afro-American."", You should always use capitalization when writing the titles of works. This includes books, movies, poems, short stories, and songs. This is because the title is unique and specific and capitalization will signal that the words of the title should stand out to the reader. Rules for capitalizing titles include:Capitalize verbs (run, write, etc.), adverbs (silently, swiftly, etc.), adjectives (pretty, thin, etc.), pronouns (he, they, etc.), subordinating conjunctions (as, because, etc.), and nouns (dog, car, etc.) in works.
Always use a capital letter for the first and last word in a title, even if the first word is one you would not normally capitalize, such as a preposition (to, in, at, etc.), coordinating conjunction (and, but, etc.), or an article (the, a, etc.) words like the, an, a, an, to, in, and other small words.
Do not capitalize prepositions, coordinating conjunctions, and articles if they show up after the first word or before the last word in a title. For example, it should be “East of Eden” rather than “East Of Eden.”

, The first word of every sentence should be capitalized, regardless of what kind of word. This is because a capital at the start of a sentence signals to a reader that something important is happening. A capital here serves as a road sign for reading. Without capitalizing the first word of every sentence, it would be much harder to discern when a new sentence began and when new ideas were introduced.


Also remember to capitalize the first word of every line of poetry.

, You also need to capitalize the first word of sentences in quotes. Since the person is saying something, it's a new sentence and should have a capital letter for the first letter. For example:


Emily asked, ""Do you know where it is?""
He said to me, ""I'd rather have pizza.""
Sally asked me how I was doing and I responded, ""I am very well, thank you."", Any major event or a period in time that is notable should be capitalized. This is because as a major event or period, you should want to draw attention to it as a subject when writing about it. In this usage, capitalizing signals to the reader that they should take note of this event or period as it might be significant in the text or outside of it. For example:


The Antebellum Period.
The Victorian Era.
The Great Recession.
The Treaty of Paris.
A notable exception to this is when we write the name of a century. When you refer to the “fourteenth century,” it should not be capitalized, as it is not specific enough. A more specific usage, though, like the “Long Eighteenth Century” (which refers to a period of revolutions and political change from 1688 to 1812) can be capitalized., In addition, it is an important and notable usage in that the user of the word “I” will always see significance in the word.

, One of the major conventions of writing today is to capitalize people’s names. Capitalizing people’s names signals that the name is unique and specific and has importance. By capitalizing a person’s name, we draw the attention of a reader to that person and as a result make them a major subject of the writing. In addition:


Capitalize the names of pets.
Capitalize the names of well-known animals.
Capitalize the names of gods and deities (for example: Lord Ganesha, Zeus, Jesus Christ, or Yahweh), unless you refer to “god” in a general or nonspecific way. If you are referring to your own specific god or deity, you should write ""God."", Family relationships, when you are referring to your own relative, should also be capitalized. For example:


When you are referring to your relative, such as your “Aunt” or “Mother,” the word should be capitalized, such as “Aunt Margaret"" or ""Cousin John.""
Incorrect usage would be “aunt Margaret” or ""cousin John.""
Incorrect usage would also be to capitalize the relationship of someone else's family member, such as ""John's Dad."" Instead, it should be ""John's dad.""
Also remember not to capitalize your own relationship if it is changed by a modifier like ""my."" For example, ""my dad"" is correct, rather than ""My Dad."", The titles of people should also be capitalized. This is because titles convey prestige and something unique and different. Without capitalizing them, the importance and prestige of the title would not be as apparent to us. Common titles are Jr. Mr. Ms. Miss, Sr., and Dr. , In addition to capitalizing people’s names and titles, you should also capitalize the name for members of a specific group. Capitalizing the name for a group or a member of a group denotes that the group is unique and specific and different from others who do not share membership, identity, of affiliation. Such groups include:


Racial, ethnic, and nation groups. For example: African Americans, Hispanics, or Italians.
Political groups. For example: Democrats and Republicans.
Social groups. For example: Daughters of the American Revolution or Sons of the Confederacy.
Athletic groups. For example: Yankees or Marlins., The cardinal directions and intercardinal directions (like southwest, northwest, etc.) should not be capitalized. This is because the directions are not specific and unique enough and are used fairly commonly in ordinary language and writing. However, consider the following:


Capitalizing the names of regions like the “South” or the “West” is appropriate, although some scholars do argue if it is necessary.
Differentiate between using a cardinal direction and the name of a region. For instance, “I’m driving west to Seattle from Chicago.” West, here, signals the direction you are driving, not the name of the region. If you mean to name the region, then capitalize. Make sure to be deliberate in your use.
Some scholars debate whether a descriptor of people who live in a region like “southerner” should be capitalized. Writing “southerner” and “Southerner” can both be permissible., In most cases, job titles should not be capitalized. This is because those titles are not specific and unique enough to merit capitalization. Consider:


An example of an incorrect capitalization of a job title is when someone would write “I am a Regional Manager for Alpha Beta Video.”
Always use lowercase for job titles unless the title is before your name. For example, “Professor Richard Hofstadter.”
Avoid using capitalization to give importance to something, like your job title, when the rules and conventions of writing do not sanction capitalization., The seasons of the year should not normally be capitalized. This is because they do not indicate something unique and specific enough to warrant capitalization. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.


Capitalize seasons when the season is attached to a specific event or title (for example: Spring Beer Fest).
Capitalize seasons when they refer to something more than just the season. For example, if a season also indicates the semester of a school year, like the “Fall semester,” then capitalize.
Make sure that capitalization of a season is paired with something more specific., Capitalizing animal breeds and plant species can be pretty tricky. This is because breed and species names combine a variety of languages and bring in otherwise complicated issues. Because of this, be very aware when you are writing breed names or plant species. Consider:


Words that make up plant species are usually lowercase, such as ""live oak"" or ""magnolia tree.""
Whenever a breed or species name incorporates the name of a specific person or geographical location, then you need to capitalize only that portion of the name. For example, ""Darwin's fox"" or ""Labrador retriever.""
Remember to capitalize the names of fruits or vegetables if they refer to specific varieties, such as ""Red Delicious apples"" or ""Better Boy tomato.""
When it comes to binomial nomenclature, which is the Latin language classification system for living things, you should always capitalize the first part, which is the genus name. The second part, which is the species name, is never capitalized (for example, ""Canis lupus,"" the gray wolf). If there is a third part that further specifies, like with ""Canis lupus familiaris,"" (the domestic dog) it should not be capitalized."

Understand what a ""regimen"" is.,
Understand what a ""regime"" is.,
Recognize that on occasion they are interchangeable.",How to Use Regime and Regimen Correctly," A regimen is a set of steps that one can follow for diet, exercise, medicine, or other health practice.It is a type of routine. Some definitions are more strict than others; one dictionary states that a regimen must include medication.However, it can usually be applied to any health practice.


A doctor may prescribe a 'regimen of medical treatment.
A skincare regimen might include washing, toning, and moisturizing your skin.;
, A regime is a form of rules, government, or leadership.It often implies a strict, authoritarian control. A regime is like a strict rule, or it can be ""the conditions under which a scientific or industrial process occurs"".


The dictator imposed a fascist regime upon her country.
My grandmother held a strict regime over the household, and we all feared her disapproving eye.
Occasionally, it can refer to a time period in which a certain type of government held power. For example, the old kings of France comprised the Ancient Regime.


, Regime can occasionally be used to describe a regimen.

This is more common in British English than in American English."

Pick ""who"" or ""whom"" for people.,
Use ""that"" or ""which"" for things.,
Know the exception.,
Pick ""that"" for things in restrictive clauses.,
Choose ""which"" for nonrestrictive clauses.,
Use ""that"" to describe an object in a statement.,
Pick ""which"" to describe an object in a sentence.,
Use ""who"" or ""whoever"" when the pronoun is the subject.,
Pick ""whom"" or ""whomever"" when the pronoun is the object.,
Choose ""whose"" when you're trying to show possession.,
Trying replacing the pronoun with another one to figure it out.",How to Use the Words ''Who'' and ''That'' Correctly," You use ""who"" when the pronoun refers to people. A pronoun is just a word that refers back to a noun, such as in these two sentences: ""Robert ate an apple. He threw the core away."" ""He"" refers back to ""Robert."" Therefore, when the pronoun refers back to a person, you use ""who.""For example, you would say, ""Robert, who was trying to lose weight, ate apples."" ""Who"" refers back to ""Robert,"" which is why you use ""who"" instead of ""that."";
, When the pronoun refers back to something that is not a person, such as a thing, then you switch to ""that"" or ""which."" In other words, use ""that"" with objects, places, and so on instead of ""who.""Therefore, you would write, ""The apple that was bruised tasted bad."" ""That"" refers back to ""the apple,"" which is why you use ""that"" instead of ""who.""

, In some cases, you can use ""that"" for people, generally in informal speech and writing. However, it is often frowned upon, particularly in formal writing. Therefore, try to stick to using ""who"" for people when writing, especially when writing something requiring formal writing, such as an essay.For example, you might say, ""The lady over there that ordered the coffee wants some sugar."" However, you generally don't write that way. Instead, you'd write, ""The lady who ordered the coffee wants some sugar.""

, A restrictive clause is one that is necessary to the sentence. It limits (restricts) a subject. In other words, it narrows down the identity of something, so it's necessary to the meaning of the sentence. When using restrictive clauses, you don't need commas to set off the clause.For example, you would write, ""The fruit that we ate at dinner tasted bad."" ""That we ate at dinner"" narrows down which fruit you're talking about, so it is restrictive and necessary to the sentence. Think of it this way: Does all fruit taste bad? No, just the fruit you ate at dinner, so the clause is necessary to the sentence.
In other words, restrictive clauses will alter the meaning of the sentence., A nonrestrictive clause adds information to the sentence, but it doesn't narrow down the meaning. In addition, these types of clauses aren't necessary to the sentence for it to make sense. They provide extra information, so they are set off by a comma or commas.For example, you would write, ""The fruit that we ate at dinner tasted bad, which upset me."" ""Which upset me"" adds information to the sentence. However, it doesn't restrict the subject, nor is it necessary.
Here's another example: ""The television, which was expensive when we bought it, was showing signs of age."" ""Which was expensive when we bought it"" doesn't narrow down which television. It just adds information.
Note that ""who"" can be used in both restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses. The only difference is the punctuation.

, ""That"" can serve another function. It can also be used as an adjective. An adjective describes a noun. In this case, the adjective is used to indicate which object the person is referring to, as in, ""That cat is the one that ate my sandwich."", ""Which"" can also serve as an adjective. However, it is usually used in a question rather than a statement to figure out something about an object. For instance, you might ask, ""Which cat ate the sandwich?"", A subject is the person doing the action. You can have a subject of a independent clause or a dependent clause. In both cases, you would use ""who"" if the pronoun is the subject of the clause, meaning it does the action.An independent clause has a subject and a verb, and it can stand on its own. For instance, ""Rob ate fries,"" is an independent clause. ""Rob"" is the subject, and ""ate"" is the verb.
A dependent clause has a subject and a verb, but it can't stand on its own. It must be attached to a dependent clause to make sense. For example, ""because he likes them"" is a dependent clause. It has a subject (""he"") and a verb (""likes""), but it needs an independent clause to make sense: ""Rob ate fries because he likes them.""
Therefore, in either a dependent or independent clause, use ""who"" or ""whoever"" when the pronoun is the subject. In question form, an example is ""Who ate the cookies?"" ""Who"" is the doing the action, even though you don't know ""who"" is. In fact, if you think of it as a statement, it makes more sense: ""Who ate the cookies.""Another example, with a dependent clause, is, ""She loved to sing to whoever was around."" ""Whoever"" acts as the subject in ""whoever was around.""

, The object is who (or what) the action is being done to. In the previous example, ""Rob ate fries,"" ""fries"" is the object of the sentence because Rob is eating them. Independent clauses, dependent clauses, and even phrases (such as prepositional phrases) can have objects, though not all do.Choose ""whom"" or ""whomever"" when the question is asking what person is on the receiving end of the action, such as, ""Whom did she say ate the cookies?"" If you turn it into a statement, you can see how ""whom"" is the object: ""She said whom ate the cookies.""
Pick ""whomever"" when it's the object of a dependent or independent clause, such as, ""We like whomever you pick.""
""Whomever"" can also be the object of a preposition: ""She likes to run with whomever."" ""Whomever"" is the object of ""with."", ""Whose"" is a pronoun that shows possession, much like ""his"" or ""hers."" Therefore, you use ""whose"" when you're trying to figure out who owns something, such a book or a drink.For example, you'd say, ""Whose sandwich is this?"" ""Whose"" is showing possession of the sandwich.

, When in doubt, try substituting in other pronouns, such as ""he,"" ""him,"" and ""his"" to figure out whether to use ""who,"" ""whom,"" or ""whose."" It can make it easier, as these pronouns are more common.For example, in the sentence, ""Who ate the cookies?"" you'd replace it with ""he"" ate the cookies, the subjective pronoun, so you use ""who.""
In ""She likes to run with whomever,"" you'd replace it with ""him,"" as in, ""She likes to run with him."" Therefore, you use the objective case, ""whom.""
In ""Whose sandwich is this?"" you need to turn it around to a statement: ""This is whose sandwich."" You'd say, ""This is his sandwich,"" which is why you use ""whose.""

Ask questions with interrogative pronouns.,
Refer to nouns with demonstrative pronouns.,
Define nouns with relative pronouns.,
Emphasize with intensive pronouns.,
Show that the subject is also receiving the action with reflexive pronouns.,
Indicate a general or non-specific object with indefinite pronouns.",How to Use Pronouns2," Sometimes you don’t know who or what is doing something. In those cases, you use the interrogative pronouns. These include who, whom, what, whose, and which. Interrogatives lack an antecedent.”Who is going to the movie?”
”Whose car is that parked out front of our house?”
”I don’t understand what is going on.”

, Demonstrative pronouns include this, that, these, those, and such. These words refer to a specific noun that is being referred to in a conversation. The speaker or reader should understand exactly what the antecedent is.She looked at a red car. ""That is a nice car,” she said.

In this example, that is a demonstrative pronoun which is clearly referencing the red car.



, Relative pronouns are used after nouns to provide more information about that noun. They can tell us which person or thing we are talking about, or they give more information about that person or thing. Relative pronouns are who, whom, which, whose, and that.


Who is the subject pronoun. You use it when it is performing the action. It is only used to refer to people. For example, “We visited my grandmother, who lives down the street.”
”Whom” is an object pronoun. Again, this means we only use it when it is receiving the action or after a preposition. For example, “To whom am I speaking?”
“Which” is used when you are providing non-essential information. For example, ”I put ketchup on my pasta, which is how I like it.”
“That” is used when providing essential information about an object. For example, ”I like pasta that is covered in ketchup.”

, Intensive pronounces end in either –self (if it is singular) or –selves (if it is plural). They are myself, ourselves, herself, himself, itself, themselves, yourself, and yourselves. You can use these pronouns to add emphasis to a sentence.


”He himself will carry the torch to the podium.”
”They can do it themselves.”

, The reflexive pronouns are the same pronouns as the intensive. They end in –self (for singular) or –selves (for plural). They indicate that the subject and the object are the same person or thing.


“I helped myself to the buffet.”

In this sentence, the subject (I) and the object (myself) refer to the same person.



, These pronouns are often used to describe a general antecedent without specifying exactly who or what is .being discussed.Indefinite pronouns are almost always singular. The exceptions to this rule are both, all, few, many, or all. These are plural.Indefinite pronouns include:


Each
Anybody
Somebody
Nobody
Everybody
One
Anyone
Everyone
Someone
Neither
Either
Nothing
Anything
Everything
Something

Say the sentence out loud.,
Check that the pronouns agree with the verbs.,
Replace the pronoun with the antecedent.,
Circle every pronoun, and draw a line to its antecedent.,
Replace all nouns with pronouns.,
Complete the sentence.",How to Use Pronouns3," Your ear is very good at catching mistakes. Speak the sentence. If something sounds off, check the pronouns. You may not have written them correctly.

, Singular pronouns should take singular verb forms. Plural pronouns take plural verb forms. Double-check that the pronoun takes the same number value as its antecedent and that the proper verb is being used.



Each, either, neither, and one are always singular. That means that they take singular verbs.Who takes the value of its antecedent. If its antecedent is plural, then who is plural. If the antecedent is singular, who is singular.

, The sentence should have exactly the same meaning if you switch the pronoun with the antecedent. If you want to make sure that your usage is correct, try replacing the pronoun with its antecedent.

, The antecedent should be very close to the pronoun, ideally within the same sentence or the sentence immediately before it. If you cannot find the antecedent or the antecedent is far away from the pronoun, replace the pronoun with its antecedent., Take away all nouns, and replace them with just pronouns in the sentence. This can help you remove distracting words and identify errors more quickly.


For example, in the sentence ""Dad snapped a photo of Mike and she,"" replace Dad, a photo, and Mike with he and it. You are left with ""He snapped it of she."" You may notice the error that a subject pronoun (she) is being used where an object pronoun (her) should be used. The sentence should read “Dad snapped a photo of Mike and her.”

, Sometimes, sentences leave out verbs that are understood in the meaning of the sentence. This often happens with “than” comparisons. Add these verbs back in to see if the pronoun is correct.


For example, in the sentence “He makes more money than she/her,” you can finish the sentence to find the correct pronoun. “He makes more money than she ” is more correct than “He makes more money than her .”

First, consider what types of items you are listing.,
Create a sentence.,
Try a different sentence.,
Use parallelism in prepositional phrases.,
Write parallel sentences using infinitives.,
Use parallelism to create cohesive paragraphs.,
Create your own cohesive sentence.,
Read your work out loud.,
Look for a lack of parallelism.,
Check for places where you could add parallelism for emphasis.",How to Use Parallelism Correctly," Are you listing things or ideas? Are you making a list of what a person is doing? To use parallelism correctly, you want the list to include the same parts of speech in the same form.


The part of speech is the name given to each word to describe its function. For instance, a noun is a person, place, idea, or thing. It does action or has action done to it, sometimes. Other times, it just names something, such as in a list.
A verb, on the other hand, is the action of the sentence. It’s words like “kick,” “jump,” or “paint.”;
, Let’s try one with actions. Pick a person to do the action: Kate. Next, what does Kate do? Let’s say she ate first, then got dressed, and then left the house. Put those in a sentence together:


“Kate was eating, dressed, and left.” Wait, that doesn't sound right, does it? Try making all the verbs in the list be in the same tense - simple past.
“Kate ate, dressed, and left.” That sounds better, right? It’s because the words in the list are parallel—they share the same structure.

, Let’s use descriptive words this time, still describing Kate. For example:


“Kate is fast, efficiently, and courteous.” Once again, the sentence sounds wrong because one of the words doesn't follow the same structure—“efficiently” is an adverb instead of an adjective like the other words in the list.
Therefore, the sentence should be: “Kate is fast, efficient, and courteous.” However, it could also be: “Kate works quickly, efficiently, and courteously,” where all the words describe how Kate “works”. In other words, they are adverbs, because they describe the verb.

, Parallelism can also be used in other parts of speech, such as prepositional phrases. For instance, look at the following sentence:


“Kate went to work, to the park, and then to her house.” “To” is a preposition, and it introduces a phrase. The sentence is parallel because each item is a prepositional phrase. It wouldn’t sound right if it were phrases as “Kate went to work, to the park, and walked home.” “Walked home” is a different part of speech—it’s a verb plus a noun, as opposed to another prepositional phrase.

This sentence could also be phrased: “Kate went to work, the park, and her house”; the second sentence works because the reader understands to carry the word “to” throughout the list. However, with prepositional phrases, it doesn’t have to be the same word to be parallel; you can use any preposition.


For instance, you could say, “Kate went through the tunnel, over the bridge, and around the bend.” “Through,” “over,” and “around” are all prepositions, so the sentence is still parallel.

, Infinitives are “to” plus the base form of the verb. For instance, you could say “Kate went out to eat and to shop.” “To eat” and “to shop” are both infinitives, so the sentence is parallel.


However, it wouldn't be correct to say, “Kate went out to eat and shopping,"" because it’s not parallel.
Basically, when writing a list, check to make sure each item uses the same part of speech. The items can be a single word, a phrase, or even a clause, but they should all follow the same pattern.

, In structure, parallelism often refers to the repetition of a certain phrase or style of phrase. A famous example of this type of parallelism is a quote from John F. Kennedy:


“My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” President Kennedy repeats “ask… what…” in the phrasing, creating a contrast between the two ideas, while tying them together at the same time.
Similarly, Dr. Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech is an example of parallelism. Throughout the speech, he repeats the phrase “I have a dream,” creating cohesiveness in the text.

, Let’s say you enjoy ice cream, but you avoid it because you’re lactose intolerant. You could create a sentence such as “I want to eat ice cream; however, I do not want the stomach pain it will cause me.” The repetition of “I…want” binds the two sentences together.

, When looking for problems with parallelism in your own work, read the essay aloud. Search for places that sound awkward.

, Check to see if the awkwardness is because the sentence isn’t parallel. Are the words in a list all the same part of speech? Does the sentence suffer because it has too many different kinds of structure?

, While your existing structure may not be bad, adding a parallel structure can make your writing better. For instance, use the following sentences as an example:


“The pie was delicious. It was tasty.” By combining the sentences and using a parallel structure, the writing sounds better: “The pie was delicious and tasty.”
As you can see, parallel structure is not only sound grammar, it makes your writing sound better. You can use it to add emphasis and to create an effect.

Take a look at the meanings and tense differences between these two words.,
Recognize when you should use the word bring.,
Recognize what word you should use when you don't have the necessary ability to bring an item to you.,
Recognize the future tense verb of the word ""bring"" is ""will bring"".",How to Tell the Differences Between Bring and Brought,"



Bring is a verb that means to come to a place or convey a meaning and is a present-tense verb. Example: 'I will bring you some chocolates.'

Brought means exactly the same as above, but that it has already happened (past tense of bring. Brought means to bring about cause to happen.

Example- 'I brought you some chocolates.'

;
, Bring is the word you should use when you want something and that item isn't with you.

, The word you should use, when you don't have this ability, is to use brought. When you have already walked an item over to the person, use brought in place of bring.

, It can never be ""will brought"". When you listen to native English speakers, you'll never hear them say ""will brought"".

Be persistent.,
Ask for permission which is slightly different.",How to Use Go or Come," You probably know this, but if not, then understanding this is pretty easy in some situations. You might consider saying:


""You can come with me."" -- or ""I will go with you."";
, Both of these phrases refer to a person changing between locations.

, Directed to/toward the speaker's location.


""Come in first. Please, come here. Come inside the house, please -- and then we discuss what to do next."", while calling someone ""to/toward"" the speaker.

Thus, if the direction will be to or towards the speaker then the speaker should use ""come"".



, not toward the speaker. For example you can say:


""You could go over there."" or ""I could go to their house. Should I go pick them up or will you?"", when calling a friend about a visit you both have planned and to possibly go to a third person's house to get him or her.

The direction is someplace other than either speaker's locations so use the work ""go.""


""Do you think we should go from there to their house to eat or not? Either way we can go to their house. But, we can eat before we go, or when we go to our homes.""

The current location spoken of is neither the speaker's nor the listener's present location, use ""go"".



, If you do this you will find it easier each subsequent time, example:


""I'll come..."" ""I'll go to their house.""
If you are interested in correct usage, then plan the wording a little as you speak (or before).

,, Keep thinking about using these words and practicing. It will take time to change your common usage habits; so don't be impatient with yourself if you regress or seem slow to change.

,


When the speaker is outside and the listener is inside, ask: ""May I come into your house to the bathroom?"" -- to come toward the listener.
When both of you are outside, ask: ""May I go inside your house to the bathroom?"" -- going away from him/her.

Decide what it is that you'd like to learn via music about English.,
Understand that there are hundreds, maybe even thousands of songs that have been written in English about any topic that you can possibly think of.,
Put the songs into an iPod or music device.,
Begin to try to sing them through.,
Sing the songs once a day.,
Ask someone who speaks English if they will let you sing one of the songs.,
Make little songs to remember things with, because music is an international language!,
Be patient with yourself.",How to Use Music to Learn English As a Second Language," Would you like to learn the alphabet? Would you like to learn more about numbers? Would you like to learn about the 50 states? Would you like to learn about America? Once you have made your decision, move on to the next step.;
, For example, the English alphabet has been set to music. There are songs about numbers, such as ""3 is a magic number"" which was made famous on popular radio by a band called Blind Melon after they covered the original version from ""School House Rock"", which was a series of short fun cartoons geared towards teaching the listener something. School House Rock videos and all of these songs, can be found on YouTube, the library or ordered on eBay, Etsy, purchased via iTunes or at a record store. There is also a song about the 50 states and plenty of songs about America. Choose a few songs that you want to listen to.

, Use a CD walkman or play them on a loop as you're beginning to fall asleep. Listen to the songs a few times, let them enter your mind and cling themselves to your brain.

, You won't know all the words, but some will stick with you. If you're not sure what the words mean, Google them online or look them up at Dictionary.com or even in an actual dictionary! You can also find a dictionary app for free or cheap if you have a smart phone.

, Try singing as you're in your car, or as you're walking to or from work or public transportation. Sing them on a regular basis until they become memorized in your brain and you can sing them without any music to accompany you.

, Or, go to an open mic at a bar or library and ask if your audience will tell you if and when you are incorrect.

, It will go into your head and stick with you for all of your days. For example, if you want to remember an address, put it to a rhythm. If you want to remember some words for household items, write a little song. ""Fork, spoon, knife and plate, these are items I use to eat"", etc.

, It doesn't matter if your voice is good or not, as long as you're using the music to teach yourself the information you need to know. Best of luck!

Take a look at the meanings and tense of both of these words.,
Recognize the differences in the tenses of these words.,
Recognize when you should use ""take"".",How to Tell the Differences Between Take and Took,"


TAKE means ""To get into one's hold or possession by voluntary action; to hold, grasp, or grip.""

Example- ""To take the child by hand.""


TOOK is just the past-tense form of ""to take"". It's definition is the same as the present tense.

Example- ""I took my book"".

;
, Take is a future-tense verb, while took is a past tense verb. For the present tense verb, use ""am taking"".


Rarely is there ever a need to use the future tense of the verb ""to take"", however, this verb is ""will take"".

, When an item is resting on or is in a spot where it can be grabbed, use the word take. Generally, when you can walk up to the item and pick it up, you can generally use the word ""take"", and not took.

Create a student-centered class.,
Get in touch with other teachers like you.",How to Teach English if You Aren't a Native Speaker," It's true that you know English, but a certification can back you up. Ask around and see what certification tests are available in your country. CAE, TOEFL, ECPE, IETLS are some names to look for. Get the highest score you can.;
, Knowing English is a must to teach it, but having a certification is essential. Check the requirements for English teachers in your country to see what certificate you need. There are two key qualifications that are international recognized – CELTA and TESOL. Both of them are types of TEFL courses.

, While being a native speaker might provide your students a taste of ""real"" English in class, having learned English consciously gives you a better understanding of grammar rules and the difficulties facing your students.

, Whether you are a native speaker or not, get some training before starting a class. Learn the skills you need to manage a class and the methodology you need to plan your course in advance. That way, you'll feel more confident about your skills.

, The teacher is an invaluable source of natural English for their students, but since you're not a native speaker, try to provide other sources like video, conversations, etc. Look for material that gives your students the chance to get to know real English.

, This approach will give your students the opportunity to talk, and become better while you talk less.

, This will give you support and help you to become better through interaction and exchange of ideas.

Consider your child's age.,
Consider your child's level of maturity.,
Be aware of the math curriculum in your child's school district.,
Assess your child's readiness for algebra.,
Introduce algebraic concepts to your child.",How to Get Your Child Ready for Algebra1," Some educational researchers, such as Dr. Herman Epstein, believe the human brain has periods of rapid development and periods where little development occurs, one of which coincides with a physical growth spurt during the ages 14 to 17, the high school years.;
, Your child should show some general problem-solving skills, be able to draw conclusions from logical reasoning, and be able to organize projects.

, Historically in American schools, algebra was introduced in either the 9th or 10th grade. Due to political pressures resulting in part from the No Child Left Behind Act, many school districts have formally introduced algebra in the 8th grade, with preliminary concepts taught in 7th grade.


If you homeschool your child, look at the curricula from several districts in your immediate area for a better handle on when might be an appropriate time to start preparing your child for algebra.

, You can do this in 1 of 2 ways:


Through a formal algebra readiness test. Many school districts offer algebra readiness tests as a means of placing students in study tracks for their high school years. These tests are usually offered during a student's middle school years. Organizations such as College Preparatory Mathematics and Sylvan Learning offer online or downloadable algebra readiness tests.
By regularly reviewing your child's math homework. Use the information presented under ""Prerequisites for Algebra"" along with an understanding of your school district's curriculum to monitor your child's progress in developing the preliminary skills for learning algebra.

, Many of the concepts taught in algebra can be presented to children at a younger age if done in a manner appropriate to their age. For example, you can introduce the concept of variables by asking your child what number added to 6 makes 10.

"
"
Understand and write various number forms.,
Calculate numbers in all the forms described above.,
Be able to factor numbers.,
Understand ratios, proportions, and rates.,
Identify and draw various geometric shapes.,
Measure and calculate the dimensions and properties of various geometric shapes.,
Work with the Pythagorean theorem.,
Collect, organize, and present information so others can understand it.,
Understand and analyze patterns.,
Understand the concept of variables.,
Represent mathematical functions as equations and on graphs.",How to Get Your Child Ready for Algebra2," Your child should be able to read, write, compare, and convert between the following forms:


Integers. Integers include counting numbers (1, 2, 3, etc., which are positive integers), whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.), and their negative value counterparts (additive inverses, -1, -2, -3, etc.).
Fractions. Fractions are written as one number (the numerator) over another (the denominator), separated by a line, such as 1/2. Your child should understand and identify proper fractions (which have a numerator smaller than the denominator, such as 2/3), improper fractions (which have a numerator as large or larger than the denominator, such as 3/2), and mixed numerals (which combine an integer with a fraction, such as 1 1/2).
Decimals. Decimals are another way to express fractional values using a decimal point instead of a fraction bar. Your child should be able to understand decimal place value (that 0.5 is larger than 0.05 because 5 tenths is more than 5 hundredths) and be able to convert decimals to fractions and vice versa.
Percents. Percents are an expression of numeric values as parts of 100 (""per cent""). Your child should be able to convert between percent and decimal values for the same number.
Exponents. Exponents are superscripted (raised) numbers used to represent how many times a base number is used as a factor in multiplication. They are sometimes referred to as ""powers."" Exponents can also be written as normal digits after a caret (^) when superscripting isn't possible. Your child should be able to convert numbers raised to powers to their equivalent values, such as 4 ^ 2 = 16 and 10 ^ 3 = 1000.
Scientific notation. Scientific notation is writing a large numeric value as a decimal multiplied by 10 raised to a power. The number 1,600,000 would be written in scientific notation as 1.6 x 10 ^ 6.

, Your child should be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers, fractions, decimals, percents, and in scientific notation, with some of the following related skills:


When adding or subtracting fractions, your child should be able to convert fractions into equivalent forms so that both terms have the same denominator. When multiplying fractions, your child should be able to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together and reduce the result to lowest terms.
When multiplying decimals together, your child should be able to place the decimal point correctly in the product. When dividing one decimal by another, your child should be able to correctly place the decimal point in the quotient by moving the decimal points in the dividend and divisor the same number of places to the right to make the divisor an integer.

, Factoring is the ability to identify a number as the product of 2 or more smaller numbers (factors). Your child should be able to identify factors for any given number and identify prime numbers, which are divisible only by 1 and themselves. In addition, your child should be able to understand and perform the following:


Greatest common factor (GCF). This is the largest number that can be divided evenly into 2 or more different numbers; for example, the greatest common factor of 12 and 20 is 4 (3 x 4 = 12, 5 x 4 = 20).
Least (or lowest) common multiple (LCM). This is the smallest number that is a multiple of 2 or more different numbers; for example, the least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18 (3 x 6 = 18, 2 x 9 = 18).
Prime factoring. This is being able to express a given number as a product of prime numbers. For example, the prime factoring of 60 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 5.

, ""Ratio"" is the comparison of 2 quantities to each other, while ""proportion"" refers to the amount of an item against a whole. In a bowl of fruit with 3 apples and 5 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:5 (also writable as 3/5), while the proportion of apples to all fruit is 3:8 (or 3/8). ""Rate"" is a ratio of 2 measurements, usually of different types, such as miles per hour, heartbeats per minute, or cycles per second.


Related to ratios and proportions are the concepts of odds and probabilities. Probability is a ratio of the desired outcome to all possible outcomes; the probability of getting heads on a coin flip is 1:2 (1/2), since a coin can come up either heads or tails. ""Odds"" is the ratio of the desired outcome to unwanted outcomes; the odds of getting heads on a coin toss are 1:1.

, These skills are somewhat more of a prerequisite for geometry classes than for algebra, but they relate to the ability to recognize patterns in number sequences and other areas.

, Your child should be able to use a ruler, compass, and protractor and should be able to find the following:


Perimeter: The total length of all the edges of a 2-dimensional object.
Area: The amount of space a 2-dimensional object takes up.
Volume: The amount of space a 3-dimensional object takes up.
Surface area: The total area of each surface of a 3-dimensional object.

, The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the length of the other 2 sides. This skill helps prepare your child not just for algebra and geometry, but trigonometry as well. Your child should be able to use this relationship to find the length of any side of a right triangle when the other 2 lengths are known and also identify whether a triangle is a right triangle if the lengths of all 3 sides are given.


Because finding the length of an unknown side involves calculating square roots, this is an opportunity for your child to develop skills using a calculator.

, Your child should have a rudimentary understanding of statistics (mean, median, mode, and range) and be able to read and create bar graphs, line graphs, and pie charts, as well as be able to plot points on a 2-dimensional grid.

, Patterns that show constant ranges of change (such as 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) relate to both algebra and geometry. Your child should be able to recognize the nature of a pattern and project what the next number in a numeric sequence will be.

, Variables are unknown or varying quantities in equations represented in algebra by letters. This concept is often introduced several years before elementary algebra by using boxes or blanks to represent the unknown quantities. Your child should be able to understand the concept of variables in this format and be able to find the value of the unknown quantity.

, A function is the relationship between an input number and a single, resulting output number. (If a function were defined as adding 7 to each number, 1 would be an input and 8 its corresponding output.) Your child should be able to calculate the output number for a given input number and function, build a table of input and output values for a given function, and construct a line graph from a table of input and output values.

Set up your equation so that it looks something like x2 + 5x + 4.,
Give your equation an ""a"", ""b"", and ""c"" number.,
Write down all the factor pairs of your ""c"" value.,
Find the factor pair that, when added together, equals ""b"".,
Put that factor pair into two binomials.,
Solve each factor by moving the constant over to the other side of the equation.,
Finished.",How to Find the Zeros of a Function1," Start with your biggest terms and move successively down, until you get to your constant. You want your big polynomial, such as or x2, to be the first term, and then to successively go down to smaller terms, until the last term is just a single number, like 8 or 4. Add an equals sign and a zero to the end of each term.


Polynomial terms that have been ordered correctly:
x2 + 5x + 6 = 0
x2 - 2x – 3 = 0


Polynomial terms that have been ordered incorrectly:
5x + 6 = -x2

x2 = 2x + 3

;
, There's no math involved in this step. It's purely for setting things up so that you can factor easier when the time comes. Think of your equation as having a format. The format of the equation is ax2 ± bx ± c = 0. Simply find out the a, b, and c values in your equation. Here are some examples:


x2 + 5x + 6 = 0

a = 1 (no number in front of ""x"" = 1, as there is still one ""x"" being squared)

b = 5

c = 6


x2 - 2x – 3 = 0

a = 1 (no number in front of ""x"" = 1, as there is still one ""x"" being squared)

b = -2

c = -3



, A factor pair is two numbers that, multiplied together, equal that number. Pay special attention to negative numbers. Two negative numbers multiplied together equal a positive number. Order doesn't matter here. (""1 x 4"" is the same as ""4 x 1"".)


Equation: x2 + 5x + 6 = 0

Factor pairs of 6, or c:
1 x 6 = 6
-1 x -6 = 6
2 x 3 = 6
-2 x -3 = 6



, Look at your b value and find which of your factor pairs add up to that number.



b value = 5
Factor pair whose sum equals 5 = 2 and 3
2 + 3 = 5



, A binomial is just (x ± number)(x ± number). How do you know if it's a plus sign or minus sign that you put into the binomial? You look at the factor pair numbers: positive number = plus sign, negative number = minus sign. Here is the factor pair that we've put into a binomial:


(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0

, Break the two binomials apart — (x + 2) = 0 and (x + 3) = 0 — and then ""solve"" the equation by adding or subtracting to isolate the variable and the constant:


(x + 2) = 0 becomes x = -2
(x + 3) = 0 becomes x = -3

, These are the zeroes of your function.

Use slope to determine how steep, and in what direction (upward or downward), a line goes.,
Find the number in front of the x, usually written as ""m,"" to determine slope.,
Reorganize the equation so one variable is isolated if the slope isn't apparent.",How to Find the Slope of an Equation1," Finding the slope of a line is easy, as long as you have or can setup a linear equation. This method works if and only if:

There are no exponents on the variables

There are only two variables, neither of which are fractions (for example, you would not have 1x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{x}}}

The equation can be simplified to the form y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}, where m and b are constants (numbers like 3, 10, -12, 43,35{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{3}},{\frac {3}{5}}}).;
, If your equation is already in the right form, y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}, then simply pick the number in the ""m"" position (but if there is no number written in front of x then the slope is 1). That is your slope! Note that this number, m, is always multiplied by the variable, in this case an ""x."" Check the following examples:


y=2x+6{\displaystyle y=2x+6}


Slope = 2 




y=2−x{\displaystyle y=2-x}


Slope = -1 




y=38x−10{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{8}}x-10}


Slope = 38{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{8}}} , You can add, subtract, multiply, and more to isolate a variable, usually the ""y."" Just remember that, whatever you do to one side of the equal sign (like add 3) you must do to the other side as well. Your final goal is an equation similar to y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}. For example:


Find the slope of 2y−3=8x+7{\displaystyle 2y-3=8x+7}


Set to the form y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}:


2y−3+3=8x+7+3{\displaystyle 2y-3+3=8x+7+3}


2y=8x+10{\displaystyle 2y=8x+10}


2y2=8x+102{\displaystyle {\frac {2y}{2}}={\frac {8x+10}{2}}}


y=4x+5{\displaystyle y=4x+5}




Find the slope:

Write your equation in the quadratic form.,
Plug a, b, and c into x = (-b +/-√(b2 - 4ac))/2a.,
Solve.,
Add and subtract to get two final answers.,
Check your answers.,
Alternatively, check your answers manually.",How to Find the Roots of a Quadratic Equation1," The official definition of a quadratic equation is a second-order polynomial equation expressed in a single variable, x, with a ≠ 0.In simple terms, this just means that it's an equation with one variable (usually x) where the highest exponent of the variable is 2. In general terms, we can write this as ax2 + bx + c = 0


To get an equation in quadratic form, just get all of the terms on one side of the equals sign so that you have 0 on the other side. For example, if we want to get the equation 2x2 + 8x = -5x2 - 11 in quadratic form, we can do it like this:
2x2 + 8x = -5x2 + 11
2x2 + 5x2 + 8x = + 11
2x2 + 5x2 + 8x - 11 = 0

7x2 + 8x - 11 = 0 . Notice that this is in the standard ax2+ bx + c = 0 form mentioned above.;
, Finding the roots of a quadratic equation with the quadratic formula is easy - just use plug a, b, and c into the formula and solve for x! Since the form of a quadratic equation is ax2+ bx + c = 0, this means the number next to the x2 term is a, the number next to the x term is b, and the number without an x term is c.


For our example equation, 7x2 + 8x - 11 = 0, a = 7, b = 8, and c = -11.

Plugging this into the formula, we get x = (-8 +/-√(82 - 4(7)(-11)))/2(7)


, Once you've plugged your a, b, and c values into your formula, solving is just a matter of doing basic algebra operations until you get to the +/- symbol. We'll deal with that in the next step.


In our example, we'd solve like this:
x = (-8 +/-√(82 - 4(7)(-11)))/2(7)
x = (-8 +/-√(64 - (28)(-11)))/(14)
x = (-8 +/-√(64 - (-308)))/(14)
x = (-8 +/-√(372))/(14)
x = (-8 +/- 19.29/(14) . Let's stop here for now.

, One of the tricky things about finding the roots of a quadratic equation is that you'll usually get two correct answers (if you're doing quadratic equations for school work, don't forget to list both to get full points!) To get both answers, finish solving the equation for x, once using a + and once using a -.


Adding, we get:
x = (-8 + 19.29)/(14)
x = 11.29/14
x = 0.81

Subtracting, we get:
x = (-8 - 19.29)/(14)
x = (-27.29)/(14)
x = -1.95 .
Thus, our answers are 0.81 and -1.95.


, If you have time, it's a good idea to check the roots of your quadratic equation once you've found them. Since solving a quadratic equation involves doing a long string of math operations, it's easy to make simple mistakes that can affect your answers. Luckily, the easy checking methods below should reveal whether or not you've got the right roots.


The quickest, easiest way to check your answer is to simply plug your a, b, and c terms into an automatic quadratic solving program. These are easily found online — for instance, here is one from mathisfun.com., If you're in a situation where you can't use a handy online tool to check your answers, you can still see whether you have the correct roots by plugging them in for x in your original equation. If your equation comes out to zero (or very close to it — this is usually due to rounding), you have the correct roots.


Let's plug our answers back in to 7x2 + 8x - 11 = 0 to see if they are correct:
7(-1.95)2 + 8(-1.95) - 11
26.62 - 15.6 - 11
26.62 - 26.5 = 0.02 — this is almost zero, so the difference is probably from rounding and not from having the wrong answer.
7(0.81)2 + 8(0.81) - 11
4.59 + 6.48 - 11 = 0.07 — see above. Our answers are most likely correct.

Calculate -b/2a.,
Find the corresponding f(x) value.,
Report your results.",How to Find the Maximum or Minimum Value of a Quadratic Function Easily1," A quadratic function is one that has an x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term. It may or may not contain an x{\displaystyle x} term without an exponent. There will be no exponents larger than 2. The general form is f(x)=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c}. If necessary, combine similar terms and rearrange to set the function in this general form.For example, suppose you start with f(x)=3x+2x−x2+3x2+4{\displaystyle f(x)=3x+2x-x^{2}+3x^{2}+4}. Combine the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} terms and the x{\displaystyle x} terms to get the following in general form:


f(x)=2x2+5x+4{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+5x+4}


;
, A quadratic function results in the graph of a parabola. The parabola either opens upward or downward. If a{\displaystyle a}, the coefficient of the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term, is positive, then the parabola opens upward. If a{\displaystyle a} is negative, then the parabola opens downward. Look at the following examples:For f(x)=2x2+4x−6{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+4x-6}, a=2{\displaystyle a=2} so the parabola opens upward.

For f(x)=−3x2+2x+8{\displaystyle f(x)=-3x^{2}+2x+8}, a=−3{\displaystyle a=-3} so the parabola opens downward.

For f(x)=x2+6{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+6}, a=1{\displaystyle a=1} so the parabola opens upward.

If the parabola opens upward, you will be finding its minimum value. If the parabola opens downward, you will find its maximum value.


, The value of −b2a{\displaystyle -{\frac {b}{2a}}} tells you the x{\displaystyle x} value of the vertex of the parabola. When the quadratic function is written in its general form of ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c}, use the coefficients of the x{\displaystyle x} and x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} terms as follows:

For a function f(x)=x2+10x−1{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+10x-1}, a=1{\displaystyle a=1} and b=10{\displaystyle b=10}. Therefore, find the x-value of the vertex as:


x=−b2a{\displaystyle x=-{\frac {b}{2a}}}


x=−10(2)(1){\displaystyle x=-{\frac {10}{(2)(1)}}}


x=−102{\displaystyle x=-{\frac {10}{2}}}


x=−5{\displaystyle x=-5}



As a second example, consider the function f(x)=−3x2+6x−4{\displaystyle f(x)=-3x^{2}+6x-4}. In this example, a=−3{\displaystyle a=-3} and b=6{\displaystyle b=6}. Therefore, find the x-value of the vertex as:


x=−b2a{\displaystyle x=-{\frac {b}{2a}}}


x=−6(2)(−3){\displaystyle x=-{\frac {6}{(2)(-3)}}}


x=−6−6{\displaystyle x=-{\frac {6}{-6}}}


x=−(−1){\displaystyle x=-(-1)}


x=1{\displaystyle x=1}




, Insert the value of x that you just calculated into the function to find the corresponding value of f(x). This will be the minimum or maximum of the function.

For the first example above, f(x)=x2+10x−1{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+10x-1}, you calculated the x-value for the vertex to be x=−5{\displaystyle x=-5}. Enter −5{\displaystyle -5} in place of x{\displaystyle x} in the function to find the maximum value:


f(x)=x2+10x−1{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+10x-1}


f(x)=(−5)2+10(−5)−1{\displaystyle f(x)=(-5)^{2}+10(-5)-1}


f(x)=25−50−1{\displaystyle f(x)=25-50-1}


f(x)=−26{\displaystyle f(x)=-26}



For the second example above, f(x)=−3x2+6x−4{\displaystyle f(x)=-3x^{2}+6x-4}, you found the vertex to be at x=1{\displaystyle x=1}. Insert 1{\displaystyle 1} in place of x{\displaystyle x} in the function to find the maximum value:


f(x)=−3x2+6x−4{\displaystyle f(x)=-3x^{2}+6x-4}


f(x)=−3(1)2+6(1)−4{\displaystyle f(x)=-3(1)^{2}+6(1)-4}


f(x)=−3+6−4{\displaystyle f(x)=-3+6-4}


f(x)=−1{\displaystyle f(x)=-1}




, Review the question you have been asked. If you are asked for the coordinates of the vertex, you need to report both the x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} (or f(x){\displaystyle f(x)}) values. If you are only asked for the maximum or minimum, you only need to report the y{\displaystyle y} (or f(x){\displaystyle f(x)}) value. Refer back to the value of the a{\displaystyle a} coefficient to be sure if you have a maximum or a minimum.

For the first example, f(x)=x2+10x−1{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+10x-1}, the value of a{\displaystyle a} is positive, so you will be reporting the minimum value. The vertex is at (−5,−26){\displaystyle (-5,-26)}, and the minimum value is −26{\displaystyle -26}.

For the second example, f(x)=−3x2+6x−4{\displaystyle f(x)=-3x^{2}+6x-4}, the value of a{\displaystyle a} is negative, so you will be reporting the maximum value. The vertex is at (1,−1){\displaystyle (1,-1)}, and the maximum value is −1{\displaystyle -1}.

All you need are two points on the line, which you plug into the equation y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle {\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}. While finding the slope, keep in mind the following information to help you check if you're on the right track:

Positive slopes go higher the further right you go.

Negative slopes go lower the further right you go.

Bigger slopes are steeper lines. Small slopes are always more gradual.

Perfectly horizontal lines have a slope of zero.

Perfectly vertical lines do not have a slope at all. Their slope is ""undefined."", Use the graph (or the test question) to find the x and y coordinates of two points on the graph. They can be any two points that the line crosses through. For an example, assume that the line in this method goes through (2,4) and (6,6).In each pair, the x coordinate is the first number, the y coordinate comes after the comma.

Each x coordinate on a line has an associated y coordinate.


, Continuing our first example, with the points (2,4) and (6,6), label the x and y coordinates of each point. You should end up with:


x1: 2


y1: 4


x2: 6


y2: 6, The following formula is used to find slope using any two points on a straight line: y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle {\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}. Simply plug in your four points and simplify:

Simplify for Final Answer:


24=12{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}={\frac {1}{2}}} = Slope




, The slope of a line is “Rise over Run:” how much the line goes up divided by how much the line ""runs"" to the right. The “rise” of the line is the difference between the y-values (remember, the Y-axis goes up and down), and the “run” of the line is the difference between the x-values (and the X-axis goes left and right).
, The equation of the slope is y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle {\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}. This may also be shown using the Greek letter “Δ”, called “delta”, meaning “difference of”.

Check your point against a graph whenever possible.",How to Find the Slope of an Equation3," Derivatives give you the rate of change (or slope) at a single point on a line. The line can be curved or straight -- it doesn't matter. Think of it as how much the line is changing at any time, instead of the slope of the entire line. How you take derivatives changes depending on the type of function you have, so review how to take common derivatives before moving on.


Review taking derivatives here

The most simple derivatives, those for basic exponential equations, are easy to find using a simple shortcut. This will be used for the rest of the method.


, You will not always be asked to explicitly find the derivative or slope of a curve. You might also be asked for the ""rate of change at point (x,y). You could be asked for an equation for the slope of the graph, which simply means you need to take the derivative. Finally, you may be asked for ""the slope of the tangent line at (x,y)."" This, once again, just wants the slope of the curve at a specific point, (x,y).

For this method, consider the question: ""What is the slope of the line f(x)=2x2+6x{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x} at the point (4,2)?""The derivative is often written as f′(x),y′,{\displaystyle f'(x),y',} or dydx{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}}, You don't even really need you graph, just the function or equation for your graph. For this example, use the function from earlier, f(x)=2x2+6x{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x}. Following the methods outlined here, take the derivative of this simple function.


Derivative: f′(x)=4x+6{\displaystyle f'(x)=4x+6}


, The differential of a function will tell you the slope of the function at a given point. In other words, f’(x) is slope of the function at any point (x,f(x)) So, for the practice problem:

What is the slope of the line f(x)=2x2+6x{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x} at the point (4,2)?


Derivative of Equation:


f′(x)=4x+6{\displaystyle f'(x)=4x+6}




Plug in Point for x:


f′(x)=4(4)+6{\displaystyle f'(x)=4(4)+6}




Find the Slope:

The slope of the f(x)=2x2+6x{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x} at (4,2) is 22.


, Know that not all points in calculus will have a slope. Calculus gets into complex equations and difficult graphs, and not all points will have a slope, or even exist on every graph. Whenever possible, use a graphing calculator to check the slope of your graph. If you can't, draw the tangent line using your point and the slope (remember -- ""rise over run"") and note if it looks like it could be correct.

Tangent lines are just lines with the exact same slope as your point on the curve. To draw one, go up (positive) or down (negative) your slope (in the case of the example, 22 points up). Then move over one and draw a point. Connect the dots, (4,2) and (26,3) for your line.

Fill in the blanks and solve for x as normal.",How to Find the Roots of a Quadratic Equation2," Though the quadratic formula described above is a valuable tool, it isn't the only way to solve quadratic equations. For example, some quadratic equations can be factored, which involves rewriting them in a way that makes them easy to solve. To start, however, you'll want to have your equation in standard quadratic form: ax2 + bx + c = 0.


In this section, we'll only be dealing with quadratics that have an ""a"" variable equal to 1. If the a variable is not 1, the process is a little harder (see below.) Let's use x2 + 7x + 12 = 0 as our example equation in this section. In the next few steps, we'll factor and solve our equation.

, ""Factoring"" is just a term that means ""finding the values that multiply together to give you something else."" In this case, we're trying to break our quadratic equation down to its factors. Since the x term with the highest exponent is x2 (or, in other words, x × x), we'll start by setting up the factored form of the equation like this: (x + _)(x + _) = 0.


Note the blank spaces — in the next few steps, we'll fill these in to complete the factored equation.

, Next, list all of the numbers that can multiply together to give you the c term in your quadratic equation. These are its factors.


In our equation (x2 + 7x + 12 = 0), 12 is our c term. The numbers that can multiply to make 12 are: 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4. This means the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.


, From your short list of numbers that multiply together to make your c value, pick the two that add up to make your b term. To be clear, you're not looking for factors of your b term — just two numbers that add together to make it.


In our equation (x2 + 7x + 12 = 0), our b term is 7. Our list of factors for c are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. 3 and 4 add up to 7, so these are the numbers we want.
If there weren't two numbers in this list of factors that added up to 7, we would say that the equation is ""unfactorable over the integers.""Basically, for our purposes, this means that the equation can't be factored and that we'll have to use another method to find the roots.

, Now, simply fill in the blanks in the factored form of the equation you've prepared with the two numbers you just chose from the list of factors. This gives you the factored form of your original quadratic equation.


Let's fill in the blanks in the factored form of our quadratic equation: (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0.


, Now, all you need to do to find the roots of your original quadratic equation is to set the terms in each parentheses equal to 0 and solve for x. Since the terms in parentheses are multiplied by each other, if either one equals zero, the entire equation will. Thus, the roots of the equations are the x values that get each set of terms in parentheses to equal zero.


In our example, our terms in parentheses are (x + 3) and (x + 4) = 0. Setting each of these equal to zero, we get:
x + 3 = 0: x = -3

x + 4 = 0: x = -4

Note that we can check these two answers exactly as we would if we had used the quadratic formula to find them.

, If the a term in a quadratic equation isn't equal to one, it gets a little harder to factor, but it can still be possible. Start by breaking the a term into its factors — because there's an x2 in the a term, both factors will contain x.


In this section, let's use 2x2 + 14x + 12 = 0 as our example equation. In this case, 2x2 is our a term. Since 2 is a prime number, its only factors are 2 and 1. This means that, for our purposes, the factors of 2x2 are 2x and x.

Note that there are cases where there are more than two factors for the a term. If we were dealing with 8x2, for instance, we'd have 8x and x plus 2x and 4x. In this case, we've have to test both to find the set that fits.

, We start to factor almost exactly as in the section above. However, this time, at least one of our x terms will have a coefficient next to it (sometimes, both will — it depends on the factors you've broken your a term into.)In our example, we would set up our equation like this: (2x + _)(x + _).


, This part is exactly the same as in the section above — you're just looking for the numbers that can multiply together to give you your c value.


In our example, since our c term is still 12, our list of factors is the same: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.


, This part is tricky — you want to pick two numbers that, when plugged in to the factored form of your equation, will give you the b term in your original quadratic equation. Keep in mind, though, that this time you won't just have two x's in the factored form of your equation — you'll have at least one x term with a coefficient.


In our example, our b term is 14x. This means we want to find two numbers from our list of c factors that, when we multiply one by 2x and the other by x, will give us a total of 14x.
Let's try our factors from before: 3 and 4. 3 × 2x = 6x, 4 × x = 4x. 4x + 6x = 10x. This doesn't work, so let's flip them around. 4 × 2x = 8x, 3 × x = 3x. 8x + 3x = 11x. We don't get 14x either way, so this set of factors isn't right.
Now, let's try 6 and 2. 6 × 2x = 12x, 2 × x = 2x. 12x + 2x = 14x. Success! We'll use 6 and 2 to fill in the blanks in our factored equation.

, Now, use the two factors you just found to fill in the blanks in your factored equation. Keep in mind that you need to put each in the right space so that when they multiply by the x terms you get the correct b term. After this, just set each set of parentheses equal to zero and solve as before.


In this case, our equation would be (2x + 2)(x + 6) = 0. Setting each half equal to zero, we get:
2x + 2 = 0
2x = -2 : x = -1

x + 6 = 0 : x = -6

Determine the direction of the graph.,
Identify the minimum or maximum value.,
Find the vertex.",How to Find the Maximum or Minimum Value of a Quadratic Function Easily2," The standard form of a general quadratic function, which can also be called the vertex form, looks like this:f(x)=a(x−h)2+k{\displaystyle f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k}

If your function is already given to you in this form, you just need to recognize the variables a{\displaystyle a}, h{\displaystyle h} and k{\displaystyle k}. If your function begins in the general form f(x)=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c}, you will need to complete the square to rewrite it in vertex form.

To review how to complete the square, see Complete the Square.


, Just as with a quadratic function written in its general form, you can tell the direction of the parabola by looking at the coefficient a{\displaystyle a}. If a{\displaystyle a} in this standard form is positive, then the parabola opens upward. If a{\displaystyle a} is negative, then the parabola opens downward. Look at the following examples:For f(x)=2(x+1)2−4{\displaystyle f(x)=2(x+1)^{2}-4}, a=2{\displaystyle a=2}, which is positive, so the parabola opens upward.

For f(x)=−3(x−2)2+2{\displaystyle f(x)=-3(x-2)^{2}+2}, a=−3{\displaystyle a=-3}, which is negative, so the parabola opens downward.

If the parabola opens upward, you will be finding its minimum value. If the parabola opens downward, you will find its maximum value.


, When the function is written in standard form, finding the minimum or maximum value is as simple as stating the value of the variable k{\displaystyle k}. For the two example functions given above, these values are:

For f(x)=2(x+1)2−4{\displaystyle f(x)=2(x+1)^{2}-4}, k=−4{\displaystyle k=-4}. This is the minimum value of the function because this parabola opens upward.

For f(x)=−3(x−2)2+2{\displaystyle f(x)=-3(x-2)^{2}+2}, k=2{\displaystyle k=2}. This is the maximum value of the function, because this parabola opens downward.


, If you are asked for the coordinates of the minimum or maximum value, the point will be (h,k){\displaystyle (h,k)}. Note, however, that in the standard form of the equation, the term inside the parentheses is (x−h){\displaystyle (x-h)}, so you need the opposite sign of the number that follows the x{\displaystyle x}.

For f(x)=2(x+1)2−4{\displaystyle f(x)=2(x+1)^{2}-4}, the term inside the parentheses is (x+1), which can be rewritten as (x-(-1)). Thus, h=−1{\displaystyle h=-1}. Therefore, the coordinates of the vertex for this function are (−1,−4){\displaystyle (-1,-4)}.

For f(x)=−3(x−2)2+2{\displaystyle f(x)=-3(x-2)^{2}+2}, the term inside the parentheses is (x-2). Therefore, h=2{\displaystyle h=2}. The coordinates of the vertex are (2, 2).

If necessary, you may need to combine like terms and rearrange to get the proper form.Begin with the sample function f(x)=2x2−4x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}-4x+1}.


, Using basic first-year calculus, you can find the first derivative of the general quadratic function to be f′(x)=2ax+b{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=2ax+b}.For the sample function f(x)=2x2−4x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}-4x+1}, find the derivative as:


f′(x)=4x−4{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=4x-4}




, Recall that derivative of a function tells you the slope of the function at that selected point. The minimum or maximum of a function occurs when the slope is zero. Therefore, to find where the minimum or maximum occurs, set the derivative equal to zero. Continue with the sample problem from above:f′(x)=4x−4{\displaystyle f^{\prime }(x)=4x-4}


0=4x−4{\displaystyle 0=4x-4}


, Use basic rules of algebra to rearrange the function and solve the value for x, when the derivative equals zero. This solution will tell you the x-coordinate of the vertex of the function, which is where the maximum or minimum will occur.0=4x−4{\displaystyle 0=4x-4}


4=4x{\displaystyle 4=4x}


1=x{\displaystyle 1=x}


, The minimum or maximum value of the function will be the value for f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} at the selected x{\displaystyle x} position. Insert your value of x{\displaystyle x} into the original function and solve to find the minimum or maximum.For the function f(x)=2x2−4x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}-4x+1} at x=1{\displaystyle x=1},


f(1)=2(1)2−4(1)+1{\displaystyle f(1)=2(1)^{2}-4(1)+1}


f(1)=2−4+1{\displaystyle f(1)=2-4+1}


f(1)=−1{\displaystyle f(1)=-1}




, The solution gives you the vertex of the maximum or minimum point. For this sample function, f(x)=2x2−4x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}-4x+1}, the vertex occurs at (1,−1){\displaystyle (1,-1)}. The coefficient a{\displaystyle a} is positive, so the function opens upward. Therefore, the minimum value of the function is the y-coordinate of the vertex, which is −1{\displaystyle -1}."

Simplify by combining like terms.,
Determine the domain and range of the simplified function.,
Switch the roles of the x and y terms.,
Rewrite the inverted equation in terms of y.,
Determine the domain and range of the inverse function.,
Check that your inverse function works.",How to Find the Inverse of a Quadratic Function1," If you have the “right” kind of function to begin, you can find the inverse using some simple algebra. This form is something of a variation of y=ax2+c{\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c}. Comparing this to a standard form quadratic function, y=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+bx+c}, you should notice that the central term, bx{\displaystyle bx}, is missing. Another way to say this is that the value of b is 0. If your function is in this form, finding the inverse is fairly easy.

Your beginning function does not have to look exactly like y=ax2+c{\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c}. As long as you can look at it and see that the function consists only of x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} terms and constant numbers, you will be able to use this method.

For example, suppose you begin with the equation, 2y−6+x2=y+3x2−4{\displaystyle 2y-6+x^{2}=y+3x^{2}-4}. A quick examination of this equation shows that there are no terms of x{\displaystyle x} to the first power. This equation is a candidate for this method to find an inverse function.
;
, The initial equation may have multiple terms in a combination of addition and subtraction. Your first step is to combine like terms to simplify the equation and rewrite it in the standard format of y=ax2+c{\displaystyle y=ax^{2}+c}.

Taking the sample equation, 2y−6+x2=y+3x2−4{\displaystyle 2y-6+x^{2}=y+3x^{2}-4}, the y-terms can be consolidated on the left by subtracting a y from both sides. The other terms can be consolidated on the right by adding 6 to both sides and subtracting x^2 from both sides. The resulting equation will be y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}.


, Recall that the domain of a function consists of the possible values of x that can be applied to provide a real solution. The range of a function consists of the values of y that will result. To determine the domain of the function, look for values that create a mathematically impossible result. You will then report the domain as all other values of x. To find the range, consider the values of y at any boundary points and look at the behavior of the function.Consider the sample equation y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}. There is no limitation on allowable values of x for this equation. However, you should recognize that this is the equation of a parabola, centered at x=0, and a parabola is not a function because it does not consist of a one-to-one mapping of x and y values. To limit this equation and make it a function, for which we can find an inverse, we must define the domain as x≥0. 

The range is similarly limited. Notice that the first term, 2x2{\displaystyle 2x^{2}}, will always be positive or 0, for any value of x. When the equation then adds +2, the range will be any values y≥2.

Defining the domain and range at this early stage is necessary. You will use these definitions later in defining the domain and range of the inverse function. In fact, the domain of the original function will become the range of the inverse function, and the range of the original will become the domain of the inverse., Without changing the equation in any other way, you need to replace all appearance of y with an x, and all appearances of x with a y. This is the step that actually “inverts” the equation.Working with the sample equation y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}, this inversion step will result in the new equation of x=2y2+2{\displaystyle x=2y^{2}+2}.

An alternate format is to replace the y terms with x, but replace the x terms with either y−1{\displaystyle y^{-}1} or f(x)−1{\displaystyle f(x)^{-}1} to indicate the inverse function.


, Using a combination of algebraic steps, and taking care to perform the same operation evenly on both sides of the equation, you will need to isolate the y variable. For the working equation x=2y2+2{\displaystyle x=2y^{2}+2}, this revision will look like the following:x=2y2+2{\displaystyle x=2y^{2}+2}   (original starting point)


x−2=2y2{\displaystyle x-2=2y^{2}}    (subtract 2 from both sides)


x−22=y2{\displaystyle {\frac {x-2}{2}}=y^{2}}     (divide both sides by 2)

±x−22=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {x-2}{2}}}=y}     (square root of both sides; remember that the square root results in both positive and negative possible answers)


, As you did at the beginning, examine the inverted equation to define its domain and range. With two possible solutions, you will select the one that has a domain and range that are inverses of the original domain and range.Examine the sample equation solution of ±x−22=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {x-2}{2}}}=y}. Because the square root function is not defined for any negative values, the term x−22{\displaystyle {\frac {x-2}{2}}} must always be positive. Therefore, allowable values of x (the domain) must be x≥2. Using that as the domain, the resulting values of y (the range) are either all values y≥0, if you take the positive solution of the square root, or y≤0, if you select the negative solution of the square root. Recall that you originally defined the domain as x≥0, in order to be able to find the inverse function. Therefore, the correct solution for the inverse function is the positive option.

Compare the domain and range of the inverse to the domain and range of the original. Recall that for the original function, y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}, the domain was defined as all values of x≥0, and the range was defined as all values y≥2. For the inverse function, now, these values switch, and the domain is all values x≥2, and the range is all values of y≥0.


, To make sure that your work is correct and your inverse is the right equation, select any value for x and place it into the original equation to find y. Then, put that value of y in the place of x in your inverse equation, and see if you generate the number that you started with. If so, your inverse function is correct.As a sample, select the value x=1 to place in the original equation y=2x2+2{\displaystyle y=2x^{2}+2}. This gives the result y=4. 

Next, place that value of 4 into the inverse function x−22=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {x-2}{2}}}=y}. This does give the result of y=1. You can conclude that your inverse function is correct.

Write the result as your answer.",How to Find the Degree of a Polynomial," Combine all of the like terms in the expression so you can simplify it, if they are not combined already. Let's say you're working with the following expression: 3x2 - 3x4 - 5 + 2x + 2x2 - x. Just combine all of the x2, x, and constant terms of the expression to get 5x2 - 3x4 - 5 + x.;
, The constant terms are all of the terms that are not attached to a variable, such as 3 or 5. The coefficients are the terms that are attached to the variable. When you're looking for the degree of a polynomial, you can either just actively ignore these terms or cross them off. For instance, the coefficient of the term 5x2 would be 5. The degree is independent of the coefficients, so you don't need them.


Working with the equation 5x2 - 3x4 - 5 + x, you would drop the constants and coefficients to get x2 - x4 + x.

, This is also called putting the polynomial in standard form.. The term with the highest exponent should be first, and the term with the lowest exponent should be last. This will help you see which term has the exponent with the largest value. In the previous example, you would be left with
-x4 + x2 + x.

, The power is simply number in the exponent. In the example, -x4 + x2 + x, the power of the first term is 4. Since you've arranged the polynomial to put the largest exponent first, that will be where you will find the largest term.

, You can just write that the degree of the polynomial = 4, or you can write the answer in a more appropriate form: deg (3x2 - 3x4 - 5 + 2x + 2x2 - x) = 3. You're all done., If your polynomial is only a constant, such as 15 or 55, then the degree of that polynomial is really zero. You can think of the constant term as being attached to a variable to the degree of 0, which is really 1. For example, if you have the constant 15, you can think of it as 15x0, which is really 15 x 1, or 15. This proves that the degree of a constant is 0.

, Finding the degree of a polynomial with multiple variables is only a little bit trickier than finding the degree of a polynomial with one variable. Let's say you're working with the following expression:


x5y3z + 2xy3 + 4x2yz2


, Just add up the degrees of the variables in each of the terms; it does not matter that they are different variables. Remember that the degree of a variable without a written degree, such as x or y, is just one. Here's how you do it for all three terms:x5y3z = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9
2xy3 = 1 + 3 = 4
4x2yz2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

, The largest degree of these three terms is 9, the value of the added degree values of the first term.

, 9 is the degree of the entire polynomial. You can write the final answer like this: deg (x5y3z + 2xy3 + 4x2yz2) = 9.

, Let's say you're working with the following expression: (x2 + 1)/(6x -2)., You won't need the coefficients or constant terms to find the degree of a polynomial with fractions. So, eliminate the 1 from the numerator and the 6 and -2 from the denominator. You're left with x2/x.

, The degree of the variable in the numerator is 2 and the degree of the variable in the denominator is 1. So, subtract 1 from 2. 2-1 = 1.

, The degree of this rational expression is 1. You can write it like this: deg = 1.

Find the common difference for the sequence.,
Check that the common difference is consistent.,
Add the common difference to the last given term.",How to Find Any Term of an Arithmetic Sequence1," When you are presented with a list of numbers, you may be told that the list is an arithmetic sequence, or you may need to figure that out for yourself. The first step is the same in either case. Select the first two consecutive terms in the list. Subtract the first term from the second term. The result is the common difference of your sequence.For example, suppose you have the list 1,4,7,10,13{\displaystyle 1,4,7,10,13}.... Subtract 4−1{\displaystyle 4-1} to find the common difference of 3.

Suppose you have a list of terms that decreases, such as 25,21,17,13{\displaystyle 25,21,17,13}…. You still subtract the first term from the second to find the difference. In this case, that gives you 21−25=−4{\displaystyle 21-25=-4}. The negative result means that your list is decreasing as you read from left to right. You should always check that the sign of the difference matches the direction that the numbers seem to be going.
;
, Finding the common difference for just the first two terms does not ensure that your list is an arithmetic sequence. You need to make sure that the difference is consistent for the whole list. Check the difference by subtracting two different consecutive terms in the list. If the result is consistent for one or two other pairs of terms, then you probably have an arithmetic sequence. 

Working with the same example, 1,4,7,10,13{\displaystyle 1,4,7,10,13}… choose the second and third terms of the list. Subtract 7−4{\displaystyle 7-4}, and you find that the difference is still 3. To confirm, check one more example and subtract 13−10{\displaystyle 13-10}, and you find that the difference is consistently 3. You can be pretty sure that you are working with an arithmetic sequence.

It is possible for a list of numbers to appear to be an arithmetic sequence based on the first few terms, but then fail after that. For example, consider the list 1,2,3,6,9{\displaystyle 1,2,3,6,9}…. The difference between the first and second terms is 1, and the difference between the second and third terms is also 1. However, the difference between the third and fourth terms is 3. Because the difference is not common for the entire list, then this is not an arithmetic sequence.


, Finding the next term of an arithmetic sequence after you know the common difference is easy. Simply add the common difference to the last term of the list, and you will get the next number.

For example, in the example of 1,4,7,10,13{\displaystyle 1,4,7,10,13}…, to find the next number in the list, add the common difference of 3 to the last given term. Adding 13+3{\displaystyle 13+3} results in 16, which is the next term. You can continue adding 3 to make your list as long as you like. For example, the list would be 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25{\displaystyle 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25}…. You can do this as long as you like.

Take the coordinates of two points you want to find the distance between.,
Know the distance formula.,
Find the horizontal and vertical distance between the points.,
Square both values.,
Add the squared values together.,
Take the square root of the equation.",How to Find the Distance Between Two Points," Call one point Point 1 (x1,y1) and make the other Point 2 (x2,y2). It does not terribly matter which point is which, as long as you keep the labels (1 and 2) consistent throughout the problem.x1 is the horizontal coordinate (along the x axis) of Point 1, and x2 is the horizontal coordinate of Point 2. y1 is the vertical coordinate (along the y axis) of Point 1, and y2 is the vertical coordinate of Point 2.

For an example, take the points (3,2) and (7,8). If (3,2) is (x1,y1), then (7,8) is (x2,y2).
;
, This formula finds the length of a line that stretches between two points: Point 1 and Point 2. The linear distance is the square root of the square of the horizontal distance plus the square of the vertical distance between two points. More simply put, it is the square root of: (x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2{\displaystyle (x2-x1)^{2}+(y2-y1)^{2}}, First, subtract y2 - y1 to find the vertical distance. Then, subtract x2 - x1 to find the horizontal distance. Don't worry if the subtraction yields negative numbers. The next step is to square these values, and squaring always results in a positive integer.Find the distance along the y-axis. For the example points (3,2) and (7,8), in which (3,2) is Point 1 and (7,8) is Point 2: (y2 - y1) = 8 - 2 = 6. This means that there are six units of distance on the y-axis between these two points.

Find the distance along the x-axis. For the same example points (3,2) and (7,8): (x2 - x1) = 7 - 3 = 4. This means that there are four units of distance separating the two points on the x-axis.


, This means that you will square the x-axis distance (x2 - x1), and that you will separately square the y-axis distance (y2 - y1).


62=36{\displaystyle 6^{2}=36}


42=16{\displaystyle 4^{2}=16}


, This will give you the square of the diagonal, linear distance between your two points. In the example of the points (3,2) and (7,8), the square of (7 - 3) is 36, and the square of (8 - 2) is 16. 36 + 16 = 52.
, This is the final step in the equation. The linear distance between the two points is the square root of the sum of the squared values of the x-axis distance and the y-axis distance.To carry on the example: the distance between (3,2) and (7,8) is sqrt (52), or approximately 7.21 units.

Simply put, |−4|{\displaystyle |-4|} is just asking you how far away -4 is from zero. Since distance is always a positive number (you can't travel ""negative"" steps, just steps in a different direction), the result of absolute value is always positive.

, At it's most simple, absolute value makes any number positive. It is useful for measuring distance, or finding values in finances where you work with negative numbers like debt or loans., The notation for absolute value is easy. Single bars (or a ""pipe"" on a keyboard, found near the enter key) around a number or expression, like |n|,|3+5|,|−72|{\displaystyle |n|,|3+5|,|-72|}, indicates absolute value.


|2|{\displaystyle |2|} is read as ""the absolute value of 2."", For instance, |-5| would become |5|.
, The number remaining is your answer, so |-5| becomes |5| and then 5. This is all you need to do|−5|=5{\displaystyle |-5|=5} 


, If you've got a simple expression, like |−10|{\displaystyle |-10|}, you can just make the whole thing positive. But expressions like |(−4∗5)+3−2|{\displaystyle |(-4*5)+3-2|} need to be simplified before you can take the absolute value. The normal order of operations still applies:

Simplify inside parenthesis: |(−20)+3−2|{\displaystyle |(-20)+3-2|}


Add and Subtract:|−26|{\displaystyle |-26|}


Make everything inside the absolute value positive: |26|{\displaystyle |26|}


Final Answer: 26, When determining longer equations, you want to do all the possible work before finding the absolute value. You should not simplify absolute values until everything else has been added, subtracted, and divided successfully. For example:


Problem:1+2+|4−7|5∗|−3∗2|{\displaystyle {\frac {1+2+|4-7|}{5*|-3*2|}}} 


Perform the order of operations inside and outside the absolute value:3+|−3|5∗|−6|{\displaystyle {\frac {3+|-3|}{5*|-6|}}}

Simplify to final answer: 15{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5}}}, Absolute value is pretty easy, but that doesn't mean a few practice problems won't help you keep the knowledge:


|12|{\displaystyle |12|} = 12{\displaystyle 12}


|−24|{\displaystyle |-24|} =  24{\displaystyle 24}

Set up the quadratic equation in the proper form.,

Determine the domain and range of the inverse function.,
Check that your inverse function works.",How to Find the Inverse of a Quadratic Function2," In order to begin finding the inverse, you must begin with the equation in the format f(x)=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c}. If necessary, you may need to combine similar terms to get the equation into this format. With the equation written this way, you can begin to tell some information about it.The first thing to notice is the value of the coefficient a. If a>0, then the equation defines a parabola whose ends point upward. If a<0, the equation defines a parabola whose ends point downward. Notice that a≠0. If it did, then this would be a linear function and not quadratic.


, Before you can find the inverse function, you will need to rewrite your equation into the standard format. The standard format for any quadratic function is f(x)=a(x−h)2+k{\displaystyle f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k}. The numerical terms a, h and k will be developed as you transform the equation through a process known as completing the square.Notice that this standard format consists of a perfect square term, (x−h)2{\displaystyle (x-h)^{2}}, which is then adjusted by the other two elements a and k. To get to this perfect square form, you will need to create certain conditions in your quadratic equation.


, Remember that a quadratic function that is a perfect square originates with two binomials of (x+b)(x+b){\displaystyle (x+b)(x+b)}, or (x+b)2{\displaystyle (x+b)^{2}}. When you perform this multiplication, you get a result of x2+2bx+b2{\displaystyle x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}}. Thus, the first term of the quadratic is the first term of the binomial, squared, and the last term of the quadratic is the square of the second term of the binomial. The middle term is comprised of 2 times the product of the two terms, in this case 2∗x∗b{\displaystyle 2*x*b}.To complete the square, you will be working in reverse. You will start with x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} and some second x-term. From the coefficient of that term, which you can define as “2b,” you will need to find b2{\displaystyle b^{2}}. This will require a combination of dividing by two and then squaring that result.


, Recall the original form of the quadratic function ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c}. If the first coefficient is anything other than 1, then you must divide all terms by that value, to set a=1.For example, consider the quadratic function f(x)=2x2+6x−4{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x-4}. You must simplify this by dividing all terms by 2, to yield the resulting function  f(x)=2(x2+3x−2){\displaystyle f(x)=2(x^{2}+3x-2)}. The coefficient 2 will remain outside of the parentheses and will be part of your final solution.

If all terms are not multiples of a, you will wind up with fractional coefficients. For example, the function f(x)=3x2−2x+6{\displaystyle f(x)=3x^{2}-2x+6} will simplify to f(x)=3(x2−2x3+2){\displaystyle f(x)=3(x^{2}-{\frac {2x}{3}}+2)}. Work carefully with the fractions as necessary.


, You already have the first two terms of the perfect square quadratic. These are the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term and whatever coefficient appears in front of the x-term. By taking that coefficient to be whatever value it is, you will add or subtract whatever number is necessary to create a perfect square quadratic. Recall from above that the required third term of the quadratic is this second coefficient, divided by two, and then squared.For example, if the first two terms of your quadratic function are x2+3x{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x}, you will find the needed third term by dividing 3 by 2, which gives the result 3/2, and then squaring that, to get 9/4. The quadratic x2+3x+9/2{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x+9/2} is a perfect square.

As another example, suppose your first two terms are x2−4x{\displaystyle x^{2}-4x}. Half of the middle term is -2, and then you square that to get 4. The resulting perfect square quadratic is x2−4x+4{\displaystyle x^{2}-4x+4}.


, This is a tricky concept but it works. By both adding and subtracting the same number in different locations of your function, you are really making no change to the value of the function. However, doing this will allow you to get your function into the proper format.Suppose you have the function f(x)=x2−4x+9{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}-4x+9}. As noted above, you will use the first two terms to work on completing the square. Using the middle term of -4x, you will generate a third term of +4. Add and subtract 4 to the equation, in the form f(x)=(x2−4x+4)+9−4{\displaystyle f(x)=(x^{2}-4x+4)+9-4}. The parentheses are placed just to define the perfect square quadratic that you are creating. Notice the +4 inside the parentheses and the -4 on the outside. Simplify the numbers to give the result of f(x)=(x2−4x+4)+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x^{2}-4x+4)+5}.


, The polynomial inside the parentheses should be a perfect square quadratic, which you can rewrite in the form (x+b)2{\displaystyle (x+b)^{2}}. In the example from the prior step, f(x)=(x2−4x+4)+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x^{2}-4x+4)+5}, the quadratic factors into (x−2)2{\displaystyle (x-2)^{2}}. Carry along the rest of the equation, so your solution will be f(x)=(x−2)2+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x-2)^{2}+5}. This is the same function as your original quadratic, f(x)=x2−4x+9{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}-4x+9}, simply revised into standard f(x)=a(x−h)2+k{\displaystyle f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k} form.Notice that for this function, a=1, h=2, and k=5. The value of writing the equation in this form is that a, being positive, tells you that the parabola points upward. The values of (h,k) tell you the apex point at the bottom of the parabola, if you wanted to graph it.


, The domain is the set of x-values that can be used as input into the function. The range is the set of y-values that can be the outcome. Recall that a parabola is not a function with a definable inverse, because there is not a one-to-one mapping of x-values to y-values, as a result of the symmetry of the parabola. To resolve this problem, you need to define the domain as all values of x that are greater than x=h, the apex point of the parabola.Continue working with the sample function f(x)=(x−2)2+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x-2)^{2}+5}. Because this is in standard format, you can identify the apex point as x=2, y=5. Thus, to avoid the symmetry, you will only work with the right-side of the graph, and set the domain as all values x≥2. Inserting the value x=2 into the function gives the result of y=5. You can see that the values of y will increase as x increases. Therefore the range of this equation is y≥5. 


, This is the step where you begin to find the inverted form of the equation. Leave the equation in its entirety, except for switching these variables.Continue to work with the function f(x)=(x−2)2+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x-2)^{2}+5}. Insert x in place of f(x), and insert y (or f(x), if you prefer) in place of x. This will yield the new function x=(y−2)2+5{\displaystyle x=(y-2)^{2}+5}.


, Using a combination of algebraic steps, and taking care to perform the same operation evenly on both sides of the equation, you will need to isolate the y variable. For the working equation x=(y−2)2+5{\displaystyle x=(y-2)^{2}+5}, this revision will look like the following:x=(y−2)2+5{\displaystyle x=(y-2)^{2}+5}   (original starting point)


x−5=(y−2)2{\displaystyle x-5=(y-2)^{2}}    (subract 5 from both sides)

±x−5=y−2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-5}}=y-2}     (square root of both sides; remember that the square root results in both positive and negative possible answers)

±x−5+2=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-5}}+2=y}     (add 2 to both sides)


, As you did at the beginning, examine the inverted equation to define its domain and range. With two possible solutions, you will select the one that has a domain and range that are inverses of the original domain and range.Examine the sample equation solution of ±x−5+2=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-5}}+2=y}. Because the square root function is not defined for any negative values, the term x−5{\displaystyle {x-5}} must always be positive. Therefore, allowable values of x (the domain) must be x≥5. Using that as the domain, the resulting values of y (the range) are either all values y≥2, if you take the positive solution of the square root, or y≤2 if you select the negative solution of the square root. Recall that you originally defined the domain as x≥2, in order to be able to find the inverse function. Therefore, the correct solution for the inverse function is the positive option.

Compare the domain and range of the inverse to the domain and range of the original. Recall that for the original function the domain was defined as all values of x≥2, and the range was defined as all values y≥5. For the inverse function, now, these values switch, and the domain is all values x≥5, and the range is all values of y≥2.


, To make sure that your work is correct and your inverse is the right equation, select any value for x and place it into the original equation to find y. Then, put that value of y in the place of x in your inverse equation, and see if you generate the number that you started with. If so, your inverse function is correct.As a sample, select the value x=3 to place in the original equation f(x)=x2−4x+9{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}-4x+9}. This gives the result y=6.

Next, place that value of 6 into the inverse function x−5+2=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-5}}+2=y}. This does give the result of y=3, which is the number you started with. You can conclude that your inverse function is correct.

If factoring did not work, then you could resort to the Quadratic Formula, which would yield the real solutions for any quadratic formula. You can use the Quadratic Formula as another method to find inverse functions.The Quadratic Formula is x=/2a.

Notice that the Quadratic Formula will result in two possible solutions, one positive and one negative. You will make this selection based on defining the domain and range of the function.


, Your quadratic equation must begin in the format f(x)=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c}. Take whatever algebraic steps you must in order to get your equation into that form.For this section of this article, use the sample equation f(x)=x2+2x−3{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+2x-3}.


, Determine the graph of the function, either by using a graphing calculator or just plotting various points until the parabola appears. You will find that this equation defines a parabola with its apex at (-1,-4). Thus, to define this as a function that will have an inverse, define the domain as all values of x≤-1. The range will then be all y≥-4., To begin finding the inverse, switch the variables x and y. Leave the equation unchanged, except for reversing the variables. At this stage, you will replace x for f(x).Using the working equation f(x)=x2+2x−3{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+2x-3}, this will give the result x=y2+2y−3{\displaystyle x=y^{2}+2y-3}.


, Recall that to use the Quadratic Formula, you must set your equation equal to 0, and then use the coefficients in the formula. Similarly, this method of finding an inverse function begins by setting the equation equal to 0.

For the sample equation, to get the left side equal to 0, you must subtract x from both sides of the equation. This will give the result 0=y2+2y−3−x{\displaystyle 0=y^{2}+2y-3-x}.


, This step is a bit tricky. Recall that the Quadratic Formula solves for x, in the equation 0=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle 0=ax^{2}+bx+c}. So, to get the equation you currently have, 0=y2+2y−3−x{\displaystyle 0=y^{2}+2y-3-x}, to match that format, you need to redefine terms as follows:Let y2=ax2{\displaystyle y^{2}=ax^{2}}. Therefore, x=1

Let 2y=bx{\displaystyle 2y=bx}. Therefore, b=2

Let (−3−x)=c{\displaystyle (-3-x)=c}. Therefore, c=(-3-x)


, Normally, you would place the values of a, b and c into the Quadratic Formula to solve for x. However, recall that you previously switched x and y for finding the inverse function. Therefore, when you use the Quadratic Formula to solve for x, you are really solving for y, or the f-inverse. The steps of solving the Quadratic Formula will work like this:x=/2a

x=(-2)±√((-2)^2-4(1)(-3-x)) / 2(1)

x=((-2)±√(4+12+4x))/2

x=(-2±√(16+4x))/2

x=(-2±√(4)(4+x))/2

x=-2±2√(4+x))/2

x=-1±√(4+x)

f-inverse = -1±√(4+x)   (This final step is possible because you earlier put x in place of the f(x) variable.)


, Notice that the Quadratic Formula gives two possible results, using the ± symbol. Write out the two separate solutions to make it easier to define the domain and range and make the correct final solution. These two solutions are:f−1=−1+4+x{\displaystyle f^{-1}=-1+{\sqrt {4+x}}}


f−1=−1−4+x{\displaystyle f^{-1}=-1-{\sqrt {4+x}}}


, Notice that, for the square root to be defined, the domain must be x≥-4. Recall that the domain of the original function was x≤-1 and the range was y≥-4. To choose the inverse function that matches, you will need to choose the second solution, f−1=−1−4+x{\displaystyle f^{-1}=-1-{\sqrt {4+x}}} as the correct inverse function., To make sure that your work is correct and your inverse is the right equation, select any value for x and place it into the original equation to find y. Then, put that value of y in the place of x in your inverse equation, and see if you generate the number that you started with. If so, your inverse function is correct.Using the original function f(x)=x2+2x−3{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+2x-3}, choose x=-2. This will give the result of y=-3. Now put the value of x=-3 into the inverse function, f−1=−1−4+x{\displaystyle f^{-1}=-1-{\sqrt {4+x}}}. This turns out the result of -2, which is indeed the value that you started with. Therefore, your definition of the inverse function is correct.
