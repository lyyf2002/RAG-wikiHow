Verify that you are starting with an arithmetic sequence.,
Add the common difference to the term before the space.,
Subtract the common difference from the term following the space.,
Compare your results.",How to Find Any Term of an Arithmetic Sequence2," In some cases, you may have a list of numbers with a missing term in the middle. Begin, as before, by checking that your list is an arithmetic sequence. Select any two consecutive terms and find the difference between them. Then check this against two other consecutive terms in the list. If the differences are the same, you can presume that you are working with an arithmetic sequence and proceed.

For example, suppose you have the list 0,4{\displaystyle 0,4},___,12,16,20{\displaystyle 12,16,20}…. Start by subtracting 4−0{\displaystyle 4-0} to find a difference of 4. Check this against two other consecutive terms, such as 16−12{\displaystyle 16-12}. The difference is again 4. You can proceed.


, This is similar to adding a term to the end of a sequence. Find the term that immediately precedes the space in your sequence. This is the “last” number that you know. Add your common difference to this term, to find the number that should fill in the space. 

In our working example, 0,4{\displaystyle 0,4},____,12,16,20{\displaystyle 12,16,20}…, the term preceding the space is 4, and our common difference for this list is also 4. So add 4+4{\displaystyle 4+4} to get 8, which should be the number in the blank space.


, To be sure that you have the correct answer, check from the other direction. An arithmetic sequence should be consistent going in either direction. If you move from left to right and add 4, then going in the opposite direction, from right to left, you would do the opposite and subtract 4.

In the working example, 0,4{\displaystyle 0,4},___,12,16,20{\displaystyle 12,16,20}…, the term immediately following the space is 12. Subtract the common difference of 4 from this term to find 12−4=8{\displaystyle 12-4=8}. The result of 8 should fill in the blank space.


, The two results that you get, from adding up from the bottom or from subtracting down from the top should match. If they do, then you have found the value for the missing term. If they do not, then you need to check your work. You may not have a true arithmetic sequence.

In the working example, the two results of 4+4{\displaystyle 4+4} and 12−4{\displaystyle 12-4} both gave the solution of 8. Therefore, the missing term in this arithmetic sequence is 8. The full sequence is 0,4,8,12,16,20{\displaystyle 0,4,8,12,16,20}….

Identify the first term of the sequence.,
Define your common difference as d. Find the common difference for the sequence as before.,
Use the explicit formula.,
Fill in your information to solve the problem.",How to Find Any Term of an Arithmetic Sequence3," Not every sequence begins with the numbers 0 or 1. Look at the list of numbers that you have and find the first term. This is your starting point, which can be designated using variables as a(1).

It is common in working with arithmetic sequences to use the variable a(1) to designate the first term of a sequence. You may, of course, choose any variable you like, and the results should be the same.

For example, given the sequence 3,8,13,18{\displaystyle 3,8,13,18}…, the first term is 3{\displaystyle 3}, which can be designated algebraically as a(1).


, In this working example, the common difference is 8−3{\displaystyle 8-3}, which is 5. Checking with other terms in the sequence provides the same result. We will note this common difference with the algebraic variable d.
, An explicit formula is an algebraic equation that you can use to find any term of an arithmetic sequence, without having to write out the full list. The explicit formula for an algebraic sequence is a(n)=a(1)+(n−1)d{\displaystyle a(n)=a(1)+(n-1)d}.

The term a(n) can be read as “the nth term of a,” where n represents which number in the list you want to find and a(n) is the actual value of that number. For example, if you are asked to find the 100th item in an arithmetic sequence, then n will be 100. Note that n is 100, in this example, but a(n) will be the value of the 100th term, not the number 100 itself.


, Using the explicit formula for your sequence, fill in the information that you know to find the term that you need. 

For example, in the working example 3,8,13,18{\displaystyle 3,8,13,18}…, we know that a(1) is the first term 3, and the common difference d is 5. Suppose you are asked to find the 100th term in that sequence. Then n=100, and (n-1)=99. The complete explicit formula, with the data filled in, is then a(100)=3+(99)(5){\displaystyle a(100)=3+(99)(5)}. This simplifies to 498, which is the 100th term of that sequence.

Rearrange the explicit formula to solve for other variables.,
Find the first term of a sequence.,
Find the length of a sequence.",How to Find Any Term of an Arithmetic Sequence4," Using the explicit formula and some basic algebra, you can find several pieces of information about an arithmetic sequence. In its original form, a(n)=a(1)+(n−1)d{\displaystyle a(n)=a(1)+(n-1)d}, the explicit formula is designed to solve for an and give you the nth term of a sequence. However, you can algebraically manipulate this formula and solve for any of the variables.

For example, suppose you have the end of a list of numbers, but you need to know what the beginning of the sequence was. You can rearrange the formula to give you a(1)=(n−1)d−a(n).{\displaystyle a(1)=(n-1)d-a(n).}

If you know the starting point of an arithmetic sequence and its ending point, but you need to know how many terms are in the list, you can rearrange the explicit formula to solve for n. This would be n=a(n)−a(1)d+1{\displaystyle n={\frac {a(n)-a(1)}{d}}+1}.

 If you need to review the basic rules of algebra to create this result, check out Do Algebra or Simplify Algebraic Expressions.


, You may know that the 50th term of an arithmetic sequence is 300, and you know that the terms have been increasing by 7 (the “common difference”), but you want to find out what the first term of the sequence was. Use the revised explicit formula that solves for a1 to find your answer.

Use the equation a(1)=(n−1)d−a(n){\displaystyle a(1)=(n-1)d-a(n)}, and fill in the information that you know. Since you know that the 50th term is 300, then n=50, n-1=49 and a(n)=300. You also are given that the common difference, d, is 7. Therefore, the formula becomes a(1)=(49)(7)−300{\displaystyle a(1)=(49)(7)-300}. This works out to 343−300=43{\displaystyle 343-300=43}. The sequence that you have began at 43, and counted up by 7. Therefore, it looks like 43,50,57,64,71,78…293,300.


, Suppose you know all about the start and end of an arithmetic sequence, but you need to find out how long it is. Use the revised formula n=a(n)−a(1)d+1{\displaystyle n={\frac {a(n)-a(1)}{d}}+1}.

Suppose you know that a given arithmetic sequence begins at 100 and increases by 13. You are also told that the final term is 2,856. To find the length of the sequence, use the terms a1=100, d=13, and a(n)=2856. Insert these terms into the formula to give n=2856−10013+1{\displaystyle n={\frac {2856-100}{13}}+1}. If you work this out, you get n=275613+1{\displaystyle n={\frac {2756}{13}}+1}, which equals 212+1, which is 213. There are 213 terms in that sequence.

This sample sequence would look like 100, 113, 126, 139… 2843, 2856.

Try a few practice problems.",How to Find the Absolute Value of a Number2," You cannot find the absolute value of imaginary numbers the same way you found it for rational numbers. That said, you can easily find the absolute value of a complex equation by plugging it into the distance formula. Take the expression |3−4i|{\displaystyle |3-4i|}, for example.


Problem:|3−4i|{\displaystyle |3-4i|}


Note: If you see the expression −1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {-1}}}, you can replace it with ""i."" The square root of -1 is an imaginary number, known as i. |i|=1{\displaystyle |i|=1}, Think of 3-4i as an equation for a line. Absolute value is the distance from zero, so you want to find the distance from zero for the point (3, -4) on this line.The coefficients are simply the two numbers that aren't ""i."" While the number by the i is usually the second number, it doesn't actually matter when solving. To practice, find the following coefficients:


|1+6i|{\displaystyle |1+6i|} = (1, 6)


|2−i|{\displaystyle |2-i|} = (2, -1)


|6i−8|{\displaystyle |6i-8|} = (-8, 6), All you need at this point are the coefficients. Remember, you need to find the distance from the equation to zero. Since you use the distance formula in the next step, this is the same thing as taking absolute value.
, To find distance, you'll use the distance formula, known as x2+y2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}}. So, for your first step, you need to square both coefficients of your complex equation. Continuing the example |3−4i|{\displaystyle |3-4i|}:


Coefficients: (3, -4)


Distance formula: 32+(−4)2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}}}


Square the coefficients: ' 9+16{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9+16}}}


Note: Review the distance formula if you're confused. Note now squaring both numbers makes them positive, effectively taking absolute value for you., The radical is the sign that takes the square root. Simply add them up, leaving the radical in place for now.


Coefficients: (3, -4)


Distance formula: 32+(−4)2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}}}


Square the coefficients: 9+16{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9+16}}}


Add up squared coefficients: 25{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}}


, All you have to do is simplify the equation to get your final answer. This is the distance from your ""point"" on an imaginary graph zero. If there is no square root, just leave the answer from the last step under the radical-- this is a legitimate final answer.


Coefficients: (3, -4)


Distance formula: 32+(−4)2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}}}


Square the coefficients: 9+16{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9+16}}}


Add up squared coefficients: 25{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}}


Take the square root to get your final answer: 5

Partition your number.,

Find the second digit of your estimate.,
Find your new modified difference.,
Find the third digit of your estimate.,
Repeat.",How to Find Nth Roots by Hand," Separate the number you want to find the nth root of into n-digit intervals before and after the decimal. If there are fewer than n digits before the decimal, then that is the first interval. And if there are no digits or fewer than n digits after the decimal, fill in the spaces with zeroes.

, Find a number (a) raised to the nth power closest to the first n digits (or the fewer than n digits before the decimal) as a base-ten number without going over. This is the first and only digit of your estimate so far., Subtract your estimate to the nth power (an) from those first n digits and bring down the next n digits next to that difference to form a new number, a modified difference. (Or multiply the difference by 10n and add the next n digits as a base-ten number.), Find a number b such that  (nC1 an - 1 (10n-1) + nC2 an - 2 b (10n - 2) ) + . . . +  nCn - 1  a bn - 2 (10 )  +  nCn bn - 1 (100 ) )b  is less than or equal to the modified difference above (10n (d ) + d1d2. . . dn).  This becomes the second digit of your estimate so far.

The combinations notation nCr represents n! divided by the product of (n - r)! and r!, where n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) . . . (3)(2)(1). The notation nCr is sometimes expressed as n over r within tall parentheses without a division bar, and it can be calculated simply as the first r factors of n! divided by r!, which is often written as nPr divided by r!

, Subtract the two quantities in the last step above (10n (d ) + d1d2. . . dn minus nC1 an - 1 (10n-1) + nC2 an - 2 b (10n - 2) ) + . . . +  nCn - 1  a bn - 2 (10 )  +  nCn bn - 1 (100 ) )b) to form your new modified difference by bringing down the next set of n digits next to that result. (Or multiply the difference by 10n and add the next n digits as a base-ten number.), Find a new number c and use your estimate so far, a (which is now 2 digits), such that  (nC1 an - 1 (10n - 1) + nC2 an - 2 c (10n - 2 ) + . . . +  nCn - 1  a c n - 2 (10 )  +  nCn cn - 1 (100 ) ) c  is less than or equal to the new modified difference in above (10n (d ) + d1d2. . . dn). This becomes the third digit of your estimate so far., Keep repeating the last two steps above to find more digits of your estimate.

This is basically a rolling binomial expansion minus the lead term, where the two terms involved are the prior estimate multiplied by 10 and the next digit to improve the estimate.

Identify the x-axis.,
Find the point where the line crosses the x-axis.,
Write the ordered pair for the x-intercept.",How to Find the X Intercept1," A coordinate graph has a y-axis and an x-axis. The x-axis is the horizontal line (the line that goes from left-to-right). The y-axis is the vertical line (the line that goes up and down).It is important to look at the x-axis when locating the x-intercept.

, The x-intercept is this point.If you are asked to find the x-intercept based on the graph, the point will likely be exact (for example, at point 4). Usually, however, you will have to estimate using this method (for example, the point is somewhere between 4 and 5).
, An ordered pair is written in the form (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} and gives you the coordinates for the point.The first number of the pair is the point where the line crosses the x-axis (the x-intercept). The second number for will always be 0, since a point on the x-axis will never have a value for y.For example, if a line crosses the x-axis at point 4, the ordered pair for the x-intercept is (4,0){\displaystyle (4,0)}.

Draw the line alongside the graph of the polynomial.",How to Find Slant Asymptotes," Make sure that the degree of the numerator (in other words, the highest exponent in the numerator) is greater than the degree of the denominator. If it is, a slant asymptote exists and can be found. .


As an example, look at the polynomial x^2 + 5x + 2 / x + 3. The degree of its numerator is greater than the degree of its denominator because the numerator has a power of 2 (x^2) while the denominator has a power of only 1. Therefore, you can find the slant asymptote. The graph of this polynomial is shown in the picture.;
, Place the numerator (the dividend) inside the division box, and place the denominator (the divisor) on the outside.


For the example above, set up a long division problem with x^2 + 5x + 2 as the dividend and x + 3 as the divisor.

, Look for a factor that, when multiplied by the highest degree term in the denominator, will result in the same term as the highest degree term of the dividend. Write that factor above the division box.


In the example above, you would look for a factor that, when multiplied by x, would result in the same term as the highest degree of x^2. In this case, that’s x.Write the x above the division box.

, Multiply to get your product, and write it beneath the dividend.


In the example above, the product of x and x + 3 is x^2 + 3x. Write it under the dividend, as shown.

, Take the lower expression under the division box and subtract it from the upper expression. Draw a line and note the result of your subtraction underneath it.


In the example above, subtract x^2 + 3x from x^2 + 5x + 2. Draw a line and note the result, 2x + 2, underneath it, as shown.

, Repeat these steps, using the result of your subtraction problem as your new dividend.


In the example above, note that if you multiply 2 by the highest term of the divisor (x), you get the highest degree term of the dividend, which is now 2x + 2. Write the 2 on top of the division box by adding it to first factor, making it x + 2. Write the product of the factor and the divisor beneath the dividend, and subtract again, as shown.

, You do not have to perform the long division all the way to the end. Continue only until you get the equation of a line in the form ax + b, where a and b can be any numbers.


In the example above, you can now stop. The equation of your line is x + 2.

, Graph your line to verify that it is actually an asymptote.


In the example above, you would need to graph x + 2 to see that the line moves alongside the graph of your polynomial but never touches it, as shown below. So x + 2 is indeed a slant asymptote of your polynomial.

Make sure your function is one-to-one.,
Given a function, switch the x's and the y's.,
Solve for the new ""y."",
Replace the new ""y"" with f^-1(x).",How to Find the Inverse of a Function," Only one-to-one functions have inverses.


A function is one-to-one if it passes the vertical line test and the horizontal line test. Draw a vertical line through the entire graph of the function and count the number of times that the line hits the function. Then draw a horizontal line through the entire graph of the function and count the number of times this line hits the function. If each line only hits the function once, the function is one-to-one.

If a graph does not pass the vertical line test, it is not a function.


To algebraically determine whether the function is one-to-one, plug in f(a) and f(b) into your function and see whether a = b. As an example, let's take f(x) = 3x+5.

f(a) = 3a + 5; f(b) = 3b + 5
3a + 5 = 3b + 5
3a = 3b
a = b


Thus, f(x) is one-to-one.;
, Remember that f(x) is a substitute for ""y.""


In a function, ""f(x)"" or ""y"" represents the output and ""x"" represents the input. To find the inverse of a function, you switch the inputs and the outputs.
Example: Let's take f(x) = (4x+3)/(2x+5) -- which is one-to-one. Switching the x's and y's, we get x = (4y + 3)/(2y + 5).

, You'll need to manipulate the expressions to solve for y, or to find the new operations that must be performed on the input to obtain the inverse as an output.


This can be tricky depending on your expression. You may need to use algebraic tricks like cross-multiplication or factoring to evaluate the expression and simplify it.
In our example, we'll take the following steps to isolate y:

We're starting with x = (4y + 3)/(2y + 5)
x(2y + 5) = 4y + 3 -- Multiply both sides by (2y + 5)
2xy + 5x = 4y + 3 -- Distribute the x's
2xy - 4y = 3 - 5x -- Get all the y terms on one side
y(2x - 4) = 3 - 5x -- Reverse distribute to consolidate the y terms
y = (3 - 5x)/(2x - 4) -- Divide to get your answer



, This is the equation for the inverse of your original function.


Our final answer is f^-1(x) = (3 - 5x)/(2x - 4). This is the inverse of f(x) = (4x+3)/(2x+5).

Determine that the equation of the line is in standard form.,
Plug in 0 for y{\displaystyle y}.,
Solve for x{\displaystyle x}.,
Write the ordered pair.",How to Find the X Intercept2," The standard form of a linear equation is Ax+By=C{\displaystyle Ax+By=C}.In this form, A{\displaystyle A}, B{\displaystyle B}, and C{\displaystyle C} are integers, and x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} are the coordinates of a point on the line.

For example, you might be given the equation 2x+3y=6{\displaystyle 2x+3y=6}.


, The x-intercept is the point on the line where the line crosses the x-axis.At this point, the value for y{\displaystyle y} will be 0.So, in order to find the x-intercept, you need to set the y{\displaystyle y} to 0 and solve for x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, if you substitute 0 for y{\displaystyle y}, your equation will look like this: 2x+3(0)=6{\displaystyle 2x+3(0)=6}, which simplifies to 2x=6{\displaystyle 2x=6}.


, To do this, you need to isolate the x variable by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient. This will give you the value of x{\displaystyle x} when y=0{\displaystyle y=0}, which is the x-intercept.

For example:2x=6{\displaystyle 2x=6}2x2=62{\displaystyle {\frac {2x}{2}}={\frac {6}{2}}}x=3{\displaystyle x=3}


, Remember that an ordered pair is written in the form (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)}. For the x-intercept, the value of x{\displaystyle x} will be the value you calculated previously, and the y{\displaystyle y} value will be 0, since y{\displaystyle y} always equals 0 at the x-intercept.For example, for the line 2x+3y=6{\displaystyle 2x+3y=6}, the x-intercept is at the point (3,0){\displaystyle (3,0)}.

Find the ordered pairs for the x-intercept.",How to Find the X Intercept3," A quadratic equation is an equation that takes the form ax2+bx+c=0{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0}.A quadratic equation has two solutions, which means a line written in this form is a parabola and will have two x-intercepts.For example, the equation x2+3x−10=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x-10=0} is a quadratic equation, so this line will have two x-intercepts.


, The formula is x=−b±b2−4ac2a{\displaystyle x={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}}, where a{\displaystyle a} equals the coefficient of the second-degree term (x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}), b{\displaystyle b} equals the coefficient of the first-degree term (x{\displaystyle x}), and c{\displaystyle c} equals the constant., Make sure you substitute the correct values for each variable from the equation of the line.

For example, if the equation of your line is x2+3x−10=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x-10=0}, your quadratic formula will look like this: x=−3±32−4(1)(−10)2(1){\displaystyle x={\frac {-3\pm {\sqrt {3^{2}-4(1)(-10)}}}{2(1)}}}.


, To do this, first complete all of the multiplication. Make sure you pay close attention to all positive and negative signs.

For example:x=−3±32−4(−10)2(1){\displaystyle x={\frac {-3\pm {\sqrt {3^{2}-4(-10)}}}{2(1)}}}x=−3±32+402{\displaystyle x={\frac {-3\pm {\sqrt {3^{2}+40}}}{2}}}


, Square the b{\displaystyle b} term. Then, add this number to the other number under the square root sign.

For example:x=−3±32+402{\displaystyle x={\frac {-3\pm {\sqrt {3^{2}+40}}}{2}}}x=−3±9+402{\displaystyle x={\frac {-3\pm {\sqrt {9+40}}}{2}}}x=−3±492{\displaystyle x={\frac {-3\pm {\sqrt {49}}}{2}}}


, Since the quadratic formula has a ±{\displaystyle \pm }, you will solve once by adding, and once by subtracting. Solving by adding will give you your first x{\displaystyle x} value.

For example:x=−3+492{\displaystyle x={\frac {-3+{\sqrt {49}}}{2}}}x=−3+72{\displaystyle x={\frac {-3+7}{2}}}x=42{\displaystyle x={\frac {4}{2}}}x=2{\displaystyle x=2}


, This will give you the second value for x{\displaystyle x}. First calculate the square root, then find the difference in the numerator. Finally, divide by 2.

For example:x=−3−492{\displaystyle x={\frac {-3-{\sqrt {49}}}{2}}}x=−3−72{\displaystyle x={\frac {-3-7}{2}}}x=−102{\displaystyle x={\frac {-10}{2}}}x=−5{\displaystyle x=-5}


, Remember that an ordered pair gives the x-coordinate first, then the y-coordinate (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)}. The x{\displaystyle x} values will be the values you calculated using the quadratic formula. The y{\displaystyle y} value will be 0, since at the x-intercept, y{\displaystyle y} always equals 0.For example, for the line x2+3x−10=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x-10=0}, the x-intercepts are at points (2,0){\displaystyle (2,0)} and (−5,0){\displaystyle (-5,0)}.

Check the degree of your polynomial.,
Plug your numbers into the axis of symmetry formula.,
Write down the equation of the axis of symmetry.",How to Find an Axis of Symmetry1," The degree (or “order”) of a polynomial is simply the largest exponent value in the expression. If the degree of your polynomial is 2 (there is no exponent larger than x2), you can find the axis of symmetry using this method. If the degree of the polynomial is higher than 2, use Method 2.


To illustrate, take, as an example, the polynomial 2x2 + 3x – 1. This highest exponent present is the x2, so it is a 2nd order polynomial, and you can use this first method to find the axis of symmetry.;
, To calculate the axis of symmetry for a 2nd order polynomial in the form ax2 + bx +c (a parabola), use the basic formula x = -b / 2a.


In the example above, a = 2 b = 3, and c = -1. Insert these values into your formula, and you will get:
x = -3 / 2(2) = -3/4.

, The value you calculated with your axis of symmetry formula is the x-intercept of the axis of symmetry.


In the example above, the axis of symmetry is -3/4.

Follow ""neither"" with ""nor."",
Use “nor” multiple times within a list.,
Keep your ""neither"" and ""nor"" parallel.Parallel structure, as it applies to the neither/nor form, means that both halves of phrase need to match each other in regards to the information being described.,
Do not use ""nor"" with ""either."",
Use ""nor"" with other negatives.,
Only use “nor” once when outside of its correlative pair.,
Only carry the “nor” negative through to a verb phrase.,
Be careful when using ""nor"" alone.,
Make sure that your nouns and verbs are in agreement.The tense of the verb of your sentence must match the tense of your noun.,
Use a comma when ""nor"" sets off an independent clause.When “nor” sets off a dependent clause, no comma is necessary.",How to Use nor," Usually, ""nor"" follows ""neither"" in the same sentence, as in, ""neither A nor B."" Together, this neither/nor structure forms a correlative pair. This means that the information one term introduces is connected or related to the information the other term introduces.


The two terms can be applied when discussing actions or they can be used when listing nouns.
Example: ""He neither listens to music nor plays it.""
Example: ""She likes neither candy nor cake.""
Note that “neither” can also start a sentence.
Example: “Neither Sarah nor Jim can make it to the party on Saturday.”;
, Typically, the neither/nor structure is only used when drawing a negative connection between two objects or actions. You can use ""nor"" when talking about more than two ideas, though, but you need to repeat the word ""nor"" after each item in your list.Note that ""neither"" is only used once, no matter how many times you use ""nor.""
Do not merely separate the items in your list by commas.
Correct example: ""The store had neither peanut butter nor jelly nor bread.
Incorrect example: ""The store had neither peanut butter, jelly, nor bread.""

,


In other words, you cannot follow ""neither"" with a verb action and ""nor"" with a noun, or vice versa. Both most either introduce a verb or introduce a noun.
Correct example: ""We saw neither Gwen nor Eric during our trip.
Correct example: ""We neither saw Gwen nor spoke to Eric during our trip.""
Incorrect example: ""We neither saw Gwen nor Eric during our trip.""

, The terms “either” and “neither” are used in similar manners, but “either” is positive while “neither” is negative. As such, you must pair the negative “neither” with the negative “nor” and the positive “either” with the positive “or.”


Just as “neither” is always paired with “nor,” “either” is always paired with “or.”
Correct example: ""Neither James nor Rebecca is interested in basketball.”
Correct example: ""Either eat your vegetables or skip your dessert.”
Incorrect example: “I neither know the rules of the game or care to know.”
Incorrect example: “I will either go to the library or take a nap.”

, Even though ""nor"" is almost always used after ""neither,"" you can use it with other negative expressions and still form something grammatically correct.


Example: ""The final guest is not here, nor should we wait for her before we start the festivities.
Example: ""He has never gone fishing, nor does he have any desire to learn.""

, When listing more than two objects or actions, separate each item in the list by a comma and precede the final one with “nor.” Do not introduce each separate item in the list with “nor.”


Compare this to the use of “nor” within its correlative neither/nor pair. When used with “neither,” you must say “nor” before each item in a list. When used without “neither,” you should only use “nor” once.
Correct example: He has never experienced joy, sadness, nor anger with such passion before.”
Incorrect example: He has never experienced joy nor sadness nor anger with such passion before.”

, There are times when a negative mood in a sentence should be followed through with ""or"" instead of ""nor."" If the second part of the negative is a verb phrase—an action—then ""nor"" is correct.


If the second part of the negative is a noun, adjective, or adverb phrase, however, the initial negative will be carried through the rest of the sentence, making ""nor"" redundant. In these instances, ""or"" should be used, instead.
Correct example: ""He never comes to practice, nor does he listen to the coach.""
Correct example: ""She does not enjoy music or art.""
Incorrect example: ""She does not enjoy music nor art.""

, As a negative conjunction, ""nor"" is almost always used to connect two thoughts or items in a sentence that has an established negative tense. You can technically use ""nor"" without using any other negative term, but this is very rarely done.Using ""nor"" on its own will usually seem stiff and unnatural. Since it is so rare, many will also think that you are using ""nor"" improperly.
Even though there is no negative element within the sentence, you still need to make sure that the idea expressed after ""nor"" connects to the idea described before it in a sensible manner.
Example: ""The report was done on time, nor does it appear to contain any mistakes.""

, In other words, a singular noun must have a singular verb and a plural noun must have a plural verb.


This does not usually pose a problem, but if two nouns in your neither/nor structure have different tenses, it can be difficult to find a wording that sounds natural.
Look at the noun closest to the verb (usually the noun following ""nor""). If this noun is plural, make your verb plural. If it is singular, make the verb singular.
Correct example: ""Neither he nor they are interested.""
Correct example: ""Neither they nor he is interested.""
Incorrect example: ""Neither he nor they is interested.""
Incorrect example: ""Neither they nor he are interested.""

, Similarly, a comma is not necessary if “nor” is only used to draw a relationship between two nouns. If it sets off an independent clause, however, you should proceed the “nor” with a comma.


A dependent clause is a sentence fragment that relies on the rest of the sentence to be complete. An independent clause contains both a subject and a verb, and as a result, it could be separated from the rest of the sentence and still stand on its own.
Correct example: “No one knew the answer, nor did they make a guess.”
Incorrect example: “No one knew the answer nor did they make a guess.”

, This may, however, sound exceedingly awkward.
NOTE: It was once technically correct to use the masculine when the gender was unknown or when referring to a mixed-gender group. (1 policeman + 1 policewoman = 2 policemen.) However, this usage is currently regarded as sexist. Furthermore, it may mistakenly imply that the group spoken of is entirely male. Therefore, in all but the most formal uses, the generic use of plural pronouns (""they"" or ""their"") have become acceptable substitutes for the generic use of the masculine singular. (In fact, despite the opposition of nineteenth- and twentieth-century grammarians, this generic use of the plural pronoun has been used by many fine authors for centuries, and is both as logical and as old as the generic masculine singular.)


Example: Each aide must complete his schedule for the week.

Possible Improvement (though awkward): Each aide must complete their schedule for the week.

Recognize the difference between a root clause and an embedded clause.,
Learn the primary function of an embedded clause.,
Note the two types of embedded clauses.,
Use “which” or “where” to create an embedded clause.,
Form an embedded clause with “who”.,
Make a relative clause using “that”.,
Use a variety of embedded clauses in your writing and speech.",How to Use an Embedded Clause," The root clause in a sentence is also known as the main clause, as it forms the main section of the sentence. The embedded clause is then insert inside the main clause to expand on it. The root or main clause will contain the embedded clause.Keep in mind embedded clauses are sometimes called subordinate clauses. Most subordinate clauses begin with “because”, “since”, and “although”, which are called subordinators. For example, a subordinate clause would be found in the sentence: “Ashley left the room because she hated dancing.” “Because she hated dancing” is the subordinate clause as it adds more detail to the beginning of the sentence, “Ashley left the room”.;
, An embedded clause is a clause used in the middle of a sentence, or in the root clause. The embedded clause should give the reader more information and enhance the overall meaning of the sentence. Using embedded clauses will help to create more detail to your sentences and raise your writing to a higher level.The clause are usually a group of words that include a subject and a verb. The embedded clause will then be bracketed by commas in the sentence. Most embedded clauses begin with “who”, “which”, “where”, and “that”. Embedded clauses cannot stand separately from the sentence and would make the sentence grammatically incorrect if they were omitted.

, There are two types of embedded clauses: nominal clauses and relative clauses. Nominal clauses use “that” or “for” to create the embedded clause. Relative clauses use “who”, “which”, and “where” to create the embedded clause.You can use either type in sentences when you are trying to use an embedded clause. However, some sentences may work better if you use the nominal clause and some might work better if you use the relative clause.

, You will use “which” in an embedded clause when you are referring to an inanimate object, such as an item you own. You will use “where” when you are referring to a location or place, such as the house where you were born or your current address.For example, you may say, “My phone, which is brand new, is not working.” The embedded clause in this sentence is “which is brand new”, as it adds more information about the subject of the sentence, “my phone”.
You may say, “This house, where I grew up, has changed over the years.” The embedded clause in this sentence is “where I grew up”, as it provides more information about the subject of the sentence, “this house”.
You’ll notice that the embedded clauses “which is brand new” and “where I grew up” are bracketed by commas. They also do not make sense as separate phrases and are only grammatically correct when they are placed in the sentences.

, You will use “who” in an embedded clause when you are discussing a person, such as a friend, partner, or acquaintance.For example, you may say, “The nurse, who was very sweet, gave me a shot.” The embedded clause in this sentence is “who is very sweet” as it provides more information on the subject of the sentence, “the nurse”.

, You can also use “that” to create a relative clause, a type of embedded clause. This will allow you to provide more information in a sentence with the use of “that”.For example, you may say, “I should have noticed that Mark does not like Mindy.” The relative clause in the sentence is “that Mark does not like Mindy”. In this case, you are using the embedded clause to provide more information in the sentence and expand on “I should have noticed”.

, To effectively deploy embedded clauses in your writing, you should try to vary which ones you use and how you use them. Sprinkle them throughout a section of writing to add more detail, but avoid using them in every sentence or in two sentences in a row. Often, embedded clauses are more effective when they appear sporadically.For example, you may start with a sentence that does not have an embedded clause, such as, “I had a difficult day today.” You may then expand on the sentence by using a sentence with an embedded clause, such as, “My computer, which is very expensive, is not working properly.”
When you are using embedded clause in academic papers or essays, you should use them to expand on an idea or thought you have introduced earlier. For example, you may have the sentence, “Social norms and rules are a major theme in 19th century British literature.” You may then expand on the sentence with a sentence with an embedded clause, “Jane Austen, who is one of the more prominent novelist of the time, addresses this theme in many of her works.”

Determine what a restrictive clause is.,
Determine what a non-restrictive clause is.,
Determine if you’re using a restrictive or non-restrictive clause.,
Use “that” for restrictive clauses.,
Use “which” for non-restrictive clauses.,
Determine where you should place commas.","How to Use ""That"" and ""Which"" Correctly"," The key to knowing if you need to use “which” or “that” in a sentence is deciding if you need to create a restrictive or non-restrictive clause.


A restrictive clause is one that sets limits on the subject of the sentence. A restrictive clause also contributes to the meaning of the sentence – the sentence won’t make sense without the restrictive clause.
For example, the sentence “I like flowers that are purple” has a restrictive clause in it and removing it would change the meaning of the sentence. “that are purple” is the restrictive clause, because removing it would tell the reader you like flowers, but not purple ones.;
, A non-restrictive clause adds information to the sentence, but removing it doesn’t change the meaning of the sentence.


For example, in the sentence, “The car, which is red, was totaled in the accident,” has a restrictive clause in it because “which is red” can be removed without changing the sentence’s meaning. The car will still be totaled, whether we know its color or not. “Which is red” is the non-restrictive clause., When you’re trying to figure out if you’re using a restrictive or non-restrictive clause, ask yourself if the clause changes the meaning of the sentence and or if it just adds information to it.


If taking out the clause changes the meaning of the sentence, you’re using a restrictive clause. In the sentence ""Jimmy likes apples that are red"" taking out ""that are red"" changes the meaning of the sentence; we might think Jimmy likes all apples and not just the red ones. ""That are red"" is therefore a restrictive clause.
If taking out the clause doesn’t change the meaning of the sentence, you’re using a non-restrictive clause.In the sentence ""Jimmy thinks apples, which grow on trees in his yard, are the best fruit,"" taking out ""which grow on trees in his yard"" doesn't change the meaning of the sentence. We still learn that apples are Jimmy's favorite fruit, and therefore ""which grow on trees in his yard"" is a non-restrictive clause.

, If you determine that omitting the clause changes the meaning of the sentence, you need to use “that” in your sentence.For example, in the sentence “I like dogs that are brown,” the clause “that are brown” is crucial to understanding the sentence; it limits what type of dogs you like.

, If omitting the clause only removes additional information from the sentence, you need to use “which” in your sentence.


For example, in the sentence “I took the firetruck, which is my niece’s favorite toy, to be fixed,” the clause “which is my niece’s favorite toy” only adds information to the sentence. You’re taking the firetruck to be fixed – the fact that the truck is your niece’s favorite doesn’t change the meaning of the sentence., If you’re creating a non-restrictive clause and therefore using “which” in your sentence, the clause should be surrounded by commas.


For example, “I love lobster, which is expensive, because it reminds me of growing up by the ocean,” would make sense without “which is expensive.” This is the phrase you should surround with commas.
If you know you have a non-restrictive clause and need to use “which,” but don’t know where to put the commas, test it. Your sentence should still make sense if you take out the words surrounded by commas."

Learn basic grammar terms.,
Be aware of your own language's grammar.,
Learn one pattern at a time.This is how the above mentioned 8-year old (and you, for that matter) learned grammar: our brains are very, very good at recognizing patterns and using them.,
Vary your learning material and your practice strategy.,
Keep your goal in mind.",How to Understand Grammar in Various Languages," If you don't know what a noun, a verb, an adjective or an article is, even very basic grammar instructions will just be confusing.;
, Which tenses are there and which are actually used most? How many cases does your language have and what are they used for? Both ""you run"" and ""you are running"" indicate an action taking place in the present, but what is the difference? Become aware of the fact that meaning is carried not only in the vocabulary but also in the grammar, and that there are forms of grammar which turn up rarely and others which are used all the time.

, For example, someone who just learned the pattern for an action just taking place, should build as many variations of that as possible, using as much of the vocabulary already learned as possible.

, One of the beauties of the Internet is: language learning material without end. Clips of your favorite movie or TV show dubbed in French, German, Italian or possibly Korean, audiobooks in various languages, Wikipedia and wikiHow articles on your favorite subject of interest in various languages and so on.


In the above example, a good first step is to read a text in the language you are learning and mark all the examples you find. Write them down and sort them (by gender, meaning or whatever makes sense to you). Read aloud. Write and speak simple examples. Listen to a text and try to hear examples of the pattern you are just learning.
Keep in mind that some video or audio players allow for slower replay; in that case, an audio played at 90% or even 80% of its original speed sounds slightly odd, but not too bad, and is easier to understand.

, Do you want to just academically understand the language or speak the language? In the first case, working your way through a primer and using some examples to anchor the grammatical structures in your mind might be the best strategy. If you want to speak, 50 percent of the grammar most used in the target language learned well will be far more useful than the entire grammar sitting in your brain as theoretical knowledge. And that means learning lots and lots of slightly different examples.

If the degree of your polynomial is 2 (there is no exponent larger than x2), you can find the axis of symmetry using the formula method above. If the degree of the polynomial is higher than 2, use this graphical method.

, Make two lines in the shape of a plus sign. The horizontal line is your x-axis; the vertical line is your y-axis.

, Mark both axes with numbers at equal intervals. Spacing should be uniform on both axes.

, Take your polynomial or function and calculate values of f(x) by putting all values of x into it.

, You now have pairs of y = f(x) for every x on the axis. For each (x, y) pair, make a point on the graph – vertically on the x-axis and horizontally on the y-axis.

, Once you have marked all the graph points, you can connect your dots smoothly to reveal a continuous graph of your polynomial.

, Inspect your graph carefully. Look for a point on the axis such that when a line is passed through it, the graph splits into two equal, mirrored halves.

, If you can find a point – call it “b” – on the x-axis that splits the graph into two mirrored halves, then that point, b, is your axis of symmetry.

Substitute appropriate values for r{\displaystyle r} and θ{\displaystyle \theta } and evaluate.",How to Find Roots of Unity," Finding roots of unity means that we find all numbers in the complex plane such that, when raised to the third power, yield 1. When we consider the equation x3−1=0,{\displaystyle x^{3}-1=0,} we know that one of the zeroes is 1. But from the fundamental theorem of algebra, we know that every polynomial of degree n{\displaystyle n} has n{\displaystyle n} complex roots. As this is a cubic equation, there are three roots, and two of them are in the complex plane. We can no longer restrict ourselves to dealing with just the real numbers in finding these two remaining roots.


z3=1{\displaystyle z^{3}=1}
;
, 

We know that a complex number can be written as z=reiθ.{\displaystyle z=re^{i\theta }.} But recall from polar coordinates that numbers written in polar form are not uniquely defined. Adding any multiple of 2π{\displaystyle 2\pi } will give the same number as well. Below, the symbols k∈Z{\displaystyle k\in {\mathbb {Z} }} mean that k{\displaystyle k} is any integer.


z=rei(θ+2πk),  k∈Z{\displaystyle z=re^{i(\theta +2\pi k)},\ \ k\in {\mathbb {Z} }}



Raise z{\displaystyle z} to the one-third power. Since we want to avoid making our function multivalued, we must restrict the domain of the argument to θ:[0,2π).{\displaystyle \theta :[0,2\pi ).} Therefore, k=0,1,2.{\displaystyle k=0,1,2.} In general, the mth roots are found by substituting k=0,1,⋯,m−1.{\displaystyle k=0,1,\cdots ,m-1.}


z1/3=r1/3ei(θ+2πk3){\displaystyle z^{1/3}=r^{1/3}e^{i\left({\frac {\theta +2\pi k}{3}}\right)}}




, Since we are finding roots of unity, r=1{\displaystyle r=1} and θ=0.{\displaystyle \theta =0.} In other words, all of the roots lie on the unit circle.


11/3=ei2πk/3=cos2πk3+isin2πk3, k=0,1,2{\displaystyle 1^{1/3}=e^{i2\pi k/3}=\cos {\frac {2\pi k}{3}}+i\sin {\frac {2\pi k}{3}},\ k=0,1,2}


, When the roots are plotted on the complex plane, they form an equilateral triangle, where one of the vertices is on the point z=1.{\displaystyle z=1.} Additionally, the complex roots come in conjugate pairs. 


11/3=1,−12+32i,−12−32i{\displaystyle 1^{1/3}=1,-{\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}i,-{\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}i}


, The plot above is a complex plot of the function z3−1.{\displaystyle z^{3}-1.} The brightness starts from black and gets brighter as the magnitude increases. The hue starts from red and goes across the color wheel, corresponding to the angle going from 0{\displaystyle 0} to 2π.{\displaystyle 2\pi .} (More precisely, for every π/3,{\displaystyle \pi /3,} the color goes from red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, to red again.)

As a starting point in interpreting, we see that on the real axis, the function maps the origin to -1. This is represented on the plot by cyan, as eiπ=−1,{\displaystyle e^{i\pi }=-1,} and the increasing brightness to the left means that the function is getting smaller and smaller. Meanwhile, the real axis is red for x>1,{\displaystyle x>1,} and gets brighter as well. We can clearly see the zeroes as three black dots which form an equilateral triangle.


, As with the third roots, we know that the equation x5−1=0{\displaystyle x^{5}-1=0} has one root, 1, in the reals. Per the fundamental theorem of algebra, there are four other roots, and these roots must be complex. 
,


z1/5=r1/5ei(θ+2πk5){\displaystyle z^{1/5}=r^{1/5}e^{i\left({\frac {\theta +2\pi k}{5}}\right)}}


, It is fine to leave answers in polar form. As we can see above, the zeros of the function z5−1{\displaystyle z^{5}-1} form a regular pentagon, and the complex roots form conjugate pairs, just as with the third roots of unity.

,How to Paraphrase a Paragraph1,
"
Know what ‘paraphrasing’ means.,
Be aware of the differences between paraphrasing and summarizing.,
Understand that paraphrasing doesn’t necessarily mean making the text shorter.",How to Paraphrase a Paragraph2," “Paraphrasing” is saying something someone else has said in your own words. You still express the same ideas, just in a different way. It can be a useful skill to have, especially if you are trying to write an essay or article.Of course, you always want to give credit when you use someone else’s ideas, but paraphrasing gives you a chance to say it in your own words instead of using a direct quotation. By stating it your way, the information may fit better into what you’re writing, allowing your writing to flow more easily from one idea to the next.

, Paraphrasing may sound suspiciously like summarizing, but they are actually two different methods of a rewriting a text. In both methods, you are putting the text in your own words, though summarizing sometimes uses some of the same phrases as the original, depending on your end goals.


For example, let’s say the original writing is: “The fox stalked its prey in the moonlight, it’s large ears and bright eyes on high alert for the rabbit’s next move.”

Example of a paraphrased sentence: “The rabbit stayed still in the light of the moon while the fox surveyed the land using its spectacular hearing and night vision.”

Example of summarization: “Foxes hunt rabbits at night using their ears and eyes.”

, When you summarize, you are trying to take a longer text and make it into a shorter, succinct text using your own words. This is not the case with paraphrasing. In fact, sometimes your paraphrased paragraph might be slightly longer than the original, depending on the words you choose.

"
"
Change the original word choice.,
Use a thesaurus to help you with word choice.,
Create your own syntax for your paraphrased paragraph.,
Try to change the structure of the paragraph.,
Keep in mind that there is more than one way to paraphrase a paragraph.",How to Paraphrase a Paragraph3," When you paraphrase, you must change the words being used. That is, as a writer you have your own unique way of explaining an idea, and therefore, your diction is important. “Diction” just means the words you choose to make your point. When you are paraphrasing, you must choose different words than the ones in the original text to explain the same idea.Example: The words you would choose to tell someone how to ride a bike are different from the words another writer would choose. Someone else may say “Climb on the bike,” while you might say, “Sit on the bike seat.” Both have essentially the same meaning—“Get on the bike”—yet they are worded differently.

, You can use a thesaurus if you can’t think of another word to convey the same idea, as it can remind you of other similar words you already know (these words are called synonyms). Be careful to only use words that you are sure fit, however, as a word you don’t know may have a connotation that isn’t appropriate for the paragraph. “Connotation” is the feeling a word has.


For instance, “grumble” and “protest” have similar meanings, and they would be listed as synonyms in a thesaurus. However, they have different connotations. For instance, “protest” is often connected to politics while “grumble” is not.

, Paraphrasing doesn’t just relate to word choice; it also has to do with syntax and structure. “Syntax” is how you put your words together to form a sentence.For instance, “Jane stared at the sunset as she ate oranges” is syntactically different from the sentence “Jane ate oranges while she stared at the sunset.”

, “Structure” is how sentences and paragraphs are put together. Of course, you want to put the sentences in your paragraphs together in a way that makes sense. You want to lead your reader through the idea you are presenting. Nonetheless, you still have some wiggle room in how a paragraph goes together. When you’re paraphrasing, you can’t just replace words in the text with synonyms (words that mean the same thing) and call it done. You actually need to restructure it until it is a completely new paragraph that conveys the same idea.Paragraph you would like to paraphrase: “Jane swerved in the road to avoid hitting the deer. As the car veered off the road, Jane couldn’t help thinking this day may be her last. Her thoughts flashed to her children and her spouse. The car hit the tree with a sickening crunch, and Jane blacked out. However, she awoke within a few seconds, bruised and sore, but alive.”

Paraphrased paragraph example 1: “Jane saw a deer in the road, so she swung her car around to miss the animal. Her car headed for the trees. Her mind flooded with images of her family, and she wondered if she would die today. As the front of the car crunched into the tree, she lost consciousness for a moment, though she thankfully survived the crash with just a few bumps.”

, It’s important to note that there are any number of ways to rewrite a paragraph, as many as there are writers. For instance, the same paragraph used in the previous step could be paraphrased in a different way that is not as vivid, and not quite as detailed. Nonetheless, it still tells the reader the same information using different wording.



Paraphrased paragraph example 2: “While out driving, Jane hit a tree because she swerved to miss a deer. She thought about how her family would miss her if she died as the car slammed into the tree. She sustained minor injuries, though the impact knocked her out for a bit.”

The red section, ""The thief,"" is the subject of the sentence, or the one doing the action. The purple section, ""smashed,"" is the verb, or action. The blue section, ""the window,"" is the object: something is happening to it. Keep reading for more explanation, and look back at this example sentence to follow along.

, In an active sentence, the subject is whatever does something. It can be a person, a place, a thing, or even an idea. Here are some examples, with the subject in red:


Every morning, the sun rises.

The tall woman will brush her teeth.

Your bravery saved the town.

, In active sentences, the verb describes what the subject does. It can also describe what the subject did in the past, or will do in the future. Here are some examples, with the verb colored purple:


The tree grew very tall.
My enemy is planning his attack.

, In many active sentence, but not all of them, an action is done to something else. Here are examples, with the object colored blue:


The dog ate the meat.
The explorers discovered a new river.

, If you're not sure whether something is the subject or object, find yourself the verb and ask yourself ""What is (verb)-ing?"" to find the subject.Ask ""What is being (verb)ed?"" to find the object. Here's an example of a tricky sentence, step by step:


""Everything in the world irritates her.""
Find the verb. The only word that describes an action is ""irritates"", so ""irritates"" must be the verb.
Find the subject. What is irritating? ""Everything in the world"" is irritating, so the entire phrase ""Everything in the world"" is the subject.
Find the object. What is being irritated? The person described as ""her"" is being irritated, so ""her"" is the object.

, ""The ball is thrown by the athlete."" In this passive sentence, the subject is ""The ball"". The verb, ""was thrown"", describes what happened to the ball. The agent, the thing that did the action, is ""the athlete""., The subject of a passive sentence is having something done to it. This can be any noun: a person, place, thing, or idea. Here are some examples, with the subject written in red:



This essay was written last year.

The delicious dinner was cooked by a professional cook.

Elephants are protected from hunters by international law.

, In a passive sentence, something happens to the subject. The verb is the action that happens. It begins with a ""to be"" verb (for example, ""is,"" ""was,"" ""were,"" ""has been,"" ""will have been""), then a verb in a past tense.Here are some examples with the verb colored purple:


The city was destroyed by the meteor.
All the ice cream had been eaten already.
The music was played beautifully.

, Many passive sentences do not include the agent at all. If an agent is present, it describes what did the action. It usually comes at the end of the sentence, after the word ""by."" Here are some examples, with the agent colored brown:


The child was raised by her mother.
World War I was started by an assassin.

, Remember, a passive sentence is about a subject that something is happening to. Find the verb and ask ""What (verb)?"" to find the subject. To find the agent, if there is one in the sentence, rephrase the sentence to ask ""Who is (verb)ing? Here's a difficult example, step by step:


""None of them had been so badly treated by their own teacher before.""
Find the passive verb. This sentence might sound confusing, because the writer has added some adverbs in the middle of the verb! The full verb is ""had been (...) treated"". If it makes the sentence easier to follow, you can treat the verb as ""had been so badly treated.""
Find the subject. What had been so badly treated? None of them had been so badly treated. ""None of them"" is the subject of the sentence.
Find the agent. Who had treated ""none of them"" so badly before? Their own teacher had treated ""none of them"" so badly before. ""Their own teacher"" is the agent of the passive sentence.

, Passive verbs include a form of ""to be"" as well as a past tense verb. For example, ""was bitten"" or ""been blessed."" This is one of the easiest ways to tell a passive sentence apart, but the next step is also useful for figuring out difficult sentences, and becoming familiar with how passive and active sentences work.

, Read the sentence, think about what it means, and try to describe the topic as an active sentence: ""someone that did something."" If the order of words is the same as the original sentence, the sentence is active. If you had to change the order, the sentence is probably passive. Here are some examples:


""The flower bloomed every night."" This sentence is about ""a flower that bloomed."" You didn't have to change the sentence to say that, so it's an active sentence.
""The river was crossed by the oxen. This sentence is about ""oxen that crossed a river."" You had to change the order of the nouns (river and oxen), so the original sentence is passive.
""The book was written two hundred years ago."" This sentence is about ""Someone that wrote a book."" You had to add a whole new noun (someone) to guess at who did the writing! The original sentence is definitely passive.

, For example, ""This cave painting was created thousands of years ago."" is a good passive sentence. It focuses the attention right on what you want to talk about, the cave painting. The active version of this sentence ""Someone created this cave painting thousands of years ago,"" adds unnecessary words (someone) and makes the topic of the sentence (""this cave painting"") harder to find. Here are additional examples:


""I can't text right now. My phone is being repaired."" is more useful than ""I can't text right now. The electronics store staff is repairing my phone.""
""Our son Robert was delivered at County Hospital last night!"" tells your family the news it wants to hear right away. ""The doctors at County Hospital delivered our son Robert last night!"" puts the focus on the doctors, whom Uncle Joe probably doesn't care about.

, If someone did something embarrassing, you can use a passive verb to avoid calling attention to him.For example, say ""The lamp was broken."" instead of ""John broke the lamp"" if you want to tell everyone that you need a new lamp, without making John feel bad. (Even the active sentence ""Someone broke the lamp"" may start an argument over who did it.)


This use comes up often in politics and news announcements. Keep an eye out for a celebrity, politician, or company spokesman that says ""Mistakes were made."" so they can avoid admitting that ""I made mistakes."", In most cases, an active verb makes a sentence more forceful and easier to follow. When you write a passive sentence, stop and try to rewrite it as an active sentence. It's not always necessary, but it often forces you to improve your writing and think harder about what you're trying to say.For example:


""Slaves were treated badly in the early US."" can be rewritten as ""___ treated slaves badly in the early US."" Depending on your point, you might use the subject ""slave owners,"" ""the judicial system,"" or one of many other nouns.
""Cancer has been called the most dangerous threat to senior citizens."" makes a claim without referring to a source. Rewrite this as ""___ calls cancer the most dangerous threat to senior citizens."" If you are not sure what the subject of this new active sentence is, you might not have enough evidence to make this claim.

Explain that a participle is a form of a verb, usually ending in “ing” or “ed.” There are exceptions, but you can begin teaching using these endings to help the students identify them in the beginning.,
Explain the use of this participle.,
Use a more complicated example to show how a participle can be used with other words to form a participial phrase.,
Explain that there are present participles, which describe something that is going on, and past participles that describe something in the past.,
Introduce students to the use of verbs ending in “ed” as participles.,
Ask the students why they would use participial phrases, instead of writing “Beth reads a lot of books about Mexico because she is interested in the ancient Mayans.” If they are struggling with the concept, explain how these phrases can be used to describe something in fewer words and to vary sentence structure.

,
Try some examples written on the board or on a sheet.,
Give the students a work sheet filled with participial phrases.,
Ask the students to write their own sentences using participial phrases.,
Practice recognizing and using these phrases frequently throughout the unit and year.",How to Teach Participial Phrases,";
, Instead of being used to show the action of the noun, it is used to describe, or modify, the noun. For instance, the word “smiling” is usually used to indicate an act, such as “the girl is smiling;” however, it can be used to describe the noun by saying, “the smiling girl.”This is simply a participle and not yet a phrase. As the student start to understand the use of the verb as an adjective, you can begin teaching participial phrases, a more complicated use of the participle.
Ask the students to try changing some of these compound verb forms to participles with the objects around them.

, For example, “The girl, smiling at the boy, was blushing.” Ask the students to identify the noun, the verb and the participle.


Repeat this exercise with more examples using participial phrases.

, Generally, they are used in a very similar fashion; however, they should know how to identify a past participial phrase and a present participial phrase using the verbs in the sentence.

, For example, Interested in the ancient Mayans, Beth reads a lot of books about Mexico. If the students have trouble recognizing the participle, ask them to identify what the phrase is describing, Beth or the books.

,, Ask the students to underline the participial phrases. The following can be used as examples:


Excited to join the game, Devon finished his homework quickly.
Karen, smelling the delicious roast, washed her hands for dinner.
The water, cascading furiously, washes over the rocks.

, Ask them to work alone or in small groups and underline the phrase. Review the answers as a group so that they can correct themselves., Once they have the hang of this section of grammar, they can use creativity to describe something at their home or to write a paragraph story using five or more participial phrases.

, Students will learn to use them more as they see them in print. As they read a story, ask them to underline any participial phrases with pencil and make a list at the end of the book or story.

Understand the purpose of drills.,
Learn the types of drills that can be used when teaching English.,
Try the substitution drill.,
Try the transformational drill.,
Try the reputation drill.,
Practice the chain drill.,
Use a mechanical drill.,
Practice a communications drill.",How to Teach Using English Language Drills," There are a lot of good reason for using English language drills, including:


To practice.
To fix a new structure in the mind of the students.
To improve students' linguistic skills.
How we can fix something in the mind of students?;
, There are several types of drills (each is explained in the following steps):


Substitution Drill
Transformational Drill
Reputation Drill
Chain Drill
Mechanical Drill
Communication Drill

, Replace or change a new word, for example, Bob teaches English.


In this replacement, type one or other words like Learns, Studies, etc. In this way, they will understand the example easily.

, This is a kind of drill which transfers one idea to another. For example: He teaches, he taught, he will teach, he has taught, he is teaching.

, This is a kind of drill in which you practice pronunciation.

, In this drill, we practice a series of dialogues. For example:


S.A: how are you?
S.B: I am fine.

, For students who can't understand the meaning due to the lesson being complicated, make the lesson easier by expanding it.

, This a kind of drill that while you are teaching, you communicate with student and students by using ideas. Motivate the students to share their ideas and to discuss the topic.

"
"
Start by teaching the basics.,
Begin naming the parts of speech.,
Help students determine what a subject and a predicate is.,
Discuss how certain words modify other words.,
Encourage the students to help one another.",How to Teach Sentence Diagramming1," Talk about how words function; you don’t need to focus on the names of words right at the beginning of your lesson. Help your students begin to see how words interact with each other.


For instance, you can have students act out short sentences to see what is doing the action (the subject/noun), what is the action (the verb), and how they relate to one another.
Try having them act out sentences like “Kelly jumps.” and “Carla writes.” Once the students learn those, move on to more complicated sentences, such as “Kelly jumps quickly over the blue desk.” and “Carla writes in cursive letters on the board.”;
, Teach nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and interjections. Make the connections for your students between the relationships you discussed and the formal names of the parts of speech.

, This is the first step in formal diagramming; everything before this step is an attempt to lay the groundwork.

Find the subject. Go back to your earlier examples, expanding on the exact nature of the subject, which is the thing that does the action in sentence. For instance, in “Kelly jumps quickly over the blue desk,” “Kelly” is the subject.






Talk about the predicate. Teach your students about how the second half of the sentence has the action in it, as well as modifiers to help make sense of what is going on, such as a direct object. The predicate in this case is “jumps quickly over the blue desk.”







, When doing this, link the discussion to your earlier talks on relationships in sentences. Point out which words in the sentence are modifying other words.

Discuss how words like prepositions, articles, and conjunctions connect everything together to help the sentence make sense.






For instance, “quickly” is modifying “jumps,” as it tells how Kelly did the jump.







, When diagramming, write the sentence down on the board so that all the students can follow along. To reinforce the information, have them work in groups to diagram their own sentences.


You can also assign groups to learn about each part of speech and teach it to the rest of the class to help reinforce the lessons. That way, they learn one part of speech really well themselves and help the other kids learn it, too.

Set the text aside.,
Print out the document or alter its look.,
Read the paper out loud.,
Read the work backwards.",How to Read for Punctuation and Grammar Mistakes1," It is very common to miss mistakes when editing your own work, especially if you've just written it. You end up reading for what's in your head and not what's written down on paper. Setting a work aside for a day or so can allow you to get the space you need to spot errors.Ideally, the longer you set a text aside, the better. A day or more might be a good idea. However, if you're working on a deadline you might not have that much time. Try to at least set the text aside for half and hour or 15 minutes before revisiting it.;
, Anything you can do to make a text look different can help you spot errors more easily. Altering the text or seeing it in a different medium can help with the proofreading process.


Ideally, you should print the text out. Not only can reading a text on paper rather than a screen help with proofreading, you'll also be able to use a pen or pencil to mark any errors you see as you go.It's not always possible to print out a text, however. If you do not have a printer handy, you may have to proofread on a screen. If this the case, try altering the look of the document. Change the font's type, color, or size. Copy and paste the text into an e-mail document, send it to yourself, and then read it online., Sometimes, hearing the text out loud can help you catch errors in the text. In a quiet room, read the text as you go along. Try to pay attention to what's written and not what's in your head as you read. Go slowly, focusing on each individual sentence. You might also want to take a pencil or chop stick and tap each word as you go, as this will force you to focus on what's written and not what's in your head., Changing the order of a text can help you catch errors. Much like proofreading, this changes how you look at the text and can help you read what's written and not what's in your head.


Read the last sentence first, then the sentence before the last, and so on. Do this until you reach the first sentence of a paper."

Start with the alphabet and numbers.,
Teach pronunciation, especially for difficult sounds.,
Teach your students nouns.,
Instruct your students on verbs and adjectives.,
Explain tenses and articles.,
Practice common phrases.,
Teach basic sentence construction.,
Encourage students to speak only English in the classroom.,
Provide verbal and written instructions.,
Monitor students’ progress constantly.,
Promote a diversity of modes of learning.,
Break lessons into small pieces.,
Use games to reinforce the topic of the day.,
Use visuals to teach language.,
Promote the use of targeted language apps on mobile devices.,
Use social media.",How to Teach English As a Second Language to Beginners," One of the first things you should start with is to teach the alphabet and numbers. By teaching the alphabet and numbers, you’ll create a great foundation for everything else that your students will learn.


Have your students learn the alphabet to a certain point. You can start at ""a"" and go to ""m,"" if you want. Have your students finish the alphabet at a pace you are both comfortable with. The point is to push your students but to not push them too hard.
Ask your students to work on numbers. As with letters, start them and stop them depending on their capabilities. Consider creating a worksheet on which students can practice writing letters and/or numbers.
Use flashcards with a word that begins with each letter of the alphabet to reinforce your lesson.
Learning the alphabet might be easier to speakers whose native language uses the Latin or English alphabet.;
, Teaching pronunciation is extremely important when teaching English as a second language. Consider focusing on sounds that are particularly hard for English as a second language students like:


The ""TH."" The ""TH"" (like in ""theater"" or ""thing"") does not exist in a number of languages. As a result, it's relatively hard for some ESL students (such as those from Romance or Slavic language backgrounds) to pronounce.
The ""R."" The ""R"" sound is also difficult for many ESL learners for a variety of reason including the fact that it is pronounced differently depending on regional dialects.
The ""L."" The ""L"" sound is another difficult one for ESL learners, especially those from east Asia. Spend extra time on the ""L."", After teaching the alphabet and numbers, move on to nouns. Teaching nouns will be one of the easiest things for your students to learn. This is because your students will be able to look at everything around them as potential things to learn.


Start with common objects in your classroom.
Move on to common objects in your city or town. Good examples are: car, house, tree, road, and more.
Continue on to objects your students will encounter in their daily lives, such as food, electronics, and more., The next step after you teach your students nouns, is to move on to verbs and adjectives. Teaching verbs and adjectives will be a huge step in the process in which your students will put together full sentences (written or spoken).


Adjectives change or describe other words. Examples of adjectives you can teach are: wild, silly, troubled, and agreeable.
Verbs describe an action. Examples of verbs you can teach are: to speak, to talk, and to pronounce.
You’ll need to make sure your students understand the difference between verbs and adjectives. Without knowing how they work, your students will be unable to speak or build sentences.
Spend extra time on irregular verbs. The word ""go"" is a great example of a difficult English irregular verb. The past tense of ""go"" is ""went."" The future tense of ""go"" becomes ""gone."", After you’ve covered nouns, verbs, and adjectives, you need to move on to teaching tenses and articles to your students. Without understanding how to use the proper tense and where to use articles, your students will not be able to put whole sentences together.


Tenses explain when something has happened or occurred. Make sure to explain past tense, current tense, and future tense.
Articles are adjectives that provide extra information about a noun. Articles include: a, an, and the.
Make sure your students master tenses and articles, as they are paramount in their ability to construct sentences and to speak properly., One great way to teach English is to encourage your students to practice and use common phrases. This is important, as your students won’t understand the meaning of many common phrases just based off of the literal meaning of the words.


You should tell your students to repeat those phrases (and use them) until they feel comfortable using them in conversation.
Begin with a few common phrases like “never mind,” “no doubt,” or “make believe.”
Provide your students with a list of common phrases to work with and think about., After you've taught the alphabet, verbs, and more, you should begin to teach your students basic sentence construction. This is important, as it will provide a foundation to their writing ability. It will also aid them in reading. Teach the main five patterns that sentences in English are constructed around:


Subject-Verb sentences. These sentences have the subject followed by a verb. For instance, ""The Dog runs.""
Subject-Verb-Object. These sentences have the subject first, followed by a verb, which is then followed by an object. For instance, ""John eats pizza.""
Subject-Verb-Adjective sentences. These sentences have the subject first, a verb, and then an adjective. For instance, ""The puppy is cute.""
Subject-Verb-Adverb sentences. These sentences have the subject, a verb, and then an adverb. For instance, ""The lion is there.""
Subject-Verb-Noun sentences. These sentences have a subject, a verb, and end with a noun. For instance, ""Emmanuel is a philosopher."", One great way to facilitate learning is to encourage students to avoid speaking languages other than English in the classroom. This necessarily forces students to use their knowledge of English and further develop them. It also provides teaching moments for instructors and learning opportunities for students.


This tactic is best used when students have already learned the basics (basic questions, greetings, the alphabet, and numbers).
When a student uses English incorrectly, correct them in the proper way.
Always be encouraging.
This tactic works well with the “repeat after me” and/or “answer me” approach. For instance, you can make a statement or ask a student a question. It will give them the opportunity to answer in English.
Avoid becoming a “language police.” If a student has difficulty and has to talk in his or her native language, don’t shame them. Hear their concern., When explaining an activity or giving directions about homework, classwork, or a project, you should always give both verbal and written instructions. Giving both verbal and written instructions allows your students to hear words and see them in print at the same time. This will aid in word association and in pronunciation.


Print off directions to an activity and distribute them to students before you explain an activity. If you are teaching online, email directions to your students before you explain it to them via video., No matter what type of lesson you are teaching or what activity your students are doing, you should monitor them constantly. Monitoring students will allow you to see their progress and to find out if they are struggling.


If you’re teaching in a classroom environment, walk around and talk to students to see if they are having trouble.
If you’re teaching online, send messages or emails to students and ask them if they need help.
Make yourself available as much as you can when students are doing in-class activities or other activities., Teaching English as a second language to beginners is a lot more effective when you use a variety of types of learning. Diversity in learning is important since each student is different and learns differently.


Use speaking.
Rely on writing.
Encourage reading.
Suggest listening.
Try to promote all of the modes of learning equally., When teaching beginners or very young students, break the lesson into several pieces of about 10 minutes. Breaking lessons up into small pieces will make sure you don’t lose your students' attention. At the same time, it will make sure that you don’t overwhelm your students.


You don’t need to stay at exactly 10 minutes. Feel free to go a few minutes over if it will aid your lesson.
After each mini-lesson, switch to a totally different sort of lesson. This will help refresh students and keep their attention.
Change your mini lessons daily. Try to incorporate as many different lessons as possible to keep your students' attention and to challenge them.

, Games will help students learn English by making it fun and by compelling them to think in new and different ways.


Try a Jeopardy-type game that uses a point system to get your students to compete against each other.
Consider a Family Fued-style game if you want your students to work together in teams.
Try memorizing or guessing games that rely on flash cards. For instance, display a flash card with a hint and see if your students can guess the correct answer., An important way to teach language is to use visuals in order to build word association. By using visuals to promote word association, your students will be able to make stronger connections between ideas and new words that they are learning in your class. Consider:


Pictures and photographs.
Post-cards.
Video.
Maps.
Comic books. Comic books are especially good because visuals and text are paired together., One great way to teach English as a second language is to incorporate the use of targeted language applications on smart phones. Targeted language apps are a great way to reinforce what you have taught during instruction time, as students can use them to practice their language skills and to learn new phrases and words.


Targeted language apps are available on a number of smart phone operating systems.
There are a wide variety of free targeted language apps, like Duolingo.
Some apps provide the opportunity for multiple students to work together to learn., Social media is a great way to teach English as a second language for beginners. Social media provides a great opportunity for you to teach colloquial phrases and commonly used words. In addition, it provides an opportunity for students to observe word usage and to practice what they have learned.


Try an “idiom of the day” lesson. In this, you can pick common idioms or colloquial phrases, and explain them to your class.
Have your students follow popular figures on Twitter and translate their tweets.
Start a social media group and have students share news pieces and explain or translate them in English."

, The Guardian is an English language news source that makes learning materials available for free. They’ve done the research and compilation of English learning materials for you! Use these materials to get a handle on the basics, starting with the English alphabet.The Big Grammar Book includes 101 printable grammar worksheets. It is useful for both beginners and more established English pupils. The worksheets were provided by EnglishBanana, a website that offers free worksheets and language-learning guides.
The aptly titled Big Resource Book and Big Activity Book are additional compilations of worksheets and lessons to help you learn English.
Take advantages of one of several “toolkits” made available by the Guardian. These are provided by independent language professionals and include illustrated, specific lessons to help you learn English.

, Keep a disciplined routine of daily study sessions, during which you eliminate distractions and focus entirely on the materials you're currently working with. Park yourself somewhere away from a television, turn of your phone (unless you’re using it to help you study), and commit. Aside from traditional methods of studying, there a plenty of ways to study language, especially English.If you’re in a class, revise any worksheets and other assignments when they are returned. Going back over previous homework is always worth your while. This will help keep knowledge fresh in your mind. Take note of anywhere you lost points, and adjust your answer to make it correct.
Take free online quizzes. You can find unlimited vocab quizzes online, as well as quizzes and games that will test your English grammar comprehension, sentence construction, and more.Use audio lessons. Especially if you spend a portion of each day in transit, get in the habit of listening to English lessons. This will help with all around language skills, including pronunciation.

, If you have a friend who is also learning English, make of point of studying together. Even if they are more advanced, you can learn a lot from a peer who already went through experiences and struggles that you’re having.


Languages can be challenging to learn. Having the comradery of a friend to join you in the learning process can help even if you don’t formally work on coursework or materials together.
Simply maintaining a basic conversation with a friend is one of the best ways to study a new language.
If you’re in a class together, check each other’s homework. Not only will this improve your scores, it will also improve your comprehension.
Quiz each other. Even if you’re studying different specific material, you can help one another with flash cards, and pick up new knowledge as you do so.
Having quick access to someone who may be able to answer questions will speed up your studying and make it more enjoyable. Sooner than later, they’ll have questions for you too!

, English arguably has the most words of any language, which means that there are often multiple words that give almost the same meaning. Even if a word is a synonym for another word, that does not mean the two words are interchangeable. Subtle differences in word meanings can make a big difference when you use the words.


For example, the words emaciated and thin have similar meanings, but you would not use them interchangeably. Emaciated indicates that someone looks so thin that she seems unhealthy, while slim implies that one looks thin, yet still attractive and healthy.Check the definition of synonyms before you decide to use them. This will help you to deepen your understanding of the English language while expanding your vocabulary as well.

, Inconsistent ways of spelling certain sounds can make learning English a bit frustrating. When you’re having trouble with a certain word, look at how it's spelled in other forms. This may even frustrate you further for a moment – but it will remind you that there are plenty of exceptions to English spelling rules, and you need to recognize this to master English.


For example, some words feature silent letters, such as ""knife"" and ""honor.”There are also rules for vowel order in some cases, such as “i” before “e” most of the time- (but not always!) and replace the “y” and add “ies” for plural words.

, Verbs can also be challenging when you are trying to learn English. There are many verbs in the English language that have similar meanings, but the meaning of a sentence can be quite different depending on the one you choose.For example, “May I?” and “Can I?” have different (yet similar) meanings. “May” indicates that you are politely asking permission to do something, while “can” indicates that you are inquiring about whether or not something is possible.
Make sure that you familiarize yourself with common verbs to avoid making these types of mistakes.

, In spoken English, many words are not pronounced the same way even if they are spelled the same way. This means that you may end up making some mistakes with pronunciation now and then.


For example, the words “bough,” “tough,” and “cough” all end in the same four letters, but each word is pronounced differently."
"
Make the sentence diagramming process more interactive.,
Try fun grammar games, such as classroom Mad Libs.,
Use note cards.,
Keep your teaching method fun and interesting.",How to Teach Sentence Diagramming2," Not everyone learns by watching a teacher draw a diagram on the board. Try diagramming sentences with each student standing in place of a word.

Write each word of a sentence on a piece of paper or cardboard. Tape off a section of the floor for the subject and predicate. Have the other students instruct the word-holding students on which box they should stand in.






You can have students who represent words that belong together, such as prepositional phrases, link arms to show connections in a physical way.







, Write a story, leaving out crucial words. Then have the students fill in the parts of speech at their desk without letting them see the whole story. The blank spaces in your story should have the name of a part of speech, such as a noun or verb, in the blank spot so that your students know what kind of word to use to fill in the gap.


Encourage a few students to read their stories, which will be silly since they didn’t get to see the original text at first. While this doesn’t teach diagramming, it does help kids learn parts of speech.

, Alternatively, write equal numbers of verbs, nouns, and modifiers (such as prepositional phrases) on cards. Hand one out to each kid. Let kids wander around the room until they find two other people, so that each group has a noun, verb, and modifier. Then have the kids form their cards into sentences.


In another game, have the kids form groups. Give each group a bag of words written out on notecards. Have them sort the notecards into parts of speech within a certain time limit. The team that gets the most correct in that time period wins the game.

, When teaching diagramming, try to make it lighthearted and fun to keep it more interesting. Also, don’t be afraid to change up your teaching technique to make it appeal to a wider variety of students. Everyone learns differently, so changing your approach will help more students grasp the material."

Watch out for apostrophes.,
Make sure colons and semi-colons are used correctly.,
Fix comma splices.",How to Read for Punctuation and Grammar Mistakes2," Many people accidentally misuse apostrophes in their writing. Each time you see an apostrophe used, take a moment to make sure it's used correctly.


Apostrophes are used to show possession. To show something belongs to someone, you would use an apostrophe and then an ""s"" or an apostrophe after an ""s."" An apostrophe and then an ""s"" is used for singular nouns, indefinite pronouns (anybody, somebody, etc.), and plural nouns that do not end in ""s"" (fish, deer, etc.). An apostrophe following an s is only used for plural pronouns that end in an ""s.""For example, ""I asked if I could pet the man's dog."" As ""man"" is a singular noun, the apostrophe comes before the ""s."" In the sentence, ""All the students' papers were turned in late,"" the apostrophe comes after the ""s"" as students is plural and ends in ""s.""
The word ""it"" is an exception. If it is possessive, it's spelled ""its."" The construction ""it's"" is a contraction, meaning ""it is."" For example, ""The dog is chewing on its toy. It's a black Labrador."", Semi-colons and colons are often used incorrectly or used in place of one another. Each time you see one of the two used, pause to make sure the usage is correct.


Semi-colons are usually used to connect closely related ideas when a comma is not appropriate. Semi-colons can link independent clauses, clauses connected by transitional phrases or conjunctive adverbs, or lengthy clauses with multiple commas in each clause to avoid confusion. Usually, semi-colons should be used between two clauses that could stand on their own independently.A common error regarding semi-colons is using a comma when a semi-colon would be appropriate. For example, ""The dog is big, it is also brown."" As there is no conjunction connecting those two clauses, and the ideas are connected, a semi-colon would be more effective here. ""The dog is big; it is also brown.""Another common error regarding semi-colons is using one in place of a colon. A colon is used to say, ""that is to say"" or ""here is what I mean."" It's most commonly used before lists in a sentence. For example, ""Jane went to the store and bought everything she needed for the cookies: spices, sugar, flour, and icing.""A colon can also be used much the same way a semi-colon is used, to connect two clauses, but only if specific requirements are met. A colon should only be used in place of a semi-colon if the second clause explains the first. For example, ""Mark's long career in law paid off: he was elected district judge that year."" As the second clause explains what the first was alluding to, Mark's election as judge being what his law career lead to, a colon is appropriate.
Two ideas that are merely connected would still require a semi-colon. For example, ""Mark got to the courthouse at noon; he put on his judge's robes."" As the robes do not offer an explanation for the first clause, a semi-colon is used., Commas are one of the most misused forms of punctuation. While proofreading a paper, watch out for comma splices.


Read through your paper and take note of every use of a comma. For example, take the sentence, ""Eve went to the drugstore, she picked up a prescription for painkillers."" Read the first part of the sentence. Does it make sense on its own? Yes. Read the second part. That also makes sense on its own. This is a comma splice and the error should be corrected.There are three ways to fix a comma splice. You could add a conjunction that merges the sentences together. For example, ""Eve went to the drugstore and picked up a prescription for painkillers"" or ""Eve went to the drugstore to pick up a prescription for painkillers.""Second, you could replace the comma with a period and make two sentences. ""Eve went to the drugstore. She picked up a prescription for painkillers.""Third, you could replace the comma with a semicolon if the sentences are closely related. ""Eve went to the drugstore; she picked up a prescription for painkillers."""

Watch for sentence fragments.,
Break down run-on sentences.,
Watch for sentence sprawls.,
Make sure the subject and verb of each clause agree.,
Keep the same verb tense throughout the sentence or passage.,
Watch for basic spelling errors and typos.",How to Read for Punctuation and Grammar Mistakes3," A sentence fragment is a statement with a period, question mark, or some form of punctuation that fails to stand on its own as a sentence.


Fragments are most often a piece of a sentence disconnected from a main clause. For example, ""My old roommate never paid rent on time. Which is why I need a new roommate."" The second part of that thought is a sentence fragment. It can be corrected by merging the two. ""My old roommate never paid rent on time, which is why I need a new roommate.""Sentence fragments can also be a sentence without a main verb. For example, ""A book with a morally ambiguous main character."" This tells about the book and its characters, but there's no action happening which means it is not a full sentence. A possible revision would be, ""This book features a morally ambiguous main character"" the verb becoming ""features.""Sometimes, sentence fragments lack a subject. For example, ""With the intended effect of the law being deterring drunk driving in the city."" The subject is unclear. A revision might be, ""The law's intended effect is deterring drunk driving in the city."", Run-on sentences can be somewhat difficult to detect as they can sometimes appear grammatically correct if not read closely. Run-on sentences are very long sentences when two or more clauses are joined without the use of a comma, semi-colon, conjunction, or other means of connecting sentences.A good way to detect run-on sentences is to read a work out loud. Listen to your own voice. If you find the sentence difficult to finish in a single breath, and if you find it's hard to follow when spoken out loud, it might be a run-on sentence.A run-on sentence can usually be corrected through the use of a comma, semi-colon, or other device to unite the two sentences. For example, ""My favorite movie is It's A Wonderful Life it is a very heartwarming Christmas story."" This is a run-on sentence as the two clauses (""My favorite movie..."", ""it is a..."") are not properly connected. It could be fixed in a number of ways.
You could break down the run-on into two sentences. ""My favorite movie is It's A Wonderful Life. It is a very heartwarming Christmas story."" You could use a semi-colon, as the ideas are connected. ""My favorite movie is It's A Wonderful Life; it's a very heart warning Christmas movie."" You could also use a conjunction to unite the clauses. ""My favorite movie is It's A Wonderful Life because it's a heartwarming Christmas story.""

, Sentence sprawls are very long sentences that, while usually technically grammatically correct, can be difficult to read. Some writers use sentence sprawls stylistically, but unless a sentence sprawl is intentional and meant to convey something to the reader you should minimize their use. In general, if you notice a very long sentence that takes up more than two lines, try to break it up into multiple sentences., Subject/verb agreement means singular subjects have singular verbs, and plural subjects have plural verbs. People sometimes make mistakes with S/V agreement when writing sentences with multiple clauses or longer sentences as they lose track of what the subject was.


In some sentences, the subject appears before another noun and you may accidentally have the verb agree with the second noun over the actual subject. For example, take the sentence ""The profits brought in by the bar industry is off this season."" At first glance, this may appear correct as ""is"" comes after ""bar industry."" However, the subject of the sentence is ""the profits,"" not the bar. Therefore, the correct construction would be ""The profits brought in by the bar industry are off this season.""When joining two singular subjects with a conjunction like ""and"", the verb should be plural even though the subjects themselves are singular. For example, ""Mary and her friend takes the train into the city each day"" is incorrect as both ""Mary"" and ""her friend"" are singular nouns, but they are presented as a plural unit. The correct construction would be ""Mary and her friend take the train into the city each day."", Shifting between present and past tense may confuse the reader. Make sure your verb tense is always in agreement.


People often slip up by mistake with tense agreement, especially when typing quickly. Past and present tense verbs are often spelled in similar ways, leading you to make an error. For exampled, ""James entered the room and sit down on the chair."" As ""sit"" and ""sat"" differ only by one letter, this is an easy mistake to make. The sentence should be, ""James entered the room and sat down on the chair.""

, Even people generally good with spelling and grammar occasionally make mistakes.


Dropped words are a common typo. You may forget the ""is"" or ""the"" in a sentence if you worked too quickly. Reading a work out loud can help you catch dropped words.Do not rely solely on spellcheck. Spellcheck can be a helpful feature but it does not catch all spelling and grammar errors. If, for example, you typed ""quite"" instead of ""quiet"" spellcheck would not catch this error.
Know what words you tend to misspell. Words like ""unnecessary,"" for example, can trip people because of the multiple letters. Keep a running list of words you frequently stumble over and pay attention to their use in your paper."
"
Watch for passive voice.,
Eliminate nominalization.,
Limit use of the word ""there."",
Correct ""By...it"" constructions.",How to Read for Punctuation and Grammar Mistakes4," Using passive voice is generally advised against unless you work in a few specific disciplines. Watch for the passive voice as you edit your work.


The subject of a sentence should be the person, place, or thing doing the action. This is called the active voice and you should generally use the active when writing.In the passive voice, some form of the verb ""to be"" (e.g., is, are, was, were) is used with a past participle (a verb in the past tense). This can be needlessly confusing to read and takes attention away from the action, which should be the primary focus of a sentence.For example, take the sentence ""The dog was walked by Holly."" This sentence is in the passive voice. To correct it, you would change it to, ""Holly walked the dog."" This sentence puts focus on the person engaging in the action (Holly) rather than the objected acted upon (the dog)., Nominalization is unnecessarily using the noun form of a word when the verb form would make the sentence more concise. People often accidentally nominalize a sentence in a first draft.To catch unneeded nominalization, look for the word ""of"" and examine each time you use it in a paper. ""Of"" is often used in nominalization. For example, ""Luke offered an explanation of why Rosemary was late for class.""As you can see in the above sentence, instead of using the verb ""explain"" the noun ""explanation"" is used. The sentence would be quicker and easier to read if it were rewritten as ""Luke explained why Rosemary was late for class."", ""There"" is an expletive that usually does nothing to clarify the meaning of a sentence. In general, you should remove unnecessary uses of the word ""there"" while proofreading.


Sentences that begin with ""there,"" ""there is,"" and ""there are"" would generally read better with these portions removed. For example, ""There are many people who believe free speech should be limited in certain ways."" Removing the ""there"" makes the sentence read more smoothly. ""Many people believe free speech should be limited in some way."", These constructions are unnecessarily long sentence that begin with ""by"" and use the word ""it"" somewhere in the middle. For example, """"By putting the herbs in the pasta sauce first, it allows the flavors to really sink in"" could be made more concise by simply saying ""Putting the herbs in the pasta sauce first allows the flavors to really sink in.""

Find a native conversation partner in person or online.,
Take a class.,
Study abroad.",How to Perfect Your English1," If your experience with English has largely been in textbooks, it can be helpful to practice your conversation skills with a native English speaker. Conversing regularly with a skilled English speaker will enable you to speak more fluidly and develop a natural speaking cadence. You can seek out a native speaker to partner with for conversation through Meetup.com or a local university.


If you don’t have time to seek out a partner in person, many online services such as Italki.com can connect you with a native speaker over Skype for one-on-one conversation sessions.;
, A classroom setting allows you to brush up your language skills in areas of confidence and improve your skills where you lag. You may feel at ease practicing in front of others who fall a little short of fluency as well. ESLdirectory.com provides a great database to browse ESL classes in your area., Immersing yourself completely in not just an English-speaking population but also an English-speaking culture can take your fluency to the next level. Seek out university programs in the United States, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia or New Zealand for further study. Many accept international students year-round."

Read comics. An easy option, if you don't want to read children's books, is to read comic books or comics instead. You can buy many English language comic books in bookstores and online, or you can read free comics online (these are usually called webcomics).
Read books you've read before. You can also read a book you have read before. If you already know a little bit about what happens, then you will have an easier time guessing and understanding the words.
Read the newspaper. Newspapers are a good way to learn the basics of a language, because they usually have very good grammar and are written to be easy to understand. You can find online versions of many good English language newspapers, like the New York Times or The Guardian.;
, Watching movies will also help you improve your English, by helping you to hear what it sounds like and also helping you to learn new words. You can start watching with subtitles on, but you will learn more with the subtitles off. Once you have a basic vocabulary, try to keep the subtitles off and focus on listening for the words you do know and guessing the words you don't know from what is happening on the screen.

, MMOs are video games that you play online with other people. You can choose to play with people in English-speaking countries, which will give you the chance to talk with them and learn from them. Try playing Guild Wars, World of Warcraft, or The Elder Scrolls Online.

, Pen-pals are people trying to learn your language that you write letters (or emails) to and they write back. You write half of your letter in your native language so that they can practice and half in English so that you can practice. You can talk about whatever you want! There are many websites that can help you find an online pen-pal.

, You can also just make friends with English language speakers online and chat, email, and Skype together in order to practice your English. You can find online friends by joining fan communities or through language-learning communities like Fluentify.

, Learning and singing songs is another good way to make your English better. This will help you learn the sounds of English (rhymes will help your pronunciation). It will also help improve your vocabulary. Find a song you like, learn it, and learn what the lyrics mean.

, English courses will help you learn the most important words and grammar and can help you make sure you're learning everything correctly. There are two main ways to take English language courses:


Take an online course. You can take courses online. Some of these cost money and some are free. The ones that cost money may be better than the free ones but not all the time! Good examples of online programs are LiveMocha and Duolingo.
Take a course in school. You can take a class from a local college or English language school. These cost money, but the help from the teacher will be very important and will help you learn faster than trying to learn on your own.

, This will force you to practice your writing and vocabulary. It will also force you to practice making new sentences, instead of just repeating sentences you already know. You can keep a diary of your day. You should also keep a small journal where you write down new words when you hear or see them.

, Traveling to a place where everyone speaks English will help you learn a lot faster. Take a temporary job or a study abroad course in an English-speaking country. You can also take shorter trips, but immersing yourself in the language for at least 3 months will help the most.

, Of course, you can teach yourself English too. The trick to teaching yourself English fast is to make it the most important thing to you. Spend all of your free time studying and use your English as often as you can.

, There are many online tools for helping you to learn English faster. These range from flashcard type programs to phone apps. Try ANKI (flashcards), Memrise (flashcards and so much more), or Forvo (pronunciation guide).

, Immersion is one of the best ways to learn a language. This means that you need to study English every day, for at least 3 hours a day. One hour once a week is not enough to learn. If you can spend at least 6 hours a day hearing, writing, and speaking English, this will help you the most.

, When you are trying to learn new words, don't work from a giant list of vocabulary. Learn only a few words at a time and do not move on until you really know those words.

, Put a label on everything in your home to help you learn those words. This will teach you to think of the image when you see the word, instead of translating everything in your head.

, Google image search is a great way to learn nouns (and some other types of words) in a language. Search new words in the image search tool and the pictures that show up will help you learn!

, Generally, you should not use flashcards with only words (with the English word on one side and your word on the other). This teaches you to translate everything inside your head, making you slow to understand the English you hear. Instead, try to learn the English word with a sound or picture.

, The thing about English is that most people don't speak with perfect grammar and few people even speak with good grammar. If you spend all of your time trying to learn the grammar, you'll waste a bunch of time. Speak incorrectly: it's ok! Someone will correct you and you'll learn over time. Eventually it will sound right and you won't even have to think about it.

, The most important part of learning a language quickly is to just speak it. Just use your language skills as much as you can. Don't worry about being wrong or not saying something correctly. Not using your skills makes you learn so much slower. Just speak! You can do it!

Talking to actual native speakers is the most effective way to improve your English skills, speaking or otherwise. So whether you have to Skype them, call them, or beg them to speak to you, do so. Your progress will be faster this way than any other.


Even if they're just tourists, invite them to dinner! They get a meal, you get an English lesson. Advertise on Craigslist. Take a class and get buddy-buddy with your teacher. Offer a language exchange. They're hiding out there somewhere!;
, No, not English music, the music of English -- its lilt, its prosody, the sing-songy-ness of it. The intonation. Even if you speak perfect English technically, if you speak it like a robot you're not speaking it the way it's meant to be spoken.


Watch people. Watch how their mouths form the words. Watch how emotion is communicated. Watch where the emphasis goes on certain sentences and how that provides context. Apart from just deciphering their words, take notice of the humor, the feeling, and the formality they employ.

, Above all, if you want to be understood, slow down. The more clearly you speak, the better chance your listener has of understanding you. It's tempting to get nervous and want to speed up to get it all over with, but you can't do that! Clarity is key -- for some native English speakers, too!


They will be patient with you -- don't worry! You just gotta be patient with yourself. It's much less frustrating to speak to someone who you understand even though they're speaking slowly than to speak to someone you don't understand at all. Speaking quickly isn't impressive if your tongue gets all jumbly.

, Though we hear ourselves all the time, we really don't know quite what we sound like. So record yourself! What are the weak and strong points you hear in your speech? And then you can concentrate on what you need to work on.


A great idea is to get a book on tape, record yourself reading an excerpt from it (or mimicking the narrator), and comparing yourself to the recording. That way you can do it over and over until you get it right!
When that's a bit too much effort, just read your books aloud. You'll score points on your reading skills and your speaking skills. Half the battle is just getting comfortable with the words!

, Yes, one class is good. In fact, one class is even great. But if you can take more than one class -- of differing styles -- that's even better. A group class can be cheap, fun, and work on all your skills, but adding a one-on-one class, too? You'll get that individualized attention to your speech you've been craving. That's a double dose of improvement.


There are specialized classes you can take, too. Accent reduction classes, business English classes, tourism classes, heck, sometimes even food classes. If you see something that interests you (let's face it, sometimes grammar doesn't cut it), go for it! You may learn more than you think.

, This is the biggest, easiest mistake to make. You go about your day, you're on the job working partly in English, you go to your English class, and then you go home and revert back to your native tongue. While you may be making slow improvements, you'll never get past that dreaded lingual plateau. Make a point to speak it at home, too. Have only English at the dinner table. Stick to English TV at home. Make it as 24/7 as possible.


Heck, talk to yourself in English. Narrate your actions. While you're washing the dishes, say what you're doing, thinking, or feeling. It sounds a little silly (if you get caught!), but it keeps your brain thinking in English before your first language, which is huge. Once you can do that, the rest is just keeping it up.

, It's easy to look at your situation and think that you'll never be exposed to English naturally as much as you would like. Going abroad is expensive, you don't know any foreigners, etc. That's the lazy way of looking at it! English speakers are everywhere; sometimes they just have to be found and coaxed out of hiding. You have to come to them.


Heck, call up an English hotline. Call up Nike and ask about their sneakers. Call a phone company and make small talk about phone plans. Start a blog. Set your OS to English. Play WoW. Get into English chat rooms. There are ALWAYS opportunities to be had.

, If your listening skills feel lacking, don't beat yourself up. It seems like the easiest skill, but it can be very, very taxing. The way you're taught English in school is practically the opposite of how native speakers actually speak. No wonder it's such a chore!


So the next time someone says, ""Do you want to pass me that bag?"" and you hear, ""Djuwanapassmethabag?"" you're not going crazy. Between that and all the ""like,"" ""uhh,"" and ""umm,"" you run into it could drive a person crazy. So when you get in the listening zone, remind yourself: it's slang time.

, Really. Passive listening is okay, but interacting is even better. If you want to get good at listening, you have to ask questions. And this way you have control of the conversation! If you ask someone what their favorite thing to do in summer is you know they're not going to go off on a confusing tangent on politics. At least, hopefully!


And the more you hear a specific individual talk, the easier it is to understand them. English has so many accents you may find yourself not understanding someone and wondering why. Be patient! Your mind will get used to their accent in time. English-speaking people have to adjust for each other all the time.

, So while talking and listening proactively is best, passive learning is good, too. So throw on the telly and sit down for a spell. Try to keep the captions off! And if you can record it and watch it more than once, even better. That way you can see your progress.


Even having the radio on in the background is helpful, just to keep your mind in the English zone. But the best case scenario is getting a movie and watching it over and over until your mind stops having to worry about understanding and instead can concentrate on the little things, like intonation and slang. And watching TV shows where you have the same characters over and over so you get used to their speech. In other words: repetition.

, If you have a friend who speaks English that is trying to learn a language you speak, start an English exchange! Half the time you speak your language and the other half you speak English. And you get to spend time drinking coffee and relaxing, too!


If that's not a possibility, find some friends who all want to practice their English. Though practicing this language with non-native speakers isn't ideal, it's definitely way better than nothing. You'll be less nervous speaking it in front of them and you can learn from each others' strengths.

, Even just learning a song a day can widen your vocabulary extensively. And it's fun and energizing, too. You can grow your musical repertoire, learn new words, and expand your knowledge without even realizing it. And then you can go hit the karaoke bar!


Stick to songs that are slow and clear. The Beatles and Elvis are two great places to start, though modern music is good, too -- just aim for the ballads; they're usually the easiest to understand. Rap can wait till later.

, It's as simple as that. To get good at something, you have to do it. You have to do it over and over and over. So write. Every day. It can be a diary entry, it could be your next bestseller; it doesn't really matter. Just put that pen to paper and get going.


Keep it all in one place. Having a notebook or binder dedicated to your English work will keep you organized and motivated. The better you get, the easier it will be to see your progress. You can look back and marvel at how bad you used to be and how awesome you are now.

, However, it's kinda pointless if you don't ever get it checked or corrected. You want to get better at the entire language, not just the language you're capable of right now. You have two options here:


The Internet. It's amazing; it really is. Sites like italki.com and lang-8 can correct your work for free! Don't get off wikiHow just yet, but do keep those sites in mind.
A friend. Obviously. But the great thing about writing is that you can email your friend and wherever they are, they can get it, correct it, and get it back to you. So whether they're a mile away or in the middle of Canada, progress can be had.

, If you write like a six-year-old, regardless of how correct your writing is, it still is going to sound like a six-year-old. The only difference between a six-year-old with good grammar and a 20-year-old with good grammar is their vocabulary. So whenever you run into a phrase you want to start incorporating into your writing (or speech), write it down. And then make a point to use it.


A good idea is to start learning collocations. That's a fancy term for words that go together. ""Get married"" is useful, but ""get married to someone"" is even better -- that way you know not to say ""get married with."" If you said you ""received a cold,"" you'd receive some funny looks -- but not if you said you ""caught a cold."" See how that works?

, While knowing a lot of words is all well and good, if you type like this,your writing isn't going 2 look very good u know? Painful. Make sure you have your spaces right, your punctuation right, and use capital letters when appropriate. That stuff matters too.


Unless you are a 15-year-old girl texting her friends, text speak is not okay. ""You"" is ""you,"" not ""u."" ""For"" is not ""4."" ""2"" means something very different than ""to"" or ""too."" You won't be winning any medals for writing like that.

, It has practically everything you've ever wanted. Practically. There are websites that have English games, easy-to-read English articles, and exercises to improve your skills in every domain. Here's just a few neat ones to whet your appetite:Anki is flashcard software. Similar things can be found on websites like Memrise, too. You can basically quiz yourself.
OneLook is a type of dictionary that can find words for you, define them, and translate. You only need the, cough cough, one look. It also has a reverse dictionary where you can type in the concept instead!
Visuwords creates word map visualizations, connecting the word you search with similar, associated words or words that collocate with it. Great way to expand your vocabulary!
Similar to Visuwords, Merriam Webster has a ""visual dictionary."" If you type in ""tire,"" it will show you a tire, with words pointing to every little detail of it from ""tread"" to ""bead wire.""
Englishforums is a great place to pose questions and talk to speakers. It's basically message board after message board of English-related questions.

, And by that, we don't mean ""get it checked,"" like stated above. We mean get it checked and then rewrite it. You want a beautiful, finished draft of perfect English created by you. If you just write it and get it corrected, you won't truly ingest what mistakes you made and how to fix them. And this way your notebook is a whole heck of a lot prettier.


Once you've corrected a piece, try to write something the next day that builds upon the mistakes you've corrected. This way you can prove to yourself that you've improved and actually notice the mistakes you're not making anymore. You'll get better and build your confidence. Bonus.-

Take an online course.,
Watch television and movies in English.,
Listen to the radio or podcasts in English.,
Read aloud.",How to Perfect Your English2," It used to be that you needed to shell out lots of money for online English classes, but that is changing thanks to MOOECs or Massive Open Online English Courses. These courses are taught online at the college level and often by high-ranking professors. Best of all? Most are free.Top MOOECs to seek out are Alison, FutureLearn and EdX. Many offer specialized classes that focus on improving conversation skills, verb tenses and more, so you can improve the particular area that you have trouble with to perfect your English.

, Listening to English with onscreen action can go a long way towards improving your language skills. Try to watch new shows and movies as well as movies that you know well. Doing this can help you pick up slang and improve your conversation skills.Keep a list of unfamiliar words you encounter while watching in a notebook. Afterward, try to use the new words in sentences you write yourself. This will help you incorporate the words into your vocabulary.

, Your commute is a great time to practice your English skills. Whenever you’re in the car, flip to an English radio station. Listening to people go back and forth in English can help you pick up on certain words or phrases people employ often in dialog.If you’re listening to a radio interview, imagine how you would answer the questions. Try to practice and interact as much as possible. No one’s looking!

, Reading provides an opportunity to practice your English while also looking at the words. This will help you with reading comprehension and give you an opportunity to take things slow and review sentence construction. Add unfamiliar words to your vocabulary list.If you struggle with reading in English, try simple books, such as children’s books. These are usually written in a straightforward way and have pictures to aid with comprehension.

Fine-tune your accent.,
Practice intonation.,
Observe cultural norms and social gestures closely.",How to Perfect Your English3," A bad accent is a dead giveaway that you are not a native speaker. To improve your accent, try breaking difficult words down into their component sounds. Note where your lips and teeth are when you make the sounds successfully. Try to replicate the lip and mouth movements that give you the most authentic sound.Try recording yourself and listen to the playback to improve your accent. If you switch between American and British accents, it may be distracting for listeners. It can be helpful to impersonate a famous actor or actress who is a native speaker with the accent you prefer to better hone your sound.

, Intonation helps listeners better comprehend your message and the emotion behind it. To work on your intonation, spend some time watching soap operas in English. Sure, they are corny, but their intonation is usually exaggerated for effect. Use that as a guide to understand when it is appropriate for your voice to go up in pitch or down based on the content of what you are saying.Pick a piece of dialog from a play, for example, and record yourself reading it with the proper intonation. Make recordings over time to see how your intonation has improved or changed with this same piece. By listening to the playback, you can get a better idea of where your voice is off or just right.

, Gestures, coupled with language, can send a powerful message about the strength of your English. English speakers who have native fluency don’t just have all the right words or intonation, they are culturally attuned to the hand gestures and norms (dressing, facial expressions, etc.) that characterize English speakers.Go to a local market and watch people interact; It can be helpful to note people who are your age and gender in particular. What expressions do they use to drive home a point or let someone know they are listening? Make a list of any characteristics you notice and try to incorporate them when you speak English.

Start simple.,
Practice conversations.",How to Speak English1," Very few people are true beginners when it comes to English. ""Hello,"" ""hi,"" ""How are you?"" and numerals have infiltrated most societies. Odds are you know more English than you think.


Take what you know. For example, ""How are you?"" That uses the verb ""to be."" What are other questions just like this? Take what you know and expand it!

How is she?
How is your father?
How are your children?
How is the weather?



Start memorizing verbs. The top ten most common verbs in English are the following: ""be,"" ""have,"" ""do,"" ""say,"" ""get,"" ""make,"" ""go,"" ""know,"" ""take,"" and ""see.""Just knowing these verbs can get you through a lot of basic conversations.
English is subject-verb-object, in that order. Your subject pronouns are: ""I,"" ""you,"" ""he""/""she""/""it,"" ""we,"" ""you,"" ""they."" Object pronouns in English are: ""me,"" ""you,"" ""him""/""her""/""it,"" ""us,"" ""you,"" ""them."" With those verbs and knowing English is SVO, what sentences can you come up with?

I know her.
She makes it.
He takes us.

;
, Once you have basic subject and object pronouns down and a handful of verbs, you can start asking questions.


Questions often open with ""who,"" ""what,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" ""why,"" and ""how."" ""Who"" indicates a person; ""what"" indicates a thing; ""when"" indicates a time; ""where"" indicates a place; ""why"" indicates a reason; ""how"" indicates a manner.
Say you know the subjects, some basic nouns, those ten verbs, and these question starters. What are some things you could ask an English speaker?

What is your name?
What do you do?
When is your birthday?
Where is she?
Why do you have it?
How do you know?

Tell him that we automatically know the correct stress as native speakers, but he must learn the stress for every word.,
Show him how to ask you if he's saying a word with the correct stress.",How to Teach a Learner of English Correct Word Stress," This kind of error will sound like this: instead of saying beHIND, he will say BEhind, or even BE-HIND.;
, He may think he's ok since he says all the right sounds, but the word stress is wrong.

, Any dictionary will show the syllables of a word (be.hind) and which one is stressed (be.hind').

,, You may need to do this several times, and remind him often.

, There are no easy rules to memorize for word stress; it's just something he must learn when he learns a new word, like the spelling.

, ""Am I saying that word right?"" would be a good phrase for him to memorize.

Move your mouth and avoid eating your words.,
Do not say “Tuh” instead of “To” in between words.,
Do not run your words together.,
Avoid using contractions or short forms.,
Decrease the use of words that fill your sentences.,
Be explicit: Say “Yes” or “No”.,
Stop bad habits.,
Be patient and smile.",How to Speak Articulately With Non Native English Speakers," Remember those old Kung-Fu movies on American TV? Move your mouth as those actors did. It is important to breathe and relax your facial muscles and chest. Preferably, in private, I like to pinch my cheeks with my fingers and move them in, out, and around. This exercise creates an ""elastic"" effect. In fact, it relaxes your facial muscles!;
, For example, I need “tuh” talk “tuh” the manager.

, “Whadyado?”, “Gonna”, “Gimme”, “Lemme”, and “Wanna” are words that are run together. Visualize your words as a punching ball and ""target"" it with your speech. Imagine each individual word passing in your mind's eye like subtitles in a movie. Articulate each word and “punch” it. You punch, recover, and punch again.

, Use long forms. “Can’t” is one word you must use the long form with. It is difficult for a non-native speaker to understand the difference between “can” and “can’t” in a sentence. For example, “I can’t take you on Friday” and “I can take you on Friday”. Use the long form, “cannot”. “I cannot take you on Friday”.

, The idea is to remove the “noise” from your speech. Imagine trying to listen to the radio with two young children in the same room. They are playing and screaming. What is the result? ""Family of...car...on vacation...in Arizona."" If your oral communication is filled with ""um"", ""like"", ""you know"", or other fillers, comprehension is more difficult. “Right” is a word that commonly fills conversations. I prefer to use “Yes, that is correct”. A non-native speaker may not understand “right” and confuse it with its opposite, “left”.

, Do not say: “Uh-huh” or “Uh-uh”. Those expressions are not in grammar books!

, Many non-native speakers may have learned bad habits when acquiring English. For example, many Indian speakers of English dispense almost entirely with prepositions. To them, ""I am going to house"" is quite valid even though its meaning is not clarified by adding my, your, a, that or his/her. Listen for such omissions and clarify them., The more relaxed you are, the more you are in control of your communication. Do not give a busy lifestyle or a meeting agenda permission to control your speech. Think as you speak and do not speak as you think.

Learn FOIL multiplication.,
Understand factoring.,
Write a space for the answer in FOIL form.,
Fill out the First terms.,
Use factoring to guess at the Last terms.,
Test which possibilities work with Outside and Inside multiplication.",How to Factor Trinomials1," You might have already learned the FOIL method, or ""First, Outside, Inside, Last,"" to multiply expressions like (x+2)(x+4). It's useful to know how this works before we get to factoring:


Multiply the First terms: (x+2)(x+4) = x2 + __
Multiply the Outside terms: (x+2)(x+4) = x2+4x + __
Multiply the Inside terms: (x+2)(x+4) = x2+4x+2x + __
Multiply the Last terms: (x+2)(x+4) = x2+4x+2x+8

Simplify: x2+4x+2x+8 = x2+6x+8;
, When you multiply two binomials together in the FOIL method, you end up with a trinomial (an expression with three terms) in the form ax2+bx+c, where a, b, and c are ordinary numbers. If you start with an equation in the same form, you can factor it back into two binomials.


If the equation isn't written in this order, move the terms around so they are. For example, rewrite 3x - 10 + x2 as x2 + 3x - 10.
Because the highest exponent is 2 (x2, this type of expression is ""quadratic.""

, For now, just write (__ __)(__ __) in the space where you'll write the answer. We'll fill this out as we go.


Don't write + or - between the blank terms yet, since we don't know which it will be.

, For simple problems, where the first term of your trinomial is just x2, the terms in the First position will always be x and x. These are the factors of the term x2, since x times x = x2.


Our example x2 + 3x - 10 just begins with x2, so we can write:
(x __)(x __)
We'll cover more complicated problems in the next section, including trinomials that begin with a term like 6x2 or -x2. For now, follow the example problem.

, If you go back and reread the FOIL method step, you'll see that multiplying the Last terms together gives you the final term in the polynomial (the one with no x). So to factor, we need to find two numbers that multiply to form the last term.


In our example x2 + 3x - 10, the last term is -10.
What are the factors of -10? What two numbers multiplied together equal -10?
There are a few possibilities: -1 times 10, 1 times -10, -2 times 5, or 2 times -5. Write these pairs down somewhere to remember them.
Don't change our answer yet. It still looks like this: (x __)(x __).

, We've narrowed the Last terms down to a few possibilities. Use trial and error to test each possibility, multiplying the Outside and Inside terms, and comparing the result to our trinomial. For example:


Our original problem has an ""x"" term of 3x, so that's what we want to end up with in this test.
Test -1 and 10: (x-1)(x+10). The Outside + Inside = 10x - x = 9x. Nope.
Test 1 and -10: (x+1)(x-10). -10x + x = -9x. That's not right. In fact, once you test -1 and 10, you know that 1 and -10 will just be the opposite of the answer above: -9x instead of 9x.
Test -2 and 5: (x-2)(x+5). 5x - 2x = 3x. That matches the original polynomial, so this is the correct answer: (x-2)(x+5).
In simple cases like this, when you don't have a constant in front of the x2 term, you can use a shortcut: just add the two factors together and put an ""x"" after it (-2+5 → 3x). This won't work for more complicated problems, though, so it's good to remember the ""long way"" described above.

Factor the following polynomial.",How to Factor the Difference of Two Perfect Squares," A coefficient is the number in front of a variable, which is multiplied by the variable.The variable is the unknown value, usually denoted by x{\displaystyle x} or y{\displaystyle y}.. The degree refers to the exponent of the variable. For example, a second-degree term has a value to the second power (x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}) and a fourth-degree term has a value to the fourth power (x4{\displaystyle x^{4}}).For example, in the polynomial 36x4−100x2{\displaystyle 36x^{4}-100x^{2}}, the coefficients are 36{\displaystyle 36} and 100{\displaystyle 100}, the variable is x{\displaystyle x}, and the first term (36x4{\displaystyle 36x^{4}}) is a fourth-degree term, and the second term (100x2{\displaystyle 100x^{2}}) is a second-degree term.
;
, A  greatest common factor is the highest factor that divides evenly into into two or more terms.If there is a factor common to both terms of the polynomial, factor this out.For example, the two terms in the polynomial 36x4−100x2{\displaystyle 36x^{4}-100x^{2}} have a greatest common factor of 4x2{\displaystyle 4x^{2}}. Factoring this out, the problem becomes 4x2(9x2−25){\displaystyle 4x^{2}(9x^{2}-25)}  .


, If you factored out a greatest common factor, you are only looking at the terms that remain inside the parentheses. A perfect square is the result of multiplying an integer by itself.A variable is a perfect square if its exponent is an even number.You can only factor using the difference of squares if each term in the polynomial is a perfect square.

For example, 9x2{\displaystyle 9x^{2}} is a perfect square, because (3x)(3x)=9x2{\displaystyle (3x)(3x)=9x^{2}}. The number 25{\displaystyle 25} is also a perfect square, because (5)(5)=25{\displaystyle (5)(5)=25}. Thus, you can factor 9x2−25{\displaystyle 9x^{2}-25} using the difference of squares formula.


, You know you are finding the difference if you have a polynomial that subtracts one term from another. The difference of squares only applies to these polynomials, and not those in which addition is used.

For example, you cannot factor 9x2+25{\displaystyle 9x^{2}+25} using the difference of squares formula, because in this polynomial you are finding a sum, not a difference.


, The formula is a2−b2=(a−b)(a+b){\displaystyle a^{2}-b^{2}=(a-b)(a+b)}. The terms a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} and b2{\displaystyle b^{2}} are the perfect squares in your polynomial, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the roots of the perfect squares., This is the value for a{\displaystyle a}. To find this value, take the square root of the first perfect square in the polynomial. Remember that a square root of a number is a factor you multiply by itself to get that number.

For example, since (3x)(3x)=9x2{\displaystyle (3x)(3x)=9x^{2}}, the square root of 9x2{\displaystyle 9x^{2}} is 3x{\displaystyle 3x}. So you should substitute this value for a{\displaystyle a} in the difference of squares formula: 9x2−25=(3x−b)(3x+b){\displaystyle 9x^{2}-25=(3x-b)(3x+b)}.


, This is the value for b{\displaystyle b}, which is the square root of the second term in the polynomial.

For example, since (5)(5)=25{\displaystyle (5)(5)=25}, the square root of 25{\displaystyle 25} is 5{\displaystyle 5}. So you should substitute this value for b{\displaystyle b} in the difference of squares formula: 9x2−25=(3x−5)(3x+5){\displaystyle 9x^{2}-25=(3x-5)(3x+5)}.


, Use the  FOIL method to multiply the two factors. If your result is your original polynomial, you know you have factored correctly.

For example:(3x−5)(3x+5){\displaystyle (3x-5)(3x+5)}=9x2+15x−15x−25{\displaystyle =9x^{2}+15x-15x-25}=9x2−25{\displaystyle =9x^{2}-25}.


, Use the difference of two squares formula: 36x4−9{\displaystyle 36x^{4}-9}.

The terms have no greatest common factor, so there is no need to factor anything out of the polynomial.

The term 36x4{\displaystyle 36x^{4}} is a perfect square, since (6x2)(6x2)=36x4{\displaystyle (6x^{2})(6x^{2})=36x^{4}}.

The term 9{\displaystyle 9} is a perfect square, since (3)(3)=9{\displaystyle (3)(3)=9}.

The difference of squares formula is a2−b2=(a−b)(a+b){\displaystyle a^{2}-b^{2}=(a-b)(a+b)}. Thus, 36x4−9=(a−b)(a+b){\displaystyle 36x^{4}-9=(a-b)(a+b)}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the square roots of the perfect squares.

The square root of 36x4{\displaystyle 36x^{4}} is 6x2{\displaystyle 6x^{2}}. Plugging in for a{\displaystyle a} you have 36x4−9=(6x2−b)(6x2+b){\displaystyle 36x^{4}-9=(6x^{2}-b)(6x^{2}+b)}.

The square root of 9{\displaystyle 9} is 3{\displaystyle 3}. So plugging in for b{\displaystyle b}, you have 36x4−9=(6x2−3)(6x2+3){\displaystyle 36x^{4}-9=(6x^{2}-3)(6x^{2}+3)}.


, Make sure you factor out a greatest common factor, and use the difference of two squares: 48x3−27x{\displaystyle 48x^{3}-27x}.

Find the greatest common factor of each term. This term is 3x{\displaystyle 3x}, so factor this out of the polynomial: 3x(16x2−9){\displaystyle 3x(16x^{2}-9)}.

The term 16x2{\displaystyle 16x^{2}} is a perfect square, since (4x)(4x)=16x2{\displaystyle (4x)(4x)=16x^{2}}.

The term 9{\displaystyle 9} is a perfect square, since (3)(3)=9{\displaystyle (3)(3)=9}.

The difference of squares formula is a2−b2=(a−b)(a+b){\displaystyle a^{2}-b^{2}=(a-b)(a+b)}. Thus, 48x3−27x=3x(a−b)(a+b){\displaystyle 48x^{3}-27x=3x(a-b)(a+b)}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the square roots of the perfect squares.

The square root of 16x2{\displaystyle 16x^{2}} is 4x{\displaystyle 4x}. Plugging in for a{\displaystyle a} you have 48x3−27x=3x(4x−b)(4x+b){\displaystyle 48x^{3}-27x=3x(4x-b)(4x+b)}.

The square root of 9{\displaystyle 9} is 3{\displaystyle 3}. So plugging in for b{\displaystyle b}, you have 48x3−27x=3x(4x−3)(4x+3){\displaystyle 48x^{3}-27x=3x(4x-3)(4x+3)}.


, It has two variables, but it still follows the rules for the difference of squares method: 4x2−81y2{\displaystyle 4x^{2}-81y^{2}}.

No factor is common to each term in this polynomial, so there is nothing to factor out before you begin factoring the difference of squares.

The term 4x2{\displaystyle 4x^{2}} is a perfect square, since (2x)(2x)=4x2{\displaystyle (2x)(2x)=4x^{2}}.

The term 81y2{\displaystyle 81y^{2}} is a perfect square, since (9y)(9y)=81y2{\displaystyle (9y)(9y)=81y^{2}}.

The difference of squares formula is a2−b2=(a−b)(a+b){\displaystyle a^{2}-b^{2}=(a-b)(a+b)}. Thus, 4x2−81y2=(a−b)(a+b){\displaystyle 4x^{2}-81y^{2}=(a-b)(a+b)}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the square roots of the perfect squares.

The square root of 4x2{\displaystyle 4x^{2}} is 2x{\displaystyle 2x}. Plugging in for a{\displaystyle a} you have 4x2−81y2=(2x−b)(2x+b){\displaystyle 4x^{2}-81y^{2}=(2x-b)(2x+b)}.

The square root of 81y2{\displaystyle 81y^{2}} is 9y{\displaystyle 9y}. So plugging in for b{\displaystyle b}, you have 4x2−81y2=(2x−9y)(2x+9y){\displaystyle 4x^{2}-81y^{2}=(2x-9y)(2x+9y)}.

Start with the present tenses.,
Move to the past and future tenses.,
Put your adjectives before nouns.",How to Speak English2," Let's start with present simple and present continuous:


Present simple is used for facts and habits. If you are describing something that is true or something that happens often, opt for the present simple.

I go to work every day.
She eats breakfast at 7.
China is a big country.


Present continuous is used for things that are happening right now. There are two verbs: a helper and a main verb. The helper is ""am""/""is""/""are"" (depending on the subject) and the main verb is any verb with -ing:

You are reading.
I am typing.
He is watching TV.



, Once you've mastered the present, get started on the past and future tenses. We're just going to go over the basic ones now:


Use the past simple for any event that happened in the past at a specific time.

I saw that movie last year.
She died on a plane.
We went to the bank yesterday.


For the future, let's keep it simple. Add a future time marker, and just use the present continuous! It can double as a future tense, too.

They are making a cake tomorrow.
You are leaving in May.
I am going at 6 pm.



, Always, always, always put the adjective (the word that describes) before the noun. Always! In fact, there's even an order within adjectives:


There are eight basic types of adjectives: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more than one, they go in that order. So, it's a ""huge, round, metal bowl"" or a ""small, red sleeping bag.""

"
"
Label everything.,
Keep an eye on your pronunciation.,
Pick a dialect.",How to Speak English3," Take the objects in your house and label them with their English equivalent. The goal is to get your mind thinking in English. When it's right there, it'll be impossible to ignore.


When you've labeled everything and find yourself thinking, ""Where is my blanket?"" try to think of the word (or sentence) in English. When you find your blanket, were you right?
Don't write on the objects--grab a slip of paper and tape it on sturdily.

, It's very easy to get caught up in memorizing words when pronunciation can be just as important. Unfortunately, English has exceptions to most rules. But there are still some general guidelines you can abide by:


Always say the last sounds in the word. Certain Asian dialects find this rather difficult. If you know you're guilty of this, keep it in mind. ""Streets"" is not pronounced stree. The ""ts"" is very important in retaining meaning.
Take the sentence ""I project the project will end soon."" Confusing, huh? Isn't English SVO? Yes, and this sentence is too. The first ""project"" (verb) is pronounced pro-JECT; the second (noun) is pronounced PRO-ject. The same is true for all verb-noun pairs: nouns stress the first syllable, verbs the second.
Though there are definite exceptions, most nouns in English have the first syllable stressed. Think of the nouns in your house: ""BED-room,"" ""BATH-room,"" ""KITCH-en,"" ""TA-ble,"" ""WIN-dow,"" ""SO-fa,"" ""WA-ter,"" ""JACK-et,"" ""TOI-let,"" etc.

, There are meaningful differences between American, British, and Australian English. Before you go about increasing your vocabulary, which one appeals to you?


Sometimes it's very important to know who you're speaking to. If you tell an American, Canadian, or Australian you're not wearing pants, they might wonder if you're wearing shorts, a dress, a skirt, or just in your underwear. If you tell a British person you're not wearing pants, you're going commando!
In addition to vocabulary differences, the pronunciation differences are huge. Know these variations exist before you get confused with multiple correct pronunciations.

Certain dictionaries use British English and certain dictionaries prefer American. Choose the one that's best for you.



"
"
Get a good dictionary.,
Speak in English with native speakers.,
Use the internet.,
Watch TV, listen to songs, and read books.,
Think in English.",How to Speak English4," If you need to, get several. A dictionary to translate between your first language and English is best, in addition to a dictionary in English only.


Get a pocket-sized version for when you're on the go and that pesky word you keep forgetting comes up.

, Though it may be tempting to speak with your other friends who are learning too, you'll see the quickest results if you converse mainly with native speakers.



Hire a tutor or private teacher. Make sure they're native and have the accent you want. Choose someone with teaching experience--just because you can speak a language does not mean you can teach it.

If a teacher isn't up your alley, get a penpal!



, There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of sites you can use to your benefit. Anything to make grammar more exciting is welcome--there are games and videos galore.


Such resources can be found at Simple English Wikipedia, the British Council, and English Club, among many others.
YouTube doesn't have to be about funny animals and popular music. Tap into its educational resources as well.

, Though your goal is to speak English, you have to be able to understand it, too! Even when you're alone and not stuck in a grammar exercise you can keep your mind primed.


Start with children's books and TV shows. The language is simpler and will go slower. Eventually, move to channels catered to your interests. If you enjoy cooking, graduate to the Food Network and see what you can pick up on. Try not to turn on the captions!

If you have a DVR, record the shows. That way you can go back and work through the dialogue and conversations at your own pace.
Listen to English music! Ballads go quite slowly and the refrains can be rather repetitive. Your vocabulary will naturally expand, too.



, If you find yourself thinking something simple in you native tongue, what would its equivalent be in English? Make a habit of this for maintenance and memory.



Think out loud if helps. Explain to your roommates or family what you're trying to do; maybe they'll want to catch on, too! Eventually, simple phrases will become par for the course.

Use simple factoring to make more complicated problems easier.,
Look for trickier factors.,
Solve problems with a number in front of the x2.,
Use substitution for higher-degree trinomials.",How to Factor Trinomials2," Let's say you need to factor 3x2 + 9x - 30. Look for something that factors into each of the three terms (the ""greatest common factor"", or GCF).In this case, it's 3:


3x2 = (3)(x2)
9x = (3)(3x)
-30 = (3)(-10)
Therefore, 3x2 + 9x - 30 = (3)(x2+3x-10). We can factor out the new trinomial using the steps in the section above. Our final answer will be (3)(x-2)(x+5).

, Sometimes, the factor might involve variables, or you might need to factor a couple times to find the simplest possible expression. Here are a few examples:


2x2y + 14xy + 24y = (2y)(x2 + 7x + 12)
x4 + 11x3 - 26x2 = (x2)(x2 + 11x - 26)
-x2 + 6x - 9 = (-1)(x2 - 6x + 9)
Don't forget to factor the new trinomial further, using the steps in method 1. Check your work and find similar example problems in the example problems near the bottom of this page.

, Some quadratic trinomials can't be simplified down to the easiest type of problem. Learn how to solve problems like 3x2 + 10x + 8, then practice on your own with the example problems at the bottom of the page:


Set up our answer: (__ __)(__ __)

Our ""First"" terms will each have an x, and will multiply together to make 3x2. There's only one possible option here: (3x __)(x __).
List factors of 8. Our options are 1 times 8, or 2 times 4.
Test these using the Outside and Inside terms. Note that the order of the factors matter, since the Outside term is being multiplied by 3x instead of x. Try out every possibility until you get an Outside+Inside result of 10x (from the original problem):
(3x+1)(x+8) → 24x+x = 25x no

(3x+8)(x+1) → 3x+8x = 11x no

(3x+2)(x+4) → 12x+2x=14x no

(3x+4)(x+2) → 6x+4x=10x yes This is the correct factor.

, Your math book might surprise you with an equation with a high exponent, such as x4, even after you've used simple factoring to make the problem easier. Try substituting a new variable that turns it into a problem you know how to solve. For example:


x5+13x3+36x
=(x)(x4+13x2+36)
Let's invent a new variable. We'll say y = x2, and plug it in:
(x)(y2+13y+36)
=(x)(y+9)(y+4). Now switch back to using the original variable:
=(x)(x2+9)(x2+4)
=(x)(x±3)(x±2)

Check for prime numbers.,
Check to see if the trinomial is a perfect square.,
Check whether no solution exists.",How to Factor Trinomials3," Check to see if the constant in either the first or third term of the trinomial is a prime number. A prime number can be divided evenly only by itself and 1, so there is only one possible pair of binomial factors.br>


For example, in x2 + 6x + 5, ""5 is a prime number, so the binomial must be in the form (__ 5)(__ 1).

In the problem 3x2+10x+8, 3 is a prime number, so the binomial must be in the form (3x __)(x __).
For the problem 3x2+4x+1, both 3 and 1 are prime numbers, so the only possible solution is (3x+1)(x+1). (You should still multiply this out to check your work, since some expressions can't be factored at all – for example, 3x2+100x+1 has no factors.)

, A perfect square trinomial can be factored into two identical binomials, and the factor is usually written (x+1)2 instead of (x+1)(x+1). Here a few common ones that tend to show up in problems:


x2+2x+1=(x+1)2, and x2-2x+1=(x-1)2

x2+4x+4=(x+2)2, and x2-4x+4=(x-2)2

x2+6x+9=(x+3)2, and x2-6x+9=(x-3)2

A perfect square trinomial in the form ax2 + bx + c always has a and c terms that are positive perfect squares (such as 1, 4, 9, 16, or 25), and a b term (positive or negative) that equals 2(√a * √c)., Not all trinomials can be factored. If you're stuck on a quadratic trinomials (ax2+bx+c), use the quadratic formula to find the answer. If the only answers are the square root of a negative number, no real solutions exist, so there are no factors.


For non-quadratic trinomials, use Eisenstein's Criterion, described in the Tips section.

Each one of these parts is called a ""factor."" So, for example, the number 6 can be evenly divided by four different numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 6. Thus, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

The factors of 32 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32

Both ""1"" and the number you're factoring are always factors. So, the factors of a small number, like 3, would simply be 1 and 3.

Factors are only the perfectly divisible numbers, or ""whole"" numbers. You could divide 32 by 3.564, or 21.4952, but this won't lead to a factor, just another decimal.
;
, A binomial is simply the addition or subtraction of two numbers, at least one of which contains a variable. Sometimes these variables have exponents, like x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} or 5y4{\displaystyle 5y^{4}}. When first factoring binomials, it can help to reorder equations with ascending variable terms, meaning the biggest exponent is last. For example:


3t+6{\displaystyle 3t+6}  →  6+3t{\displaystyle 6+3t}


3x4+9x2{\displaystyle 3x^{4}+9x^{2}}  →  9x2+3x4{\displaystyle 9x^{2}+3x^{4}} 


x2−2{\displaystyle x^{2}-2}  →  −2+x2{\displaystyle -2+x^{2}} 


Note how the negative sign stays in front of the 2. If a term is subtracted, just keep the negative in front of it.




, This means you find the highest possible number that both parts of the binomial are divisible by. If you're struggling, simply factor both numbers on their own, then see what the highest matching number is. For example:


Practice Problem:3t+6{\displaystyle 3t+6}.

Factors of 3: 1, 3

Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6.


The greatest common factor is 3.




, Once you know your common factor, you need to remove it from each term. Note, however, that you're simply breaking the terms down, turning each term into a small division problem. If you did it right, both equations will share your factor:


Practice Problem:3t+6{\displaystyle 3t+6}.


Find greatest common factor: 3


Remove factor from both terms:3t3+63=t+2{\displaystyle {\frac {3t}{3}}+{\frac {6}{3}}=t+2}


, In the last problem, you removed a 3 to get t+2{\displaystyle t+2}. But you weren't just getting rid of the three entirely, simply factoring it out to simplify things. You can't just erase numbers without putting them back! Multiply your factor by the expression to finally finish. For example:


Practice Problem:3t+6{\displaystyle 3t+6}


Find greatest common factor: 3


Remove factor from both terms:3t3+63=t+2{\displaystyle {\frac {3t}{3}}+{\frac {6}{3}}=t+2}


Multiple factor by new expression: 3(t+2){\displaystyle 3(t+2)}


Final Factored Answer: 3(t+2){\displaystyle 3(t+2)}


, If you did everything correctly, checking that you got it right should be easy. Simply multiply your factor by both individual parts in the parenthesis. If it matches the original, unfactored binomial then you did it all correctly. From start to finish, solve the expression 12t+18{\displaystyle 12t+18} to practice:


Reorganize terms:18+12t{\displaystyle 18+12t} 


Find greatest common denominator: 6{\displaystyle 6}


Remove factor from both terms:18t6+12t6=3+2t{\displaystyle {\frac {18t}{6}}+{\frac {12t}{6}}=3+2t}


Multiple factor by new expression: 6(3+2t){\displaystyle 6(3+2t)}


Check Answer: (6∗3)+(6∗2t)=18+12t{\displaystyle (6*3)+(6*2t)=18+12t}


, When solving an equation with binomials, especially complex binomials, it can seem like there is no way everything will match. For example, try to solve 5y−2y2=−3y{\displaystyle 5y-2y^{2}=-3y}. One way to solve it, especially with exponents, is to factor first.


Practice Problem: 5y−2y2=−3y{\displaystyle 5y-2y^{2}=-3y}

Remember that binomials must only have two terms. If there are more than two terms you can learn to solve polynomials instead.


, This whole strategy relies on one of the most basic facts of math: anything multiplied by zero must equal zero. So if you equation equals zero, then one of your factored terms must equal zero! To get started, add and subtract so one side equals zero.


Practice Problem: 5y−2y2=−3y{\displaystyle 5y-2y^{2}=-3y}


Set to Zero:  5y−2y2+3y=−3y+3y{\displaystyle 5y-2y^{2}+3y=-3y+3y}


8y−2y2=0{\displaystyle 8y-2y^{2}=0}




, At this point, you can pretend the other side doesn't exist for a step. Just find the greatest common factor, divided it out, and then create your factored expression.


Practice Problem: 5y−2y2=−3y{\displaystyle 5y-2y^{2}=-3y}


Set to Zero: 8y−2y2=0{\displaystyle 8y-2y^{2}=0}


Factor: 2y(4−y)=0{\displaystyle 2y(4-y)=0}


, In the practice problem you are multiplying 2y by 4 - y, and it must equal zero. Since anything multiplied by zero equals zero, this means either 2y or 4 - y must be 0. Create two separate equations to figure out what y must be for either side to equal zero.


Practice Problem: 5y−2y2=−3y{\displaystyle 5y-2y^{2}=-3y}


Set to Zero: 8y−2y2+3y=0{\displaystyle 8y-2y^{2}+3y=0}


Factor: 2y(4−y)=0{\displaystyle 2y(4-y)=0}


Set both parts to 0:


2y=0{\displaystyle 2y=0}


4−y=0{\displaystyle 4-y=0}




, You might have one answer, or more than one. Remember, only one side has to equal zero, so you might get a few different values of y that solve the same equation. For the end of the practice problem:


2y=0{\displaystyle 2y=0}


2y2=02{\displaystyle {\frac {2y}{2}}={\frac {0}{2}}}


y = 0




4−y=0{\displaystyle 4-y=0}


4−y+y=0+y{\displaystyle 4-y+y=0+y}


y = 4




, If you got the right values for y then you should be able to use them to solve the equation. It is simple as trying each value of y in place of the variable, as shown. Since the answer were y = 0 and y = 4:


5(0)−2(0)2=−3(0){\displaystyle 5(0)-2(0)^{2}=-3(0)}


0+0=0{\displaystyle 0+0=0}


0=0{\displaystyle 0=0} This answer is correct




5(4)−2(4)2=−3(4){\displaystyle 5(4)-2(4)^{2}=-3(4)}


20−32=−12{\displaystyle 20-32=-12}


−12=−12{\displaystyle -12=-12} This answer is also correct.




, Remember, factoring is finding out what numbers can divide into the whole. The expression x4{\displaystyle x^{4}} is another way of saying x∗x∗x∗x{\displaystyle x*x*x*x}. This means you can factor out each x if the other term has one as well. Treat variables no different from a normal number. For example:


2t+t2{\displaystyle 2t+t^{2}} can be factored, because both terms contain a t. Your final answer would be t(2+t){\displaystyle t(2+t)}

You can even pull out multiple variables at once. For example, in x2+x4{\displaystyle x^{2}+x^{4}} both terms contain the same x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}. You can factor to x2(1+x2){\displaystyle x^{2}(1+x^{2})}


, Take, for example, the expression 6+2x+14+3x{\displaystyle 6+2x+14+3x}. This may seem like it has four terms, but look closely and you'll realize there are really only two. You can add like terms, and since both the 6 and 14 have no variable, and the 2x and 3x share the same variable, these can both be combined. Factoring is then easy:


Original Problem: 6+2x+14+3x{\displaystyle 6+2x+14+3x} 


Reorganize terms: 2x+3x+14+6{\displaystyle 2x+3x+14+6} 


Combine like terms: 5x+20{\displaystyle 5x+20}


Find greatest common factor: 5(x)+5(4){\displaystyle 5(x)+5(4)}


Factor: 5(x+4){\displaystyle 5(x+4)}


, A perfect square is a number whose square root is a whole number, like 9{\displaystyle 9} (3∗3){\displaystyle (3*3)}, x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} (x∗x){\displaystyle (x*x)}, or even 144t2{\displaystyle 144t^{2}} (12t∗12t){\displaystyle (12t*12t)} If your binomial is a subtraction problem with two perfect squares, like a2−b2{\displaystyle a^{2}-b^{2}}, you can simply plug them into this formula:


Difference of perfect squares formula: a2−b2=(a+b)(a−b){\displaystyle a^{2}-b^{2}=(a+b)(a-b)}


Practice Problem: 4x2−9{\displaystyle 4x^{2}-9}


Find square roots:


4x2=2x{\displaystyle {\sqrt {4x^{2}}}=2x}


9=3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9}}=3}




Plug squares into formula: 4x2−9=(2x+3)(2x−3){\displaystyle 4x^{2}-9=(2x+3)(2x-3)}, Just like the perfect squares, this is a simple formula for when you have two cubed terms subtracted by each other. For example, a3−b3{\displaystyle a^{3}-b^{3}}. Just like before, you simply find the cubed root of each, plugging them into a formula:


Difference of perfect cubes formula: a3−b3=(a−b)(a2+ab+b2){\displaystyle a^{3}-b^{3}=(a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})}


Practice Problem: 8x3−27{\displaystyle 8x^{3}-27}


Find cubed roots:


8x33=2x{\displaystyle {\sqrt{8x^{3}}}=2x}


273=3{\displaystyle {\sqrt{27}}=3}




Plug cubes into formula: 8x3−27=(2x−3)(4x2+6x+9){\displaystyle 8x^{3}-27=(2x-3)(4x^{2}+6x+9)}, Unlike the difference of perfect squares, you can easily find added cubes too, like a3+b3{\displaystyle a^{3}+b^{3}}, with a simple formula. It's almost the exact same as above, just with some pluses and minuses flipped. The formula is just as easy as the other two, and all you have to do is recognize the two cubes in the problem to use it:


Sum of perfect cubes formula: a3+b3=(a+b)(a2−ab+b2){\displaystyle a^{3}+b^{3}=(a+b)(a^{2}-ab+b^{2})}


Practice Problem: 8x3−27{\displaystyle 8x^{3}-27}


Find cubed roots:


8x33=2x{\displaystyle {\sqrt{8x^{3}}}=2x}


273=3{\displaystyle {\sqrt{27}}=3}




Plug cubes into formula: 8x3−27=(2x+3)(4x2−6x+9){\displaystyle 8x^{3}-27=(2x+3)(4x^{2}-6x+9)}"

Say, ""We're working with the polynomial."" x3 + 3x2 - 6x - 18 = 0. Let's group it into (x3 + 3x2) and (- 6x - 18);
,


Looking at (x3 + 3x2), we can see that x2 is common.
Looking at (- 6x - 18), we can see that -6 is common.

,


Factoring out x2 from the first section, we get x2(x + 3).
Factoring out -6 from the second section, you'll get -6(x + 3).

,


This gives you (x + 3)(x2 - 6).

, If you have an x2 in your roots, remember that both negative and positive numbers fulfill that equation.


The solutions are -3, √6 and -√6.

,


Let's say you're working with the equation: x3 - 4x2 - 7x + 10 = 0.

, The constant ""d"" is going to be the number that doesn't have any variables, such as ""x,"" next to it.


Factors are the numbers you can multiply together to get another number. In your case, the factors of 10, or ""d,"" are: 1, 2, 5, and 10.

, We want to determine which factor makes the polynomial equal zero when we substitute the factor for each ""x"" in the equation.


Start by using your first factor, 1. Substitute ""1"" for each ""x"" in the equation:
(1)3 - 4(1)2 - 7(1) + 10 = 0
This gives you: 1 - 4 - 7 + 10 = 0.
Because 0 = 0 is a true statement, you know that x = 1 is a solution.

, If x = 1, you can rearrange the statement to look a bit different without changing what it means.


""x = 1"" is the same thing as ""x - 1 = 0"" or ""(x - 1)"". You've just subtracted a ""1"" from each side of the equation.

, ""(x - 1)"" is our root. See if you can factor it out of the rest of the equation. Take it one polynomial at a time.


Can you factor (x - 1) out of the x3? No you can't. But you can borrow a -x2 from the second variable; then factor it: x2(x - 1) = x3 - x2.
Can you factor (x - 1) out of what remains from your second variable? No, again you can't. You need to borrow another little bit from the third variable. You need to borrow a 3x from -7x. This gives you -3x(x - 1) = -3x2 + 3x.
Since you took a 3x from -7x, our third variable is now -10x and our constant is 10. Can you factor this? You can! -10(x - 1) = -10x + 10.
What you did was rearrange the variables so that you could factor out a (x - 1) out of the entire equation. Your rearranged equation looks like this: x3 - x2 - 3x2 + 3x - 10x + 10 = 0, but it's still the same thing as x3 - 4x2 - 7x + 10 = 0.

, Look at the numbers that you factored out using the (x - 1) in Step 5:


x2(x - 1) - 3x(x - 1) - 10(x - 1) = 0. You can rearrange this to be a lot easier to factor one more time: (x - 1)(x2 - 3x - 10) = 0.
You're only trying to factor (x2 - 3x - 10) here. This factors down into (x + 2)(x - 5).

, You can check whether your solutions actually work by plugging each one, individually, back into the original equation.


(x - 1)(x + 2)(x - 5) = 0 This gives you solutions of 1, -2, and 5.
Plug -2 back into the equation: (-2)3 - 4(-2)2 - 7(-2) + 10 = -8 - 16 + 14 + 10 = 0.
Plug 5 back into the equation: (5)3 - 4(5)2 - 7(5) + 10 = 125 - 100 - 35 + 10 = 0.

In most instances you will need to be a native English speaker, or have significant and demonstrable mastery of English, such as a Bachelor’s degree from an English language university. You will generally need a degree, but it doesn’t normally make a big difference what the degree is in., A specific ESL teaching qualification is not essential for you to find work teaching in Japan. Most schools will offer training after you arrive to help you learn how to teach. Taking a course before you go, however, will give you a competitive advantage in the job market and will help you be more prepared for the work.


There are a number of different courses you can take, ranging from high-level courses such as the CELTA qualification, to short online TEFL courses.
The kind of course you might consider depends on whether you are looking to build a career teaching English, or work for a shorter period to try it out.
The more high-end courses can be very expensive, so it is advisable to try the work out for a while before deciding whether or not you want to make the investment., One of the best ways to get work teaching English in Japan is through the government’s JET (Japan Exchange and Teaching) Programme. The majority of JET workers will be assigned as Assistant Language Teachers, who will assist and support the Japanese English teachers in the classroom and in extra-curricular activities.The Assistant Language Teachers are there particularly to help the students with their speaking and conversational English.
In Japan there is a strong emphasis on reading and writing English, so native speaker Assistants can play an important part in the speaking element.
JET contracts last for a year, starting in the summer, and can potentially be renewed for up to four years., Aside from the JET programme, the other main employers of ESL teachers are private language schools. Searching through the internet will reveal a huge number of potential employers, and it can be difficult to judge from a website what a school will be like and what your working conditions will be.


The US Embassy in Japan provides a webpage with links to a number of organisations in Japan that employ ESL teachers: http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/jicc/japan-links.html#Employment

Whatever schools you find that you want to apply to, always do plenty of research online about the school as well as the city or area in which it is situated.
Ask around in ESL forums online for advice and stories from people who know the area and the schools., When applying for a teaching job in Japan, you should be wary of potential scams and dubious recruiters. Always insist on getting everything in writing, and ensure that you are given a formal working contract. Watch out for tell-tale signs and signals, such as the recruiter asking for some upfront fees or payments, or asking for money for some leads on jobs. Some other key signs to watch out for include:


Being asked to pay a processing fee for a visa. Your employer should pay this, not you.
The company using a Post Office Box address rather than a street address.
A company that says they will arrange a working visa after you arrive. It is illegal to work in Japan on a tourist visa.
Being asked for personal information, such as your bank card details.
Being pressured to take a job immediately with a line like “we have only one job left, you have to accept now.”, It sounds obvious, but you should be sure that you have a valid passport that is not due to expire while you will be in Japan. Check with this plenty of time before you are due to fly, because it can take a while for a new passport request to be processed.

, The school or company you will be working for should do the work to arrange the appropriate visa for you before you arrive. If you are working and being paid you will need a proper working visa, not a tourist visa.


You can go to Japan on a tourist visa and look for work, but you will only have three months to find work and get the appropriate visa before your tourist visa expires.
It should be possible to find work when in Japan, but be aware that most big companies only hire from outside Japan.
If you are in Japan you are more likely to find work with smaller companies, with fewer school branches., It is possible to apply for a working visa yourself, but you must have a job before you do this, and you must have a college degree. Your visa application needs to be sponsored by an employer, so you can’t get a working visa until you have a job offer. The application process can take two or three months. The visa typically granted to ESL teachers is called the “Specialist in Humanities/International Services” visa. You need information about you and the company you will work for, including:


Copies of the company’s registration and financial accounts.
Documents detailing your duties, and your contract.
Certificates and qualifications that show your education and career achievements.
A completed visa application form with two photos.
Your “Reason for Invitation Form.”
A “Letter of Guarantee Form.”, Before you leave it’s sensible to make copies of all the important documents and pieces of paperwork. This could include your passport, your visa, your insurance and your contract. If you are planning to look for work after you arrive, you should bring copies of all your qualifications and certifications., It is common for your accommodation to be organised by your employer before you arrive. If you are participating in the JET Programme, for example, you will be provided accommodation. You will typically get a small apartment, but you should ensure you know what to expect before you arrive.


Apartments in Japan are typically small and sparsely furnished compared to your average apartment in the West.
Not all apartments will have an internet connection, so be sure to ask before you arrive., Before you get out in Japan, you should make sure you completely understand how you will be paid, and what, if any, costs will be covered for you. In some instance your accommodation will be provided for free, other times you will have to pay. You will generally receive a monthly salary paid directly into your bank account.


Depending on your employer, your pay may have all the usual tax and insurance deductions included.
Generally the big schemes, such as JET programme, that are designed for people coming from outside Japan for a year or two, will organise all the taxes and insurance for you.If you working more independently for a private school, you may be expected to make arrangements for insurance and tax yourself.

, If you are keen to teach in English in Japan, chances are that you are already interested in Japanese life and culture and want to experience it first-hand. Even so, it’s a good idea to do some further research on daily life in Japan and specifically in the place you will be living and working.


It could be fun to draw up a list of things you want to do in your spare time, such as learning more Japanese and trying out loads of great sushi.

, You will only be expected to speak English at your workplace, but it’s a good idea to spend some time trying to get to grips with some Japanese basics before you head out. Being able to ask for things politely and greet people in Japanese will help you settle in when you arrive. Here are a few words to get you started:


Hello – Konnichiwa (KOHN-NEE-CHEE-WAH).
Welcome – Youkoso (YOH-KO-SO).
Thank you – Arigatou Gozaimasu (AH-REE-GAH-TOH-GO-ZA-EE-MAH-SU)., If you have a job arranged before you arrive, you will most likely find yourself in the classroom soon after you arrive. There may be some training, but you should expect to be getting involved in the classroom quickly so it’s best to be prepared. Some small things can help make the first few classes a little easier, such as bringing small gifts from your home country for the students, and bringing educational games like Scrabble.


Make sure you have a good English dictionary, as well as a comprehensive grammar book.
Bring along some resources, such as a book of ESL lesson plans to help you.
Take some glossy magazines and other resources that you can use to engage the students."
"
Read any English language newspaper aloud and slowly.,
Find some children's books.,
Prepare your own dictionary of words.,
Construct your own sentences using the words that you have noted in your dictionary.,
Be methodical.,
Read aloud as often as you can.,


",How to Improve Your Knowledge of English," Go as slowly as possible in order to understand the meaning of what you are reading, including nuances. While the structure of English is fairly simple in comparison to many other languages, its idioms make it a more difficult language to adequately master.;
, Those containing many parables, fables, short stories, and legends are good because they are easy to read and carry interesting messages as well. Reading such stories will give you a better understanding of the words, and you will improve your vocabulary through reading. Children's books with illustrations, such as illustrated dictionaries, are an excellent resource for those learning English as a second language.

, Every day, try to write down some of the key new words that you have mastered that day.


Go through this dictionary once a week so that you recall the meanings of these words and they permanently stick in your memory. Every time you go through this dictionary, visualize the meaning of those words. For example, for the word ""hallucination,"" try to imagine what the word actually means - you might try to picture someone having a nightmarish dream while awake perhaps. This visualization method will make you understand the subtle differences between similar words such as ""consent"" and ""permission,"" while also accepting that English has such a rich vocabulary that often you simply need to learn as many new words as possible that all carry similar or identical meanings!

, Use those words in your daily conversation with your friends and in your written communications. This will sensitize you to the new words.

, If you follow this method for the next few weeks, then using new words will become a habit.

, If you are shy of others, you will be only a victim. Therefore, you should never hesitate to take the initiative and engage people in conversation. Reading aloud will help provide you with the extra confidence that you can speak the words clearly,"

Understand the definition of factoring when applied to single numbers.,
Understand that variable expressions can also be factored.,
Apply the distributive property of multiplication to factor algebraic equations.",How to Factor Algebraic Equations1," Factoring is conceptually simple, but, in practice, can prove to be challenging when applied to complex equations. Because of this, it's easiest to approach the concept of factoring by starting with simple numbers, then move on to simple equations before finally proceeding to more advanced applications. A given number's factors are the numbers that multiply to give that number. For example, the factors of 12 are 1, 12, 2, 6, 3 and 4, because 1 × 12, 2 × 6, and 3 × 4 all equal 12.


Another way to think of this is that a given number's factors are the numbers by which it is evenly divisible.
Can you find all the factors of the number 60? We use the number 60 for a wide variety of purposes (minutes in an hour, seconds in a minute, etc.) because it's evenly divisible by a fairly wide range of numbers.

The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

;
, Just as lone numbers can be factored, so too can variables with numeric coefficients be factored. To do this, simply find the factors of the variable's coefficient. Knowing how to factor variables is useful for simplifying algebraic equations that the variables are a part of.


For example, the variable 12x can be written as a product of the factors of 12 and x. We can write 12x as 3(4x), 2(6x), etc., using whichever factors of 12 are best for our purposes.

We can even go as far as to factor 12x multiple times. In other words, we don't have to stop with 3(4x) or 2(6x) - we can factor 4x and 6x to give 3(2(2x) and 2(3(2x), respectively. Obviously, these two expressions are equal.



, Using your knowledge of how to factor both lone numbers and variables with coefficients, you can simplify simple algebraic equations by finding factors that the numbers and variables in an algebraic equation have in common. Usually, to make the equation as simple as possible, we try to search for the greatest common factor. This simplification process is possible because of the distributive property of multiplication, which states that for any numbers a, b, and c, a(b + c) = ab + ac.


Let's try an example problem. To factor the algebraic equation 12 x + 6, first, let's try to find the greatest common factor of 12x and 6. 6 is the biggest number that divides evenly into both 12x and 6, so we can simplify the equation to 6(2x + 1).
This process also applies to equations with negatives and fractions. x/2 + 4, for instance, can be simplified to 1/2(x + 8), and -7x + -21 can be factored to -7(x + 3).

"
"
Ensure the equation is in quadratic form (ax2 + bx + c = 0).,
In quadratic equations where a = 1, factor to (x+d )(x+e), where d × e = c and d + e = b.,
If possible, factor by inspection.,
Solve by completing the square.,
Use factors to solve quadratic equations.,
Check your answers - some of them may be extraneous!",How to Factor Algebraic Equations2," Quadratic equations are of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are numeric constants and a does not equal 0 (note that a can equal 1 or -1). If you have an equation containing one variable (x) that has one or more terms of x to the second power, you can usually shift the terms in the equation around using basic algebraic operations to get 0 on one side of equals sign and ax2, etc. on the other side.


For example, let's consider the algebraic equation. 5x2 + 7x - 9 = 4x2 + x - 18 can be simplified to x2 + 6x + 9 = 0, which is in the quadratic form.
Equations with greater powers of x, like x3, x4, etc. can't be quadratic equations. They are cubic equations, quadratic equations, and so on, unless the equation can be simplified to eliminate these terms of x above the power of 2.

, If your quadratic equation it is in the form x2 + bx + c = 0 (in other words, if the coefficient of the x2 term = 1), it's possible (but not guaranteed) that a relatively simple shortcut can be used to factor the equation. Find two numbers that both multiply to make c and add to make b. Once you find these two numbers d and e, place them in the following expression: (x+d)(x+e). These two terms, when multiplied together, produce your quadratic equation - in other words, they are your quadratic equation's factors.


For example, let's consider the quadratic equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0. 3 and 2 multiply together to make 6 and also add up to make 5, so we can simplify this equation to (x + 3)(x + 2).
Slight variations on this basic shortcut exist for slight variations in the equation itself:

If the quadratic equation is in the form x2-bx+c, your answer is in this form: (x - _)(x - _).
If it is in the form x2+bx+c, your answer looks like this: (x + _)(x + _).
If it is in the form x2-bx-c, you answer is in the form (x + _)(x - _).


Note: the numbers in the blanks can be fractions or decimals. For example, the equation x2 + (21/2)x + 5 = 0 factors to (x + 10)(x + 1/2).

, Believe it or not, for uncomplicated quadratic equations, one of the accepted means of factoring is simply to examine the problem, then just consider possible answers until you find the right one. This is also known as factoring by inspection. If the equation is in the form ax2+bx+c and a>1, your factored answer will be in the form (dx +/- _)(ex +/- _), where d and e are nonzero numerical constants that multiply to make a. Either d or e (or both) can be the number 1, though this is not necessarily so. If both are 1, you've essentially used the shortcut described above.


Let's consider an example problem. 3x2 - 8x + 4 at first seems intimidating. However, once we realize that 3 only has two factors (3 and 1), it becomes easier, because we know that our answer must be in the form (3x +/- _)(x +/- _). In this case, adding a -2 to both blank spaces gives the correct answer. -2 × 3x = -6x and -2 × x = -2x. -6x and -2x add to -8x. -2 × -2 = 4, so we can see that the factored terms in parentheses multiply to become the original equation.

, In some cases, quadratic equations can be quickly and easily factored by using a special algebraic identity. Any quadratic equation of the form x2 + 2xh + h2 = (x + h)2. So, if, in your equation, your b value is twice the square root of your c value, your equation can be factored to (x + (sqrt(c)))2.


For example, the equation x2 + 6x + 9 fits this form. 32 is 9 and 3 × 2 is 6. So, we know that the factored form of this equation is (x + 3)(x + 3), or (x + 3)2.

, Regardless of how you factor your quadratic expression, once it is factored, you can find possible answers for the value of x by setting each factor equal to zero and solving. Since you're looking for values of x that cause your equation to equal zero, a value of x that makes either of your factors equal zero is a possible answer for your quadratic equation.


Let's return to the equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0. This equation factored to (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0. If either of the factors equals 0, the entire equation equals 0, so our possible answers for x are the numbers that make (x + 3) and (x + 2) equal 0. These numbers are -3 and -2, respectively.

, When you've found your possible answers for x, plug them back in to your original equation to see if they are valid. Sometimes, the answers you find don't cause the original equation to equal zero when plugged back in. We call these answers extraneous and disregard them.


Let's plug -2 and -3 into x2 + 5x + 6 = 0. First, -2:

(-2)2 + 5(-2) + 6 = 0
4 + -10 + 6 = 0
0 = 0. This is correct, so -2 is a valid answer.


Now, let's try -3:

(-3)2 + 5(-3) + 6 = 0
9 + -15 + 6 = 0
0 = 0. This is also correct, so -3 is also a valid answer.

If the equation is in the form a2-b2, factor it to (a+b)(a-b).,
If the equation is in the form a2+2ab+b2, factor it to (a+b)2.,
If the equation is in the form a3-b3, factor it to (a-b)(a2+ab+b2).",How to Factor Algebraic Equations3," Equations with two variables factor differently than basic quadratics. For any equation a2-b2 where a and b do not equal 0, the equation factors to (a+b)(a-b).


For example, the equation 9x2 - 4y2 = (3x + 2y)(3x - 2y).

, Note that, If the trinomial is in the form a2-2ab+b2, the factored form is slightly different: (a-b)2.


The equation 4x2 + 8xy + 4y2 can be re-written as 4x2 + (2 × 2 × 2)xy + 4y2. We can now see that it's in the correct form, so we can say with confidence that our equation factors to (2x + 2y)2


, Finally, it bears mentioning that cubics and even higher-order equations can be factored, though the factoring process quickly becomes prohibitively complicated.


For instance, 8x3 - 27y3 factors to (2x - 3y)(4x2 + ((2x)(3y)) + 9y2)

",How to Factor by Grouping1," If you plan to use this method, the equation should follow a basic format of: ax2 + bx + c


This process is usually used when the leading coefficient (the a term) is a number other than ""1,"" but it can also be used for quadratic equations in which a = 1.

Example: 2x2 + 9x + 10;
, Multiply the a term and c term together. The product of these two terms is referred to as the master product.



Example: 2x2 + 9x + 10

a = 2; c = 10
a * c = 2 * 10 = 20



, List the factors of your master product, separating them into their natural pairs (the pairs required to produced the master product).



Example: The factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20

Written in factor pairs: (1, 20), (2, 10), (4, 5)



, Look through the factor pairs and determine which set will produce the b term—the middle term and the coefficient of x—when added together.


If your master product was negative, you will need to find a pair of factors that equal the b term when subtracted from one another.

Example: 2x2 + 9x + 10

b = 9
1 + 20 = 21; this is not the correct pair
2 + 10 = 12; this is not the correct pair
4 + 5 = 9; this is the correct pair



, Rewrite the center term, breaking it apart into the factor pair previously identified. Make sure that you include the proper signs (plus or minus).


Note that the order of the center terms should not matter for this problem. No matter which order you write the terms in, the end result should be the same.

Example: 2x2 + 9x + 10 = 2x2 + 5x + 4x + 10

, Group the first two terms into a pair and the second two terms into a pair.



Example: 2x2 + 5x + 4x + 10 = (2x2 + 5x) + (4x + 10)

, Find the common factors of the pair and factor them out. Rewrite the equation accordingly.



Example: x(2x + 5) + 2(2x + 5)

, There should be a shared binomial parentheses between the two halves. Factor this out, and place the other terms in another parentheses.



Example: (2x + 5)(x + 2)

, You should now have your final answer.



Example: 2x2 + 9x + 10 = (2x + 5)(x + 2)

The final answer is: (2x + 5)(x + 2)

Evaluate the following polynomial when x=4{\displaystyle x=4}: 7x2−12x+13{\displaystyle 7x^{2}-12x+13}.",How to Evaluate an Algebraic Expression," An algebraic expression is a set of numbers and letters combined by mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. The numbers in the expression are called constants or coefficients, depending on their function. The letters are called variables.2x{\displaystyle 2x} is an expression. In this expression, you are multiplying the coefficient 2{\displaystyle 2} by the variable x{\displaystyle x}.


2x+3y{\displaystyle 2x+3y} is an expression called a binomial. In this expression, you add the product of 3y{\displaystyle 3y} to the product of 2x{\displaystyle 2x}. In this expression, 2{\displaystyle 2} and 3{\displaystyle 3} are coefficients, and x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} are variables.

Once you add an equal sign to an expression, it becomes an equation. For example, 2x=14{\displaystyle 2x=14} is an equation.
;
, A variable is a symbol, usually a letter, that stands for an unknown value.In algebra, you are usually trying to find the value of the variable. In order to evaluate an algebraic expression, however, you need to be given the variable’s value.
, Evaluate means to simplify an expression. When you are asked to evaluate an algebraic expression, you need to plug a given value for the variable into the expression and solve.For example, you might be asked to evaluate 2x{\displaystyle 2x} when x=2{\displaystyle x=2}.


, This information should be given to you. Usually you will be told to evaluate the expression “when” or “where” the variable is equal to a certain value. If you are not given the variable’s value, you cannot evaluate the expression.

For example, you might be asked to evaluate the expression 5x−10{\displaystyle 5x-10} when x=8{\displaystyle x=8}.


, To do this, plug the given value into the expression wherever you see the variable. If the variable has a coefficient (a number you need to multiply its value by), make sure to put the value in parentheses.

For example, to evaluate 5x−10{\displaystyle 5x-10} when x=8{\displaystyle x=8}, replace the x{\displaystyle x} in the equation with 8{\displaystyle 8}: 5(8)−10{\displaystyle 5(8)-10}.


, Remember to follow the  order of operations when solving an expression. When you complete your calculations rewrite the expression as an equation.

For example:5(8)−10{\displaystyle 5(8)-10}=40−10{\displaystyle =40-10}=30{\displaystyle =30}So, 5(8)−10=30{\displaystyle 5(8)-10=30}.


, To do this, follow the same steps as you do for evaluating an expression with one variable, except plug in the values for both variables into the equation. These values should be given.

Make sure you do not switch the values. The x{\displaystyle x} value cannot be substituted for the y{\displaystyle y} variable and vice versa. Doing so will give you an incorrect solution.


,

Identify the variable and its value. The variable is x{\displaystyle x}, and you are evaluating the expression for x=3{\displaystyle x=3}.

Substitute the given value for the variable: 2(3)+3{\displaystyle 2(3)+3}.

Make the necessary calculations: 2(3)+3=6+3=9{\displaystyle 2(3)+3=6+3=9}.

Write the equation: 2(3)+3=9{\displaystyle 2(3)+3=9}


,

Identify both variables and their values. The variables are x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y}, and you are evaluating the expression for x=2{\displaystyle x=2} and y=6{\displaystyle y=6}.

Substitute both given values for the variables: 4(2)+3(6){\displaystyle 4(2)+3(6)}.

Make the necessary calculations: 4(2)+3(6)=8+18=26{\displaystyle 4(2)+3(6)=8+18=26}.

Write the equation: 4(2)+3(6)=26{\displaystyle 4(2)+3(6)=26}.


,

Identify the variable and its value. The variable is x{\displaystyle x}, and you are evaluating the expression for x=4{\displaystyle x=4}.

Substitute the given value for the variable: 7(4)2−12(4)+13{\displaystyle 7(4)^{2}-12(4)+13}.

Make the necessary calculations. Remember when working with exponents that you should calculate the exponent before multiplying by a coefficient:7(4)2−12(4)+13{\displaystyle 7(4)^{2}-12(4)+13}=7(16)−12(4)+13{\displaystyle =7(16)-12(4)+13}=112−48+13{\displaystyle =112-48+13}=64+13{\displaystyle =64+13}=77{\displaystyle =77}

Write the equation: 7(16)−12(4)+13=77{\displaystyle 7(16)-12(4)+13=77}

Maybe you don't need algebra, or maybe you need to take a different math class to prepare you for algebra. Usually, a placement test is free and comes with an appointment with the academic counselor; they will be able to tell you about your specific situation.;
, When registering for a college course, you can choose your own professor. Ask around and find out about the different professors. Choose a section taught by a quality professor that you think would fit with your learning style.


Choose a section that also fits with your schedule allowing you to attend every class.
Use websites that have reviews from students have taken the course with that professor to find out who would be a good fit for you.

, Many community colleges have testing centers that allow you to schedule your exams to be taken outside of the classroom. This can allow for flexibility in case you need a few more days of study. You also may be given more time to finish the exam than you would during a normally scheduled class period.


Speak with your professor at the beginning of the course about scheduling exams outside the classroom.

, If this course is essential to you continuing on to the next course, make it the highest priority when you’re choosing your schedule. If you are a morning person, choose a section that meets in the morning when you are awake and ready to learn. If the best section fills up before you can schedule it, try speaking directly to the professor and explaining why it’s important for you to attend class at that particular time.


Many people tend to lose focus after lunch time so if you’re not a morning person choose a section between 10am and 12pm or after 3pm.

, If you have the opportunity to do so, taking the class on its own allows you to spend all of your time and energy on truly understanding algebra. Not having to split your attention between multiple courses lets you focus specifically on the task at hand.


If you really want to succeed at a four-year college, take college algebra at a community college the summer before to gain a solid foundation in math.

, Homework, quizzes, and exams will likely have different point values associated with them. Knowing what percentage each contributes to your grade can help you further in the course if you are struggling. Avoid falling behind because you didn’t put in the time to do the homework properly!


Determine how much time you will need to spend each week to really master the course. Make sure to set aside this time by scheduling it into your day.

, Pre-algebra includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. These concepts are essential for understanding the more complicated algebraic concepts.


Find online tutorials that have quizzes associated with them to ensure your mastery of this material.

, Give yourself a head start on the material by looking through the book before the course begins. If you have time, work through some of the concepts and identify the ones that are particularly difficult for you.


By getting ahead in your College Algebra (or any other math) studies you will have already worked through some problems and you will have intelligent questions to ask your teacher about the material.
If your bookstore stocks them, buy a copy of the student solution manual. This will make your homework sessions much easier.

, Your professor didn’t spend all of that time putting together a syllabus for no reason. The syllabus is a roadmap to the entire course, telling you what material will be covered each class, when homework is due, and when quizzes and exams will be.


Write down all class times, study sessions, quizzes, exams, and project due dates in your planner. This helps you keep track of when everything is due and helps you make academics a priority. Pay special attention to exam study sessions and exams that fall outside of your normal schedule and/or class location.
Make sure you have enough time to take algebra. A good rule of thumb is to schedule two hours of homework and studying for every hour of class. If you do not have enough time to take this class due to other commitments in your life, either make time for this class or wait until you do have the time.

, Refer back to your syllabus to see what part of the textbook will be covered during your next class. Read that section and work some of the problems to check your understanding. Take some notes during your reading to refer back to while studying for quizzes and exams.Come to class prepared to ask questions about the parts that you didn’t understand.

, If you don't go to class, it's much harder to learn on your own. Math is a cumulative subject, so if you don't know the foundation, it's difficult to grasp later concepts.Just going to class is not enough, you also need to actively pay attention.
Pay special attention during demonstrations. Some algebra concepts are best when demonstrated. It is hard to use words to describe how a circle, an ellipse, a parabola and a hyperbola can come from the same cone, but when the professor takes out a model and shows you how to ""cut"" the cone, conic sections are much easier to understand.

, Write down or draw everything your professor presents on the board as well as any verbal hints they give. Write or draw everything the exact same way the professor writes or draws it on the board. This will help you study your notes later. If the professor asks a question in class, think about it and answer it if you know it.


Ask questions if you are confused. It is likely that other students have the same question you do.
Review your notes frequently to solidify your comprehension of the material. If there is something you can’t quite grasp, ask your professor for help.

, Do all of the homework, even if it is not collected or graded. Homework is practice for exams. When you do your homework, you study for the test at the same time. Just reading your notes may be enough for other courses, but it is not enough to help you pass algebra.Check the homework when you are done. If you have the student solutions manual, you can see how to do each problem step by step. If you do not have a student solutions manual, your book will have the answers at the back of the book. Make sure you get the problems right before moving on to the next section.
Ask questions on the homework. Write a list of problems that you had while doing the homework and take it to the next class. Make sure you give the questions a good try first; you may be able to solve them yourself.

, Your math professor may show your class how to use a specific calculator or computer program. Learn the program or instrument inside out. If you have been out of school for even a few years since your last math class, make sure you know how to use the most recent calculators or programs. Find an online tutorial for more practice.

, Understanding how to represent functions of a graph is key to understanding algebra. With graph paper, you can learn important graphing and visualization skills. These skills will help you in algebra and any higher math class.

, Office hours are time set aside specifically by your professor to help you if you have questions. Take advantage of this one-on-one time if there is a concept you are really struggling with. Try to figure out exactly what it is you don’t understand instead of just walking in and saying, “I don’t get it”.Alternatively, you can use the math lab if your school has one. Visit it to find help when you need it. If you are afraid of asking the staff members in the lab, ask the student workers (if they are available); almost every student math lab worker has taken algebra. Try to come in during times of less traffic so that you don't have to wait for help.

, Many community colleges and universities have a certain number of free tutoring hours offered to students. Find a time that works best for you and attend a session. If you’re struggling with a particular topic, focus on that until it makes sense.


Find out about your college’s policy at the beginning of the year. You may lose the tutoring privileges if you don’t use them in the first semester.

, If you have the time and the capacity, a study group is a great way to stay on top of the material. Study groups are also good for working through homework and complex concepts. Someone in your group may understand something really well and be able to explain it to you in a way that clarifies the concept for you.Set up a weekly or every other week meeting time.

, A short one-on-one tutoring session can be more beneficial to you than hours of group work in class because it allows you to focus specifically on what doesn’t make sense. Although it may seem expensive, it is usually cheaper to pay for tutoring than to pay for retaking the course later.


Find a tutor that fits and understands your learning style. If you start with one tutor and it isn’t working for you, don’t hesitate to find another one.

, Using a test from a previous year is a great way to get more practice for the exam. It will give you an idea of the format of the exam and the difficulty of the questions. Work the test questions and then check your answers. What you got wrong is your lesson plan for concepts to work on.

, Not only do the quizzes and homework count for a grade, but they are also good practice for the final exam. When you get a quiz or homework back, check to see what you did wrong. Do the problems again for practice and make sure you don't make the same mistakes again.A good quiz average may also help you pass if your test grades are on the pass/fail fence. You’ll be less likely to make the same mistake a second time if you’ve reworked the problems.

, Before an exam, most professors will put together a review assignment that covers all of the topics that you will see on the test. Completing the review will give you an idea of the topics you really understand and the ones you might need to study a little more before exam day.


Use all the resources you have available to you to finish the review and study. Refer to your notes, textbook, previous homework assignments, and online help if necessary.

, If you don’t show the work of how you arrived at an answer, you are at risk of getting the whole question wrong even if you just added the last two numbers at the end incorrectly.


Showing your work lets the professor know that you understand the concept, you may have just made a small arithmetic error.

, If you come across a problem that you are unsure of, skip it and move on. You can always go back to those problems at the end of the test and focus on them once you’ve answered everything else. Don’t forget that you can also ask questions during the exam. Your professor may not be able to answer it, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

, If you have stayed on a consistent study schedule, you won’t need to cram because you will have been reviewing everything all along. Make sure you aren’t hungry during the test, either.

Dividing a matrix by another matrix is an undefined function.The closest equivalent is multiplying by the inverse of another matrix. In other words, while ÷ is undefined, you can solve the problem * -1. Since these two equations would be equivalent for scalar quantities, this ""feels"" like matrix division, but it's important to use the correct terminology.

Note that * -1 and -1 * are not the same problem. You may need to solve both to find all possible solutions.

For example, instead of (13263913)÷(7423){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\39&13\end{pmatrix}}\div {\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}}}, write (13263913)∗(7423)−1{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\39&13\end{pmatrix}}*{\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}}^{-1}}.You may also need to calculate (7423)−1∗(13263913){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}}^{-1}*{\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\39&13\end{pmatrix}}}, which may have a different answer.
;
, To take the inverse of a matrix, it must be a square matrix, with the same number of rows and columns. If the matrix you're planning to inverse is non-square, there is no unique solution to the problem.The term ""divisor matrix"" is a little loose, since this is not technically a division problem. For * -1, this refers to matrix . In our example problem, this is (7423){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}}}.

A matrix that has an inverse is called ""invertible"" or ""non-singular."" Matrices without an inverse are ""singular.""


, To multiply two matrices together, the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix.If this does not work in either arrangement (* -1 or -1 * ), there is no solution to the problem.

For example, if is a 4 x 3 matrix and is a 2 x 2 matrix, there is no solution. * -1 does not work since 4 ≠ 2, and -1 * does not work since 2 ≠ 3.

Note that the inverse -1 always has the same number of rows and columns as the original matrix . There's no need to calculate the inverse to complete this step.

In our example problem, both matrices are 2 x 2s, so they can be multiplied in either order.


, There's one more requirement to check before you can take the inverse of a matrix. The determinant of the matrix must be nonzero. If the determinant is zero, the matrix does not have an inverse. Here's how to find the determinant in the simplest case, the 2 x 2 matrix:


2 x 2 matrix: The determinant of the matrix (abcd){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}} is ad - bc.In other words, take the product of the main diagonal (top left to bottom right), then subtract the product of the anti-diagonal (top right to bottom left).

For example, the matrix (7423){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}}} has the determinant (7)(3) - (4)(2) = 21 - 8 = 13. This is nonzero, so it is possible to find the inverse.


, If your matrix is 3 x 3 or larger, finding the determinant takes a bit more work:


3 x 3 matrix: Choose any element and cross out the row and column it belongs to. Find the determinant of the remaining 2 x 2 matrix, multiply by the chosen element, and refer to a matrix sign chart to determine the sign. Repeat this for the other two elements in the same row or column as the first one you chose, then sum all three determinants. Read this article for step-by-step instructions and tips to speed this up.


Larger matrices: Using a graphing calculator or software is recommended. The method is similar to the 3 x 3 matrix method, but is tedious by hand.For example, to find the determinant of a 4 x 4 matrix, you need to find the determinants of four 3 x 3 matrices.


, If your matrix is not square, or if its determinant is zero, write ""no unique solution."" The problem is complete. If the matrix is square and its determinant is non-zero, continue to the next section for the next step: finding the inverse.
, If your matrix is 2 x 2, you can use a shortcut to make this calculation much easier.The first step in this shortcut involves switching the top left element with the bottom right element. For example:


(7423){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}}} → (3427){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}3&4\\2&7\end{pmatrix}}}


Note: Most people use calculators to find the inverse of a 3 x 3 matrix or larger. If you'd like to calculate it by hand, refer to the end of this section.


, In other words, multiply the top right and bottom left elements by -1:


(3427){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}3&4\\2&7\end{pmatrix}}} → (3−4−27){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}3&-4\\-2&7\end{pmatrix}}}


, You found the determinant of this matrix in the section above, so there's no need to calculate it a second time. Just write down the reciprocal 1 / (determinant):

In our example, the determinant is 13. The reciprocal of this is 113{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{13}}}.


, Multiply each element of the new matrix by the reciprocal you just found. The resulting matrix is the inverse of the 2 x 2 matrix:


113∗(3−4−27){\displaystyle {\frac {1}{13}}*{\begin{pmatrix}3&-4\\-2&7\end{pmatrix}}}=(313−413−213713){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}{\frac {3}{13}}&{\frac {-4}{13}}\\{\frac {-2}{13}}&{\frac {7}{13}}\end{pmatrix}}}


, To check your work, multiply the inverse by the original matrix. If the inverse is correct, their product will always be the identity matrix, (1001){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}}} If the math checks out, continue on to the next section to complete your problem.

For the example problem, multiply (313−413−213713)∗(7423)=(1001){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}{\frac {3}{13}}&{\frac {-4}{13}}\\{\frac {-2}{13}}&{\frac {7}{13}}\end{pmatrix}}*{\begin{pmatrix}7&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}}}.


Here's a refresher on how to multiply matrices.

Note: Matrix multiplication is not commutative: the order of the factors matters. However, when multiplying a matrix by its inverse, both options will result in the identity matrix., Unless you are learning this process for the first time, save yourself time by using a graphing calculator or math software for larger matrices. If you do need to calculate it by hand, here's a quick summary of one method:Adjoin the identity matrix I to the right side of your matrix. For example, → . The identity matrix has ""1"" elements along the main diagonal, and ""0"" elements in all other positions.

Perform row operations to reduce the matrix until the left side is in row-echelon form, then continue reducing until the left side is the identity matrix.

Once the operation is complete, your matrix will be in the form . In other words, the right side will be the inverse of the original matrix.


, In ""ordinary math"" with scalar quantities, multiplication is commutative; 2 x 6 = 6 x 2. This is not true for matrices, so you may need to solve two problems:

* -1 is the solution x for the problem x= .

-1 * is the solution x for the problem x = .

If this is part of an equation, make sure you are performing the same operation on both sides. If = , then -1does not equal -1, because the -1 is on the left side of but the right side of ., The dimensions of the final matrix are the outer dimensions of the two factors. It has the same number of rows as the first matrix, and the same number of columns as the second matrix.

Returning to our original example, both (13263913){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\39&13\end{pmatrix}}} and (313−413−213713){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}{\frac {3}{13}}&{\frac {-4}{13}}\\{\frac {-2}{13}}&{\frac {7}{13}}\end{pmatrix}}} are 2 x 2 matrices so the dimensions of the answer are also 2 x 2.

To take a more complicated example, if is a 4 x 3 matrix and -1 is a 3 x 3 matrix, then the matrix * -1 has dimensions 4 x 3.


, Refer to the linked article for full instructions, or refresh your memory with this summary:

To find row 1, column 1 of -1, find the dot product of row 1 and -1 column 1. That is, for a 2 x 2 matrix, calculate a1,1∗b1,1+a1,2∗b2,1{\displaystyle a_{1,1}*b_{1,1}+a_{1,2}*b_{2,1}}.

In our example (13263913)∗(313−413−213713){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\39&13\end{pmatrix}}*{\begin{pmatrix}{\frac {3}{13}}&{\frac {-4}{13}}\\{\frac {-2}{13}}&{\frac {7}{13}}\end{pmatrix}}}, row 1 column 1 of our answer is:(13∗313)+(26∗−213){\displaystyle (13*{\frac {3}{13}})+(26*{\frac {-2}{13}})}=3+−4{\displaystyle =3+-4}=−1{\displaystyle =-1}


, For example, the element at position 2,1 is the dot product of row 2 and -1 column 1. Try to complete the example on your own. You should get the following answers:


(13263913)∗(313−413−213713)=(−1107−5){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\39&13\end{pmatrix}}*{\begin{pmatrix}{\frac {3}{13}}&{\frac {-4}{13}}\\{\frac {-2}{13}}&{\frac {7}{13}}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}-1&10\\7&-5\end{pmatrix}}}

If you need to find the other solution, (313−413−213713)∗(13263913)=(−92193){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}{\frac {3}{13}}&{\frac {-4}{13}}\\{\frac {-2}{13}}&{\frac {7}{13}}\end{pmatrix}}*{\begin{pmatrix}13&26\\39&13\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}-9&2\\19&3\end{pmatrix}}}

, The constant in the divisor, x + 2, is positive 2, so reversing the sign of the constant would give you -2.

, The upside-down division symbol will look a bit like a backwards ""L."" Place the term -2 to the left of this symbol.

, Write the terms from left to right, just as they appear. It should look like this: -2| 1 2 -4 8.

, Bring down the first coefficient, 1, below itself. It should look like this:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
    ↓
    1

, Simply multiply 1 by -2 to get -2 and write this product under the second term, 2. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2
    1

, Now take the second coefficient, 2, and add it to -2. The result is 0. Write this result below the two numbers, just as you would in long division. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2
    1   0

, Now, take the sum, 0, and multiply it by the divisor, -2. The result is 0. Place this number below 4, the third coefficient. It should look like this:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2  0 
    1   

, Add 0 and -4 to get -4 and write this answer below the 0. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2   0 
    1   0   -4

, Now, multiply -4 by -2 to get 8, write this answer under the fourth coefficient, 8, and add this answer to the fourth coefficient. 8 + 8 = 16, so this is your remainder. Write this number below the product. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2   0   8
    1   0   -4   |16


, In this case, the first sum, 1, is placed next to an x to the second power (one less than three). The second sum, 0, is placed next to an x, but the result is zero, so you can remove this term. And the third coefficient, -4, becomes a constant, a number without a variable, since the original variable was x. You can write an R next to the 16, because that is the remainder. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2   0   8
    1   0   -4   |16
    x2   + 0x    - 4    R 16x2 - 4 R16

, The final answer is the new polynomial, x2 - 4, plus the remainder, 16, over the original divisor, x + 2. Here's how it would look: x2 - 4 +16/(x +2).

",How to Factor by Grouping2," The equation should have four separate terms. The exact appearance of those four terms can vary, however.


Usually, you will use this method when you see a polynomial equation that looks like: ax3 + bx2 + cx + d

The equation may also look like:

axy + by + cx + d
ax2 + bx + cxy + dy
ax4 + bx3 + cx2 + dx
Or similar variations.



Example: 4x4 + 12x3 + 6x2 + 18x

, Determine if all four terms have anything in common. The greatest common factor among the four terms, if any common factors exist, should be factored out of the equation.


If the only thing all four terms has in common is the number ""1,"" there is no GCF and nothing can be factored out at this point.
When you do factor out a GCF, make sure that you continue to keep it at the front of your equation as you work. This factored out GCF must be included as part of your final answer for that answer to be accurate.

Example: 4x4 + 12x3 + 6x2 + 18x

Each term has 2x in common, so the problem can be rewritten as:
2x(2x3 + 6x2 + 3x + 9)



, Group the first two terms together and the second two terms together.


If the first term of the second group has a minus sign in front of it, you will need to put a minus sign in front of the second parentheses. You will need to change the sign of the second term in that grouping to reflect that choice.

Example: 2x(2x3 + 6x2 + 3x + 9) = 2x, Identify the GCF in each binomial pair and factor it to the outside of the pair. Rewrite the equation accordingly.


At this point, you might be faced with a choice between factoring out a positive number or a negative number for the second group. Look at the signs before the second and fourth terms.

When the two signs are the same (both positive or both negative), factor out a positive number.
When the two signs are different (one negative and one positive), factor out a negative number.



Example: 2x= 2x2, The binomial pair inside both parentheses should be the same. Factor this out of the equation, then group the remaining terms into another parentheses set.


If the binomials inside the current sets of parentheses do not match, double-check your work or try rearranging your terms and grouping the equation again.
The parentheses must match. If they do not match no matter what you try, the problem cannot be factored by grouping or by any other method.

Example: 2x2= 2x2, You should have the final answer at this point.



Example: 4x4 + 12x3 + 6x2 + 18x = 2x2(x + 3)(2x2 + 3)

The final answer is: 2x2(x + 3)(2x2 + 3)

Use worst comes worst or worse comes to worse.",How to Use Worse and Worst," Worse means ""of a lower quality; less attractive, pleasing, etc; more serious or severe.""Worse is a form of the word bad.;
, Worse is an example of a comparative adjective. Comparative adjectives are used to compare the characteristics of the objects they modify. They will be used with two nouns in a sentence, which include physical objects, concepts, places, and people.I think eggplant is worse than boiled cabbage, but that's just my opinion.
That red dress looks worse on you than the white one.
Which is worse for your health, smoking or drinking?

, Since worse is a comparative word, it is commonly used with the word than when comparing the two nouns. The sentences commonly following the following pattern:


Noun + verb + comparative adjective + than + noun.Winter weather is worse than summer weather.
One tricky use of worse is when two or more objects act as a group noun.
The car is worse than the other two you showed me.In this example, the two things being compared are car and the other two, which functions as one object. There are still two things being compared.

, Although this situation commonly only lists one thing, technically speaking, you are still comparing two things - one state of being to another. Often, one of these states is implied instead of mentioned outright.


This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
I think my handwriting is worse .
I am feeling worse , In some sentences, the than is implied. That means there won't be two things being compared in the sentence; the second thing will be implied.


Bob and Fred are bad drivers, but I think Bob is worse .

, Worst means ""worse than all the others; least helpful or skillful; most unfavorable or corrupt.""Worst is a form of the word bad.

, Worst is a superlative adjective. A superlative adjective is one which is used to denote the extreme highest or lowest out of a group of nouns.This is used when comparing three or more things.


Unlike worse, you can’t use worst when only comparing two things.
Dirty diapers smell worse than rotten milk, but week-old fish is the worst of all.
Math is the worst of all my classes.

, Worse and worst correspond to words like colder and coldest.


Use worse whenever you would use a -er word. The -er is the comparative.
The weather in Boston is colder than it is in Miami. / The weather in Boston is worse than it is in Miami.
Use worst whenever you would use a -est word. The -est is the superlative.
Washington state has the wettest weather in the US. / Washington state has the worst rain in the US.
The growing intensity scale of the word is: bad - worse - worst. Worst is the most bad and worse is more bad than bad.
The weather in November is bad, but it's worse in December. The worst weather all winter is in January.

, Since worst is used to single out one inferior thing, it always comes after the word the.


I disagree. Eggplant and boiled cabbage are both vile, but squash is the worst!
That is the worst cake I have ever tasted.

, Use worst to compare something to other things that are implied but not mentioned outright.


Chartreuse is the worst color .
He’s the worst person imaginable .

, The phrase worst case scenario points to the extreme negative outcome of a situation. Because it is using an extreme, use worst.


The reason people say worse case scenario is due to speaking patterns. In many common words, the -t is dropped; therefore, you hear worse case when the person actually means worst case., According to modern usage, it is okay to say ""if worst comes to worst,"" ""if worse comes to worse,"" or ""if worse comes to worst.""The idiom was first seen in 1596 as if the worst come to the worst. This meant that the worst case scenario happened. In 1719, Daniel Defoe wrote in Robinson Crusoe, ""if the worse came to the worst."" This new use of the idiom meant that things are getting worse."

PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. Whenever you are solving a problem, start with the expressions in parentheses and work your way through the acronym, finishing with subtraction.For parentheses, perform all of the operations inside the parentheses using this same order.

Multiplication and division are considered equal operations. You can solve them at the same time, so simply solve from left to right. 

Addition and subtraction are also equal operations, so solve from left to right.

You can remember PEMDAS using the mnemonic, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. 
;
, For any problem you solve in algebra, you will always solve it using this order. Many times, a problem has parentheses to denote all of the operations you will perform first. Multiplication and division rank equally, so simply solve either of these operations from left to right. The same goes for addition and subtraction.For example, to solve the equation (3+6)×7−42{\displaystyle (3+6)\times 7-{\frac {4}{2}}}:

First solve the expression in parentheses:(3+6=9){\displaystyle (3+6=9)}9×7−42{\displaystyle 9\times 7-{\frac {4}{2}}}

Next, solve exponents. In this particular equation, there are no exponents, so you can move on to the next step.

 Next, multiply and divide left-to-right:63−42{\displaystyle 63-{\frac {4}{2}}}63−2{\displaystyle 63-2}

 Finally, add and subtract left to right:63−2=61{\displaystyle 63-2=61}




, The more problems you practice, the better you will be at solving them. Eventually, using this order of operations will become second nature and you won’t even think about it. Do as many problems as you need to feel confident in solving them.

 Example 1: 8+(6×42+7){\displaystyle 8+(6\times 4^{2}+7)}=8+(6×16+7){\displaystyle =8+(6\times 16+7)}=8+(96+7){\displaystyle =8+(96+7)}=8+103{\displaystyle =8+103}=111{\displaystyle =111} 

 Example 2: 302+52−(6×3){\displaystyle {\frac {30}{2}}+5^{2}-(6\times 3)}=302+52−18{\displaystyle ={\frac {30}{2}}+5^{2}-18}=302+25−18{\displaystyle ={\frac {30}{2}}+25-18}=15+25−18{\displaystyle =15+25-18}=40−18{\displaystyle =40-18}=22{\displaystyle =22}


, When starting to learn algebra, the material can get overwhelming very quickly. Don’t be afraid to ask your teacher for help or seek out extra tutoring. Even asking a friend who may have a better understanding can be useful.

 Ask your parents about getting a tutor if you are really struggling. 


, Like any puzzle, there are pieces. Learning how to recognize the numbers and symbols for the placeholders that they are makes the solution much easier to grasp.

 Try to find the missing number in a problem where the final answer is given. For example: 1+x=9{\displaystyle 1+x=9}.

 The missing number is 8, because 1 plus 8 equals 9. Pretty simple, right? This is basic algebra., When solving an algebraic problem, you must remember that if you alter one side of the equation in any way, you must do the exact same thing to the other side of the equation. If you add, subtract, multiply, or divide, you must perform the same operation to the opposite side.

 For example, to solve x+3=2x−1{\displaystyle x+3=2x-1}, you first need to subtract x{\displaystyle x} from both sides of the equation, then add 1 to both sides of the equation:


x+3−x=2x−1−x{\displaystyle x+3-x=2x-1-x}3=x−1{\displaystyle 3=x-1}3+1=x−1+1{\displaystyle 3+1=x-1+1}4=x{\displaystyle 4=x}




, When given an algebraic expression, you will notice that there are constants and variables. A constant is any number given, while a variable is a letter that represents an unknown number.To isolate the variable, add or subtract terms to get the variable on one side. If the variable has a coefficient, divide both sides by that coefficient to get the variable alone.

 For example, to solve 6y+6=48{\displaystyle 6y+6=48}, you first need to subtract 6 from both sides, then divide by 6:

 6y+6−6=48−6{\displaystyle 6y+6-6=48-6}6y=42{\displaystyle 6y=42}6y6=426{\displaystyle {\frac {6y}{6}}={\frac {42}{6}}}y=7{\displaystyle y=7}




, If you are solving for a variable that is squared, you will need to take the square root of it to solve the problem. Conversely, If the variable is a square root, then you will need to square it to solve the problem.Remember that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side.

 For example, to solve x=9{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}=9}, you need to square both sides of the equation:

 (x)2=92{\displaystyle ({\sqrt {x}})^{2}=9^{2}}x=81{\displaystyle x=81}



 To solve x2=16{\displaystyle x^{2}=16}, you need to take the square root of both sides of the equation:


x2=16{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x^{2}}}={\sqrt {16}}}x=4{\displaystyle x=4}




, Whenever you have terms that have the same variable, you can combine them to simplify the problem. This helps to keep equations manageable and easier to solve. Remember, terms that have different exponents are not identical terms: x{\displaystyle x} is not the same as x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}.The following are like terms: 4x,−3x,0.45x,−132x{\displaystyle 4x,-3x,0.45x,-132x}

 The following are not like terms: 5x,8y2,−13y,9z,12xy{\displaystyle 5x,8y^{2},-13y,9z,12xy}

 For example: 4x+3y−7x{\displaystyle 4x+3y-7x} has two like terms, 4x{\displaystyle 4x} and −7x{\displaystyle -7x}. To combine them, add:

 (−7x+4x)+3y{\displaystyle (-7x+4x)+3y} = −3x+3y{\displaystyle -3x+3y}




, The art of mastering any concept is practice. Try solving problems with increasing difficulty to truly check your comprehension. Use problems from your textbook or seek out extra problems online.

 For example, solve q+18=9q−6{\displaystyle q+18=9q-6}

 Add 6 to both sides: q+18+6=9q−6+6{\displaystyle q+18+6=9q-6+6}q+24=9q{\displaystyle q+24=9q}

 Subtract q{\displaystyle q} from both sides: q+24−q=9q−q{\displaystyle q+24-q=9q-q}24=8q{\displaystyle 24=8q}

 Divide both sides by 8: 248=8q8{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{8}}={\frac {8q}{8}}}3=q{\displaystyle 3=q}




, Make a habit of checking your answers when you have solved a problem. Once you have obtained the solution and discovered the value of the variable, check your work by inserting the number you have obtained into the original equation. If the expression is still true, then you have found the correct solution!

 For example, if you found that q=3{\displaystyle q=3}, to check your answer, substitute 3 for q{\displaystyle q} in the original equation: q+18=9q−6{\displaystyle q+18=9q-6}. 

 3+18=9(3)−6{\displaystyle 3+18=9(3)-6}21=27−6{\displaystyle 21=27-6}21=21{\displaystyle 21=21}

 Right! Since the equation is true, you know that your solution is correct. 




, The FOIL method stands for First, Outside, Inside, Last. It is a method used to multiply two binomials together. A binomial is an algebraic expression with two terms, like 5x−3{\displaystyle 5x-3}. For example, If you wanted to calculate (5x−3)(4x+1){\displaystyle (5x-3)(4x+1)}, you would have to use the FOIL method., The “F” in FOIL stands for “First.” The first terms are the terms on the left in each set of parentheses.Remember that when you multiply two of the same variables together, the result is the variable, squared.

 For example, in the problem (3x+5)(2x−4){\displaystyle (3x+5)(2x-4)}, 3x{\displaystyle 3x} and 2x{\displaystyle 2x} are the first terms of each binomial. So, you would calculate 3x×2x=6x2{\displaystyle 3x\times 2x=6x^{2}}.


, The “O” in FOIL stands for “Outside.” The outside term of the first binomial is on the left; the outside term of the second binomial is on the right.For example, in the problem (3x+5)(2x−4){\displaystyle (3x+5)(2x-4)}, 3x{\displaystyle 3x} and −4{\displaystyle -4} are the outside terms of each binomial. So, you would calculate 3x×−4=−12x{\displaystyle 3x\times -4=-12x}.


, The “I” in FOIL stands for “Inside.” The inside term of the first binomial is on the right; the inside term of the second binomial is on the left.For example, in the problem (3x+5)(2x−4){\displaystyle (3x+5)(2x-4)}, 5{\displaystyle 5} and 2x{\displaystyle 2x} are the inside terms of each binomial. So, you would calculate 5×2x=10x{\displaystyle 5\times 2x=10x}.


, The “L” in FOIL stands for “Last.” The last term of each binomial is on the right.For example, in the problem (3x+5)(2x−4){\displaystyle (3x+5)(2x-4)}, 5{\displaystyle 5} and −4{\displaystyle -4} are the last terms of each binomial. So, you would calculate 5×−4=−20{\displaystyle 5\times -4=-20}.


, After putting the expression together, you can combine like terms to simplify the expression fully. Make sure you pay close attention to positive and negative signs when adding like terms.For example, for (3x+5)(2x−4){\displaystyle (3x+5)(2x-4)} you calculated 6x2−12x+10x−20{\displaystyle 6x^{2}-12x+10x-20}, which, after combining like terms, simplifies to 6x2−2x−20{\displaystyle 6x^{2}-2x-20}


, When a number has an exponent that means you multiply that number by itself as many times as the exponent says. To simplify any number that has an exponent simply multiply it the appropriate number of times.For example: 43=4×4×4=64{\displaystyle 4^{3}=4\times 4\times 4=64}.

 If there is a negative sign and no parentheses, the exponent is simplified and then the negative sign gets added: −22=−(2×2)=−4.{\displaystyle -2^{2}=-(2\times 2)=-4.}If there is a negative sign, but the number is in parenthesis, the negative number is part of the exponent: (−2)2=−2×−2=4.{\displaystyle (-2)^{2}=-2\times -2=4.}, It may be confusing at first to see a variable with an exponent. Just remember, any variable with the same exponent number can be added or subtracted. If the letters are the same, but the exponents are different, they cannot be combined.

 For example, 6x2+5x2=11x2{\displaystyle 6x^{2}+5x^{2}=11x^{2}}.

 Similarly, 4xy3−8xy3=−4xy3{\displaystyle 4xy^{3}-8xy^{3}=-4xy^{3}}.

 On the other hand, 5z+5z2{\displaystyle 5z+5z^{2}} cannot be simplified, since one variable has an exponent, and one does not.


, If two variables are being multiplied together and they both have exponents, you can add the exponents together to get the resulting exponent. This only applies to variables of the same letter.For example, (x2)(x3)=x2+3=x5{\displaystyle (x^{2})(x^{3})=x^{2+3}=x^{5}}.


, If you want to divide two variables that have exponents, simply subtract the bottom exponent from the top exponent. This only applies to variables that are the same letter.For example, a6a3=a6−3=a3{\displaystyle {\frac {a^{6}}{a^{3}}}=a^{6-3}=a^{3}}.

Use ""affect"" as a verb meaning ""to influence"" or ""to cause a change."",
Use ""affect"" as a verb meaning ""to pretend"" or ""to put on airs."",
Use ""affect"" as a noun meaning ""mood"" or ""mental state.""",How to Use Affect and Effect1," Though ""affect"" has multiple meanings, its most common use is as a verb with a meaning similar to ""produce."" Typically, when people want to say that one thing has had an impact on another, they will use the verb ""affect.""To distinguish this meaning of the word ""affect"" from ""effect"", use the following mnemonic: ""When I affect something, I produce an effect'.'


Below are a few examples of the word ""affect"" being used in this way:

It's hard to say how the price of gasoline will affect the economy in the long run.
Growing up with three older sisters affected me greatly as a person.
When someone affects you strongly, you may develop affection for them. (Notice in this example that the root of affection is affect.)

;
, People also use the word ""affect"" when someone acts in a way that's different from how s/he normally acts. If someone assumes a new personality or look, s/he is ""affecting"" his or her new traits.Below are a few examples of the word ""affect"" being used in this way:

Richard affected an attitude of indifference, though he was deeply hurt by the comments.
In her role as lady Macbeth, Sally, normally jovial, was able to affect a cold sneer of cruelty.

Read the entire sentence.,
Identify words you do understand.,
Look for illustrative examples.,
Think logically.,
Use other context clues.",How to Understand a Word Without Using a Dictionary1," It can be very frustrating to have your reading interrupted by an unknown word. If you are in the middle of an exam or an assignment for school or work, it can also be very stressful. If you can't reach for a dictionary, take other steps to figure out what the word means.Your first step is to go back and re-read the entire sentence. You probably lost track of what your were reading when you stumbled upon the new word.
Think about the content of the sentence. Do you understand the sentence without using the new word? Or is it incomprehensible?
Try underlining the unknown word. This will help you separate it from the rest of the sentence.;
, You can often use other words in the sentence to help you define the unknown word. Think about what else is happening in the sentence. Hopefully, this will help you figure out whether the unknown word is a noun, verb, or adjective.For example, maybe you are looking at a sentence that says, ""It was a very sultry day in the middle of the summer."" You probably understand each word except for ""sultry"".
Think about what you know about the summer. It is likely that ""sultry"" has something to do with weather.
Maybe your biology exam has this sentence, ""Many members of the canine family are predators, looking for other animals to eat."" You can surmise that ""predators"" prey on other animals.

, Once you have examined the other words in that sentence, you can move on. Start looking at the sentences that follow the unknown word. An author will often give descriptions that can help you figure out the meaning of an unknown word.For example, take the sentence, ""It was a very sultry day in the middle of summer."" It could be followed by the sentence, ""The heat and humidity made it appealing to sit in the shade and drink lemonade.""
You can now more confidently define ""sultry"". The descriptive words such as ""heat"" and ""humidity"" are further clues that it is a description of the weather.
Sometimes, the descriptive examples will be right in the original sentence. For example, it could say, ""Sultry days are so damp and hot.""

, Sometimes, the context clues will not be as clear. You will have to use logic to figure out the word. You can also use experience, or prior knowledge, of the topic.For example, maybe a sentence says, ""In the antebellum South, many plantation owners kept slaves."" It is likely that ""antebellum"" is the unknown word.
The sentence itself does not offer many clues. However, the following sentences are, ""But after the Civil War, slavery was outlawed. This was a major change between the two periods.""
Think about what you know now. You are reading information about two different time periods, right? Before the Civil War and after the Civil War.
You can now make a pretty logical assumption about the word ""antebellum"". Based on your experience and reading the following sentences, you know it probably means ""before the war"".

, Sometimes an author will offer other types of clues. Look for restatement. This is where the meaning of the word is restated in other words.Here is an example of ""restatement"": ""The pig squealed in pain. The high-pitched cry was very loud.""
You can also look for ""appositives"". This is where an author highlights a specific word by placing a further description between two commas.
This is an example of the use of an appositive: ""The Taj Mahal, which is a massive white marble mausoleum, is one of the most famous landmarks in India.
You may not know the words ""Taj Mahal"", but the use of appositives makes it clear that it is a landmark.

Use ""effect"" as a verb meaning ""to bring about."",
Use ""effect"" as a noun meaning ""personal possession.""",How to Use Affect and Effect2," When people misuse ""affect"" with an ""A"", they often intended this meaning of ""effect"" with an ""E."" An ""effect"" in this sense is the opposite of a cause - an event that happens because of some other precipitating event happening.Below are a few examples of the word ""effect"" being used in this way:

It's hard to say what effect the rising price of gasoline will have on the world economy.

Look for a prefix.,
Pay attention to the suffix.,
Identify root words.",How to Understand a Word Without Using a Dictionary2," Etymology is the study of the meanings of words. It also looks at the origins of words, and how they have changed over time. By learning about etymology, you can find new ways to define unknown words without using a dictionary. Start by looking at each part of the word in question. It is very helpful to look to see if the word has a common prefix.
Prefixes are the first part of the word. For example, a common prefix is ""anti"".
""Anti"" means ""against"". Knowing this should help you figure out the meanings of words such as ""antibiotic"" or ""antithesis"".
""Extra"" is a prefix that means ""beyond"". Use this to figure out words such as ""extraterrestrial"" or ""extracurricular"".
Other common prefixes are ""hyper"", ""intro"", ""macro"" and ""micro"". You can also look for prefixes such as ""multi"", ""neo"" and ""omni"".

, The suffix are the letters at the end of the word. There are several suffixes in the English language that are common. They can help you figure out what kind of word you are looking at.


Some suffixes indicate a noun. For example, ""ee"" at the end of the word almost always indicates a noun. Some examples are ""trainee"" and ""employee"".
""-ity"" is also a common suffix for a noun. Examples include ""electricity"" and ""velocity"".
Other suffixes indicate verbs. For example, ""-ate"". This is used in words such as ""create"" and ""deviate"".
""-ize"" is another verb suffix. Think about the words ""exercise"" and ""prioritize"".

, A root word is the core word, without a prefix or suffix. Most words in the English language come from either a Latin or Greek root word.By learning common root words, you can begin to identify new words more easily. You will also be able to recognize words that have had a prefix or suffix added.
An example of a root word is ""love"". You can add many things to the word: ""-ly"" to make ""lovely"".
""Bio"" is a Greek root word. It means ""life, or living matter"". Think about how we have adapted this root word to become ""biology"", ""biography"", or ""biodegradable"".

Keep notes.,
Utilize multiple resources.,
Read a lot.,
Play games.",How to Understand a Word Without Using a Dictionary3," If you can increase the size of your vocabulary, you will find yourself less likely to encounter unknown words. There are several steps you can take to effectively build your vocabulary. For example, you can start by writing notes.Every time you encounter an unfamiliar word, write it down. Then later, when you have access to a dictionary, you can look it up for a precise definition.
Keep a small pack of sticky notes with you while you read. You can write the unfamiliar word on a note and just stick it on the page to return to later.
Start carrying a small notebook. You can use it to keep track of words that you don't know and new words that you have learned.

, There are a lot of tools that you can use to help you build your vocabulary. The most obvious is a dictionary. Purchase a hard copy, or book mark an online dictionary that you find useful.A thesaurus can also be very helpful. It will give you synonyms for all of the new words you are learning.
Try a word of the day calendar. These handle desk tools will give you a new word to learn each day. They are available online and at bookstores.

, Reading is one of the best ways to increase the size of your vocabulary. Make it a point to read each day. Both fiction and non-fiction will be helpful.


Novels can expose you to new words. For example, reading the latest legal thriller will likely expose you to some legal jargon you've never heard before.
Read the newspaper. Some papers even have a daily feature that highlights language and explores the meanings of words.
Make time to read each day. You could make it a point to scroll through the news while you drink your morning coffee, for example.

, Learning can actually be fun! There are many enjoyable activities that can help you to build your vocabulary. Try doing crossword puzzles.


Crossword puzzles are a great way to learn new words. They will also stretch your brain by giving you interesting clues to figure out the right word.
Play Scrabble. You'll quickly learn that unusual words can often score the most points.

Capitalize proper nouns.,
Capitalize job titles that precede someone’s name.,
Capitalize job titles when signing your name.,
Capitalize titles when they’re used in lieu of a name.,
Use uppercase with endowed positions.,
Remember to use title case when capitalizing.",How to Know when to Capitalize Job Titles1," This is the most general rule of capitalization. It means that you should use uppercase for the unique names of specific entities (like “Paris,” “Saturn,” “Alex,” or “Green Peace”) but lowercase for “common nouns” that refer to a class of entities (like “city,” “planet,” “baseball player,” or “environmental organization”). In the case of job titles, this means that most job titles are not capitalized. However, a title that refers to an official, one-of-a-kind position, like the “Queen of England,” should be capitalized., If a specific title comes immediately before a name and refers to a specific person, it’s usually part of a proper noun, and therefore usually should be capitalized. That is, “reverend James” should be “Reverend James,” and “doctor Smith” should be “Doctor Smith.”Note that this rule only holds true for titles that have been officially conferred or awarded. For instance, you would capitalize, “Professor Anita Brown,” “Judge Regina Blake,” and “President Flora Barnum,” but you would not capitalize titles like “musician,” “artist,” or “race car driver”: “This song is performed by musician Louis Armstrong.”
Another way to determine if a job immediately preceding a person’s name should be capitalized is to consider if it’s a title or a description. That is, “Director of Marketing Joanna Russell” is correct if that’s Joanna’s official title. If you’re only describing her position, you wouldn’t capitalize her job: “marketing chief Joanna Russell.”, At the end of a letter, email, or other message, your job title should be capitalized. Instead of signing off as “John Smith, editor in chief,” your signature line should read “John Smith, Editor in Chief.”, If you are using a person’s title as a replacement for their name, especially when directly addressing them, you should capitalize it.For example: “Can you make it to my graduation, Dad?” or “With all due respect, General, I disagree,” or “I saw the Queen of England ride by today.”
This rule also holds true for terms of respect, like “Your Honor” or “Your Highness”.

, Some titles of jobs like endowed professorships or fellowships are proper nouns because they are one-of-a-kind. Because the job titles in this case are proper nouns, be sure to capitalize them even when they’re written after a person’s name: “Georgina Bourassa, the Barnaby G. Gray Professor of Circuses, taught for five years.”

, That is, always capitalize the first, last, and principal words in a title, but don’t capitalize unimportant words like prepositions (such as, “of,” “about,” or “with”), conjunctions (such as, “and,” “but,” or “or”), or articles (“a,” “an,” or “the”).For example, “associate director of research and development for the cancer unit at Pharmacon” should be: “Associate Director of Research and Development for the Cancer Unit at Pharmacon”.

Determine whether your sentence needs ""bad"" or ""badly"".,
Choose “bad” if your sentence is descriptive.,
Use “badly” if your sentence is active.,
Decide whether your sentence requires ""good"" or ""well"".,
Choose “good” if your sentence is descriptive.,
Use “well” if your sentence is active.,
Modify nouns with “good.” “Good” can be used as a predicate adjective to modify nouns, such as a person, place or thing.,
Use well to modify verbs, adjectives, and other verbs.",How to Use Bad or Badly and Good or Well," Locate the word that is being referred to by “bad” or “badly” (this word usually directly precedes bad/badly). If your sentence describes a person, place, thing, or idea, you will need to use an adjective. Adjectives are typically descriptive words that are used to further identify, or quantify nouns. ""Bad"" is an adjective, so it should be used to identify or quantify nouns in your sentences.Adverbs explain how an action (verb) is completed, and are used to modify a verb or another adverb. If your sentence requires an adverb, or a word that modifies an action or verb, you should use “badly.""For instance, in the sentence “I feel bad/badly,” the word “feel” is what will determine if an adjective or an adverb will follow. If “feel” is meant to describe a state of being, an adjective will follow. If “feel” is meant to describe the physical action of touching, an adverb will follow.
Although hearing is also a sense, it is usually used in the active form, such as, “I hear badly”. If you use the word “hearing” (in the noun form), then you will follow it with an adjective, such as, “My hearing is bad.”;
, Once you have determined that the meaning of your sentence is descriptive in nature, use the adjective “bad” to further your description.


For example, in the sentence “I feel bad about having said that,” the word “feel” determines whether you should use an adjective or an adverb. In this case, “feel” is used descriptively to describe a state of mind. Therefore, the adjective “bad” is used., You should determine if your sentence involves how an action is/was performed. This means it is active and requires an adverb, such as ""badly.""


For instance, in the sentence “I feel badly since my fingers were burned,” the word “feel” is used actively as an action.Instead of describing an emotional state, the sentence now describes a person’s ability to touch. Therefore, the adverb “badly” is used.

, Find the word that is being referred to by “good” or “well” (this word typically directly precedes good/well). Confusion usually arises when someone is referring to the four senses (taste, look, smell, and feel). When the word is used actively (as a verb), the adverb form should follow. If the word is used descriptively, an adjective should follow.For instance, in the sentence “I feel good/well,” the word “feel” is what will determine if an adjective or an adverb will follow. If “feel” is meant to describe a state of being, and adjective will follow. If “feel” is meant to describe the physical action of touching, an adverb will follow.
Even though hearing is also one of the five senses, it is typically used in the active form. For instance, “I hear well”. If you use the word “hearing” (in the noun form), then you will follow it with an adjective. For example, “My hearing is good.”

, Once you know that the meaning of your sentence is descriptive in nature, use the adjective “good” to further your explanation.


For example, in the sentence “I feel really good today,” the word “feel” determines whether you should use an adjective or an adverb. In this case, “feel” is used descriptively to describe a state of mind. Therefore, the adjective “good” is used., Once you understand that the meaning of your sentence is active in nature, use the adverb “well” to further your explanation of how an action is/was performed.


For instance, in the sentence “I feel well now that my fingers have healed,” the word “feel” is used actively as an action. Instead of describing an emotional state, the sentence now describes a person’s ability to touch (or to “do” something well—which is an action).Therefore, the adverb “well” is used.

, You can also use ""good"" to modify pronouns, such as he, she, it, they, we, etc.For example, in the sentence, “The orchestra sounded good”, “good” is modifying the noun “orchestra.”
You can also use “good” to describe how you are feeling. For example, “I am feeling good today.”

, The term “well” is an adverb so it cannot be used to modify nouns. It can only modify adjectives, verbs, and other adverbs.In the sentence, “The child plays piano well”, “well” is modifying the verb “plays.” In the sentence, “This is a well-known bar”, “well” is modifying the adjective “known.”
Keep in mind “well” can also be used as an adjective to state how you are feeling, such as “I feel well today.” This is the only exception where “well” is an adjective, not an adverb, in a sentence.

Nouns are the elements that usually perform the action in a sentence, such as a person, place, thing, idea, emotion, animal, or event. Nouns include Sally, Paris, sand , philosophy , happiness, dog, and birthday.
Adjectives modify nouns, and describe aspects or characteristics about nouns. Adjectives include red, funny, lazy, large, and short.
Pronouns take the place of nouns. There are personal subject pronouns (such as I, she, and they), personal object pronouns (such as us, you, it, and them), personal possessive pronouns (such as mine, yours, his, hers, and theirs), and relative pronouns (such as who, which, that, and whose).
Verbs indicate actions or states of being, and tell what the noun is doing. Verbs include run, sing, type, be, and walk.
Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, prepositions, and other adverbs. They are words like quickly, well, , and slowly. These words often end in –ly.

Prepositions indicate relationships in time, space, or direction. Prepositions include to, in, on, over, of, and across.
Conjunctions join nouns, clauses, phrases, and sentences. Coordinating conjunctions link independent clauses, and they are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so (remember FANBOYS). Subordinating conjunctions link dependent clauses, and they include because, if, since, while, and although.
Interjections are words that indicate emotions. These include oh, hey, ouch, and wow. They are often followed by exclamation points.
Articles are used to modify and define nouns. The is a definite article, and a and an are the indefinite articles.;
, In terms of grammatical person, English has three points of view, and each of those can be either singular or plural. The points of view are: singular or plural first-person, singular or plural second-person, and singular or plural third-person. The appropriate pronouns are:


First-person singular: I

Second-person singular: you

Third-person singular: he (masculine) / she (feminine) / it (neuter)
First-person plural: we

Second-person plural: you

Third-person plural: they


, English sentences are structured following the subject–verb–object order (such as “Andrea ran to the door,” not “Run to the door Andrea”). In general, articles come before adjectives, and adjectives come before the nouns they modify. Modifiers should always be placed as close to their nouns as possible. For instance:



Frank (subject) quickly (adverb) mailed (verb) the (article) long (adjective) letter (object).

, English technically only conjugates the present (“I like”) and past tenses (“I liked”), meaning that English verbs are only inflected (have different forms or endings) for these tenses. However, other verb tenses, such as the future (“I will like”), are created with the help of mood, words that denote time (such as “tomorrow”), and auxiliary (helping) words and verbs. Using the verb “to go” as an example, some of the main tenses in English are:Simple present (uninflected verb, or verb + s/es in third person): I go, you go, he/she/it goes, we go, you go, they go.
Present continuous (aka progressive) (am/is/are + present participle): I am going, you are going, he/she/it is going, we/you/they are going.
Present perfect (has/have + past participle): I have gone, you have gone, he/she/it has gone, we/you/they have gone.
Simple past (verb + –ed for regular verbs): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they went (“to go” is an irregular verb).
Past continuous (was/were + present participle): I was going, you were going, he/she/it was going, we/you/they were going.
Past Perfect (had + past participle): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they had gone.
Simple future (will + uninflected verb): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they will go.
Future continuous (will be + present participle): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they will be going.
Future Perfect (will have + past participle): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they will have gone.

, Punctuation is an important part of language, because it indicates starts, stops, pauses, and relationships. Capitalize the first letter of every sentence, and the first letter of all proper nouns (the names of people and places). The main punctuation marks in English—and their basic uses—are:


Commas separate thoughts, ideas, elements, and independent clauses.
Periods indicate the end of a sentence.
Semi-colons join independent clauses in a single sentence, or separate elements in a list.
Colons introduce items in a list, explanations, or definitions.
Question marks indicate that a question was posed.
Exclamation points show emphasis, imperatives, or declarations.
Apostrophes demonstrate possession or create contractions.
Quotation marks indicate that you are directly quoting someone else’s words.
Hyphens join separate words into compound words, modifiers, and numbers.
Dashes create a pause, interrupt a sentence, or add parenthetical information.
Parenthesis add additional information, references, or citations.

, While children’s books may not be grammar textbooks, they are designed to teach the basics of language, including fundamental words and spelling, regular and irregular nouns and verbs, simple conjugation, and sentence structure. Children aren’t often explicitly taught the grammar and mechanics of their native tongues, but instead pick them up by reading and listening to other native speakers., Improve your grasp of grammar by learning how other authors use language. Focus on reading different genres and styles of writing, such as classic literature, textbooks, science-fiction, science books, biographies, blogs, essays, and articles.Pay attention to how sentences are structured, word order, spelling, and creative variations the authors use.


Try reading aloud so that you also get an idea of how the language sounds in conversation.
Keep a dictionary and thesaurus handy while reading.
Read newspapers as well, listen to news radio, and watch televised news programs daily.

, Listen to how other people construct sentences, where they place words in sentences, how they say common phrases, and the vocabulary they use. English has many rules and exceptions, so don’t be afraid to ask questions if you have any.


Try parroting what other people say by repeating it in order to understand how sentences are formed and to expand your vocabulary.
Be warned that some English speakers, even native ones, don’t have a grasp of proper grammar.

, There are many online games and applications you can download on your computer or phone that will test your grammar skills in a fun way.Since these games are educational, they’ll often provide explanations for wrong answers so you can learn from your mistakes.


Libraries, book stores, and online resources will also offer grammar lessons, practice exercises, and quizzes

, Improve your grammar by writing and practicing any new rules or words you've learned. Keep a journal, write short stories, or even just email back and forth with friends or family. Concentrate on improving any problem areas you might have or mistakes you often repeat.


Don’t rely solely on grammar checkers. For one, they can be wrong. Second, you won’t learn from your mistakes if you don’t correct work yourself. If you do employ a grammar check or proofreading services, take the time to look over what changes were made so that you can learn what you did wrong.

, English has a lot of words that look, sound, and/or are spelled the same, even if they have very different meanings. These homographs (words that are spelled the same), homophones (words that are pronounced the same), heteronyms (words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently), and homonyms (words that are spelled and pronounced the same) cause a great deal of confusion, and result in common errors. Remembering these common errors will help you avoid frequently made mistakes.Common mistakes include:


Confusing it’s (a contraction of it is) and its (a possessive pronoun).
Mixing up they’re (a contraction of they are), their (a possessive pronoun), and there (an adverb indicating place).
Using you’re (a contraction of you are) and your (a possessive pronoun) incorrectly.
Confusing too (which means in addition), to (a preposition) and two (the cardinal number that comes after one).
Not using then (meaning at that time) and than (used to compare) correctly.
Improperly using lie (meaning to be in a horizontal position) and lay (which means to place something in a horizontal position).
Confusing farther (used with physical distance) and further (used with figurative or metaphorical distance).

, Improper punctuation can mean that the meaning you’re trying to convey can be confused or lost. There are many punctuation-related errors that can occur in English, including:


Run-on sentences, where there is no punctuation separating independent clauses in the same sentence.
Comma splices, where independent clauses in a sentence are joined with a comma but without a proper coordinating conjunction.
Using apostrophes to create plurals (they are used to create contractions or show possession, not create plurals).
Improper use of quotation marks, which should only be used to indicate that you are directly quoting something someone said.

, In an active construction, the subject is the thing that performs the action; in a passive construction, the subject is acted upon by an outside force. While there’s nothing wrong with the passive voice, it’s less forceful and can make sentences unclear. Therefore, you should use the active voice more often, but it’s acceptable to use the passive voice from time to time, especially to emphasize something. For example, consider how these active and passive sentences place emphasis on different elements of the sentence:


The active “I paid the bill” places the emphasis on what the subject did.
The passive “The bill was paid by me” places the emphasis on who paid the bill.

, The reflexive pronouns are myself, yourself, himself/herself/itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves. These pronouns can be used reflexively or intensively. Reflexive pronouns are only used as the object in a sentence, and only when that object is the same as the subject. Intensive pronouns are used to add emphasis to a sentence and reinforces that the subject performed the action. To tell the difference, remember that if the pronoun can be removed from the sentence and it still makes sense, the pronoun is being used intensively. However, if the pronoun cannot be removed without altering the meaning of the sentence, it’s being used reflexively.


Reflexive: “I pinched myself to see if I was dreaming.”
Intensive: “She individually picked each gift herself.”
Reflexive: “He asked himself how he’d feel in that situation.”
Intensive: “I myself don’t know how I’d react.”

, One of the best ways to ensure you understand the basic grammatical elements of a language is by seeking the help of someone who’s qualified to teach you. Many community colleges offer language courses, or you can ask around at your local high school or college to see if any English students want to make some extra money tutoring you.

, Grammar and style guides come in two forms: descriptive guides that describe how people do speak, and prescriptive guides that tell people how they should speak. But language changes and evolves, and the rules of English aren’t always set in stone. There are many style guides that recommend different ways of approaching grammar, and it’s a good idea to read several of them. This will provide an idea of the different ways to approach spelling (such as American versus British), syntax, and style, give you a better idea of the fundamentals of grammar, and show you where the language is adaptable and where it’s inflexible. Some of the most widely used style guides are:


The Chicago Manual of Style, which is often used for social science and historical journals.
The Modern Language Association (MLA) style, which is often used in the humanities, in language studies, and in cultural studies.
The Associated Press (AP) style, which is used by most news and media outlets.
The American Psychological Association (APA) style , which is often used for natural and life sciences, academic journals, and social sciences.

, Along with the resources available at libraries, the Internet is full of reliable grammar games, lessons, exercises, quizzes, and tips. Many universities will also offer resources about grammar, spelling, syntax, and common errors.


Purdue OWL is an excellent resource that has lessons and different style guide recommendations.You can also subscribe to daily grammar emails and blogs from people like Grammar Girl."
"
Let’s begin with a simple grocery list.,
Write down the subject and verb.,
Add in the list of items.,
Note that before the last item in the list, you use “and.” Some grammarians debate whether the comma before the “and” is appropriate; in fact, there is so much debate, it has it’s own special name, the serial comma or the Oxford comma.",How to Make a List Into a Sentence1," Let’s say you’re sending your sister to the store for groceries. You make out this list:


tomatoes
cucumbers
mangoes
mushrooms
ground beef
chicken broth
milk
eggs
rock salt;
, To make that list into a sentence, begin with the person’s name and purpose, which is the subject and verb:


Alex is going to the grocery store to buy…
“Alex” is the subject, the person who is doing the action. “Is going” is the verb, what Alex is doing.

, Separate them out with commas. For example:


Alex is going to the grocery store to buy tomatoes, cucumbers, mangoes, mushrooms, ground beef, chicken broth, milk, eggs, and rock salt.

, On the one hand, some people say it isn’t necessary. Others say it makes sentences clearer. For instance, if you were writing a list about ice cream flavors and you wanted chocolate ice cream and mint-flavored ice cream as two separate flavors, you might write:


Please buy the ice cream flavors vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, and mint.
If you leave out the comma before the “and,” it makes it sound like you want a single flavor, chocolate and mint ice cream. For that reason, it is more common to put the comma before the “and” in a series than to leave it out.

Determine what your needs are.,
Determine your constraints.,
Talk to your teacher and guidance counselor.,
Do an online search.,
Vet prospective tutors carefully.",How to Do Your Algebra Homework Using Online Tools5," Do you just need help with a test, or do you need long-term help with algebra? It is also possible that you may struggle with study skills or math anxiety. Knowing exactly what you need help with can help you figure out what you need to look for in a prospective tutor.


If you only need short-term help, you should try reaching out to your teacher or professor, who may be able to meet with you after school or during office hours. You could also just look for a peer tutor who would be willing to help you study.

, You should consider how much time you can devote to tutoring sessions, and also what your budget is. If you don’t have a lot of money, you may want to look for free tutoring. If you don’t have a lot of time, online tutoring may be a good bet, because you will save on travel time and can be more flexible in your scheduling.Online tutoring also allows you to work with tutors who may not be located near you, which means you have a larger pool of prospective tutors to choose from.
Online tutors tend to be less expensive than in-person tutors., If you are in high school, you may have access to free tutoring services or study groups through your school.You guidance counselor may also be able to point you in the direction of reputable professional tutors and tutoring companies.

, There are many online companies that either employ tutors or work with freelance tutors who offer services in a variety of subjects. In many instances you can set up in-person sessions, online sessions, or a combination.

, Before signing up to work with a tutor, you should ask questions about the tutor’s experience and teaching approach to ensure they will be a good match for you.You should also ask for references from previous people the tutor has worked with. If you are looking at tutors online, they will likely have reviews posted on their profiles.

Practice.",How to Learn English Grammar," Every word in the English language can be categorized as a specific part of speech. The parts of speech do not define what a word is. Instead, they describe how to use that word.


A noun is a person, place, or thing.Example: grandma, school, pencil
A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun within a sentence. Example: he, she, they

Articles are special terms that proceed a noun within a sentence. The three articles are: a, an, the
An adjective modifies or describes a noun or pronoun. Example: red, tall
A verb is a word that describes an action or state of being. Example: be, run, sleep
An adverb modifies or describes a verb. Adverbs can also be used to modify adjectives. Example: happily, wonderfully
A conjunction joins two parts of a sentence together. Example: and, but
A preposition is used in combination with a noun or pronoun to create a phrase that modifies other parts of speech, like a verb, noun, pronoun, or adjective. Example: up, down, of, from

Interjections are words that express an emotional state. Example: wow, ouch, hey;
, Most parts of speech have additional rules governing their usage. If you want to master English grammar, you will need to study these rules in detail. Make note of the following for your studies:Nouns can be: singular or plural; proper or common; collective; count or non-count; abstract or concrete; gerunds
Pronouns can be: personal, possessive, reflexive, intensive, reciprocal, indefinite, demonstrative, interrogative, or relative
Adjectives can be used on their own, for the sake of making comparisons, or as superlatives.
Adverbs are either relative adverbs or adverbs of frequency.
Conjunctions are either coordinating or correlative.
Verbs can be: action verbs or linking verbs; main verbs or auxiliary/helping verbs
The articles ""a"" and ""an"" are indefinite, while the article ""the"" is definite.

, Single-digit numbers (zero through nine) should be spelled out in word form, but double-digit numbers (10 and up) should be written in numerical form.All numbers within a sentence should either be spelled out or written numerically. Do not mix and match.

Correct example: I bought 14 apples but my sister only bought 2 apples.
Incorrect example: I bought 14 apples but my sister only bought two apples.


Never start a sentence with a number written in numerical form.
Spell out simple fractions and use hyphens with them. Example: one-half
A mixed fraction can be written numerically. Example: 5 1/2
Write decimals in numerical figures. Example: 0.92
Use commas when writing numbers with four or more digits. Example: 1,234,567
Write out the numerical figure when specifying the day of the month. Example: June 1

, At minimum, every sentence consists of a subject and an action. A sentence that lacks either one is a sentence fragment and is considered to be improper.


The subject is usually a noun or pronoun, and the action is conveyed using a verb.
Correct example: The dog ran.

Note that the subject is indicated in italics and the action is indicated in bold print.


Incorrect example: Yesterday afternoon.
Expand your sentences into more complex forms after mastering this basic format.

, Within a sentence, both the subject and verb must share the same singular/plural state. You cannot use the singular form of a verb with a plural subject; a plural subject must have a plural verb.Correct example: They are at school.
Incorrect example: They is at school.
When two singular subjects are connected with the word ""and"" (he and his brother), the subject becomes plural. When connected by ""or"" or ""nor"" (he or his brother), the subject is singular.
Collective nouns, like ""family"" or ""team,"" are treated as singular nouns and require a singular verb.

, Compound sentences are the easiest sentence form to master after the basic sentence. Use a conjunction to join two related thoughts into one sentence rather than forming two separate sentences.


Instead of: The dog ran. He was fast.

Use: The dog ran and he was fast.


Instead of: We looked for the missing book. We could not find it.

Use: We looked for the missing book but could not find it.



, A conditional sentence describes a situation in which one part of the sentence is true only if the other part is true. They can also be referred to as ""if, then"" statements, but the word ""then"" will not always appear when the sentence is written.Example: If you ask your mother, then she will take you to the store.

Note, however, that it would also be correct to write: If you ask your mother, she will take you to the store.
Both forms are still conditional.



, Use clauses to form complex sentences. Clauses are the ""building blocks"" that can be used to expand a sentence past its basic form. They can either be independent or dependent.An independent clause has its own subject and verb. As a result, it could stand as its own sentence. Note that compound sentences, as mentioned previously, consist of independent clauses.

Example: She felt sad, but her friends cheered her up.

Both ""she felt sad"" and ""her friends cheered her up"" could stand as separate sentences.


A dependent clause is one that could not stand as its own sentence.

Example: While he agreed with his brother, the boy would not admit to it.

The clause ""While he agreed with his brother"" would not make sense a separate sentence, so it is a dependent clause.



, There are multiple punctuation marks and various rules governing their usage. You should study these rules in detail, but first, you need a basic understanding of how each punctuation mark is used.Periods (.) mark the end of a statement sentence.

Ellipses (...) indicate that a portion of text has been removed from the passage.

Commas (,) separate words or word groups when a pause is necessary but a period is inappropriate.

Semicolons (;) should be used in complex sentences that lack a connecting conjunction.

Colons (:) are used to introduce lists within a sentence.

Question marks (?) are used at the end of a sentence when the sentence asks a question.

Exclamation points (!) are used at the end of a statement sentence to indicate surprise or emphasis.

Quotation marks ("") separate words spoken by another person from the rest of the text.

Parentheses () enclose information that clarifies a preceding thought.

Apostrophes (') separate contractions and show possession.

, A basic paragraph consists of three to seven sentences. Each paragraph must have a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence.The topic sentence is usually the first sentence in the paragraph. It is the most general sentence and introduces the idea you plan to discuss throughout the rest of the paragraph.

Example: English grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information.



The supporting sentences explain the idea presented in the topic sentence with greater detail.

Example: English grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. At the ""word"" level, one must learn about parts of speech. At the ""sentence"" level, topics like sentence structure, subject/verb agreement, and clauses must be explored. The rules governing punctuation use are also a part of ""sentence"" level grammar. Once a person starts writing larger piece, he or she must also learn about paragraph structure and organization.



The concluding sentence summarizes the information presented in the paragraph. It is not always necessary, but you should still know how to write one.

Example: English grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. At the ""word"" level, one must learn about parts of speech. At the ""sentence"" level, topics like sentence structure, subject/verb agreement, and clauses must be explored. The rules governing punctuation use are also a part of ""sentence"" level grammar. Once a person starts writing larger piece, he or she must also learn about paragraph structure and organization. All of these rules define and describe how to write English correctly.



Also note that the first sentence of a paragraph should be indented a few spaces to the right of the paragraph's left edge.

, While you could technically have a paragraph that uses nothing but basic sentences, a better and more grammatically pleasing paragraph will have a variety of simple and complex sentences.


Correct example: I love my cat. He has soft, orange fur. On cold days, he likes to cuddle next to me for warmth. I think that my cat is the greatest cat ever, and I am really happy to have him.
Incorrect example: I love my cat. He is orange. His fur is soft. He cuddles next to me on cold days. My cat is the greatest cat. I am really happy to have him.

, After you feel comfortable with your paragraph writing skills, try writing longer works, like academic essays. Essay writing is a separate subject, so you should study about it in greater detail. There are a few things you should keep in mind as you begin, though.



Organize your essay by writing an introductory paragraph, three or more body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph.
The introductory paragraph must be a general paragraph that presents the main idea without providing detail. The supporting paragraphs must expand on this main idea with greater detail, and each paragraph should cover its own separate point. The concluding paragraph restates and summarizes the information presented in the essay and does not introduce any new information.

, The rules and information provided in this article will not teach you everything you need to know about English grammar. This article is intended to serve as a starting point in your studies. The actual subject of English grammar is much more complex, and you will need to devote a lot of time and effort if you really want to learn it.

, Some aspects will be similar while others will differ.


When the rules are the same, rely on the knowledge you have of your native grammar to help you with English grammar.
When the rules differ, devote more time and concentration on practicing those aspects of English grammar as you study.

, People who do a lot of reading tend to be more proficient with English grammar in their own writing and speech.


This does not refer to grammar books. Grammar books are helpful, of course, but the principle of this step is a different one.
Read books, magazines, or other materials written in English that you enjoy. The more often you read, the more familiar you will naturally become with the way that grammar is used in word, sentence, and paragraph levels. Learning the rules of English grammar is an important step, but you will be able to put those rules into practice better if you are actually used to seeing proper grammar.

, If you are no longer in school, consider taking a grammar class at a community college, community center, or library. You could also look for a class online.


For non-native English speakers, look for classes specifically designed for students who are learning English as a secondary language. These classes are usually labeled as ESL (English as a Second Language), ENL (English as a New Language), or ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) classes.

, If formal classes do not help, find a mentor who can review grammar rules with you one-on-one. This mentor could be a teacher, professor, or professional tutor. On the other hand, it could also be a parent, sibling, friend, or other relative who has a strong grasp of the English language and is willing to help out.

, Go to a bookstore and purchase an English grammar workbook, or hop online and access some free grammar resources through the Internet.


As a general rule, look for Internet sources that come from educational (.edu) websites. Examples include:

The Guide to Grammar and Writing by Capital Community College Foundation (http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/)
Purdue University's Online Writing Lab (https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/1/5/)



, Above all else, practice makes perfect. The more you can practice English grammar, the better you'll get with it.

Look at the perspective the word is being used.,
Look at the difference between the location of the speaker now and the location the speaker will need to perform an action.,
Try to determine if the action of the item is to be removed (or taken away) from the location and brought to some other place.",How to Know the Differences Between Bring and Take," An easy distinction between take and bring, is when you compare them in terms of the speaker's perspective. ""Take"" associates with ""going"" from the speaker's perspective and ""bring"" associates with ""coming."" in the speaker's perspective. For example, if two people are standing together and one says ""I'm taking this to John,"" he is going to John.;
, Someone else brings something to where the speaker is currently, and takes something to where he plans to go in the future. For example:


""I am taking a book to school tomorrow."" The speaker is at home, and she wants to carry the book to another place (in the future).
""I will bring my mother's journal tomorrow."" The speaker is at school, and is talking to a teacher about bringing the journal to where she is now (the current location).
""Can you bring a bottle of wine when you come over?"" The speaker is asking the listener to bring wine to where the speaker is now. The listener would then reply ""sure, I will bring a bottle of wine with me,"" because the listener is not there yet.

,


""Bring the form 'here' to me to sign, then you can take it 'there' to the manager's office. The manager can take it to the courthouse with the other forms."" follows the same pattern.

Use ""anxious” as instructed.,
Use “eager” as instructed.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words2,"


When followed by a gerund (the ""–ing"" verb form), anxiousness refers to anxiety, not pleasant feelings such as enthusiasm or excitement.

Ex. “He was anxious about becoming the President."" (He had an uncomfortable feeling about it.)


When followed with an infinitive (""to"" and the verb), anxiousness refers to eager desire.

Ex. “He was anxious to become the President.""



,


Eagerness conveys enthusiasm and is followed with an infinitive.
Ex. “He was eager to become the President."" (He was happy about it.)

"
"
Use “convince” as instructed.,
Use “persuade” as instructed.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words3,"


Convince a person of the truth or validity of an idea.
Follow “convince” with ""that"" or ""of.""
Ex. ""The teacher convinced her students that good grammar could aid in communication.""

,


Persuade a person to take action.
Follow ""persuade"" with an infinitive (“to” and the verb).
Ex. ""The teacher persuaded her students to use good grammar.""

"
"
Use “could” with “have.” In fact, all modals (""could,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" ""may,"" ""might,"" ""must"") use the auxiliary verb ""have."",
Do not use “could” with “of.”


The same applies to all other modals.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words4,"


“Have” can be contracted as ""'ve"" (as in ""could've"" and ""couldn't've"").
Correct: ""She could have (or ""could've"") done it.""

,
Incorrect: ""She could of done it.""

"
"
Use “decimate” as instructed.,
Use ""devastate” as instructed.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words5,"


Decimation describes the wiping out of humans. In ancient Rome, “decimate” literally meant ""kill one of every ten soldiers.""

Ex. “The 2010 tsunami in Japan decimated cities and towns along the coast.”


Using creative license, you would also be correct in saying something like:

“The flu decimated Larry's sixth grade class.” (Everyone will understand that more/less than ten percent were affected and nobody actually died.)


Remember that ""decimate"" is similar to ""decimal,"" which refers to counting by tens.

,


Devastate means ""lay waste to.""

Ex. “Natural disasters can devastate a region’s buildings, forests, and landscapes.”


Devastate also means “overwhelm with negative emotions.”

Ex. “A nasty breakup can devastate an individual.”



"
"
Use “each other” as instructed.,
Use “one another” as instructed.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words6,"


“Each other” refers to two.
Ex. ""The two brothers helped each other study.""

,


""One another"" is used for three or more.
Ex. ""These five businesses compete with one another.""

"
"
Use “e.g.” as instructed.,
Use “i.e.” as instructed.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words7,"


""E.g."" (exemplī grātiā) means ""for example"" or ""such as.""
Remember the ""e"" in ""for example.""
Ex. “Many photo manipulation programs (e.g. Photoshop, GIMP) have nearly identical functions.”

,


""I.e."" (id est) means ""that is"" or ""in other words.""
Remember the ""i"" in ""in other words.""
Ex. “They recommend that we ‘demonstrate our continued loyalty through pecuniary means’ (i.e. send more money).”

"
Don't capitalize unofficial titles or common nouns.,
Do not capitalize a title that’s on its own.,
Use lowercase when the title comes after a person’s name in a sentence.",How to Know when to Capitalize Job Titles2," When the job title refers to a profession or class of jobs rather than to a specific or official title, do not put it in uppercase.For instance, “Janice Buckley is a microbiologist,” or “Here are some tips from painter John Green.” In both cases, these job titles are being used to describe a profession rather than an official title, so they shouldn’t be capitalized.

, If a title is isolated from any names and used as a standalone noun in a sentence, it should not be capitalized. This is the most common use-case for job titles, which means that they most often don't require uppercase.For example, “John, who is a salesperson, works at the dealership,” or “The clerk helped us with the documents.”

, This is true whether or not the title is specific or general, official or unofficial.For example: “John Smith, editor in chief at Grammar Central, hates typos,” or “Helena Briggs, social worker with the NHS, is a handling the case.”

"
"
Capitalize job titles when they serve as headings in your resume.,
Do not capitalize job titles in the body text of your resume.,
Be consistent with your capitalization of official job titles in cover letters.",How to Know when to Capitalize Job Titles3," When you are introducing an official position that you have held in the experience section of your resume, you should capitalize it. For instance: ""Director of Human Resources (2011 - Present)""., If a job title appears as part of a sentence or paragraph of your resume, for instance, in the summary or in a job description, do not use uppercase. For example: ""As director of human resources, I upped recruitment and decreased time-to-hire."", There’s no consensus about whether you definitely should or should not capitalize specific, official job titles when they appear in your cover letter. The important thing is to decide which way to go and be consistent throughout the text.When you are applying for a specific position, many people are inclined to put that job title in uppercase in their cover letters: “I am writing to apply for the Assistant Professor of American Literature post at Bard College.” If you do, be sure that you capitalize the other specific job titles included in your letter.
The best way to help you decide which way to go is to look at the company’s job listing and website to see if they capitalize specific job titles that appear within sentences or not. If they do, then you should, too.
Either way, remember that you should never capitalize general job titles in a sentence, such as, “I have more than twenty years of experiences as a director of human resources,” or “I am looking for a position as a campaign manager in the nonprofit sector.”

Make sure your list is parallel in structure.,
Choose a type of sentence to make your list parallel.",How to Make a List Into a Sentence2," Parallel just means that you use the same types of words or phrases throughout your list. For instance, in the list above, all the items were nouns, so the list was parallel., Take a look at this list of things George likes to do: pie, jumping over bridges, to sleep in on rainy days, and to cuddle cats. These structures are not parallel, as you have, in order, a noun, a gerund, and two infinitive phrases. Choose one type to make your sentence. For instance, the sentence could be:


George likes to eat pie, jump over bridges, sleep in on rainy days, and cuddle cats.

In this case, each one is an infinitive, built from the original “to.”


Or it could be: George enjoys eating pie, jumping over bridges, sleeping in on rainy days, and cuddling cats.

In this one, each one is a gerund.


Or it could be: George likes pie, bridges, long naps, and cats.

Here, we’ve changed every item in the list to nouns.

Use “or” to offer alternatives, rather than including everything in the list.,
Format a list with semi-colons if commas would be confusing.",How to Make a List Into a Sentence3," For instance, if Alex was supposed to buy chicken broth but could also buy beef or vegetable broth instead, the you could write it this way as a sentence:


Please buy chicken, beef, or vegetable broth. This sentence indicates that any of these alternatives is okay.
Use “etc.,” “including,” “such as,” or “and so on.” to show the list is not inclusive. For instance, in the example of the grocery list, maybe the list maker wants to tell Alex to buy salad ingredients but doesn’t need to specify exactly which ones:
Buy the ingredients for salad, such as lettuce, tomatoes, and dressing.
Alternatively, it could be: Buy lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and so on to make a salad.
Or: Buy lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc. to make a salad
Or: Buy ingredients for salad, including lettuce, tomatoes, and dressing.
Use a colon before the list if the text before it is a complete sentence. For example, you could write:
Please buy the following ingredients: lettuce, tomatoes, and dressing.

, For example, you could write:


She likes to eat pies like cherry, apple, and strawberry; to buy ice cream flavors like rocky road, vanilla, and cheesecake; and to make cookies like chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and molasses.
Because the items in the list have their own commas, they are actually separate lists all their own. That is, “pies like cherry, apple, and strawberry” is its own list. Therefore, it’s confusing to have a comma after it, as the reader may not be clear where that list ends and the bigger list begins. In this instance, and others like it, using semi-colons is more appropriate.

Consider the purpose of the direct object.,
Find the subject of the sentence.,
Look for the direct object in sentences with “transitive” action verbs.,
Keep in mind that there can be more than one direct object.,
Recognize that some sentences will not have a direct object.",How to Find a Direct Object1," A direct object could be a noun or a pronoun, and always follows an action verb. An action verb is a verb that requires something or someone to receive that action.Without a direct object, a sentence that contains an action verb may not make any sense.


For example, consider the sentence, “Dennis and Johanna ate omelettes for breakfast.” If you were to remove the direct object from the sentence, the verb’s action no longer makes much sense (“Dennis and Johanna ate for breakfast.”)
The direct object gives us information about the action that was performed by telling us for whom or for what the action was performed.In the example of Dennis and Johanna, the eating was performed for the omelettes.;
, The subject of the sentence is the person/thing doing something in a sentence. You can determine this by asking yourself “who” or “what” is performing the action in a sentence.For example, “Sam showed his mother the new museum.” Who performed an action in this sentence? Sam did. What did he do? He showed his mother the new museum.
In this example, the direct object is “the new museum.” If you ask yourself, “What or whom was shown?” You can see that the museum is what was shown, and is the direct object.

, If a sentence contains an action verb (cook, hug, show) there is a greater chance that a direct object will exist to receive the action of that verb.Action verbs that require a direct object are often called “transitive verbs”, while actions verbs that don’t require a direct object are often referred to as “intransitive verbs.”
An example of a transitive action verb: “They gave Jeremy a big hug.” In this sentence, the verb is “gave.” Ask yourself what the subject (They) did. The subject “gave.” This is the transitive verb. You can tell it is transitive because if you left the sentence at, “They gave a big hug.” The sentence no longer makes complete sense. You need the direct object; In this case, the direct object is Jeremy.

, In some cases, a sentence may have more than one direct object, or the direct object may be a clause. Clauses can be particularly misleading, so think carefully about who or what is receiving the action of the verb.For example, “John took his backpack and books to school.” In this case, both “backpack” and “books” are direct objects.An example of a direct object clause exists in this sentence: “John loves baking cakes.” In this case, the action verb is “loves,” and the direct object is “baking cakes.” If you ask yourself, “what does John love?”, you will see that the answer is, “baking cakes.”, Not all sentences will contain a direct object. For example, if the sentence contains a “linking” verb (e.g. am, is, are), “state of being” verb (seem, remain, feel), or an intransitive action verb (e.g. sneezed, danced, cried) , then it may not contain a direct object.


An example of a linking verb is included in the following sentence: “They are stubborn children.” The linking verb here (“are”) links the subject (the children) with the adjective (“stubborn”).
An example of a state of being verb: “Sarah felt ill.” In this sentence, the verb “feels” simply explains the state of the subject (Sarah).
An example of an intransitive action verb: “Hannah sneezed repeatedly.” The verb here is, “sneezed”, but if you ask yourself, “Who or what did Hannah sneeze?” You will find that there is no answer in the sentence which explains that.

Learn the basic parts of a sentence.,
Identify your subject.,
Identify your predicate.,
Ensure that there is a complete thought.,
Sentences must end with a “punctuation mark.” Punctuation marks include the period (.,
Determine the purpose of the sentence.,
Classify “declarative sentences.” Declarative sentences make a statement and end with a period, as in the example, ""Dogs bark."",
Identify “interrogative sentences.” Interrogative sentence types inquire something of the reader and end with a question mark.,
Find “exclamatory sentences.” Exclamatory sentences indicate urgency or strong emotion.,
Spot “imperative sentences.” Imperative sentences imply an order, directive or command.,
Evaluate the sentence's construction.,
Identify simple sentences.,
Classify compound sentences.,
Identify complex sentences.,
Spot complex-compound sentences.",How to Identify Different Types of Sentences," A complete sentence must begin with a capital letter, contain (at minimum) one independent clause, and end with a punctuation mark. An example of a complete sentence would be, ""Dogs bark."", In all of the sentence types, a main clause must have both a subject and a predicate. A subject is a noun or pronoun, such as the word, ""dogs,"" in the example ""Dogs bark."" The subject describes who or what the sentence is about., A predicate is an action verb, such as the word, ""bark,"" from “Dogs bark.” The predicate of the sentence describes what the subject of the sentence does.

, A set of words that does not express a complete thoughts is called a “phrase.” The sentence “Dogs bark” is a complete thought. Phrases like, “at the beach"" or “in the morning” are not.Another way of ensuring that the sentence expresses a complete thought is to check the verb. If the verb is transitive, then the sentence may not express a complete thought. For example, if the sentence was ""The dog wants,"" then the sentence would be incomplete because that verb ""wants"" is transitive. Readers need to know what the dog wants to complete the sentence. Does the dog want food? Water? To go outside? However, ""bark"" is intransitive, which means that we have a complete subject and action. Therefore, ""Dogs bark"" is a complete sentence.,), question mark (?) and exclamation point (!). Punctuation is a useful tool for identifying sentences., The first step in identifying a sentence is to figure out what the sentence is trying to accomplish. Try to figure out whether a given sentence is explaining something, asking something, exclaiming something, or giving a command.


For example, ""Dogs bark"" explains something about what dogs do, whereas ""Stop barking!"" is a command that you might give to a dog.
Sentences may also have dual purposes. For example, a sentence that reads: ""I enrolled my dog in an obedience course because he is always barking!"" is explaining and exclaiming something.

, A period indicates the stopping point of a thought.Another example of a declarative sentence might be ""I take my dog to an obedience class twice per week.""

, As the name suggests, question marks indicate questions. An example of an interrogative sentence (or question) would be, ""Do dogs bark?""A more complex example might be something like, ""Why do dogs bark?"" or ""How do you get a dog to stop barking?""

, These types of sentences end with an exclamation point and they often express urgency or a strong emotion.For example, you might exclaim, ""Quick! Catch the dog!"" or ""I am so annoyed by the dog's constant barking!""

, For example, ""Dog, stop barking,"" is an imperative sentence. When identifying imperative sentences, it is worthwhile to note that they may end with either a period or an exclamation.Another example of an imperative sentence might be, ""Susan, please go and see why the dog is barking.""

, In addition to determining the type (or purpose) of a sentence, it is also useful to assess sentence construction. You can do this by breaking the sentence down into parts. You will want to identify separate clauses, as well as identify if these clauses are “independent” or “dependent.”Clause: a group of related words that contain both a subject and predicate.
Independent clause: a clause that contains a complete thought, such as “Dogs bark.”
Dependent clause: a clause that does not contain a complete thought, such as “when a stranger comes.”

, A simple sentence is composed of just one independent clause. In this example, ""Dogs bark"" would be considered a simple sentence., Compound sentence types combine two independent clauses, using a conjunction to connect them, such as ""for,"" ""and,"" ""nor,"" ""but,"" ""or,"" ""yet,"" or ""so."" ""Dogs bark"" may be made into a compound sentence by using a conjunction (such as ""and"" or ""but"") to add another independent clause: ""Dogs bark, and they play.""You can also create a compound sentence by using a semi-colon. If you use a semicolon, then the ideas should be similar but related.For example, ""Dogs bark to sound an alarm if they suspect danger; they bark to protect their people.""

, Complex sentences combine one independent clause with one or more dependent clauses. Dependent clauses have both a subject and a predicate, but do not convey a complete thought. ""When a stranger comes"" is a dependent clause, which may be combined with the independent clause from the previous example to make a complex sentence: ""Dogs bark when a stranger comes.""A ""dependent clause"" will not convey a complete thought. When you hear the phrase ""when a stranger comes,"" you are left needing more information. What happens when a stranger comes?

, Complex-compound sentences are a combination of the complex and compound sentence structures. These types of sentences may have multiple independent and dependent clauses. An example of a complex-compound sentence is, ""Dogs bark when a stranger comes, but they do not bite."" This example uses an independent clause (""they do not bite""), separated by a conjunction (""but""), to create the new sentence.""They do not bite"" is an independent clause because it expresses a complete thought. ""They do not bite"" can be made into its own complete sentence.

Consider the problems with passive voice.,
Watch for sentences where the subject is missing.,
Note the difference between active voice and passive voice.,
Check for instances when passive voice is preferable.",How to Fix Passive Voice1," With the passive voice, the subject of a sentence is being acted upon, rather than doing the action. The verb in the sentence is acting on the subject, with the subject appearing after the action in the sentence. This results in a sentence that sounds awkward and bland, poor qualities when you are trying to craft a persuasive essay, an engaging article, or an effective oral presentation.For example, a sentence in the passive voice would be: “The milkbone was chewed by the dog” or “The basketball was thrown by Sara.” In the first sentence, the milkbone is being acted on by the dog and in the second sentence, the basketball is being acted on by Sara. This create a bland sentence, as the subject is not doing the action in the sentence.
Another example would be: “The bicycle wheels were destroyed by the storm” or “My papers were written on a computer.” In the first sentence, the bicycle wheels are being acted on by the storm and in the second sentence, the papers are being acted on by the computer.;
, A sentence may also use passive voice if it has no subject at all. These sentences tend to include dangling modifiers.Dangling modifiers are words or phrases that modify a word that is not clearly stated in the sentence.


A sentence with a dangling modifier that has no subject might be something like, “To be more professional, a black suit was worn.” In this situation, we do not know who wore the black suit, but the sentence indicates that someone wore the black suit to seem more professional. Therefore, the sentence is passive and incomplete.

, With the active voice, the subject of the sentence is doing the action. The subject usually appears before the action in the sentence. This creates sentences that are clear, concise, and direct. You should use active voice whenever because it will make your writing seem more purposeful.Example sentences in the active voice include: “The dog chewed the milkbone” or “Sara threw the basketball.” In both sentences, the subject of the sentence is doing the action. “The dog” “chewed” and “Sara” “threw.""
Other examples include: “The storm destroyed the bicycle wheels” or “I wrote the papers on a computer.” In both sentences, the subject comes before the verb and the subject is doing the action.

, In some instances, the passive voice may be necessary or more useful than the active voice. These instances are rare and specific to the content of the sentence. You should be aware of these instances so you know when it is okay to use the passive voice.Sometimes you may have an instance when the recipient of the action is more important than the performer of the action. You would then use the passive voice to highlight the recipient of the action. You might notice this in news stories and news articles.
For example, “A priceless Rodin sculpture was stolen from the Chicago Museum of Art today by two armed men.” In this instance, the more newsworthy content is that the sculpture was taken, rather than that the performer of the action is the two armed men. Putting the more important content up front, even though it is passive voice, makes the sentence feel more purposeful.
You may also use passive voice when you cannot identify the “who” or “what.” In these instances, you may use the passive voice to make up for not having more details. For example, “The package was lost during the international flight.” Because you do not know who lost the package, you cannot use the active voice and may instead use the passive voice.

Use ""to” as instructed.,
Use “too” as instructed.,
Use “two” as instructed.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words15,"


“To” is a preposition. It’s always correct if you are talking about direction.

Ex. “I’m going to the store.”


""To"" is also used to form the infinitive verb form.

Ex. ""It is my goal to write one page today.""



,


“Too"" is always an adverb. It’s correct if you can substitute ""also.""
Ex. “Really? I hate that guy, too!”

,


""Two"" is always a number. You should almost always write out the word ""two"" rather than using the Arabic number.
Ex. “Please buy two-percent milk this time.”

"
"
Use “who’s” as instructed.,
Use “whose” as instructed.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words16,"


""Who's"" is the contracted form of ""who is"" and is suitable for use only where the non-contracted form would also be suitable.
Ex. ""Who's coming to dinner?""

,


“Whose” means “of whom or of which” and is a possessive pronoun, meaning it must be used to modify another noun.
Ex. “Whose car is blocking mine in the driveway?""
In question form, “whose” can modify a noun that isn’t explicitly mentioned.
Ex. “Have you ever heard her music?”
“Whose?”
“Kelly’s.”

"
"
Use “hilarious” as instructed.,
Use “hysterical” as instructed.",How to Use Commonly Misused Words17,"


“Hilarious” means arousing great merriment; extremely funny.
Ex. “She's my favorite comedian. I think she's hilarious!”

,


“Hysterical” has to do with uncontrollable emotions, particularly negative ones.
Ex. “Seeing his dog get hit by a car made him hysterical.”
Ex. “Her hysterical laughter was off-putting, especially since the joke wasn’t that funny.”

"
"
Ask yourself “whom” or “what” is receiving the action.,
Avoid mistaking the direct object for a subject complement.,
Remember that direct objects are always nouns or pronouns.,
Keep word order in mind.",How to Find a Direct Object2," Try to remember that the direct object in a sentence is always a thing or a person who received the action of the verb.For example, in the sentence, “Alice baked her mother a cake.” You can quickly identify the subject who performed the verb (Alice) and the verb (baked). Now ask yourself, “What or whom was baked?” Was her mother baked? No, that’s not what the sentence says. The sentence says that she baked a cake. What was baked? A cake! You have now identified the direct object.

, A subject complement is a clause that follows the action verb, and describes the subject. It can be easy to confuse these because subject complements can only follow a linking verb, but some linking verbs can also be used as action verbs.For example, “appear”, “grow”, “remain”, “smell”, and “turn.” are all examples of linking verbs that can also be used as action verbs. In the sentence, “Michelle felt sick.” The verb, “felt” is a linking verb because it does not require any explanation of whom or what. However, in the sentence, “Michelle felt her forehead.” The verb, “felt” is an action verb because it requires an explanation of whom/what was felt, in this case, her forehead. If you were to remove this information, the sentence would not make sense.

, If you are trying to identify the direct object in a sentence, it can be helpful to remember that the direct object will either be a noun or it will be a pronoun.If the word you have identified as the direct object is a verb, adjective, or an adverb, try reading the sentence again. Ask yourself again, “To whom or what was the action done?” Hopefully, asking yourself this, and look carefully for a noun or pronoun will help you identify the direct object.

, The direct object will always come after the verb in a sentence, so it can be helpful to identify the verb first. This way, you will know that the word you are looking for will be after the verb.Keep in mind, though, that if you are trying to identify a direct object in a foreign language, such as German, this may not always be the case as word order can vary dramatically among languages.

Correct common passive words in your sentences.,
Rewrite the sentence so the subject is doing the action.,
Maintain the same voice throughout the sentence.,
Identify the subject.",How to Fix Passive Voice2," One way to note when you are using passive, instead of active, voice is to go through your writing and look for common words that are found in passive sentences. Though not every passive sentence contains these keywords, watching for these words is a useful way fix instances of passive voice. Watch for the following forms of “to be” that might show up in a passive sentence:“Is”: For example, “Biking is something I do.”
“Was”: For example, “The rope was used by me in the race.”
“Were”: For example, “The berries were eaten by the kids.”
“Had been”: For example, “The game had been played by the man since dawn.”
“Have been” or ""Has been"": For example, “The singing has been done by the group all morning.”

, Once you have identified passive sentences in your writing, you should adjust the sentence so the subject is doing the action. The subject could be a person, an object, or a place. You want to make sure the subject is always before the verb and is doing the action, not being acted upon.For example, you may have the sentence, “The rope was used by me in the race.” You may adjust this sentence so it is in active voice, “I used the rope in the race.” In the active sentence, the subject “I” is doing the action, “used the rope in the race.”
Another example could be the passive sentence: “The game had been played by the man since dawn.” You may adjust the sentence so it is active: “At dawn, the man started playing the game” or “The man started the game at dawn.” In the active sentence, the subject “the man” is doing the action, the verb “played.”

, Do not shift from active voice back into passive voice. Sometimes, you may fall back into the habit of shifting into passive voice after a few sentences in the active voice. You may also make the mistake of starting a sentence in active voice and then ending the sentence in passive voice. You should make sure that every sentence has a subject who is doing an action, with the subject placed before the verb in the sentence.For example, you may have the following sentence: “She wanted to act calm when she heard the jokes, but she was still jeered at by her friends.” This sentence begins in active voice, with “She wanted” and then ends in passive voice. You can adjust it to all active voice, resulting in: “She wanted to act calm when she heard the jokes, but her friends still jeered at her.”

, Many sentences in the passive voice lack a subject and contain dangling modifiers. Identifying the subject can help to clarify your sentences and move from passive voice to active voice.For example, you may have the following sentence: “To save time, the essay was typed on a computer.” This sentence uses passive voice and a dangling modifier, as it is not clear who is saving time or who is typing the essay. The revised version of the sentence would be: “To save time, Tyler typed the essay on a computer.”

Take your time.,
Read your writing out loud.,
Use the search function.,
Start at the end and read backwards.,
Visit the writing center or a writing tutor.Most universities have writing centers where you can get feedback and help on your paper for free.",How to Fix Passive Voice3," Proofreading takes time, so do not put it off to the last minute. Give yourself plenty of time.Try to set aside at least 20 minutes to proofread your paper a day or two before it is due. You will also need to give yourself time to correct any errors you find.

, You may notice passive voice if you take the time to read your writing out loud to yourself or to a sympathetic audience. You should pay close attention to any sentences where the subject comes after the verb and where it is unclear who or what is doing the action in a sentence. These are indicators of passive voice.Though your computer’s spell check function can be useful for catching grammatical errors, it may not catch all of the passive sentences in your writing so do not depend on it to do this for you.
You should also keep in mind that some sentences actually benefit from passive voice, based on the content of the sentence. Reading your writing out loud and to others can help you be a better editor of your work and notice when a sentence should be in passive or active voice.

, You can use the search or find and replace function in MS Word to help you find instances of passive voice.Try searching for common passive voice words and phrases, such as “is,” “was,” “were,” “had been,” and “have been.” Then, check the sentences with highlighted words and phrases to see if they use passive voice.


Correct instances of passive voice as needed.

, Reading a paper backwards can also make it easier for you to identify problems such as passive voice. Read the last sentence of your paper, and then read the sentence before that one.Continue to work backwards until you have read every sentence in your paper. Correct any instances of passive voice that you find as you go.

, If your university has a writing center, then make an appointment to get help finding instances of passive voice.


Keep in mind that a writing tutor will not fix your work for you. He or she will help you develop the skills you need to identify instances of passive voice on your own.

Familiarize yourself with the concept of a comma splice.,
Correct the comma splice with a period or exclamation mark.,
Fix the comma splice with a coordinating conjunction.,
Use a semi-colon to get rid of the comma splice.,
Don’t be fooled by words like “however.” Unless the word is a coordinating conjunction, it cannot be used with a comma to split two independent clauses.",How to Correct Run on Sentences1," One of the most common run-on sentences is a comma splice.A comma splice is two independent clauses that are only separated by a comma, such as in the following example:


“Ice cream is very tasty, I like it.”;
, You will also need to capitalize the letter following the added punctuation. End punctuation like periods or exclamation points work best if the ideas are separate. For example:


“Ice cream is very tasty. I like it.”

, Coordinating conjunctions are words meant specifically for connecting parts of a sentence. These words include: “and,” “but,” “for,” “yet,” “nor,” “so,” and “or.”They all work a little differently.


“And” shows that the two sentences are similar, meaning the second one is in addition to the first.
“But” shows the second sentence is contradictory.
“Yet” can also mean “in addition” or “even so.”
“Or” presents two possible choices.
“Nor” presents two impossible options. It also negates, like “but.”
“So” means “therefore,” while “for” is saying that a reason for the first part of the sentence will follow.
In our example, “and” makes the most sense to connect the sentences: “Ice cream is very tasty, and I like it.”

, Semi-colons work well if the ideas are closely related, and a conjunction doesn’t make as much sense. A semi-colon works fine in this situation, especially since conjunctions can change the meaning of the two sentences:


“Ice cream is very tasty; I like it.” Normally, you don’t use a capital letter after the semi-colon, but in this case, we of course have to capitalize the word ‘I’.

, For instance, you shouldn’t write: “I like pie, however, I like ice cream more.”


“However” is not sufficient to connect the sentences. Use one of the above methods to fix it: “I like pie. However, I like ice cream more.”'

Most states have websites outlining English/language arts standards for every grade, and because of Common Core, these are becoming more cohesive. However, the English curriculum can change from classroom to classroom, even within the same grade. Some teachers focus on novels and poetry, while others spend more time on grammatical and writing skills. Some teachers use textbooks while others rely on handouts, Power Point presentations, and smart board activities. Therefore, as soon as you know who your child's English teacher will be, get the lowdown on how he or she conducts class.


Older kids' teachers usually have a syllabus, so get your hands on one as soon as possible, whether that's a hard copy or an online link.
If your child is in eighth grade or younger, the teacher may not use a traditional syllabus, but he or she will likely have a reading list or a course outline available. If not, ask for one.


You can then use the information provided to preview the texts your student will read or the skill sets he or she will learn. The more familiar you are with consistent themes, drills, and test formats, the better you'll feel.;
, Most teachers want to provide a hands-on education that caters to several learning styles, but the reality is that they may not have the resources or time to do so. In addition, the constant focus on testing means that teachers often reluctantly fall back on traditional methods such as comprehension questions, weekly spelling tests, and book reports. If your student struggles with any of these, you can supplement the traditional classroom with your own English games at home. For instance, you may want to try:


Active Spelling: Have your kids practice spelling words or grammar skills while jumping rope, walking the dog or otherwise exercising. You can also use music to set spelling words or grammar rules to rhythms, such as singing the list of coordinating conjunctions to the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."" Older kids can make up their own corresponding poems or raps. 
English Jeopardy: This one works best for the books or short stories read in class. Help your student make a Jeopardy board with different categories and dollar values for subjects like Themes, Characters, Symbolism, and more. Your child can then compete with a group of friends from his or her class, or play solo, with the object being to clear as many categories as possible. 
Classic Word Games: Many kids struggle with vocabulary, synonyms, or spelling, even in middle and upper grades. Traditional word games like Scattegories, Scrabble, Mad Gab or Taboo can help with these issues. In particular, games like Taboo, where players aren't allowed to use common words to describe something, can help build to build vocabulary.

, Even students who love to read can have a hard time with English because they don't like the texts their teachers assign. If this is the case, ask your student what he or she doesn't like about the books being chosen. Is it that the protagonists are always boys, but she's a girl? Is it that they all seem to focus on the same themes? Is it that the language feels inaccessible? Any of these issues can be solved with a little parental savvy.


For example, many teachers have made modern versions of Shakespeare and other older texts accessible to students. If your child's teacher does not do this, have your child sit down with you and paraphrase what he thinks the characters are trying to say. More often than not, the student will pick up more than he or she thinks.
If your child is discouraged because the books chosen are otherwise un-relatable, go to the bookstore or library with her or him. Allow your child to choose a book that she or he would prefer to read. Make a deal that your student can read parts of it after finishing the assigned reading each day. You can also try to find books with similar themes or settings, but different styles. For example, if your daughter is reading the third or fourth assigned book about a boy who likes to play sports, find her a book with a girl in a dynamic athletic role.
If your child feels burned out and discouraged by Holocaust books, suggest that he or she read more about resistance workers or immigrants who escaped Nazi terror.
Make time to discuss whatever your child is reading for fun as a family. If he or she sees that you're excited about reading and learning, the spark will return.

, English can feel like a large, clunky subject even to the most adept students. This is often because it has many pieces; a good English student needs to know how to analyze literature, but also how to write a compelling argument, how to spot grammatical errors, and how to research. If you and your student find these tasks daunting, break them into small chunks.


For example, maybe your student can read a Shakespearean play scene by scene and make flashcards rather than trying to tackle one act per night.
Using highlighters to color-code the parts of a research paper might help your student know for sure what he or she needs to do next, or what research needs to be done to keep versus what can't actually be used.
You can also enlist the teacher's assistance; some teachers may use these methods in class.
If your child has a learning difficulty or reading disability, teachers can also decrease homework loads or record texts rather than requiring your student to read them.

Know that some languages don't really conjugate at all.",How to Conjugate Verbs," A verb’s conjugations drastically change in each language. A conjugation may be more detailed if the language uses masculine, feminine and plural subjects regularly. It also changes with tense and a number of other reasons, depending on the language's structure.


It is relatively easy to conjugate a verb in the English language, because the second person (you) is the same for singular or plural subjects and the verb does not change based on gender. However, English contains a large number of irregular verbs.Every language is different!;
, Try a verb that you are used to using, so that you can conjugate the verb from memory, if possible. It's also a good idea to choose a verb from every family and irregular verbs for each. In Spanish, you'd want to pick an -ar verb, an -ir verb, and an -er verb, in addition to an irregular verb like ""ser.""


Often the most common verbs are the irregular ones. Think of the three most common verbs in English: be, have, and do -- they all follow their own unique patterns. This is because common verbs maintain their nuance because they're so often used -- the patterns are well-established and resistant to change over time.

, A verb must be conjugated separately for each tense (at least in language that use tense heavily). There are many different tenses, including present, past, future, present continuous, past continuous, past perfect continuous, present perfect, past perfect, future perfect, and present perfect continuous.And that's just the tip of the iceberg! Which ones do you need to do?


To get started at the very basic level, pick the present simple, past simple, and future simple. That way you'll be able to talk about things in the past, present, and future.

, It can give you an example of how it is used in a sentence to help get you started. Online resources can be very helpful, too, providing you with entire pre-made charts.


Try guessing first though! The more you rely on your own brain, the stronger the connections will be in the future. Only jump to your dictionary or the Internet when you absolutely have to.

, In some circles, this is known as verb 1, 2, and 3. Place a colon next to each one. You will then write the correct conjugation next to each term.Write down the infinitive form at the top. This is the word that is used with the word “to.” In English, it is also the part of the verb that is used with the future tense and with auxiliary verbs. For example, with the verb “to search,” the infinitive is “search.”
List the present participle. This is the form of the verb that you use with the present continuous tense, such as “I am searching.”
List the past participle. This is the form of the verb you would use with the past perfect, present perfect and future perfect tenses. For example, ""I had searched,"" “I have searched,"" and ""I will have searched.""

, These are the most commonly used pronouns, including I, you, he, she, it, we, you and they. You are listing the first person, second person and third person, both singular and plural.The pronouns that you conjugate will change based on the language. Clarify what conjugations you are asked to include before you start your assignment.
When doing English conjugation, you can group he, she and it together. You can also opt to remove the plural 2nd person, or you, because the verb does not change based on the number of people (that is, ""you search"" versus ""you (all) search"").

, While you'll be able to stop at person and number for some languages (Romance languages, namely), for others that won't be the case. If your language needs to account for gender, mood, voice (the full list is in the last section), do so now.


It's still best to use a few verbs. How many ""verb families"" does your language have? Make sure to have one of each, including irregular verbs.

, Write the form of the verb that is used for each person in each tense you are working on, next to the pronoun. Have separate charts that are constructed the same, yet different for past, present, and future.


For example, to conjugate the verb “to search” in the present tense, you would write “I search, you search, he/she/it searches, we search, they search.” The chart would look similar, but not the same, if you were to do the verb in the past tense.

, To sum up, your chart should:


Establish the infinitive, present and past participle
Have columns for person and number (e.g., ""I"", ""they"", etc.)
Have columns for gender, etc., if applicable

You should have multiple charts for multiple verbs (of varying structures) for multiple tenses. For example, conjugate ""to search"" in the present simple, the past simple, and the future simple. Then, do the same with ""to be,"" as it's irregular.



, Most of us only have an intrinsic knowledge of our own language -- that is, everything we know isn't something we realize we know. It's only when you take a look at your own language that you realize you conjugate verbs every day according to patterns you mastered years ago. You say ""I go there on Tuesdays"" and ""She goes there on Tuesdays, too"" without even thinking. What's that all about?


When you switched to ""goes,"" you indicated that you were talking about someone or something else. You also indicated that whoever or whatever you were talking about was only one person or thing. What's more, you used the present simple tense, indicating habit, a repeated action. If someone could barely hear you and only made out ""Goes there on Tuesdays,"" they would know that someone or something is at a place on every, or at least most, Tuesdays (and not other days). Useful information!
If we're getting visual, conjugation is changing part of the word. If you tack on an extra ending, you're putting in information. If you take some off, you're putting in information. If you're dealing with a language that heavily modifies verbs, you could have an entire sentence in one word just by modifying it the right ways.

, Certain languages have lost their nuances over the centuries (while others have gained). Maybe your language only indicates person or number, but there are some languages where verb conjugation can practically write a book. Here are the common possibilities for what a conjugated verb can indicate:



Person. In English, you have to use a subject. You can't just say ""...is beautiful."" In Spanish, as an example, you could say ""Soy bonita."" The verb ""soy"" is conjugated in the first person -- yourself.

Number. How many people are doing a thing? In French, you'd say ""Je marche"" (I walk). If you're walking with a few friends, you'd say, ""Nous marchons.""

Gender. Languages like Hebrew also indicate gender on their verbs. If a female (or something regarded as female) is doing something, -/et/ or /a/ (the phonemic pronunciation, that is) is tack onto the end. Male? Leave it alone.

Tense. Many languages use the verb to indicate when an action was done. You'd say ""I went to the store last Tuesday"" in English, not ""I go to the store last Tuesday.""

Aspect. This is similar to tense, yet different. Tense refers to completed when, when aspect is completed how. An example of this is the passé simple and imparfait ""tenses"" in French -- they're both past tenses, but they're reserved for different situations.

You can have aspect without having tense -- just take a look at Mandarin.



Voice. This makes the sentence active or passive. That is ""The boy kicked the ball"" or ""the ball was kicked by the boy.""

Mood. This covers whether the statement is a fact, a desire, a command, based in reality, etc. An example is the subjunctive tense -- ""If I were hungry"" quite clearly says that right now, you're not.

, Every language is different. Conjugating verbs in one, while useful practice, won't necessarily make any other language easier. And yet others conjugate in ways that don't even involve the reasons discussed above! When you're conjugating yourself, make sure you've covered your bases.


For example, Korean has seven speech levels. Depending on the formality of your situation, you conjugate the verbs differently!
Japanese has different conjugations for speaker-listener relationships. This is called ""honorific speech."" The conjugation you choose indicates how far above or below you are in rank from the person you're speaking to.

, That's a fancy term for modifying nouns and adjectives. It's a very similar process and indicates a lot of the same things, it just has a different name. If your language also has declension, you can make charts for those, too.


This is especially important in languages with cases and languages that don't have any specific word order. There are some languages where you can say (translated roughly, of course), ""boy kick girl and ""girl kick boy"" that mean the same thing if the nouns are appropriately declined.

, It's highly possible that the language you're studying doesn't have much verb conjugation. In Vietnamese, for example, you would use a past marker as a word all by itself (""đã"") and not modify the verb at all to indicate something you already did. While this sounds like a free ticket, they often make up for complexity in other ways!

Familiarize yourself with the concept of fused sentences.,
Use a subordinating conjunction to fix fused sentences.,
Add one of the methods listed in the previous section.",How to Correct Run on Sentences2," Fused sentences are two independent clauses strung together with no punctuation.For instance, the following is a fused sentence:


“George is awesome he eats ice cream.”

, A subordinating conjunction turns an independent clause into a dependent clause. Subordinating conjunctions are words like “because,” “as,” “if,” “although,” and “since.”


Let’s look at our example. The second sentence could be turned into a dependent clause: “George is awesome because he eats ice cream.” “Because he eats ice cream” can’t stand alone, but it makes a complete thought together with the first sentence.

, To correct a fused sentence, you can use all of the methods listed in the previous section. To add end punctuation to our example sentence, you would write:


“George is awesome. He eats ice cream.”
To add a coordinating conjunction, you would write: “George is awesome, for he eats ice cream.” or “George is awesome, and he eats ice cream.” Notice how different coordinating conjunctions can change the meaning of the two sentences; they show how the sentences are related.
To add a semi-colon you would write: “George is awesome; he eats ice cream.”

"
"
Read each sentence in your paper.,
Try saying your sentences out loud as you write.,
Check that each sentence has an independent clause.,
Use an acronym to help you remember how to fix run-on sentences.",How to Correct Run on Sentences3," Consider if each one only has one complete thought or more than one. For sentences with more than one complete thought (or independent clauses):

Is it separated by a comma only? That is a run-on that needs to be fixed.
Does it not have any punctuation at all? That is a run-on that needs to be fixed.

, This may help you identify when you have more than one complete thought in the same sentence., Don’t forget to look for the subject (what is doing the action) and the verb (the action), which will help you identify independent clauses., Remember, the four ways to fix run-on sentences are by adding end punctuation, using a comma and a coordinating conjunction, using a semi-colon, or by turning one of the independent clauses into a dependent clause with a subordinating conjunction.


If you have trouble remembering the coordinating conjunctions, use the acronym “FANBOYS”: “For,” “And,” “Nor,” “But,” “Or,” “Yet,” “So.”"
"
Clap your hands as you say a word.,
Use a metronome or a Newton's cradle to make a beat.",How to Divide Words Into Syllables2," Try to form a steady beat for every individual sound you make.For example, ba (clap) - na (clap) -na (clap). This word has three claps, one for every syllable.
Words have a natural emphasis when you say them regularly. The word ""banana"" sounds like banana because it stresses the middle syllable. Coordinate your claps with the natural stresses and emphases of a word.
Start with bigger words that you know have more than one syllable, like ""hippopotamus."" The more syllables there are, the longer and more rhythmic your beat will be, making it easier to divide the word.

, Say a part of the word every time you hear a ""click"" noise.


Try to be silent at the same times the metronome or Newton's cradle is silent. Only say a syllable when you hear a click sound. This will help you split up a word into its smallest audible segments.
This might be easier than clapping because your focus is mostly on saying words and not so much on creating a rhythm. You can also use your hands to tally the syllables in particularly long words.
If using a metronome, pick a fast but steady tempo. Most hit songs fall into the 120 beats-per-minute (BPM) range,suggesting that maybe most people appreciate sound at this speed. Try setting your tempo to 120 bpm and saying words on tempo.

Write a word down on a piece of paper.,
Identify any prefix in a word.,
Draw a line after the prefix of the word.,
Identify any suffix of a word.,
Draw a line before the suffix of a word.,
Divide any compound words.,
Draw lines in the remaining chunks according to vowel placement.,
Say your word.",How to Divide Words Into Syllables3," Use big letters and leave some room between letters to separate syllables.


Write the word in a blue. You will later be drawing vertical lines to separate syllables, which you can color in red. This will provide visual contrast and help you picture how words are broken up.
Look at where the vowels fall in your word. Every syllable will have a vowel, but may not always have a consonant., Prefixes are sets of letters added to the beginning of a word to give it a specific meaning.For example, the word ""play"" is different than the word ""replay."" ""Play"" means to show something once; ""replay"" means to show something again.
Many prefixes are usually one syllable, for example rewind, predetermine, and postmortem.
Some prefixes have more than 1 syllable. If your prefix has more than one vowel and the vowels are separated by consonants, it is more than one syllable. For example: ""anti"" is a prefix with two syllables. ""Ant"" is one syllable and ""i"" is the other.
Prefixes with more than one vowel that are not separated by consonants most likely are only 1 syllable. For example: ""eu"" in ""eulogy"" is only 1 syllable.

, Separate the prefix from the remaining letters in your word.


For example, ""re | wind."" Now you can start to see how your word is made up of smaller chunks of letters.
For prefixes with more than one vowel, look at the where the vowels fall. If your prefix has more than one vowel and has consonants between them, draw a line after the first consonant that follows your first vowel. For example: ""an | ti.""
Many words don't have prefixes. If your word doesn't have a prefix, don't worry about this step.

, Suffixes are like prefixes, but they are added to the end of the word to make them mean something different.


For example: ""calculate"" means something different than ""calculator. Calculate is when you find the amount of something; calculator is a tool for helping you find that amount.
Like prefixes, suffixes are usually one syllable but can sometimes be more than 1. Common suffixes include ""s,"" ""ed,"" and ""ing,"" as in ""computers,"" ""computed,"" and ""computing.""

, If your word has both a prefix and suffix, you should have two lines drawn in your word so far.


For example: ""re | wind | ing.""
If your suffix has more than one vowel, follow the same rule as with prefixes. If vowels have consonants between them, draw a line after the first consonant that follows your first vowel. For example: flex | ib | le.
Some words don't have prefixes or suffixes. If your word does not have a suffix, do not draw a line.

, If there are two separate words have been put together, draw a line between them.


For example: ""tree | house"" or ""water | slide.""

, If you have a section of letters with multiple vowels that are separated by consonants, divide it so that there is at least one vowel in each segment.


For example: ""comput | ing"" would be broken up into ""com | put | ing.""

, Pause every time you get to a line. This should help you audibly separate your word into smaller chunks.

While watching shows with words that you may not understand, use a notebook and pen to write the word as you think it's spelled, then find its correct spelling later and find out what the word means.
Do not rely on subtitles in your native language when watching a TV series or movie. If subtitles are displayed in your language, you will not learn the English.
Instead, select English subtitles, if available.

, In order to build both your written and spoken vocabulary, practice saying the words out loud

, Spend some time in writing essays, article contributions, blogs, chat posts, etc.


If writing such works seems a busy thing, try to write journal in English language.

, You will develop confidence in speaking English if you are comfortable to do so. Communicating in English can boost your confidence.

, There are many possibilities to get to know such individuals online. BUT be careful when talking or getting friends with others in the internet.

, Have pocket dictionaries. Or if you find it nerdy when you bring dictionary, install dictionary and thesaurus apps on your phone.

, Preferably learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) phonetic notation. The IPA is a set of symbols that represent sounds of letters in English. Be familiar with IPA so that when you don't know the pronunciation of a word, it will be easy for you how to pronounce it.

,, If you are not sure about your English, don't hesitate to ask someone if your English is wrong.

If you cannot take a class, try to find an online language acquisition program.;
, Find a dictionary or online app that offers translations of words from your native language to English and from English to your native language. This can help you in the early stages of learning English as you master your vocabulary acquisition.

, Once you have a basic understanding of the way that English works, spend some time expanding your vocabulary.You may want to find English flashcards in your language.


If you feel that you have a mastery of everyday vocabulary words but wish to learn more, try finding some advanced vocabulary flashcards, such as those used by American students studying for the GRE, an exam required for entrance into graduate school.
Reading in English and circling words that you’re unfamiliar with, then looking up the words and making an effort incorporate them into your vocabulary is a great way to increase your vocabulary.

, Many public libraries offer resources for English Language Learners. They may even host free classes for community members who wish to improve their language fluency. This is more common in areas with a large community of language learners. The library also may have books or audio books that you can check out for free.

, The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) can help you learn how to pronounce words that you see in writing but don’t know how to say. The book should provide a guide to interpreting the IPA symbols, but you can also find videos online that tell you how to say each of the IPA letter sounds., Try to find a mix of more and less formal writing, so you can get a sense of both formal and conversational English.If there is an English newspaper available in your area, pick one up every day and read through it. This will give you a source for learning new words and common sentence structures on a daily basis.
Also try reading novels in English. If you find that novels are challenging, try finding books meant for children or young adults, then build up to more complex works.
Circle words that are unfamiliar, look them up, and write the definition in the margins of the paper or book. Then try to use a few of the new words in English conversation.

, English news reports are a great way to begin exposing yourself to English because reporters frequently speak clearly without any significant accent.However, diversifying the types of English videos you watch can help you develop fluency in conversational English so that you do not sound overly formal or stiff in your speech.Watch movies. Movies that are directed towards children or teens may have less complex vocabulary and sentence structures and may be easier if you are just developing proficiency.TV shows may be a good option as well because they are shorter than movies and can give you a sense of comic timing and humor, which can be part of fluency as well.
Turn on subtitles for anything you watch if they are available. Watching the words while you hear them can improve your pronunciation and vocabulary.

, YouTube and other video streaming sites have a nearly endless supply of videos in English. If you wish to improve your work-related English fluency, be sure to watch videos in your specific field so that you can master the vocabulary and details unique to your professional needs.

, You need to practice speaking English to build fluency, so having a friend who is also learning English will give you both the opportunity to learn and practice together.Alternatively, you could try to find a native English speaker who wishes to learn your native language and work out an exchange deal (see below).

, Having access to a dictionary that offers clear definitions of unfamiliar words can help you understand words and figure out how to use them in the appropriate context.Most dictionaries will provide the word, a pronunciation guide, a definition, and the plural form of the word, which can usually be made by adding an –s, but can also take on unusual form such as –es, -en, or changing the vowel from –us to –a, depending upon the origin of the word.

"
Learn how words work.,
Brush up on your grammar.,
Study suffixes and prefixes.,
Study other languages.",How to Coin a Word1," Words act as signifiers for the object or concept that they are describing. Therefore, in order for a word to have any meaning, it has to be related to some form of object or idea. This relation can be specific or vague. For example “tree” calls to mind the concept of a tree, but could refer to any type of tree. The word “tree” itself is not descriptive in any way of what a tree looks like or any other characteristic of a tree, but it is attached to the meaning and thus will always recall the idea of a tree in the reader’s mind.


Words you create will necessarily need to connect to an idea, object, or action in order to make sense. This connection is built through context, or how you use the word and how it is affected by the words around it.;
, In order to create a convincingly real word, it will need to be grammatically correct. The grammar of your sentence will help provide the context for your meaning. Decide what part of speech your word belongs to. Is it a noun, referring to a person, place or thing? Is it a verb, describing an action? Is it an adjective, a word that describes a noun? Is it an adverb, a word describing an action?


Knowing where your word fits into grammatical structure will help you build convincing sentences with it.

, Many of the words in the English language come from adding a suffix or prefix to an existing word. Try adding a suffix or prefix to a word you wish to modify.


Add a “-tastic” to the end of a word to imply that something was fantastic, either genuinely or sarcastically. For example, after going to see a concert, you could say that it was “rocktastic”.
Create an adjective by adding “y” to a noun. For example: “It had a newspapery feel to it.”

, Many English words are derived from foreign languages. Taking concepts from foreign words can give your word a more credible and “realistic” feel. Latin and German are two very good languages to investigate when looking for base words.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes.",How to Learn English," The absolute best way to learn any new language is just to speak it. It doesn't matter if you only know five English words or if you're practically fluent -- speaking English with another person is the fastest, most effective method of improving.


Don't wait until you ""feel more comfortable"" speaking in English -- you probably won't reach that level for a long time, so push yourself outside of your comfort zone and start speaking English today. You' ll be amazed at how quickly your language skills improve.
Find a native English speaker who is willing to spend some time speaking English with you -- you may be able to offer them a language exchange, where they spend 30 minutes speaking English with you and you spend 30 minutes speaking your native language with them.
If you live in an English-speaking country, you can practice by starting simple conversations with the people you meet, whether it's saying ""hello"" to a shopkeeper or asking a stranger for directions.;
, Even if you have an acceptable grasp of the English language, with good grammar and an extensive vocabulary, native English speakers may find you very difficult to understand if you don't work on your pronunciation.


Correct, clear pronunciation is essential if you really want to improve your level of English. Listen closely to how native English speakers pronounce certain words and sounds and do your best to copy them.
Pay particular attention to any sounds that you are unfamiliar with or that do not exist in your native tongue. For example some people have difficulty pronouncing the ""r"" sound, as it does not exist in their native language, while other people have difficulty with certain consonant clusters, such as the ""th"" sound.
Be aware that the pronunciation of certain English words varies greatly depending on the part of the world it's spoken in. For example, American English is very different from British English. If you intend to travel to or live in an English-speaking country, this is something you should take into account when learning how to pronounce certain words.

, The wider your vocabulary and the more English phrases you learn, the easier speaking English will become.


Again, spending time with native English speakers will help you to pick up on common vocabulary and phrases in a natural way. Although reading, watching English TV and listening to the news is also beneficial.
Once you have learned a new word or phrase, you should make an effort to use it in a sentence -- this is the best way to commit it to memory.
Another easy way to commit new words to memory is to make labels for everyday household items and stick them around your house or apartment. Then every time you use the kettle or look in the mirror, you will see the English word for these items staring back at you.
You should also start a notebook of idiomatic phrases that English speakers use all the time. Some examples include ""it's raining cats and dogs"" (raining heavily), to be on ""cloud nine"" (to be very happy) or saying something is a ""piece of cake"" (when something is very easy). Sprinkling these kinds of phrases into your conversation will bring your level of English up several notches.

, Another great way to incorporate some extra English conversation into your weekly routine is to sign up for a class of discussion group.


Attending an English class is a great way to focus on some of the more formal aspects of speaking English. A class will teach you the grammatically correct way of speaking -- which includes proper sentence structure and verb conjugation and will generally provide a very structured approach to language learning.
Attending a discussion group is a more informal and relaxed way of learning English, where the emphasis is more on communication and relationship building than on speaking ""correct"" English. Speaking English in this setting can help you to become more comfortable with speaking in front of other people.
Both of these language-learning settings have their pros and cons, so it's best to do both if you can!

, Carrying an English dictionary with you at all times (whether it's an actual book or a phone app) can be very useful.


Having a dictionary means that you will never be stuck for a word. It can save you a lot of embarrassment if you're having a conversation with an English-speaker and forget a word in the middle of the sentence -- all you have to do is take a second to look it up!
Aside from saving you awkwardness, looking up the word you need then immediately using it in a sentence will actually help you to commit the new vocabulary to memory.
It is also helpful to have a dictionary to peruse throughout the day during private moments, like when you're sitting on the train, waiting to cross the street or just having a cup of coffee. You could learn an extra 20 to 30 English words per day using this technique!
As a beginner, you should start with an English dictionary that provides definitions in your native language. However, once your language skills improve, you should switch to using an English-English dictionary, which provides English definitions for English words.

, One of the best ways to improve your English listening comprehension is to download English-language podcasts or radio apps on your phone or MP3 player.


You should then make an effort to listen to the podcasts or radio shows for at least 30 minutes per day. Do it in the gym, on your commute to work, or while you're sitting at your computer.
Make an effort to understand what's being said, don't just let the English wash over you. Even if you find it too fast, try to pick out key words and phrases to get a general idea of what the conversation is about.
If you can, make a note of any words or phrases that you don't understand and look up the translation afterwards. Then listen to the podcast or show again to hear the new words or phrases in context.

, Another fun way to improve your listening comprehension is to watch English movies and TV shows.


Try to pick movies or TV shows that you will enjoy -- this will make the exercise feel like less of a chore. If possible, choose movies or shows that you are already familiar with, such as children's cartoons or blockbuster films. If you already know the basic story you will find the language much easier to pick up on.
However, you should avoid watching movies or television shows with subtitles in your native language -- they will only distract you and make you less inclined to focus on understanding the English, which is the whole point of the exercise.

, Reading is an essential part of learning a new language, so don't forget to practice!


Find something you are really interested in -- whether that's a famous English novel, The New York Times or a fashion magazine and start working your way through it. If you find the content boring, you will be less inclined to persevere with it.
Again, make an active effort to actually understand what you're reading, don't just skim over it. Highlight any words or phrases that you don't understand, then look them up in the dictionary.
If you're alone, you could also try reading aloud -- this will allow you to improve your reading comprehension while also working on your pronunciation.

, Aside from reading and listening comprehension, you should also spend some time working on your written English.


This may be one of the most difficult aspects of your language learning, but it is important nevertheless. Writing in English will help you to work on your sentence structure, grammar and spelling.
Try keeping an English diary in which you write down a few sentences every day. It doesn't have to be deeply personal -- you could write about the weather, what you ate for dinner or what your plans are for the day.
If you feel comfortable with it, get a native speaker to look over what you've written and check it for any errors. This will help you to avoid making the same mistakes over and over again.

, Once your written language skills have improved, you could consider getting an English-speaking pen-pal!


Having an English-speaking pen-pal combines your English writing practice with the excitement of getting a letter or email!
Your pen pal may be someone who is learning English like you, or they may be a native English speaker who wants to practice their foreign language skills by writing to you in your native tongue.
Having a pen pal from an English-speaking country (such as the United States, Britain, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, for example) will also allow you to learn more about the culture and what life is like in that part of the world.

, When learning any new language, it is important to stay motivated and never give up on your goal of fluency.


Stay committed to your language-learning goal by reminding yourself of how badly you want to achieve it. Think of all of the amazing experiences and opportunities that will be available to you once you've mastered the English language.
You will be able to converse with English speakers from across the world and develop new and exciting relationships, you will be able to engage with English-speaking culture like never before and potentially further your career as a result of your new language skills.

, If you want to to gain fluency quickly, you need to commit to practicing every day.


Learning a new language is based on repetition, so if you wait too long between study sessions, you will forget everything you learned previously and have to start all over again, wasting valuable time.
However, you shouldn't study so much that you grow sick of English -- try to keep things interesting by completing a different task each day - one day of reading, one day of listening comprehension, one day of writing practice, one day studying grammar, etc.
However, you should never pass up an opportunity to practice speaking English, as this is the number one most important thing you can do to gain fluency.

, One way to make the transition from being very good at English to being fluent is to train your brain to actually think in the English language.


Constantly translating from your native language into English and back again inside your head consumes time and energy. Every language has its own nuances and peculiarities, which makes it impossible to accurately translate from one language to another in certain instances.
As a result, your spoken and written English will flow much more naturally and fluently if you can just train your brain to think in English. Think of it like a switch -- when it's time to communicate in English, you need to turn your English brain on and your mother language brain off!

, One of the greatest tests of a person's fluency in a second language is to put them in a room with a bunch of native speakers and see if they can follow and contribute to the conversation.


The best way to achieve this level of fluency is to make some English-speaking friends and hang out with them in a social setting, like in a cafe or bar.
This way, you will be forced to speak in English if you want to interact with your peers, but it won't feel like work or study because you'll be having so much fun!

, The biggest obstacle that stands in the way of learning a new language is the fear of making mistakes.


This fear serves no purpose -- it is merely a hindrance that prevents you from reaching your goal of fluency.
Don't be afraid of making a mistake and don't be shy! Of course you can't speak a new language perfectly at the start. Try to express yourself albeit with difficulty.
Remember that everyone makes mistakes when they are learning a new language -- it's a rite of passage. You will almost certainly have your fair share of awkward or embarrassing moments when you accidentally say something rude or incorrect, but this is all part of the fun.
Also remember that you are not aiming for perfection when learning to speak English, you are aiming for progress. Making mistakes is all part of the learning process, they will help you to become better, so embrace them!

Think outside of the box.",How to Improve Your English," Grab that pad of Post-Its you have laying around that you rarely ever use and start labeling the things around you. Even if you already know the simple stuff, do it anyway. Just thinking of these things in English before you think of it in your native tongue will get you thinking faster and when it takes less effort, you'll feel the progress you're making.


Try to get to the point where you think of these things in English without hesitation. Sit down on your bed and go through all the labels in your house in your head. If there's something you can't remember, get up and go check what it is. And when you've hit this level, label other stuff! Graduate from ""window"" to ""window pane,' from ""couch"" to ""cushion,"" from ""shirt"" to ""cotton blouse."" With English, there's always another level!;
, As you go about your day, there's bound to be some English words that you run into that you don't fully understand. This is when you whip out your handy dandy notebook! Scribble down the word and then when you go home, you can look it up. Instead of thinking, ""Gosh, what was that word I saw on the menu at the cafe?"" you'll flip right to the page and learn a new word!


If that's a little 2003 for you, just whip out your smartphone. Start a note (or whatever app you want to use) that's dedicated to new English words. Then every so often you can refer back to it and make sure you remember them all!

, If you have a few friends who are great at speaking English, hang out with them! Invite them over to dinner! So, your home becomes an English hub. Find a tutor to do some one-on-one with. Do a language exchange, where you can teach them your language and they can teach you theirs. Immerse yourself in it as much as you can!


What it boils down to is that you must avoid your native language as much as possible. It's tempting to get home from work and sit down, turn on your TV, and revert back to your native tongue with those you live with. Don't do it! Set time aside to speak English every night, even if it's just for an hour. Keep the TV to English, keep the radio to English, keep everything to English as much as possible.

, They are attractive, they tend to have many short articles or simple plot lines, and they come in many subjects (science, literature, self-improvement). But more importantly, they are well-illustrated. The pictures will allow you to understand many words without having to use a dictionary. You'll go faster and get more enjoyment out of it!


When it comes to books, after you get to know the characters and the vocabulary used in the series, your reading gets easier and you will begin to be able to read more quickly, while still picking up expressions and vocabulary from one volume to the next. Try Nancy Drew, Animorphs, Sweet Valley Twins or any of a number of other easy series books which are widely available in libraries.

If your level is above that, read anything. There's young adult fiction and plain ol' fiction that can up your language-learning skills and envelop you in a whole new world. It's best to choose something with a lot of dialogue -- it's more like real life!



, Everyone has their own learning style. Some people learn with their hands, some with their eyes, some with their ears, and some are a combination of the three. Your best friend may be able to recite English poetry after hearing it once when you need to see it to understand. Once you figure out how you learn, you can cater your studying habits to your abilities.


And what's more, you can stop wasting time on methods that don't work for you. If your teacher talks and talks and you remember nothing, you can start taking notes. If you're reading a book and can't remember a thing, you can start reading it aloud to yourself. There's ways around everything!

, Even English speakers could stand to learn root words! Since there are so many words in this dang language (around 750,000 in certain methods of counting-- way more than other comparable languages), learning root words can help cut you to the chase. When you see it, if you know the root word, you may not even have to look it up!


Let's say you run into the sentence, ""It was an acephaleous society."" You're thinking, ""Uhh...what the heck?!"" But back up. Think about it for a second. You know that ""a-"" means without: amoral, asexual, asymmetrical. You know that ""cephal"" means ""head"": encephalitis, encephalogram. And you know that ""-ous"" marks an adjective: ambitious, delicious, glamorous. All of a sudden you know that that means, ""It was a society without a head, without a leader."" Boom! Who needs a dictionary? Not you.

, Some newspapers use more complex language than others, so choose the right one for you. Remember that you can start with the headlines and then progress to reading the articles as you gain confidence. You can go at your own pace and pick the articles that are interesting. At least read the comics!


If you have friends who are learning too, turn it into a discussion! Have everyone bring an article they found interesting and talk about it -- in English, of course. You can study and talk about the happenings of the world simultaneously!

, If you haven't had half a dozen teachers that have told you this, you were probably taught by robots. Making mistakes is crucial. If you don't, you won't learn what's right and wrong, you won't take risks, and you won't truly grasp the concepts you're learning. It's unfortunate, it is, but it's necessary.


This is why most people stop learning and plateau. They're afraid to talk to native speakers, they're afraid to go outside their comfort zone, they're afraid to truly expand and grow. Can you imagine if Edison would've stopped at his first mistake?!

, Television and films are good too, but it's better if you have something you can watch over and over and over and over. You can really get down the content, start noticing things you never noticed before, and your brain can relax instead of flailing about, trying to keep up. Ask some friends if they have a series you can borrow!


Thanks to satellite TV, British, American and Australian television programmes and films are widely available all over the world. Try recording them! Watch with subtitles at first and then without them as you gain confidence. The better you get, the more you'll look forward to ""studying.""

, The BBC World Service is just one excellent source of spoken English and even broadcasts programs for learners. Have it on in the background while you go about doing your household tasks. Just streaming English all the time can help you learn it passively. You don't have to sit down and stare at your radio -- just let it soak in!


Radio a little too old-fashioned? You've no excuse -- there's internet radio, too, you know! There are podcasts on virtually every subject and the classics like NPR and ""This American Life"" can all be found online.

, You can listen to the radio online, watch TV clips, read articles, and even play games to improve your English. You can even chat with people! There are also many pages on the web dedicated to teaching English as a foreign language. Real people are better, but the Internet is still a great tool.


Both the BBC and Wikipedia have versions of their site aimed at ESL learners. But there are also dozens of other websites that offer worksheets, articles, word problems, and stories that are at graded levels, too.

, If you're not in a class or don't have a native speaker at your disposal, it may seem pretty hard to get better at writing. How do you know if you're doing it correctly? Simple! Use websites that will correct your work! Search through Google to find websites that assist in correcting your grammar - many which are free of charge. Again, no excuses!


It's easy to forget about the writing skill. But doing this, too, as much as you can, will make serious waves in your improvements. Write your emails in English, write yourself notes in English, write your blog in English. Even if you can't correct it, make it habit.

, Not only is it fun, but you will learn words and pronunciation. And new music! Pick one each day and study it until you know it by heart. Find a genre that appeals to you and choose some songs that don't go too fast -- hardcore rap is not a good place to start when it comes to learning English! Think the Beatles, Michael Buble, Elvis, or even musical theatre.


This can be a substitution to listening to the radio. Have the songs you've been learning playing in the background and sing along! And then, who knows, maybe you'll find yourself at karaoke next weekend!

, Rosetta Stone can cost a pretty penny, but it's useful. Some even offer accessibility to a native speaker! But that's not the only kid on the block -- there's Pimsleur and Michel Thomas as well, just to name two more. Each advocates a different type of learning -- which one would work best for you?


Ask around if anyone in your circle has these CDs already. There's no point in paying for them twice! And some of the stuff can be found online, too. You just gotta get a little creative!

, Seriously. Take every tiny opportunity. If you live in an English speaking country then this is easier, but if not then you can talk to visitors. Don't be shy, and don't worry about making mistakes - just have a go! Even saying, ""A cup of coffee to go, please,"" will help remove your nerves for when a true debate breaks out!


You can create opportunities, too! If you see someone you think speaks English that's taking a photo, ask them if they'd like you to take it for them. If you go to a restaurant that has an English menu, ask for it. It's these little things that truly set mediocre English speakers apart from the more natural ones!

, The same way we all have styles of learning, we all have times that are better for us, too. Your morning class may be a good class, but you can't pay attention because your brain is just getting out of bed and brushing its teeth. Notice when you're most alert -- and then take that time out of your day to study!


Most people will have periods of heightened alertness in the late morning and then in the evening, though this doesn't go for everyone. If you can, rework your schedule so your intake of English falls into the time when your brain can take the most advantage of it.

, That stands for the International Phonetic Alphabet, by the way. Seriously. It may seem like a lot of work, but it'll be so useful and so handy once you know it. You can look up a word in any dictionary and know exactly how it's pronounced. You can see the differences between American, British, and Australian English. You can look at your own pronunciation and see what vowels you're actually making. And it's fascinating!


ɪts ˈlikia ə ˈsikrəte koʊd! (It's like a secret code!) Pass notes with your friends! But remember, each accent is slightly different. If you run into a weird pronunciation, take note of whether it's general American, RP, or other.

, You probably know how it should sound, but how does it sound when the words come out of your mouth? Probably a bit different. So record yourself! Then you can go back and notice your strengths and weaknesses. It's a little hard listening to your own voice at first (you may feel self-conscious), but it does go away. And it's a surefire way to see your progress!


Take the time to learn pronunciation patterns. Because English is a conglomeration of a bunch of languages, there's no hard and fast rule, but there are general patterns. Two syllable verbs have a stress on the second syllable (project), whereas 2 syllable nouns (project) and adjectives (happy) stress the first. And, in general, the stress goes on the ante-penultimate syllable (though this isn't always true): photographer, continuous, national, et cetera. Does your speech mirror this?

, If you're lucky enough to be in an English class, supplement your main one with another that's of a different style. In a group class? Take a one-on-one thing. In a speaking class? Take a writing. Worried about pronunciation? Take an accent-reduction class. Practicing different skills in different environments is the only (and quickest) way to get better.


If that's not an option, get creative. Start a study group or meet up with a friend for some one-on-one or small group conversation time. Get a penpal or use Skype. There are other ways besides classes (that often cost money) to get your English fix!

, Sometimes opportunities have to be created. And sometimes those opportunities might seem a little contrived or make you feel silly, but they're worth it! Here are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing:


Call up customer service about any product -- one you have or one you don't. Ask them about their products, their services, their plans, your options if you're interested, and just make conversation. For free!
Host a dinner for tourists! Advertise that you'll offer an authentic meal in exchange for English conversation. Many tourists are looking for something a bit off the beaten path. That path could lead to your dinner table!
Start a club. You'd be surprised how many people are in your exact situation. You can avoid the costs of a class by banding together with a few people and pooling your resources. Meet at the same time at the same place every week and you may start attracting attention!

Speak in English.,
Repeat what you hear native speakers say.,
Use a conversation exchange website.,
Listen to other people speaking English.,
Think in English.",How to Develop Fluency in English2," Developing fluency requires constant and consistent practice speaking aloud.It is best if you can speak with native English speakers, but if you cannot, speak with whoever is available to you. You can even talk to yourself aloud in English.Immersing yourself fully in English is the best way to become fluent., Repeat sentences of native speakers, focusing on pronunciation, cadence, and rhythm. Record yourself speaking and play it back to give yourself the opportunity to evaluate whether your repetition sounds the same as the original.Remember to think about both what words the native speaker chooses and how they use the language.

, A conversation exchange website is like a matchmaking service for language learners.The website will match you with a native English speaker who is seeking to learn your native language. Through video or audio chats, you can have conversations in each language and give each other immediate feedback and tips.


This type of exchange is best when done on a regular schedule, as frequently as possible. Find someone who has a similar schedule to yours and who is similarly committed to developing fluency.

, Particularly if you are living in an area with English speakers, listening to other people’s public conversations can frequently be a good way to practice your English comprehension and fluency.Notice things such as the rhythm of their speech, cues for when one speaker is finished talking and the other begins, and how questions and answers are posed., This may be tricky, but practicing forming thoughts in English can help you almost as much as speaking in English.Try narrating your day in English. For example, you may think to yourself, “I am walking out of my door. I see a stray cat on the street. I need to get on the correct bus and go to work now” in English rather than your native language.

"
"
Travel to an English speaking area.,
Speak only English.,
Ask people to refrain from speaking other languages.,
Be confident.",How to Develop Fluency in English3," While a country whose primary language is English is ideal, there are English-speaking communities in other countries as well. Find such a community or country and stay there for an extended period of time; the longer you stay, the more proficient your language fluency will become., Even when you are unsure of exactly what to say all of the time, find a way to communicate only in English. Not giving yourself the option to “fall back” on your native language will help you become proficient in English more quickly and understand the system of the language more fully., If you are attempting an English immersion in a country that is not primarily English speaking, ask those around you to speak to you in English whenever possible.


This can be tricky if you are attempting language immersion at home, but your family may benefit from the immersion experience as well; try to make it a fun learning experience for everyone!

, If you let go of your fear of “messing up” the language and focus instead on just communicating and getting to know people, you’re more likely to be successful."
"
Use the correct article.,
Pay attention to prepositions.,
Choose the correct adjective order.,
Resist the thesaurus.,
Memorize irregular verbs.",How to Develop Fluency in English4," There are two types of articles in the English language: definite and indefinite. ""The"" is a definite article and refers to one specific thing. ""A"" and ""an"" are indefinite articles and refer to a general noun.If you are referring to any dog at all, say ""a dog."" If you are referring to one particular dog, say ""the dog.""
Use ""an"" instead of ""a"" if the noun that follows begins with a vowel sound, as with ""I would like an apple"" or ""I will be there in an hour.""

, One mark of a non-native speaker is the incorrect use of prepositions (words such as on, to, in, among, and around). If you wish to speak as fluently as a native speaker, pay careful attention to how these short words are used by native speakers.Unfortunately, the rules about when to use a particular preposition are inconsistent. For example, it is common to say either “I’m waiting for the train” or “I’m waiting on the train,” but you cannot always exchange “on” and “for,” as with “I have a meeting on Monday.”

, Not all adjectives are treated equally in English, and native speakers tend to place adjectives in a certain order before the noun they modify.

The typical arrangement is: article, judgement, size, shape, age, color, nationality, material.(However, it is best to limit the number of adjectives for a single noun to 2-3).
For example, you would say ""I have an old brown dog"" or ""I drive a rusty, box-shaped, 20-year-old American truck.""

, A thesaurus can be tempting if you feel that your vocabulary is limited, but often synonyms listed in a thesaurus may relate to an alternative form of the word you are replacing.If you must use a thesaurus, be sure to look up the word you select in a quality dictionary to be sure that it is an acceptable substitute for your original word.

, In English, the regular verbs are relatively easy to master, but the irregular verb forms are much more difficult. It is best to simply memorize these verb conjugations.Searching for lists of common irregular verbs and making lists or flashcards for yourself may help you master their forms."
"
Identify your theme and tone.,
Make a word that is recognizable.,
Define your word.,
Repeat your word.",How to Coin a Word2," When creating new words to describe fictional settings, take your theme and tone into account. Your newly created words should sound natural to the world that they inhabit. Foreign words can help to foster atmosphere, depending on the language:


Germanic languages are rough sounding, and have a guttural feel to them. Using Germanic-based words for tough characters can make them sound hardy. Using Germanic language for evil characters will give them a bestial quality.
Romance languages are light and airy, and can give your characters a seductive quality. Naming locations with a French- or Italian-based word will create a sense of exoticism.
Use Latin-based words to add a scientific feel. Latin evokes wisdom, and so Latin-based words can also imply intelligence. Latin is also an ancient language, and can be used to add mysticism.
Asian languages make good base words for exotic sounding locations and objects.
Use other languages as a basis for the sound and feel of the word you are creating. Avoid copying a word directly and instead use it as a guide.

, A successful word is one that the reader won’t trip over too hard. Try to relate the word to some recognizable concepts. For example, using the made-up word “bogmouth” to refer to a mouth condition gives the reader a general sense of what the character with bogmouth is experiencing. This is because the word “bog” is familiar, and evokes a similar feeling in most readers.

, Writing out an official definition for your word will help you to use it properly. Format your definition as it would appear in a dictionary, and list out any other forms the word can take. This can be especially useful if you are writing a piece with multiple made up words, both as a reference for you and for your reader.

, If you want your new word to stick in the readers’ minds and become second-nature to them, it needs to appear multiple times in your writing. Studies show that readers will understand a new word after reading it ten times with context.This means that your word needs to be supported by the language around it to provide the reader with clues on how the word is used and what it means.

"
"
Understand the concepts of slang.,
Truncate a word.,
Try verbing a word.,
Spread your new slang word.",How to Coin a Word3," Slang rises out of communities of speakers or writers as shorthand for objects, actions, and concepts. It is a method of exclusion, as only insiders will be able to understand the slang terms.


Slang starts as insider language, but can grow outside of that subculture if it becomes popular enough.
Slang is constantly evolving, and words and phrases can fall out of favor very rapidly. This is especially true if the slang begins to spread outside of the initial culture in which it was created. Avoid creating slang that is based off terms that are no longer in common use, as it will give your creation an archaic feel.

, This is when you cut off a portion of the word, either at the beginning or the end. Mash two truncated words together to form new compounds. You can combine this with adding prefixes or suffixes to create almost entirely new words.


For example, instead of saying “all right,” the words can be truncated and mashed together to form the word “aight.”

, This is simply taking a noun and making it into a verb. For example, the word “text” is traditionally read as a noun, but can now also be used as a verb referring to sending a text message.


Another example of verbing is the word “party.” Originally, it was a noun describing a gathering of people. Now, it also means to engage in the act celebrating, usually with drinking connotations. The context of the word dictates how it is interpreted.
The word gun is a noun, but can be used as a verb when you “gun someone down.” Verbing a noun can add spice and drama to an otherwise bland sentence.
Experiment with nouns to find one that works well with the verbing process. Not every noun can be verbed, but you can create a powerful and memorable sentence when you find on that can.

, Slang grows outward from peers, so in order for your slang term to work, it needs to be spoken and in use. Use it in conversation, but don’t necessarily give away that you’re using a new word. Let your peers infer the meaning through the context of what you’re saying. This will build credibility for your word.

You should strive for fluency, in any phrases and sentences you are learning, right from the start.,
Any time you learn a new word or expression, you should quickly create a construction that features it.,
Use construction branching.,
Create your own iterations and branches (with two related targets filled-in) from any desired core construction, forcing yourself to make it a part of your vocabulary.

",How to Become Fluent in English Using Constructions," This is true for anyone learning any language. There is no special level you need to attain before developing fluency.;
,


In linguistics, a construction is a fill-in-the-blank phrase which features the use of a target word or expression.
Ex. 1: Yesterday, I went to the _____ . (bank, store, mall, library, doctor)

The student then says each version out loud to become fluent in this phrasing:
Yesterday, I went to the bank.
Yesterday, I went to the store.
Yesterday, I went to the mall.
Yesterday, I went to the library.
Yesterday, I went to the doctor.


Ex. 2. The suffix “ish” in English denotes the idea of “approximately.” As in, “How old is that kid?” – “I don't know. Fifteen-ish?” To practice it, here's a construction you might make:
The movie started at _____-ish. (six, seven, eight, nine)
Again, the student is to say each version out loud:

The movie started at six-ish.
The movie started at seven-ish.
The movie started at eight-ish.
The movie started at nine-ish.


Ex. 3. The expression, “to make money hand over fist” means, “to make a lot of money.” Here's a construction you might use to practice it:

_______ was making money hand over fist. (Starbucks, Google, The guy selling soft drinks, Bill Gates, Apple) Say the phrase with each target word.


Ex 4. Sometimes the construction will require two blanks, instead of just one. For example: The expression “a rip-off” means, “an unfair deal”. This construction will require filling-in two blanks with two target phrases:
_____ for ______ is a rip-off!

$7 … a cup of coffee
$500 ... the new i-Phone
$25 ... a haircut
$40 ... this T-shirt
$20,000 ... a used Camry



, Construction branching is the process of creating a new construction by adding a word or two to the original target. For example, if this is your original construction:I really like _____ . (pizza, dancing, to travel, this TV show, the Beatles):


A possible construction branch might be created from the first target iteration:

I really like ____ pizza. (mom's, this, their, Antonio's, New York)


Or from the second...

I really like ______ dancing. (ballroom, Latin, hip-hop, square)

Start with the standard form of a general quadratic equation.,
Subtract c{\displaystyle c} from both sides.,
Divide both sides by a{\displaystyle a}.,
Complete the square.,
Write the right side under a common denominator.,
Take the square root of each side.,
Isolate x{\displaystyle x} by subtracting b2a{\displaystyle {\frac {b}{2a}}} from both sides.,
Write the right side under a common denominator.",How to Derive the Quadratic Formula," While any equation with an x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term in it qualifies as quadratic, the standard form sets everything to 0. Remember that a,b,c{\displaystyle a,b,c} are coefficients that can be any real number, so don't substitute any numbers in for them - we want to work with the general form.


ax2+bx+c=0{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0}

The only condition is that a≠0,{\displaystyle a\neq 0,} because otherwise, the equation reduces to a linear equation. See if you can find general solutions for the special cases where b=0{\displaystyle b=0} and where c=0.{\displaystyle c=0.}
;
, Our goal is to isolate x.{\displaystyle x.} To start, we move one of the coefficients to the other side, so that the left side only consists of terms with x{\displaystyle x} in it.


ax2+bx=−c{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx=-c}


, Note that we could've switched this and the previous step, and still arrived at the same place. Remember that dividing a polynomial by something means that you divide each of the individual terms. Doing so makes it easier for us to complete the square.


x2+bax=−ca{\displaystyle x^{2}+{\frac {b}{a}}x={\frac {-c}{a}}}


, Recall that the goal is to rewrite an expression x2+2◻x+◻2{\displaystyle x^{2}+2\Box x+\Box ^{2}} as (x+◻)2,{\displaystyle (x+\Box )^{2},} where ◻{\displaystyle \Box } is any coefficient. It may not immediately be obvious to you that we can do this. To see it more clearly, rewrite bax{\displaystyle {\frac {b}{a}}x} as 2b2ax{\displaystyle 2{\frac {b}{2a}}x} by multiplying the term by 22.{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{2}}.} We can do this because multiplying by 1 does not change anything. Now we can clearly see that in our case, ◻=b2a,{\displaystyle \Box ={\frac {b}{2a}},} so we are only missing the ◻2{\displaystyle \Box ^{2}} term. Therefore, in order to complete the square, we add that to both sides - namely, (b2a)2=b24a2.{\displaystyle \left({\frac {b}{2a}}\right)^{2}={\frac {b^{2}}{4a^{2}}}.} Then, of course, we factor.


x2+2b2ax+b24a2=b24a2−ca(x+b2a)2=b24a2−ca{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x^{2}+2{\frac {b}{2a}}x+{\frac {b^{2}}{4a^{2}}}&={\frac {b^{2}}{4a^{2}}}-{\frac {c}{a}}\\\left(x+{\frac {b}{2a}}\right)^{2}&={\frac {b^{2}}{4a^{2}}}-{\frac {c}{a}}\end{aligned}}}

Here, it is clear why a≠0,{\displaystyle a\neq 0,} since a{\displaystyle a} is in the denominator, and you cannot divide by 0.

If you need to, you can expand the left side to confirm that completing the square works.


, Here, we want both denominators to be 4a2,{\displaystyle 4a^{2},} so multiply the −ca{\displaystyle {\frac {-c}{a}}} term by 4a4a.{\displaystyle {\frac {4a}{4a}}.}


(x+b2a)2=b24a2−4ac4a2=b2−4ac4a2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left(x+{\frac {b}{2a}}\right)^{2}&={\frac {b^{2}}{4a^{2}}}-{\frac {4ac}{4a^{2}}}\\&={\frac {b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}


, However, it is essential that you recognize that in doing so, you are actually doing two steps. When you take the square root of d2,{\displaystyle d^{2},} you do not get d.{\displaystyle d.} You actually get its absolute value, |d|.{\displaystyle |d|.} This absolute value is critical in getting both roots - simply putting square roots over both sides will only get you one of the roots. 


|x+b2a|=b2−4ac4a2{\displaystyle \left|x+{\frac {b}{2a}}\right|={\sqrt {\frac {b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}}}}}

Now, we can get rid of the absolute value bars by putting a ±{\displaystyle \pm } on the right side. We can do this because the absolute value does not distinguish between positive and negative, so they are both valid. This tidbit is why the quadratic equation always gets you two roots. 


x+b2a=±b2−4ac4a2{\displaystyle x+{\frac {b}{2a}}=\pm {\sqrt {\frac {b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}}}}}



Let's simplify this expression a bit further. Since the square root of a quotient is the quotient of the square roots, we can write the right side as ±b2−4ac4a2.{\displaystyle {\frac {\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{\sqrt {4a^{2}}}}.} Then we can take the square root of the denominator. 


x+b2a=±b2−4ac2a{\displaystyle x+{\frac {b}{2a}}={\frac {\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}}




,


x=−b2a±b2−4ac2a{\displaystyle x={\frac {-b}{2a}}\pm {\frac {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}}}


, This nets the quadratic formula, the formula that solves any quadratic equation in standard form. This works for any a,b,c{\displaystyle a,b,c} and outputs an x{\displaystyle x} that can be real or complex. To confirm that this process works, simply follow the steps of this article in reverse order to recover standard form.


x=−b±b2−4ac2a{\displaystyle x={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}}

Don’t be alarmed at how complicating conjugation can get.",How to Conjugate the Verb to Be," When you give someone your name, you say “I am”. “I” is first person singular, so the verb that goes with “I” is “am”.;
, The plural of first person is “We.” So, if you were introducing yourself as a group, you would say “we are,” as “are” is the plural form of the verb.For example: “We are Steph and Jack.”

, If you did something yesterday, you would begin the sentence with “I was” as “was” is past tense.


For example: “I was dancing at the party yesterday.” “I was in Mexico last year.”

, To describe something you did with a friend or a group in the past, use “we were”.


For example: “We were fishing on the lake yesterday.”

, You use “will” for both the singular and the plural when you describe things you are going to do in the future.


For example: “I will learn how to fish next year.” “We will take dance lessons next month.”

, Second person is unique in that both the singular and plural versions are the same. In the present tense, you always use “are,” whether you are referring to a large group or just one person.For example: “You are a great person.” “We are going to Mexico.”

, For example: “You were at the concert.” “We were at the dance party.”

, For example: “I will be at the party tonight.” “We will be fishing on the lake tomorrow.”

, The third person singular form of “to be” for the present tense is “is”.For example: “She is a great dancer.” “Jack is an expert fisherman.”

, The verb that goes with “they” is “are”.


For example: “They are ready to dance.” “Steph and Jack are going to Mexico.”

, For example: “He was at the party.” “Steph was in Mexico last year.”

, For example: “They were dancing until 3 am last night.” ""Steph and Jack were dancing.""

, For example: “Jack will be on the beach tomorrow.” ""She will be on vacation.""


You use “will be” to also talk about the future in the third person plural. For example: “They will be arriving tomorrow.” “Steph and Jack will be in Mexico next week.”

, For example, you might say: “I have been eating for over an hour” to show that you continue to eat in the present. Or, you might say: “You had been finished eating for hours before I was done” to indicate that someone else had already completed the task, which is in the past tense., For example: “We will have eaten all the fruit by then so we need to buy more.”

, For example: “I have been waiting.” “You have been at the store for too long.”

, For example: “I had been finished hours ago.” “You had been asleep on the boat.” “He had been dancing at the party.”


You use “had been” to also describe the plural in the past perfect tense. For example: “We had been eating the fruit.”

, You use “were” as the verb for the imperfect subjunctive case.


For example: “I wish I were going to Mexico for Christmas”.

, Such as this sentence: “If you were taller, you could reach the top shelf.” You use “were” because the statement isn’t true--the person isn’t taller.


“Were” is used for the subjunctive in all conjugations. However, it does get confusing because you would use “was” if the statement could be true, as it is not subjunctive case anymore. For example, if Jack is a chocolate addict, then this statement could be true: “If Jack was around, that could be why the chocolate disappeared.”, When you start to look at cases like conditional present and perfect, conjugating verbs can get a bit more complicated. However, you can use the basic conjugations of the verb “to be” to talk to others and describe a situation effectively.

Take the square root of both sides.,
Isolate the variable.",How to Complete the Square," Let's say you're working with the following equation: 3x2 - 4x + 5.;
, To factor out a three from the first two terms, simply pull out a 3 and place it around a set of parenthesis around both terms, while dividing each term by 3. 3x2 divided by 3 is simply x2 and 4x divided by 3 is 4/3x. So, the new equation should look like this: 3(x2 - 4/3x) + 5. The 5 will remain outside of the equation because you did not divide it by 3.

, The second term, also known as the b term in the equation, is 4/3. Halve the second term, or divide it by 2 first. 4/3 ÷ 2, or 4/3 x 1/2, is equal to 2/3. Now, square this term by squaring both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. (2/3)2 = 4/9. Write this term down., You'll need this ""extra"" term to turn the first three terms in this equation into a perfect square. But you have to remember that you added it by subtracting it from the equation as well. Though obviously, it won't do you much good to simply combine the terms -- you'll be back where you started. The new equation should look like this: 3( x2 - 4/3 x + 4/9 - 4/9) + 5., Since you're working with a coefficient of 3 outside the parentheses, you can't just pull out the -4/9. You'll have to multiply it by 3 first. -4/9 x 3 = -12/9, or -4/3. If you're not working with an equation with a coefficient other than 1 over the x2 term, then you could skip this step.

, Right now, you're left with 3(x2 -4/3x +4/9) within the parentheses. You worked backwards to get the 4/9, which was really another way of finding the term that would complete the square. So, you can rewrite those terms like this: 3(x - 2/3)2. All you had to do was halve the second term and remove the third. You can check that this works by multiplying it out to see that it gives you the first three terms of the equation.3(x - 2/3)2 =






3(x - 2/3)(x -2/3) =
33(x2 - 4/3x + 4/9)

, You're left with two constant terms, or terms that aren't attached to a variable. Right now, you're left with 3(x - 2/3)2 - 4/3 + 5. All you have to do is add up -4/3 and 5 to get 11/3. You do this by setting them to the same denominator: -4/3 and 15/3, and then adding the numerators to get 11, and keeping the denominator as 3.


-4/3 + 15/3 = 11/3.







, You're all done. The final equation is 3(x - 2/3)2 + 11/3. You can remove the coefficient of 3 by dividing both parts of the equation to get (x - 2/3)2 + 11/9. You have now successfully placed the equation into vertex form, which is a( x - h )2 + k, where k represents the constant term.

, Let's say you're working with the following equation: 3x2 + 4x + 5 = 6

, The constant terms are any terms that aren't attached to a variable. In this case, you have 5 on the left side and 6 on the right side. You want to move 6 over to the left, so you'll have to subtract 6 from both sides of the equation. That will leave you with 0 on the right side (6-6) and -1 on the left side (5-6). The equation should now read: 3x2 + 4x - 1 = 0., In this case, 3 is the coefficient of the x2 term. To factor out a 3, just pull out a 3, place the remaining terms in parentheses, and divide each term by 3. So, 3x2 ÷ 3 = x2, 4x ÷ 3 = 4/3x, and 1 ÷ 3 = 1/3. The equation should now read: 3(x2 + 4/3x - 1/3) = 0.

, This means that you can get rid of that pesky 3 term outside the parentheses for good. Since you divided every term by 3, it can be removed without impacting the equation. Now you have x2 + 4/3x - 1/3 = 0

, Next, take the second term, 4/3, also known as the b term, and find half of it. 4/3 ÷ 2 or 4/3 x 1/2, is 4/6, or 2/3. And 2/3 squared is 4/9. When you're done, you'll have to write it on the left and the right side of the equation, since you're essentially adding a new term. You'll need it on both sides of the equation to keep it balanced. The equation should now read x2 + 4/3 x + 2/32 - 1/3 = 2/32
, Move the original constant term, -1/3, over to the right side to make it 1/3. Add it to the term you just placed there, 4/9, or 2/32. Find a common denominator to combine 1/3 and 4/9 by multiplying both the top and bottom of 1/3 by 3. 1/3 x 3/3 = 3/9. Now, add up 3/9 and 4/9 to get 7/9 on the right side of the equation. This yields: x2 + 4/3 x + 2/32 = 4/9 + 1/3 and then x2 + 4/3 x + 2/32 = 7/9.

, Since you've already used a formula to find the missing term, the hard part is already over. All you have to do is place x and half of the second coefficient in parentheses and square them, like so:(x + 2/3)2. Note that factoring that perfect square will give you the three terms: x2 + 4/3 x + 4/9. The equation should now read: (x + 2/3)2 = 7/9.

, On the left side of the equation, the square root of (x + 2/3)2 is simply x + 2/3. On the right side, you will get +/- (√7)/3. The square root of the denominator, 9, is an even 3, and the square root of 7 is √7. Remember to write +/- because a square root can be positive or negative.

, To isolate the variable x, just move the constant term 2/3 over to the right side of the equation. You now have two possible answers for x:± (√7)/3 - 2/3. These are your two answers. You can leave it at that or find the actual square root of 7 if you need to give an answer without the radical sign.

Set up the formula for calculating the absolute error.,
Plug the actual value into the formula.,
Find the measured value.,
Subtract the actual value from the measured value.",How to Calculate Absolute Error1," The formula is Δx=x0−x{\displaystyle \Delta x=x_{0}-x}, where Δx{\displaystyle \Delta x} equals the absolute error (the difference, or change, in the measured and actual value), x0{\displaystyle x_{0}} equals the measured value, and x{\displaystyle x} equals the actual value., The actual value should be given to you. If not, use a standardly accepted value. Substitute this value for x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, you might be measuring the length of a football field. You know that the actual, or accepted length of a professional American football field is 360 feet. So, you would use 360 as the actual value:Δx=x0−360{\displaystyle \Delta x=x_{0}-360}.


, This will be given to you, or you should make the measurement yourself. Substitute this value for x0{\displaystyle x_{0}}.

For example, if you measure the football field and find that it is 357 feet long, you would use 357 as the measured value:Δx=357−360{\displaystyle \Delta x=357-360}.


, Since absolute error is always positive, take the absolute value of this difference, ignoring any negative signs.This will give you the absolute error.

For example, since Δx=357−360=−3{\displaystyle \Delta x=357-360=-3}, the absolute error of your measurement is 3 feet.

Define all the constants and the variables.,
Add or subtract all constants.,
Add or subtract the coefficients of all like variables.",How to Combine Like Terms,"



Constants are numbers that stand on their own. They will not have an ""x"", ""y"", ""z"", or any other variable attached to them. They can be small numbers, like ""7"", or big numbers, like ""23,849"".

Variables are symbols that stand for numbers that vary. A variable is usually written as a letter, such as ""x"", ""y"", or ""z"".
The difference between constants and variables is that the value of a variable can change, while the value of a constant stays the same.;
, Remember, constants are numbers that stand all alone and never change.

,


Variables need to be exactly the same for you to add up their coefficients:





""x3 + 3x2"" have different exponents, so you cannot add them up.
""x3 + 3x3"" both have ""x3"" as a variable, so you can add them up.


Only add or subtract the value of the coefficient; don't try to add or subtract the variable.





2y2 + 5y2 = 7y2 — not 7y4.
6xy3 - 4 xy3 = 2xy3 — not 2xy.

Sum the previous two numbers to find any given number in the Fibonacci Sequence.",How to Calculate the Fibonacci Sequence1," The number of rows will depend on how many numbers in the Fibonacci sequence you want to calculate.

For example, if you want to find the fifth number in the sequence, your table will have five rows.

When using the table method, you cannot find a random number farther down in the sequence without calculating all the number before it. For example, if you want to find the 100th number in the sequence, you have to calculate the 1st through 99th numbers first. This is why the table method only works well for numbers early in the sequence.
;
, This means just entering a sequence of sequential ordinal numbers, beginning with ""1st.""

The term refers to the position number in the Fibonacci sequence. 

For example, if you want to figure out the fifth number in the sequence, you will write 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th down the left column. This will show you what the first through fifth terms in the sequence are.


, This is the starting point for the Fibonacci Sequence. In other words, the first term in the sequence is 1.

The correct Fibonacci sequence always starts on 1. If you begin with a different number, you are not finding the proper pattern of the Fibonacci sequence.


, This will give you the second number in the sequence.

Remember, to find any given number in the Fibonacci sequence, you simply add the two previous numbers in the sequence.

To create the sequence, you should think of 0 coming before 1 (the first term), so 1 + 0 = 1.


, This will give you the third number in the sequence.

1 + 1 = 2. The third term is 2.


,

1 + 2 = 3. The fourth term is 3.


, This will give you the fifth number in the sequence.

2 + 3 = 5. The fifth term is 5.


, When you use this method, you are using the formula Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}}.Since this is not a closed formula, however, you cannot use it to calculate any given term in the sequence without calculating all the previous numbers.

Write your answer.",How to Calculate Frequency1," The formula for frequency, when given wavelength and the velocity of the wave, is written as: f = V / λ


In this formula, f represents frequency, V represents the velocity of the wave, and λ represents the wavelength of the wave.
Example: A certain sound wave traveling in the air has a wavelength of 322 nm when the velocity of sound is 320 m/s. What is the frequency of this sound wave?;
, If the wavelength is given in nanometers, you need to convert this value into meters by dividing it by the number of nanometers in a single meter.


Note that when working with extremely small numbers or extremely large numbers, it is generally easier to write the values in scientific notation. The values will be shown in and out of their scientific notation forms for this example, but when writing your answer for homework, other schoolwork, or other formal forums, you should stick with scientific notation.
Example: λ = 322 nm

322 nm x (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 3.22 x 10^-7 m = 0.000000322 m



, Divide the velocity of the wave, V, by the wavelength converted into meters, λ, in order to find the frequency, f.


Example: f = V / λ = 320 / 0.000000322 = 993788819.88 = 9.94 x 10^8

, After completing the previous step, you will have completed your calculation for the frequency of the wave. Write your answer in Hertz, Hz, which is the unit for frequency.


Example: The frequency of this wave is 9.94 x 10^8 Hz.

Set up the formula for relative error.,
Plug in the value for the relative error.,
Plug in the value for the actual value.,
Multiply each side of the equation by the actual value.,
Add the actual value to each side of the equation.,
Subtract the actual value from the measured value.",How to Calculate Absolute Error2," The formula is δx=x0−xx{\displaystyle \delta x={\frac {x_{0}-x}{x}}}, where δx{\displaystyle \delta x} equals the relative error (the ratio of the absolute error to the actual value), x0{\displaystyle x_{0}} equals the measured value, and x{\displaystyle x} equals the actual value., This will likely be a decimal. Make sure you substitute it for δx{\displaystyle \delta x}.

For example, if you know that the relative error is .025, your formula will look like this: .025=x0−xx{\displaystyle .025={\frac {x_{0}-x}{x}}}.


, This information should be given to you. Make sure you substitute this value for x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, if you know that the actual value is 360 ft, your formula will look like this: .025=x0−360360{\displaystyle .025={\frac {x_{0}-360}{360}}}.


, This will cancel out the fraction.

For example:.025=x0−360360{\displaystyle .025={\frac {x_{0}-360}{360}}}.025×360=x0−360360×360{\displaystyle .025\times 360={\frac {x_{0}-360}{360}}\times 360}9=x0−360{\displaystyle 9=x_{0}-360}


, This will give you the value of x0{\displaystyle x_{0}}, giving you the measured value.

For example:9=x0−360{\displaystyle 9=x_{0}-360}9+360=x0−360+360{\displaystyle 9+360=x_{0}-360+360}369=x0{\displaystyle 369=x_{0}}


, Since absolute error is always positive, take the absolute value of this difference, ignoring any negative signs.This will give you the absolute error.

For example, if the measured value is 369 ft, and the actual value is 360 feet, you would subtract 369−360=9{\displaystyle 369-360=9}. So, the absolute error is 9 feet.

This might be explicitly stated (for example, “The building was measured to the nearest foot.”), but it doesn’t have to be. To determine the measuring unit, just look at what place value the measurement is rounded to.For example, if the measured length of a building is stated as 357 feet, you know that the building was measured to the nearest foot. So, the measuring unit is 1 foot.


, The maximum possible error is 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} the unit of measure.You might see it listed as ±{\displaystyle \pm } a number.

For example, if the unit of measure is a foot, the maximum possible error is .5 ft. So you might see that the measurement of a building is 357±.5ft{\displaystyle 357\pm .5ft}. This means that the actual value of the building’s length could be .5 ft less or .5 ft more than the measured value. If it was any less/more, the measured value would have been 356 or 358 feet.


,

For example, if you find the measurement of a building to be 357±.5ft{\displaystyle 357\pm .5ft}, the absolute error is .5 ft.

Set up the formula xn{\displaystyle x_{n}}=ϕn−(1−ϕ)n5{\displaystyle {\frac {\phi ^{n}-(1-\phi )^{n}}{\sqrt {5}}}}.,
Plug the number for n{\displaystyle n} into the formula.,
Substitute the golden ratio into the formula.,
Complete the calculations in parentheses.,
Calculate the exponents.,
Complete the subtraction.,
Divide by the square root of 5.,
Round to the nearest whole number.",How to Calculate the Fibonacci Sequence2," In the formula, xn{\displaystyle x_{n}} = the term in the sequence you are trying to find, n{\displaystyle n} = the position number of the term in the sequence, and ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } = the golden ratio.This is a closed formula, so you will be able to calculate a specific term in the sequence without calculating all the previous ones.

This formula is a simplified formula derived from Binet’s Fibonacci number formula.The formula utilizes the golden ratio (ϕ{\displaystyle \phi }), because the ratio of any two successive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are very similar to the golden ratio., The n{\displaystyle n} represents whatever term you are looking for in the sequence.

For example, if you are looking for the fifth number in the sequence, plug in 5. Your formula will now look like this: x5{\displaystyle x_{5}}=ϕ5−(1−ϕ)55{\displaystyle {\frac {\phi ^{5}-(1-\phi )^{5}}{\sqrt {5}}}}.


, You can use 1.618034 as an approximation of the golden ratio.For example, if you are looking for the fifth number in the sequence, the formula will now look like this: x5{\displaystyle x_{5}}=(1.618034)5−(1−1.618034)55{\displaystyle {\frac {(1.618034)^{5}-(1-1.618034)^{5}}{\sqrt {5}}}}.


, Remember to use the order of operations by completing the calculation in parentheses first: 1−1.618034=−0.618034{\displaystyle 1-1.618034=-0.618034}.

In the example, the equation becomes x5{\displaystyle x_{5}}=(1.618034)5−(−0.618034)55{\displaystyle {\frac {(1.618034)^{5}-(-0.618034)^{5}}{\sqrt {5}}}}.


, Multiply the two parenthetical numbers in the numerator by the appropriate exponent.

In the example, 1.6180345=11.090170{\displaystyle 1.618034^{5}=11.090170}; −0.6180345=−0.090169{\displaystyle -0.618034^{5}=-0.090169}. So the equation becomes x5=11.090170−(−0.090169)5{\displaystyle x_{5}={\frac {11.090170-(-0.090169)}{\sqrt {5}}}}.


, Before you divide, you need to subtract the two numbers in the numerator.

In the example, 11.090170−(−0.090169)=11.180339{\displaystyle 11.090170-(-0.090169)=11.180339}, so the equation becomes x5{\displaystyle x_{5}}=11.1803395{\displaystyle {\frac {11.180339}{\sqrt {5}}}}.


, The square root of 5, rounded, is 2.236067.

In the example problem, 11.1803392.236067=5.000002{\displaystyle {\frac {11.180339}{2.236067}}=5.000002}.


, Your answer will be a decimal, but it will be very close to a whole number. This whole number represents the number in the Fibonacci sequence.

If you used the complete golden ratio and did no rounding, you would get a whole number. It’s more practical to round, however, which will result in a decimal.In the example, after using a calculator to complete all the calculations, your answer will be approximately 5.000002. Rounding to the nearest whole number, your answer, representing the fifth number in the Fibonacci sequence, is 5.

Learn the formula.,
Convert the wavelength into meters, if necessary.,
Divide the speed of light by the wavelength.The speed of light is a constant, so even if the problem does not provide you with a value, the value remains 3.00 x 10^8 m/s.,
Write your answer.",How to Calculate Frequency2," The formula for the frequency of a wave in a vacuum is almost identical to that of a wave not in a vacuum. Since there are no outside influences on the velocity of the wave, though, you would use the mathematical constant for the speed of light, which electromagnetic waves would travel at under these conditions. As such, the formula is written as: f = C / λ


In this formula, f represents frequency, C represents the velocity or speed of light, and λ represents the wavelength of the wave.
Example: A particular wave of electromagnetic radiation has a wavelength of 573 nm when passing through a vacuum. What is the frequency of this electromagnetic wave?

, When the problem gives you the wavelength in meters, no further action is needed. If, however, the wavelength is given in micrometers, you need to convert this value into meters by dividing it by the number of micrometers in a single meter.


Note that when working with extremely small numbers or extremely large numbers, it is generally easier to write the values in scientific notation. The values will be shown in and out of their scientific notation forms for this example, but when writing your answer for homework, other schoolwork, or other formal forums, you should stick with scientific notation.
Example: λ = 573 nm

573 nm x (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 5.73 x 10^-7 m = 0.000000573



, Divide this value by the wavelength converted into meters.


Example: f = C / λ = 3.00 x 10^8 / 5.73 x 10^-7 = 5.24 x 10^14

, With this, you should have calculated the value of the frequency of the wave. Write your answer in Hertz, Hz, the unit for frequency.


Example: The frequency of this wave is 5.24 x 10^14 Hz.

"
"
Learn the formula.,
Divide the number of oscillations by the time period.,
Write your answer.",How to Calculate Frequency3," Frequency and the time taken to finish a single wave oscillation are inversely proportional. As such, the formula for calculating frequency when given the time taken to complete a wave cycle is written as: f = 1 / TIn this formula, f represents frequency and T represents the time period or amount of time required to complete a single wave oscillation.
Example A: The time for a certain wave to complete a single oscillation is 0.32 seconds. What is the frequency of this wave?
Example B: In 0.57 seconds, a certain wave can complete 15 oscillations. What is the frequency of this wave?

, Usually, you will be told how long it takes to complete a single oscillation, in which case, you would just divide the number 1 by the time period, T. If given a time period for numerous oscillations, however, you will need to divide the number of oscillations by the overall time period required to complete them.


Example A: f = 1 / T = 1 / 0.32 = 3.125
Example B: f = 1 / T = 15 / 0.57 = 26.316

, This calculation should tell you the frequency of the wave. Write your answer in Hertz, Hz, the unit for frequency.


Example A: The frequency of this wave is 3.125 Hz.
Example B: The frequency of this wave is 26.316 Hz.

Learn the formula.,
Multiply pi by two.,
Divide the angular frequency by the double of pi.,
Write your answer.",How to Calculate Frequency4," When told the angular frequency of a wave but not the standard frequency of that same wave, the formula to calculate the standard frequency is written as: f = ω / (2π)In this formula, f represents the frequency of the wave and ω represents the angular frequency. As with any mathematical problem, π stands for pi, a mathematical constant.
Example: A particular wave rotates with an angular frequency of 7.17 radians per second. What is the frequency of that wave?

, In order to find the denominator of the equation, you need to double the value of pi, 3.14.


Example: 2 * π = 2 * 3.14 = 6.28

, Divide the angular frequency of the wave, given in radians per second, by 6.28, the doubled value of pi.


Example: f = ω / (2π) = 7.17 / (2 * 3.14) = 7.17 / 6.28 = 1.14

, This final bit of calculation should indicate what the frequency of the wave is. Write your answer in Hertz, Hz, the unit for frequency.


Example: The frequency of this wave is 1.14 Hz.

Review every time your teacher teaches you.,
Do a prep study.,
Focus and ask questions during class.,
Study, study, study!,
The more problems you solve, the better.,
Never cheat!,
Do not panic during a test.,
Accept your grades.,
You will be better in algebra if you develop and keep up good efforts so that you can build your confidence by establishing good study habits!

",How to Become Better at Algebra," If you do not understand something, ask your parents, your friends, or even your older siblings. They would definitely be glad to help you. You should review the material every day that the teacher teaches you because who knows? Maybe the next day when you try to review, you realize that you have forgotten an important part. Review while it is still fresh in your mind.;
, Preparation studies help you. If you prepare yourself to ""think in math language"", you will know what the teacher is talking about the next time she teaches you a lesson.

, If you don't focus, you won't get much information out of what the teacher says. If you have questions about the lesson, you can ask the teacher, or, if you are a shy person, ask the person sitting next to you without distracting the class or the teacher. Or better yet, maybe you can ask your friends after class. It has to be as soon as the class is over so you don't forget. You can also ask your teacher after school, if he/she is free.

, But never cram. Some people think that cramming is good because it makes them study more. However, cramming will make you forget the material the next day when you have a test. Too many new things at once just won't stay in your mind. Two weeks before the test, study somewhere between 30 minutes to 1 hour everyday.

, Practicing is always the best way to study algebra. The point in solving problems is to get used to using the formulas! That way, you can solve the problems faster and you can think faster. Practice, practice, practice. This applies to anything, really. If you practice you will get better at it and you will succeed!

, Never cheat on a test. Cheating can get you a big old goose egg, ""0"". You don't want that to happen do you? Cheating can lead to suspension and even expulsion, so if you ever feel the need to glance over and compare answers control yourself, you never know what the consequence can be..but the worst part is that when you cheat, you don't learn. If you go to school and you don't learn, the whole thing seems like a waste of time. Cheating cheats YOU out of an education.

, Your mind won't be able to think clearly and you will forget the formulas. If you have studied and can solve the problems you do for homework, you will probably do fine on the test. Do not panic.

, That's right, accept it. When you get your test back and find out that you have gotten a bad grade, accept it as your own responsibility. That will make you want to figure out how to learn the material. Most importantly, make sure to put in extra effort the next time you study for a test Did you get a bad grade because you didn't study enough? Did you make careless errors? Whatever the reason, locate it and fix it as soon as possible without getting too down on yourself.


Look at your score. Do you want to make it better? Never think, ""Hurray! I got 100! Now I don't have to study anymore!"" If you think that, then you will get a bad grade next time because you will feel that there is no need to study. If you get a 100, just think, ""I'll have to keep it up!""
Make corrections. Look at the problems you got wrong and find out where you went wrong. Practice them again and again until you get it right. Review each day. The whole point of the tests you take in school is to figure out what things you still need to learn, then to work on those things.
Reflect on your scores.

Write out the functions that are being added or subtracted.,
Reorder the functions by degree of terms.,
Create an addition or subtraction problem using the two formulas.,
Add or subtract like terms.,
Follow the same process for adding or subtracting more than two functions.",How to Add and Subtract Functions1," Functions are usually stated as f(x) = relationship, where x is the variable input, and the relationship is stated as a formula for the variable x. Since you are adding or subtracting more than one function, they will be labeled differently, most likely f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} and g(x){\displaystyle g(x)}.

For example, you might be asked to add the function f(x)=3x+2{\displaystyle f(x)=3x+2}, and the function g(x)=4−5x{\displaystyle g(x)=4-5x}.

If you are being asked to add, you will often be asked to find (f+g)x{\displaystyle (f+g)x}.

If you are being asked to subtract, you will often be asked to find (f−g)x{\displaystyle (f-g)x}.
;
, This means ordering the formula by exponents, beginning with the largest exponent (x3,x2,x,{\displaystyle x^{3},x^{2},x,} etc.). If there is no exponent, order the first-degree term first (x), followed the constants (numbers without variables).

For example, the function g(x){\displaystyle g(x)} would be reordered as −5x+4{\displaystyle -5x+4}. The f(x) function is already ordered by degree of terms.


, You can add/subtract horizontally or vertically, since you have ordered the functions by terms.

For example, your function can be set up as (f+g)x=(3x+2)+(−5x+4){\displaystyle (f+g)x=(3x+2)+(-5x+4)}, or it could be set up vertically, with like terms lined up:+3x+2−5x+4{\displaystyle +{\begin{matrix}3x&+&2\\-5x&+&4\end{matrix}}}.


, It is helpful to add/subtract in order of the degree of terms, beginning with the highest exponent (if any). For example, for (f+g)x=(3x+2)+(−5x+4){\displaystyle (f+g)x=(3x+2)+(-5x+4)}, you would first add the first-degree terms:3x+(−5x)=−2x{\displaystyle 3x+(-5x)=-2x}.Second, you would add the constants:2+4=6{\displaystyle 2+4=6}.So (f+g)x=−2x+6{\displaystyle (f+g)x=-2x+6}.


, Adding or subtracting functions is always just a matter of adding/subtracting the like terms in the relationship formulas.

2+3i3+6i{\displaystyle {\frac {2+3i}{3+6i}}}
;
, The complex conjugate z¯,{\displaystyle {\bar {z}},} pronounced ""z-bar,"" is simply the complex number with the sign of the imaginary part reversed. For example, the conjugate of the number 3+6i{\displaystyle 3+6i} is 3−6i.{\displaystyle 3-6i.}
, The reason why this works is that for any complex number z,{\displaystyle z,} multiplying it by its conjugate yields a real number zz¯=(a+bi)(a−bi)=a2+b2,{\displaystyle z{\bar {z}}=(a+bi)(a-bi)=a^{2}+b^{2},} because a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are both real. The i's are then removed from the denominator. Remember that we are really multiplying by 1, so both the top and bottom must be multiplied by the same number. The process and reasoning is similar to that of rationalizing the denominator.


2+3i3+6i⋅3−6i3−6i=6+9i−12i+189+36=24−3i45{\displaystyle {\frac {2+3i}{3+6i}}\cdot {\frac {3-6i}{3-6i}}={\frac {6+9i-12i+18}{9+36}}={\frac {24-3i}{45}}}

Remember that i2=−1.{\displaystyle i^{2}=-1.} This means that you need to pay close attention to the signs.


, We now have a fraction with a real number in the denominator, so all that's left is to put it in the form a+bi.{\displaystyle a+bi.}


24−3i45=8−i15=815−115i{\displaystyle {\frac {24-3i}{45}}={\frac {8-i}{15}}={\frac {8}{15}}-{\frac {1}{15}}i}


, You may have already learned how to graph a complex number on the complex plane. The horizontal axis denotes the real axis, while the vertical axis is the imaginary axis. Above is a graph of an arbitrary complex number on the complex plane. It is important to understand what these graphs mean, because the nature of complex numbers means that we can draw tight connections between their algebraic properties (as shown in part 1) and their geometrical properties.
, In polar coordinates, we denote points with two variables r{\displaystyle r} and θ,{\displaystyle \theta ,} where r{\displaystyle r} is the distance from the pole and θ{\displaystyle \theta } is the angle from the polar axis. In the context of complex numbers, the magnitude of the number is called the modulus, while its angle from the polar axis is called its argument.

Recall the coordinate conversions from Cartesian to polar.


x=rcos⁡θ{\displaystyle x=r\cos \theta }


y=rsin⁡θ{\displaystyle y=r\sin \theta }



We can therefore write any complex number on the complex plane as z=r(cos⁡θ+isin⁡θ).{\displaystyle z=r(\cos \theta +i\sin \theta ).} Using Euler's formula, we can compact this to z=reiθ.{\displaystyle z=re^{i\theta }.}

In this section, we will show that dealing with complex numbers in polar form is vastly simpler than dealing with them in Cartesian form.


, Let's do a different example.


3+3i2+23i{\displaystyle {\frac {3+3i}{2+2{\sqrt {3}}i}}}


, If your numbers are already in polar form, skip this step. Otherwise, use the relations below.


r=a2+b2{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}}


θ=tan−1(ba){\displaystyle \theta =\tan ^{-1}\left({\frac {b}{a}}\right)}

In our example, we have two complex numbers to convert to polar. Let's label them as z1z2{\displaystyle {\frac {z_{1}}{z_{2}}}} and use the notation z=reiθ.{\displaystyle z=re^{i\theta }.}


z1=3+3i=32eiπ/4{\displaystyle z_{1}=3+3i=3{\sqrt {2}}e^{i\pi /4}}


z2=2+23i=4eiπ/3{\displaystyle z_{2}=2+2{\sqrt {3}}i=4e^{i\pi /3}}




, When we write out the numbers in polar form, we find that all we need to do is to divide the magnitudes and subtract the angles. Likewise, when we multiply two complex numbers in polar form, we multiply the magnitudes and add the angles. 


z1z2=32eiπ/44eiπ/3=324ei(π4−π3)=324e−iπ/12{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {z_{1}}{z_{2}}}={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}e^{i\pi /4}}{4e^{i\pi /3}}}&={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}}{4}}e^{i\left({\frac {\pi }{4}}-{\frac {\pi }{3}}\right)}\\&={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}}{4}}e^{-i\pi /12}\end{aligned}}}


, Use the following relations. Our angle is θ=−π12,{\displaystyle \theta =-{\frac {\pi }{12}},} which is not typically shown on the unit circle. You can either use a calculator or find the exact values of cos(−π12){\displaystyle \cos \left(-{\frac {\pi }{12}}\right)} and sin(−π12){\displaystyle \sin \left(-{\frac {\pi }{12}}\right)} using trigonometric summation identities. Below, we use the identities to write the components in exact form. Such identities are available online or in textbooks.


a=rcosθ{\displaystyle a=r\cos {\theta }}


b=rsinθ{\displaystyle b=r\sin {\theta }}


a=324cos(−π12)=324cos(π4−π3)=324(cosπ4cosπ3+sinπ4sinπ3)=324(22⋅12+22⋅32)=324⋅2+64=3+338{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a&={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}}{4}}\cos \left(-{\frac {\pi }{12}}\right)\\&={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}}{4}}\cos \left({\frac {\pi }{4}}-{\frac {\pi }{3}}\right)\\&={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}}{4}}\left(\cos {\frac {\pi }{4}}\cos {\frac {\pi }{3}}+\sin {\frac {\pi }{4}}\sin {\frac {\pi }{3}}\right)\\&={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}}{4}}\left({\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}\cdot {\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}\cdot {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}\right)\\&={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}}{4}}\cdot {\frac {{\sqrt {2}}+{\sqrt {6}}}{4}}\\&={\frac {3+3{\sqrt {3}}}{8}}\end{aligned}}}


b=324sin(−π12)=324⋅2−64=3−338{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}b&={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}}{4}}\sin \left(-{\frac {\pi }{12}}\right)\\&={\frac {3{\sqrt {2}}}{4}}\cdot {\frac {{\sqrt {2}}-{\sqrt {6}}}{4}}\\&={\frac {3-3{\sqrt {3}}}{8}}\end{aligned}}}


, While the above conversions took quite a few steps, it is important to recognize that the act of converting from one coordinate system to another is where the ""difficult"" part is. When dealing with complex numbers purely in polar, the operations of multiplication, division, and even exponentiation (cf. De Moivres' formula) are very easy to do.

Add or subtract the functions, as described in Method 1.,
Plug in the variable.,
Complete the calculation.",How to Add and Subtract Functions2," This will give you the formula relationship for your variable input (x).

For example, you might find that (f+g)x=−2x+6{\displaystyle (f+g)x=-2x+6}.


, Remember, this method only works if you are adding/subtracting functions with the same input variable.

For example, you might be asked to find (f+g)(2){\displaystyle (f+g)(2)}. Your added function would then look like (f+g)(2)=−2(2)+6{\displaystyle (f+g)(2)=-2(2)+6}.


, Remember to use the order of operations.

For example:(f+g)(2)=−2(2)+6{\displaystyle (f+g)(2)=-2(2)+6}(f+g)(2)=−4+6{\displaystyle (f+g)(2)=-4+6}(f+g)(2)=2{\displaystyle (f+g)(2)=2}.

Plug the appropriate variable into the first function and solve.,
Plug the appropriate variable into the second function and solve.,
Add or subtract the two outputs.",How to Add and Subtract Functions3," Since you are working with two different variables (inputs), you cannot add the formulas and plug in one input, you have to complete one function at a time.For example, if you are given f(x)=3x+2{\displaystyle f(x)=3x+2} and g(x)=4−5x{\displaystyle g(x)=4-5x}, and are asked to find f(2)+g(3){\displaystyle f(2)+g(3)}, you would start by finding f(2){\displaystyle f(2)}. When you plug in the 2, you get:f(2)=3(2)+2{\displaystyle f(2)=3(2)+2}f(2)=6+2{\displaystyle f(2)=6+2}f(2)=8{\displaystyle f(2)=8}.


, Make sure you are plugging in the correct variable to the correct function.

For example, if g(x)=4−5x{\displaystyle g(x)=4-5x}, then: g(3)=4−5(3){\displaystyle g(3)=4-5(3)}g(3)=4−15{\displaystyle g(3)=4-15}g(3)=−11{\displaystyle g(3)=-11}


, The result will be the sum or difference of the two functions, given the provided variables.

For example, if f(2)=8{\displaystyle f(2)=8} and g(3)=−11{\displaystyle g(3)=-11}, then: f(2)+g(3)=8+(−11){\displaystyle f(2)+g(3)=8+(-11)}f(2)+g(3)=−3{\displaystyle f(2)+g(3)=-3}.

Each y term power will increase over the terms, like: , 1: which represents NIL in this process, y, then y2, then y3.",How to Calculate (x+y)^n with Pascal's Triangle," Draw the triangle up to at least 5 rows.;
,, In other terms, start with (x+y)0, then (x+y)1, (x+y)2. Note down the powers.


N to the power of 0 is always 1. That means (x+y)0 is 1.
Also, (x+y)1 is simply (x+y).

,,,, In mathematical terms, for each 1 you see, except the first line, it will represent either the coefficients of x or y. It will always have the highest power used in your (x+y)N, which is N.


The numbers in a line in Pascal's triangle will refer to the coefficients of each term, with the amount of number in a line referring to the total amount of terms related to (x+y)N.







,,


Example: (x+y)4

Since the power (n) = 4, we should have a look at the fifth (n+1)th row of the Pascal triangle. Thus, the (n + 1 = 5)th row of the Pascal triangle is:1 4 6 4 1

Therefore, 1 4 6 4 1 represent the coefficients of the terms of x & y after expansion of (x+y)4.
The answer: x4+4x3y+6x2y2+4xy3+y4

Write your function, replacing f(x) with y if necessary.,
Solve for x.,
Switch the variables.,
Replace y with ""f-1(x)."",
Check your work.",How to Algebraically Find the Inverse of a Function," Your formula should have y on one side of the equals sign by itself with the x terms on the other side of the equals sign. If you have an equation that's already written in terms of y and x (for instance, 2 + y = 3x2), all you need to do is solve for y by isolating it on one side of the equals sign.


Example: If we have a function f(x) = 5x - 2, we would rewrite it as y = 5x - 2 simply by replacing the ""f(x)"" with a y.
Note: f(x) is the standard function notation, but if you're dealing with multiple functions, each one gets a different letter to make telling them apart easier. For example, g(x) and h(x) are each common identifiers for functions.;
, In other words, perform the necessary mathematical operations to isolate x by itself on one side of the equal sign. Basic algebraic principles will guide you here: if x has a numeric coefficient, divide both sides of the equation by this number; if a certain number is added to the x term(s) on one side of the equals sign, subtract this number from both sides, and so on.


Remember, you can perform any operation on one side of the equation as long as you perform the operation on every term on both sides of the equal sign.
Example: To continue our example, first, we'd add 2 to both sides of the equation. This gives us y + 2 = 5x. We'd then divide both sides of the equation by 5, yielding (y + 2)/5 = x. Finally, to make it easier to read, we'll rewrite the equation with ""x"" on the left side: x = (y + 2)/5.


, Replace x with y and vice versa. The resulting equation is the inverse of the original function. In other words, if we substitute a value for x into our original equation and get an answer, when we substitute that answer into the inverse equation (again for x), we'll get our original value back!


Example: After switching x and y, we'd have y = (x + 2)/5


, Inverse functions are usually written as f-1(x) = (x terms) . Note that in this case, the -1 exponent doesn't mean we should perform an exponent operation on our function. It's just a way of indicating that this function is the inverse of our original.


Since taking x to the -1st power gives the fraction 1/x, you can also think of f-1(x) as a way of writing ""1/f(x),"" which also signifies the inverse of f(x).

, Try substituting a constant into the original function for x. If you found the correct inverse, you should be able to plug the result into the inverse function and get your original x-value as the result.


Example: Let's substitute 4 for x in our original equation. This gives us f(x) = 5(4) - 2, or f(x) = 18.
Next, let's substitute our answer, 18, into our inverse function for x. If we do this, we get y = (18 + 2)/5, which simplifies to y = 20/5, which further simplifies to y = 4. 4 is our original x-value, so we know we've calculated the correct inverse function.

Write the formula for finding the sum of an arithmetic series.,
Plug the values into the formula.,
Add the values in the numerator of the fraction, then divide by 2.,
Multiply by n{\displaystyle n}.",How to Add Consecutive Integers from 1 to 1001," The formula is Sn=n(a1+an2){\displaystyle S_{n}=n({\frac {a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}})}, where n{\displaystyle n} equals the number of terms in the series, a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} is the first number in the series, an{\displaystyle a_{n}} is the last number in the series, and Sn{\displaystyle S_{n}} equals the sum of n{\displaystyle n} numbers., This means substituting the first term in the series for a1{\displaystyle a_{1}}, and the last term in the series for an{\displaystyle a_{n}}. When adding consecutive numbers 1 through 100, a1=1{\displaystyle a_{1}=1} and an=100{\displaystyle a_{n}=100}.

Thus, your formula will look like this: S100=n(1+1002){\displaystyle S_{100}=n({\frac {1+100}{2}})}.


, Since 100+1=101{\displaystyle 100+1=101}, you will divide 101 by 2: 1012=50.5{\displaystyle {\frac {101}{2}}=50.5}.
, This will give you the sum the consecutive number in the series. In this instance, since you are adding consecutive numbers to 100, n=100{\displaystyle n=100}. So, you would calculate 100(50.5)=5050{\displaystyle 100(50.5)=5050}. Thus, the sum of the consecutive numbers between 1 and 100 is 5,050.

To quickly multiply a number by 100, move the decimal point two places to the right."

Read the problem.,
Think of the problem in terms of slope-intercept form.,
Find the slope of the line.,
Find the y-intercept.,
Write the equation in slope-intercept form.,
Test it out.",How to Use the Slope Intercept Form (in Algebra)1," Before you can move forward, you need to carefully read the problem to understand what is being asked of you. Read the following problem: Your bank account increases linearly each week. If after 20 weeks of work, your bank account is at $560, while after 21 weeks of work it is at $585, find a way to express the relationship between how much money you've earned and how many weeks you've worked in slope-intercept form.;
, You should write y = mx + b and know that ""m"" represents the change and ""b"" represents a starting point, where the line ""intersects"" the y-axis. Notice that the problem states, ""Your bank account increases linearly each week,"" meaning that you are saving the same amount of money each time, which means it will have a smooth slope. That ""smooth,"" uniformly consistent savings plan makes it linear. If you don't save the same amount all the time, then it is not linear.

, To find the slope, you have to find the rate of change. If you started with $560 and now have $585 the next week, then you have earned $25 after 1 week of work. You can figure this out by subtracting $560 from $585. $585-$560 = $25.

, To find the y-intercept, or the ""b"" in y = mx + b, you'll need to find the starting point of the problem (where it intersects the y-axis. This means you need to know how much money you started with in your account. If you had $560 after 20 weeks of work, and you know that you earn $25 after every week of work, then you can multiply 20 x 25 to figure out how much money you earned in those 20 weeks. 20 x 25 = 500, which means that you earned $500 in those weeks.


Since you have $560 after 20 weeks and have earned $500, you can figure out how much you started with by subtracting 500 from 560. 560 - 500 = 60.
Therefore, your ""b,"" or your starting point, is 60.

, Now that you know the slope, m, is 25, (25 dollars earned per 1 week), and the intercept, b, is 60, you can plug them into the equation:


y = mx + b (fill in some of the ""blanks"" with info)
y = 25x + 60

, In this equation, ""y"" represents the amount of money earned, and ""x"" represents the amount of weeks you've worked. Try plugging a different number of weeks into the equation to see how much money you've earned after a certain amount of weeks. Try two examples:


How much money have you earned after 10 weeks? Plug ""10"" into the ""x"" in the equation to find out.

y = 25x + 60 =
y = 25(10) + 60 =
y = 250 + 60 =
y = 310. After 10 weeks, you've made $310.


How many weeks would you have to work to earn 800 dollars? Plug ""800"" into the ""y"" variable of the equation to get the ""x"".

y = 25x + 60 =
800 = 25x + 60 =
800 - 60 =
25x = 740 =
25x/25 = 740/25 =
x = 29.6. You can earn 800 dollars in almost 30 weeks.

Write a general solution.",How to Solve a Linear Diophantine Equation," A linear equation is one that has no exponents greater than 1 on any variables. To solve a linear equation in this style, you need to begin by writing it in what is called “standard form.” The standard form of a linear equation looks like Ax+By=C{\displaystyle Ax+By=C}, where A,B{\displaystyle A,B} and C{\displaystyle C} are integers.

If the equation is not already in standard form, you need to use the basic rules of algebra to rearrange or combine the terms to create the standard form. For example, if you begin with 23x+4y−7x=−3y+15{\displaystyle 23x+4y-7x=-3y+15}, you can combine similar terms to reduce the equation to 16x+7y=15{\displaystyle 16x+7y=15}.
;
, When the equation is in standard form, check all three terms A,B{\displaystyle A,B} and C{\displaystyle C}. If there is a common factor in all three terms, then reduce the equation by dividing all terms by that factor. If you reduce evenly across all three terms, then any solution you find for the reduced equation will also be a solution for the original equation.

For example, if all three terms are even, you can at least divide by 2, as follows:


42x+36y=48{\displaystyle 42x+36y=48}  (all terms are divisible by 2)


21x+18y=24{\displaystyle 21x+18y=24}  (all terms now are divisible by 3)


7x+6y=8{\displaystyle 7x+6y=8}  (this equation is as reduced as possible)




, In some cases, you may be able to tell immediately if there is no solution to your problem. If you see a common factor on the left side of the equation that is not shared on the right side, then there can be no solution to the problem.

For example, if both A{\displaystyle A} and B{\displaystyle B} are even, then the sum of the left side of the equation would have to be even. But if C{\displaystyle C} is odd, then there will be no integer solution to the problem.


2x+4y=21{\displaystyle 2x+4y=21} will have no integer solution.


5x+10y=17{\displaystyle 5x+10y=17} can have no integer solution, because the left side of the equation is divisible by 5, but the right side is not.




, The Euclidean algorithm is a system of repeated divisions, using the remainder each time as the divisor of a new division. The last divisor that divides evenly is the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers.For example, the following steps illustrate the Euclidean algorithm being used to find the GCF of 272 and 36:


272=7∗36+20{\displaystyle 272=7*36+20}....divide the larger number (272) by the smaller (36) and note the remainder (20)


36=1∗20+16{\displaystyle 36=1*20+16}....divide the previous divisor (36) by the previous remainder (20). Note the new remainder (16).


20=1∗16+4{\displaystyle 20=1*16+4}....Repeat. Divide the previous divisor (20) by the previous remainder (16). Note the new remainder (4).


16=4∗4+0{\displaystyle 16=4*4+0}....Repeat. Divide the previous divisor (16) by the previous remainder (4). Since the remainder is now 0, conclude that 4 is the GCF of the original two numbers 272 and 36.




, With your linear equation in standard form, identify the coefficients A and B. Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find their GCF. Suppose you need to find integral solutions for the linear equation 87x−64y=3{\displaystyle 87x-64y=3}.The steps of the Euclidean algorithm for the coefficients 87 and 64 are as follows:


87=1∗64+23{\displaystyle 87=1*64+23}


64=2∗23+18{\displaystyle 64=2*23+18}


23=1∗18+5{\displaystyle 23=1*18+5}


18=3∗5+3{\displaystyle 18=3*5+3}


5=1∗3+2{\displaystyle 5=1*3+2}


3=1∗2+1{\displaystyle 3=1*2+1}


2=2∗1+0{\displaystyle 2=2*1+0}




, Because the Euclidean algorithm for this pair continues all the way down to dividing by 1, the GCF between 87 and 64 is 1. This is another way of saying that 87 and 64 are relatively prime., When you complete the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCF of A{\displaystyle A} and B{\displaystyle B}, you need to compare that result with the number C{\displaystyle C} of the original equation. If the greatest common factor of A{\displaystyle A} and B{\displaystyle B} is a number that can divide into C{\displaystyle C}, then your linear equation will have an integral solution. If not, then there will be no solution.For example, the sample problem 87x−64y=3{\displaystyle 87x-64y=3} will have an integral solution, since the GCF of 1 can be evenly divided into 3.

Suppose, for example, that the GCF had worked out to be 5. The divisor 5 cannot go evenly into 3. In that case, the equation would have no integral solutions.

As you will see below, if an equation has one integral solution, then it also has infinitely many integral solutions.


, To find the solution of the linear equation, you will use your work on the Euclidean algorithm as the basis for a repeated process of renaming and simplifying values.Begin by numbering the steps of the Euclidean algorithm reduction, as reference points. Thus, you have the following steps:


Step 1:87=(1∗64)+23{\displaystyle {\text{Step 1}}:87=(1*64)+23}


Step 2:64=(2∗23)+18{\displaystyle {\text{Step 2}}:64=(2*23)+18}


Step 3:23=(1∗18)+5{\displaystyle {\text{Step 3}}:23=(1*18)+5}


Step 4:18=(3∗5)+3{\displaystyle {\text{Step 4}}:18=(3*5)+3}


Step 5:5=(1∗3)+2{\displaystyle {\text{Step 5}}:5=(1*3)+2}


Step 6:3=(1∗2)+1{\displaystyle {\text{Step 6}}:3=(1*2)+1}


Step 7:2=(2∗1)+0{\displaystyle {\text{Step 7}}:2=(2*1)+0}




, Rewrite that equation so the remainder stands alone, as equal to the rest of the information in the equation.For this problem, Step 6 is the last one that showed a remainder. That remainder was 1. Rewrite the equation in Step 6 as follows:


1=3−(1∗2){\displaystyle 1=3-(1*2)}




, This procedure is a step-by-step process of moving “up” the steps. Each time, you will be revising the right side of the equation in terms of the numbers in the higher step.You can revise Step 5 to isolate its remainder as:


2=5−(1∗3){\displaystyle 2=5-(1*3)} or 2=5−3{\displaystyle 2=5-3}




, You should notice that your revision of Step 6 contains the number 2, and your revision of Step 5 is equal to 2. Substitute the equality in Step 5 into the place of the 2 in your Step 6 revision:1=3−(1∗2){\displaystyle 1=3-(1*2)}….. (This is the Step 6 revision.)


1=3−(5−3){\displaystyle 1=3-(5-3)}….. (Substitute in place of the value 2.)


1=3−5+3{\displaystyle 1=3-5+3}….. (Distribution of the negative sign)


1=2(3)−5{\displaystyle 1=2(3)-5}…..(Simplify)


, Moving through the Euclidean algorithm steps in reverse, repeat the process. Each time, you will revise the previous step, and substitute its value into your latest result.The last step was Step 5. Now revise Step 4 to isolate its remainder as:


3=18−(3∗5){\displaystyle 3=18-(3*5)}



Substitute that value in place of the 3 in your latest simplification step and then simplify:


1=2(18−3∗5)−5{\displaystyle 1=2(18-3*5)-5}


1=2(18)−6(5)−5{\displaystyle 1=2(18)-6(5)-5}


1=2(18)−7(5){\displaystyle 1=2(18)-7(5)}




, This process will repeat, step by step, until you reach the original step of the Euclidean algorithm. The purpose of this procedure is to wind up with an equation that will be written in terms of 87 and 64, which are the original coefficients of the problem you are trying to solve. Continuing in this manner, the remaining steps are as follows:1=2(18)−7(5){\displaystyle 1=2(18)-7(5)}


1=2(18)−7(23−18){\displaystyle 1=2(18)-7(23-18)}…..(Substitution from Step 3)


1=2(18)−7(23)+7(18){\displaystyle 1=2(18)-7(23)+7(18)}


1=9(18)−7(23){\displaystyle 1=9(18)-7(23)}




1=9(64−2∗23)−7(23){\displaystyle 1=9(64-2*23)-7(23)}…..(Substitution from Step 2)


1=9(64)−18(23)−7(23){\displaystyle 1=9(64)-18(23)-7(23)}


1=9(64)−25(23){\displaystyle 1=9(64)-25(23)}




1=9(64)−25(87−64){\displaystyle 1=9(64)-25(87-64)}…..(Substitution from Step 1)


1=9(64)−25(87)+25(64){\displaystyle 1=9(64)-25(87)+25(64)}


1=34(64)−25(87){\displaystyle 1=34(64)-25(87)}




, When you return to the first step of the Euclidean algorithm, you should notice that the resulting equation contains the two coefficients of the original problem. Rearrange the numbers so they align with the original equation.In this case, the original problem you are trying to solve is 87x−64y=3{\displaystyle 87x-64y=3}. Thus, you can rearrange your last step to put the terms in that standard order. Pay particular attention to the 64 term. In the original problem, that term is subtracted, but the Euclidean algorithm treats it as a positive term. To account for the subtraction, you need to change the multiplier 34 to a negative. The final equation looks like this:


87(−25)−64(−34)=1{\displaystyle 87(-25)-64(-34)=1}




, Notice that the greatest common divisor for this problem was 1, so the solution that you reached is equal to 1. However, that is not the solution to the problem, since the original problem sets 87x-64y equal to 3. You need to multiply the terms of your last equation by 3 to get a solution:87(−25∗3)−64(−34∗3)=1∗3{\displaystyle 87(-25*3)-64(-34*3)=1*3}


87(−75)−64(−102)=3{\displaystyle 87(-75)-64(-102)=3}


, The values that must be multiplied by the coefficients are the x and y solutions to the equation.

In this case, you can identify the solution as the coordinate pair (x,y)=(−75,−102){\displaystyle (x,y)=(-75,-102)}.


, If a linear equation has one integral solution, then it must have infinitely many integral solutions. Here is a brief algebraic statement of the proof:Ax+By=C{\displaystyle Ax+By=C}


A(x+B)+B(y−A)=C{\displaystyle A(x+B)+B(y-A)=C} ….. (Adding a B to x while subtracting A from y results in the same solution.)


, The pattern of infinite solutions begins with the single solution that you identified.In this case, your solution is the coordinate pair (x,y)=(−75,−102){\displaystyle (x,y)=(-75,-102)}.


, To find a new solution for x, add the value of the coefficient of y.In this problem, beginning with the solution x=-75, add the y coefficient of -64, as follows:


x=−75+(−64)=−139{\displaystyle x=-75+(-64)=-139}



Thus, a new solution for the original equation will have the x value of -139.


, To make the equation remain balanced, when you add to the x term, you must then subtract from the y term.

For this problem, beginning with the solution y=-102, subtract the x coefficient of 87, as follows:


y=−102−87=−189{\displaystyle y=-102-87=-189}



Thus, a new solution for the original equation will have the y coordinate of -189.

The new ordered pair should be (x,y)=(−139,−189){\displaystyle (x,y)=(-139,-189)}.


, To verify that your new ordered pair is a solution to the equation, insert the values into the equation and see if it works.87x−64y=3{\displaystyle 87x-64y=3} 


87(−139)−64(−189)=3{\displaystyle 87(-139)-64(-189)=3}


3=3{\displaystyle 3=3}

Because the statement is true, the solution works.


, The values for x will fit a pattern of the original solution, plus any multiple of the B coefficient. You can write this algebraically as follows:x(k)=x+k(B), where x(k) represents the series of all x solutions, and x is the original x value that you solved.

For this problem, you can say:


x(k)=−75−64k{\displaystyle x(k)=-75-64k}



y(k)=y-k(A), where y(k) represents the series of all y solutions, and y is the original y value that you solved.

For this problem, you can say:


y(k)=−102−87k{\displaystyle y(k)=-102-87k}

Divide the series into two equal groups.,
Write the first group, 1-50, in ascending order.,
Write the second group, 100-51, in descending order.,
Add each vertical set of numbers.,
Multiply 101 times 50.",How to Add Consecutive Integers from 1 to 1002," To find out how many numbers are in each group, divide the number of numbers by 2. In this instance, since the series is 1 to 100, you would calculate 100÷2=50{\displaystyle 100\div 2=50}.So, the first group will have 50 numbers (1-50).

The second group will also have 50 numbers (51-100).


, Write the numbers in a row, beginning with 1 and ending with 50.
, Write these numbers in a row under the first group. Begin so that 100 lines up under 1, 99 lines up under 2, etc.
, This means you will calculate 1+100=101{\displaystyle 1+100=101}, 2+99=101{\displaystyle 2+99=101}. etc. You don’t actually have to add up all the sets of numbers, because you should see that each set adds up to 101., To find the sum of consecutive numbers 1 to 100, you multiply the number of sets (50) by the sum of each set (101): 101(50)=5050.{\displaystyle 101(50)=5050.} So, the sum of consecutive number 1 through 100 is 5,050.

Write down the equation.,
Isolate the y-term on one side of the equation.,
Divide all of the terms by the y coefficient.,
Identify the terms in the equation.",How to Use the Slope Intercept Form (in Algebra)2," Let's say you're working with the equation, 4y +3x = 16; write it down.

, Just move the x term over to the other side so that the y term is by itself. Remember that whenever you move a term (by adding or subtracting) to the other side of an equation, you have to flip its sign from negative to positive and vice versa. So, ""3x"" moved to the other side of the equation would become ""-3x."" The equation should now look like 4y = -3x +16 by doing this:4y + 3x = 16 =

4y + 3x - 3x = -3x +16 (by subtraction)


4y = -3x +16 (by rewriting, simplifying the subtraction)

, The y coefficient is the number in front of the y term. If there is no coefficient in front of the y term, then you're done. If there is a coefficient, however, then you should divide each term in the equation by that number. In this case, the y coefficient is 4, so you have to divide 4x, -3x, and 16 by 4 to get the final answer in slope intercept form. Here's how you do it:4y = -3x +16 =

4/4y = -3/4x +16/4 = (by division)
y = -3/4x + 4 (by rewriting, simplifying the division)

, If you're using the equation to plot a line, then you should know that ""y"" represents the y-coordinate, ""-3/4"" represents the slope, ""x"" represents the x coordinate, and ""4"" represents the y-intercept.

Write down the equation of a line in slope intercept form.,
Plug in the given (or what you may call ""known"") information.,
Solve for the y-intercept.,
Write the equation.",How to Use the Slope Intercept Form (in Algebra)3," First, simply write y = mx + b. You can fill the equation in once you have enough information. Let's say that you're trying to solve the following problem: Find the equation of a line that has a slope of 4 and passes through the point (-1, -6)., Use what you know: that ""m"" is equal to the slope, which is 4, and that ""y"" and ""x"" represent the given ""x"" and ""y"" coordinates which are known, in this case. We have ""x"" = -1 and ""y"" = -6. ""b"" represents the y-intercept; you do not know b yet, so you can leave the ""b"" term in place. Here's how the equation will look once you plug in the relevant information:


y = -6, m = 4, x = -1 (the given values)
y = mx + b (the formula)
-6 = (4)(-1) + b (by substitution)

, Now, simply do the math to find ""b,"" the y-intercept. Just multiply 4 and -1 and then subtract the result from -6. Here's how you do it:


-6 = (4)(-1) + b
-6 = -4 + b (by multiplying)
-6 - (-4) = -4 -(-4) + b (by subtraction)
-6 - (-4) = b (simplifying the right hand side)
-2 = b (simplifying the left hand side)

, Now that you've solved for ""b,"" you can fill in all of the necessary information and finish writing the line in slope intercept form. All you need to know is the slope and the y-intercept:


m = 4, b = -2
y = mx + b
y = 4x -2 (by substitution)

"

Write down the two points.,
Use the two points to find the slope of the equation.,
Pick one of the points to solve for the y-intercept.,
Plug the numbers into the original equation.",How to Use the Slope Intercept Form (in Algebra)4," Before you can write the equation of the line, you'll need to write down those two points. Let's say you're trying to solve the following problem: Find the equation of the line that passes through (-2, 4) and (1, 2). Write down the two points you're working with., The formula for finding the slope of a line that crosses two points is simply (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1). You can think of the first set of coordinates (x, y) = (-2, 4), as representing X1 and Y1, and the second set of coordinates, (1, 2), as representing X2 and Y2. Here, you're really finding the difference between the x and the y coordinates, which gives you the rise over run, or the slope. Now, just plug them into the equation and solve for the slope.


(Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1) =
(2 - 4)/(1 - -2) =
-2/3 = m
The slope of the line is -2/3.

, It doesn't matter which pair of points you choose; you can pick the one with smaller numbers or numbers that are easier to work with. Let's say you've chosen the points (1, 2). Now, just plug them into the equation ""y = mx + b"" where ""m"" represents the slope and ""x"" and ""y"" represent the x and y coordinates. Plug in the numbers and do the math to solve for ""b."" Here's how you do it:


y = 2, x, = 1, m = -2/3
y = mx + b
2 = (-2/3)(1) + b
2 = -2/3 + b
2 - (-2/3) = b
2 + 2/3 = b, or b = 8/3


, Now that you know that your slope is -2/3 and your y-intercept (""b"") is 2 2/3, just plug them into the original equation for a line and you're done.


y = mx + b
y = -2/3x + 2 2/3

"
"
Write down the equation.,
Start at the y-intercept.,
Use the slope to find the coordinates of another point on the line.,
Connect the two points.",How to Use the Slope Intercept Form (in Algebra)5," First, write down the equation so you can start using it to graph a line. Let's say you're working with the following equation: y = 4x + 3. Write it down.

, The y intercept is represented by ""+3"" or ""b"" in the equation of a line in slope intercept form is positive 3. This means that the line intersects the y axis at (0, 3). Put your pencil down at this point.

, Since you know that the slope is represented by 4, or ""m,"" you can think of the slope as representing 4/1, the rise over the run of the coordinates on the line. This means that every time the line moves up 4 points on the y axis, it moves to the right 1 point on the x axis. So, if you start at the point (0, 3) and go up (""rise"") 4 points, you'll be at (0, 7). Then, you should move to the right (""run"") one coordinate, so you get (1, 7) as another point on this line.


If your slope is negative, then you'll either have to move the y-coordinate up instead of down, or move the x-coordinate to the left instead of the right. You'll get the same result either way.

, Now, all you have to do is draw a straight line through those two points and you'll have successfully graphed a line from an equation in slope intercept form. You can keep going -- just pick another point on the line you've drawn and use the slope to move up or down to find additional points on the line.

"
"
Use Point–Slope Form which is stated as: y - y1 = m(x - x1) .,
Take the one point given and the slope m given to us (known) to work with, for example: point (4, -3) and slope m = -2 .",How to Use the Slope Intercept Form (in Algebra)6," This is another way of working with one form of the equation of the line to get another form.

,


You are working where m = -2 as the slope of a line and the coordinates of a point are (4, -3), and these are our (x1,y1) like any defined point on the line. So, using those given values we have:y - y1 = m(x - x1),y - (-3) = -2(x - 4), by substitution using the point and slopey + 3 = -2(x - 4), by simplifying -(-3) to + 3y + 3 = -2x + -2(-4), by distributiony + 3 = -2x + 8, by multiplyingy + 3 - 3 = -2x + 8 - 3, by subtraction (of equals from both sides of the equation)y = -2x + 5, by simplifying/rewriting it (That fits the y = mx + b called the Slope Intercept Form).

What is Point–slope Form based on? The point-slope form expresses the fact that the difference of y values for two points on one line (that is, y − y1) can be stated as directly proportional to the difference of x values (that is, x − x1). There is a proportionality constant called m (the slope of the line).

We find that Direct Proportion is a comparison that can be stated in a form similar to y = kx. Here we notice that y - y1 = m(x - x1) fits the form y = kx .
Direct proportion means that given two variables such as x and y, then y is called directly proportional to x, if there is a constant k such that y = kx, if and only if x is not zero. ""k"" is the proportionality constant which is just the slope as we are using it. (You can also express direct proportion by saying ""x and y vary directly"", or express that ""x and y are in direct variation"").

Find a good etymological dictionary.,
Look for the roots.,
Trace the word’s journey into English.,
Understand the dates.,
Check the examples and sources.",How to Study the Etymology of Words1," To start informally studying etymology, buy or gain access to an authoritative dictionary that includes the linguistic origins of words in its definitions. The easiest way to tell that it does is if it has, “etymological” in the title. However, it may still include etymologies even if it does not. Check a definition to see if there is a section labeled “origin” or “etymology.”


The most respected print dictionaries for English’s etymology include An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English, A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, and The Oxford English Dictionary. The last also has an online subscription option.
There is also a free, well-researched online dictionary that’s specifically dedicated to etymology, available here: http://www.etymonline.com/
;
, Etymologies seek the earliest origin of a word by tracing it back to its most basic components, that is, the simple words that were combined to create it in the first place. When you know the roots of a word, you can better understand how we arrived at the sound and meaning for the word that exist today.For instance, the word “etymology” itself has Greek roots: “etymos,” which means, “true sense,” and “logia,” which means, “study of.”Besides helping you to understand the origin of a word, knowing its roots can help you understand other words with similar roots. In the case of “etymology,” you’ll note that the root “logia,” which means “the study of,” appears in multiple other places in modern English, from “biology” to “astrology.”

, Etymology traces not only the word’s origins but also how its meanings and spellings have developed over time. Sometimes that means that a word has traveled through more than one language on its journey into modern English.Etymological dictionaries will usually present this trajectory in reverse-chronological order, starting with the most recent usage and showing where each iteration came from in turn.
If we return to the word “etymology,” it entered into Old English as ethimolegia (""facts of the origin and development of a word""), from Old French etimologie, ethimologie, from Latin etymologia, from Greek etymologia (""analysis of a word to find its true origin""). So, it appeared in the written record of three languages (Greek, Latin, and French) before it entered into English.

, Most etymologies will include dates in their origins of words. These represent the first time a particular word appeared in a document written in English. (Keep in mind that a word may well have existed in spoken English a long time before that, but this is the date of the first written record of it that has survived.)For example, “etymology” entered English in the 14th century but did not take on its modern spelling and definition until the 1640s., Thorough etymological dictionaries will often include documentary sources for each iteration of a word and/or examples of how a word has been used in context over time, usually through a phrase or sentence from a written document in English. This provides concrete historical evidence for the word’s origins while giving you insight into how its meaning has changed.For instance, the word “queen” comes from the Middle English “quene,” which can be seen in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, and the Old English “cwen,” which appears in Beowulf."
"
Say “Louie.” If you're going for the basic English pronunciation of ""Louis Vuitton"", the first word is a piece of cake.,
Say “Vit.” The second word, ""Vuitton"" looks a little more intimidating, but it's not actually very hard to pronounce in English.,
Say “Tahn.” Next, to finish ""Vuitton"", make a ""tahn"" (rhymes with ""brawn"") sound for the second syllable.,
Put it all together!,
Optionally, end with the French “Toh”.",How to Pronounce Louis Vuitton1," All you need to do is say the male English name ""Louie"" (as in Louis C.K., Louis Armstrong, Louis XIV, and so on). That's it! No extra work required.


Trivia: The Louis Vuitton brand is named after its founder, Louis Vuitton, a French craftsman and businessman who started the company in the 1850s. That's why the first word in the company's name can be pronounced like the name ""Louie"" — it is that name.;
, The first syllable should be pronounced ""vit"" (rhymes with ""fit""). Ignore the U — in English, it's more or less silent.


You can also use a softer ""voot"" sound (rhymes with ""foot""; not ""boot"") if you prefer.

, Put the the stress in the word on this syllable — it's ""vit-TAHN"", not ""VIT-tahn"".


In English, stressing the second syllable of a two-syllable word is usually used for verbs, not nouns.However, in this case, most native speakers don't find this confusing — perhaps because the word has a foreign origin.

, You've got everything you need to say ""Louis Vuitton"" now! Give it a few tries: ""Loo-ee Vit-ahn."" Practice makes perfect, so don't be afraid to start saying it out loud, even if others are around.

, Some English speakers who like to sound fancy or high-class when they're talking about the bag they just bought throw in just a little French pronunciation at the very end of the typical English version of ""Louis Vuitton."" To do this, instead of ending with the normal ""tahn"" sound, try ""toh"" (almost rhymes with ""thaw""). This isn't quite how the French say it, but for the average English speaker, it's a good compromise compared to trying to work out tricky French vowels.


For extra points, try to push just a little air out of your nose when you end the word. If you do it right, you'll sound just a little stuck-up — the perfect compliment to that ""just bought a new bag"" feeling.

Look up words you’re curious about.,
Follow up on surprising word origins.,
Recognize related words.",How to Study the Etymology of Words2," Now that you know what to look for, start studying the etymology of those words that make you wonder: “where did this come from?” It’s an entertaining way to get to know the historical meaning behind the things you say, and you’ll often be surprised about where they come from.


It’s also edifying to look up those words that seem so normal that you’ve taken their origins for granted. For instance, if you study the etymology of a familiar word like “nostril,” you’ll find that it comes from Old English “nosu” (nose) and “pyrel” or “thrill” (hole). It’s literally a “nose hole.” You’ll also note that “pyrel” and “thrill” once sounded alike in English, which shows how far the language has developed phonically. That also means that the word “nostril” is surprisingly related to the word “thrilling.”

, If what you find when you look into the etymology of a particular word does not make obvious sense today, do some research to figure out why its original meaning is what it is.


For instance, you may wonder where a word like “disaster” came from. When you look it up, you’ll find that its Greek roots are the negative prefix “dis” and “astron” (star). So, it’s earliest meaning was something like “bad star.” This might be surprising until you consider Greek astrology and their strong belief that celestial bodies exerted control over our lives on Earth., Now that you know the origin of a particular word, you can use it to identify words with similar histories and therefore with related sounds and meanings.


In the case of etymology, there are not a lot of related words, but you can see that “etymological,” “etymologically,” and “etymologist” are all closely related forms. In the case of a word like “autopsy” with the Greek root “autos” (meaning, “self”), there’ll be a whole host of related words, from “autonomy” (self-governing) to “automobile” (self-moving) to “automatic” (self-acting)."

Say “Lwee.” Saying ""Louis Vuitton"" with its real French pronunciation is a little trickier than saying it in its English form.,
Say “Vwee.” Unlike in English, the U in ""Vuitton"" isn't silent in French.,
Say “Toh.” In French, the ""-on"" ending, with very few exceptions, has a silent ""N"" sound.,
Put it all together!,
For perfect pronunciation, use a French “ou” sound.",How to Pronounce Louis Vuitton2," First, let's tackle ""Louis."" The pronunciation here is similar to the way it is in English, but not identical. In French, ""Louis"" is said very quickly (almost as a single syllable). The result is that the ""lou"" sound at the start of the word becomes very short. For an English speaker, it's easiest to approximate this by simply shortening the word to ""lwee.""

, Give it a light W sound. Don't ""dig in"" with the W sound — try to keep your lips from pursing too closely In English, Ws almost never follow Vs, so this syllable can be a little counter-intuitive, but be patient and you should get it before long.


The I in Vuitton should have the same sound as the long E vowel sound in ""squeeze."" However, it should be very quick, so if it ends up sounding a little like the I sound in ""thin"", it's OK.

, This means that you basically only need to make an ordinary ""O"" sound (like in ""low"" or ""so""). However, to sound truly French, you'll want to ""nasalize"" this vowel by pronouncing it partly with your nose.Try to keep your lips from pursing as they would in English when making the ""O"" sound. Instead, keep your mouth open slightly and your tongue in the middle of your mouth.


Try this easy test to see if you're saying ""toh"" correctly: put your finger just under your nose as if you're about to sneeze, then try saying the syllable. You should feel a tiny puff of air from your nose — this and many other French words use nasal sounds as part of their normal pronunciation., You're all ready to say ""Louis Vuitton"" like a native speaker. Follow all the rules above as you combine the syllables you've been practicing into one coherent whole. Your pronunciation of ""Louis Vuitton"" should sound a little like ""Lwee VwitOH."" Practice makes perfect, so don't be afraid to try saying it a few times on your own before you start saying it in public!


If you're having trouble, try listening to a French speaker say the words. If you don't know any, just use your preferred search engine to run a quick search for ""Louis Vuitton French Pronunciation"" — you should easily find at least a few helpful video guides.

, The instructions above will have you saying ""Louis Vuitton"" with a close approximation of an actual French accent, but they're not quite perfect. In French, the ""ou"" vowel combination can actually sometimes result in a sound that isn't used in English.For your pronunciation of ""Louis Vuitton"" to be perfect, you'll want to practice this vowel sound and use it in ""Louis"" in place of the English ""oo"" sound you may have been making before.


To practice this new ""ou"" sound, start out by saying the English ""O"" sound as in ""glow"" or ""snow"". Purse your lips close together — you're trying to look like you're drinking out of an invisible straw. Finally, without moving your mouth, start saying the English ""E"" sound as in ""free"" or ""glee"". The sound that comes out of your mouth should be a combination of ""O"" and ""E"" that sounds odd to English-speaking ears. This is the sound you'll want to use for ""Louis!""

Pronounce Damier ""dah-myay."",
Pronounce Multicolor ""mooltee-colohr."",
Pronounce Tahitiennes ""tah-ee-tee-enneh."",
Pronounce Popincourt ""pope-in-cohre."",
Pronounce Batignolles ""bat-een-yoleh.""",How to Pronounce Louis Vuitton3," Once you've mastered the name of the label itself, try teaching yourself how to pronounce some of the tongue-twisting French names of its products. For starters, try pronouncing ""Damier."" The first syllable is easy: ""dahm"" rhymes with ""bomb."" The second is a little trickier: ""myay"" rhymes with ""play."" Don't forget to sound out the I in the word — it's ""DahMYAY,"" not ""DahMAY.""


Keep in mind that, in French, the ""-ier"" ending almost always has a silent R sound.

, To pronounce this bag's name, you have to use long vowel sounds for every vowel you encounter. The first syllable, ""mool"", rhymes with ""pool"". The next, ""tee"", is pronounced how it sounds. The third syllable, ""col"", sounds like ""coal."" Finally, the ending syllable sounds like ""lore"", only with a light, delicate R sound made by pressing the back of your tongue against the top of your mouth.


Don't forget that, in French, I usually has an ""ee"" sound (not an ""eye"" sound). Thus, you would never say ""mult-EYEcolor.""

, The tricky part of pronouncing ""Tahitiennes"" is ignoring the way it's spelled, which can cause problems for English speakers. Simply sound out the first three syllables, ""tah,"" ""ee,"" and ""tee"". The last two are a little trickier — they're pronounced ""enn-uh"", with no S sound, even thought there's an S at the end of the word. Don't forget the final ""eh"" or ""uh"" syllable. It should be delicate, but audible.


Note that the French H sound here is very light or silent. The word doesn't have an audible ""hee"" sound as in the English ""Tahitian.""

, It can be tempting to pronounce this word ""Poppin Court,"" but resist it! Instead, say ""pope,"" then ""in"", then ""cohre"" (rhymes with ""bore""). Use the same light, delicate R sound as in ""Damier"" to end the word, rather than a hard English R.


Don't pronounce the T at the end of the word — once again, the final consonant is silent here.

, In French, the ""gn"" consonant pair makes a ""nyuh"" sound like the n in ""habañero."" With that in mind, pronounce ""Batignolles"" by sounding out the syllables ""bat"", ""een"" (rhymes with ""mean""), ""yol"" (rhymes with ""role""), and ""eh"". As with Tahitiennes, the final S is silent, but there is still a very light fourth ""eh"" syllable.

Either get them from your teacher, your textbook, a play, song lyrics, or whatever source that you’ll be taking them from. It is best to print out the words and then write the word out next to the printed word before you even begin. This will be your first step in memorizing them.;
, Divide the list into manageable smaller lists. If you want to memorize them in order, that’s okay. If you don’t need to memorize them in order, then break them up so that you spread words that begin with vowels throughout your sub lists. Breaking your word list up will make it so you can more easily create word association and mnemonic devices to memorize your words.


Keep your words together if you're memorizing lines for a play or music lyrics.
Feel free to mix your words up if you're memorizing for vocabulary or spelling.
Use your best judgement when and if you'll be breaking your list up and moving words around.

, You’re going to use the first letter of every word to create memory devices that will make it easier to memorize the words. You’ll do this two ways: either creating a sentence or an acronym.


The first letter of every word will create an acronym.
For the order of operations in math (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction), you’ll have p, e, m, d, a, and s. This will spell P.E.M.D.A.S.
Acronyms should work for almost any usage (vocabulary, spelling, lyrics, or a play).
This works best with word lists of 10 or less., Now spend a little time memorizing your acronym (P.E.M.D.A.S.) This shouldn’t take too long, and before long you’ll have it memorized. This might be as far as you need to go with this approach., If you want to take an extra step to memorize your sub list, take the first letter of every word (your acronym), and create a sentence based on those letter. You’ll do this by using any word that begins with the first letter of the words on your sub list. For instance:


You won’t be using the original word, simply another word that begins with the same first letter.
To remember the order of operations in math (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction), take P.E.M.D.A.S. and assign words to it.
P.E.M.D.A.S. can be transformed into “Please excuse my dear aunt Sally” or any other number of short sentences.Creating a sentence like this works best for vocabulary, spelling, and similar purposes.

, After you’ve memorized a few of your sub lists, stop and review them. Don’t spend hours doing this, as your brain will probably be overloading. This method works best when you provide enough time in between memorization.

Spend time reviewing your picture, your web, and your story.",How to Memorize Words Quickly2," Prepare the list of words you need to memorize. Either get them from your teacher, your textbook, a play, song lyrics, or whatever source that you’ll be taking them from. It is best to print out the words and then write the word out next to the printed word before you even begin. This will be your first step in memorizing them.

, Drawing a picture that describes each word will help you remember it better. Make sure to maintain the original meaning of each word as best as you can.


Nouns might be easiest, as you’ll just have to draw the person, place, or thing.
Adjectives will be somewhat easy. Words like “big” and “beautiful” will be relatively easy to draw.
Verbs might be more difficult. For a word like “associate” try to draw its meaning (the connection between things).This works best for vocabulary and spelling.

, Word association webs will help you remember words by associating them with other words. This is a great visual way of memorizing words quickly and will complement other visual approaches to memorization.


Write the word you want to remember on the center of a sheet of paper.
Draw lines outward from the center connecting the center word to other words that you associate with it. For example, if the word is “winter” draw a line outward connecting it to “snow” and another line on the other side connecting it to “freezing” and another line on the side connecting it to “ice.” Repeat this process outward until you’re confident you will remember it.
This should not take more than 3-5 minutes per word.
If you're memorizing lines for a play or music lyrics, try a linear approach, put your words in order, and connect them with lines. Branch out from your lyrics with other words that have a similar meaning or evoke a similar feeling., Creating a picture story is similar to creating a word or sentence story, but instead of writing it out, you’ll be drawing your story. This method works great for very visual and artistic learners who might be overwhelmed with writing out vocabulary and building sentences.


Take your list of words and quickly draw a picture for each word.
Try to maintain the original meaning of the word, if you can.
Organize the pictures so they make a story you can remember.
This will work great when paired with word association and mnemonic devices.
This will also work great for memorizing lyrics or play lines. As you'll be associating pictures with your words., The more time your spend looking at and thinking about your visual aids, the better prepared you’ll be and the better you’ll remember your word list. Spread this out over a couple days if possible. Review your visual aids when you have time. Consider:


Reviewing them while eating.
Looking at them when you have down time in between other tasks and projects.
Spending a couple minutes looking at them and thinking about them when you wake up and before you go to sleep.

It is best to print out the words and then write the word out next to the printed word before you even begin. This will be your first step in memorizing them.

, After you’ve got your list, arrange the words in a way so that you can create a couple sentences or a story with the words. You don’t want to just build clunky sentences, though. Consider:


Rhyming words.
Pairing words cleverly.
This works best if you don’t have to know the words in a certain order.
You will be keeping the meaning of each word.

, Finding a memorable tune to accompany your arranged words will help you remember them more easily. Think about popular songs or songs that you can easily remember the tune to. Consider the tunes from:


Your current favorite pop songs.
Traditional folk tunes like “Molly Malone” or “John Brown’s Body.”
Pledges, anthems, or hymns, like the American Pledge of Allegiance, the American Marine hymn, or Hail Britannia.
If you're trying to remember song lyrics, you'll of course use your own tune. Try pairing your lyrics and tune with a picture story., After you’ve arranged your words, say the words to yourself out loud. Afterwords, sing or rap the words. This way, you’ve taken your word list, associated with a tune, and now have your own song to memorize! You can sing it to yourself when you’re taking a test or trying to remember your word list., As you go about your daily chores or travel, sing or repeat the song or tune over and over again. If you've recorded the song or tune (you singing/saying the words over and over), play it back while you're resting, or even sleeping. If you do record it, put the tune, rap or song on loop., Keep doing this until it feels as if the words and their meanings have stuck in your memory. Music is a great aid to memory, which is why it's so easy to remember pop songs. As a result, this should be a very pleasant and potentially enjoyable way of getting your work done.

Make all words five letters and longer capital.,

Locate all adverbs and capitalize them.,
Avoid capitalizing conjunctions.,
Don’t capitalize prepositions.,
Leave articles lowercase.",How to Capitalize a Book Title," Even if the words are prepositions or conjunctions, which are not usually capitalized, they should be capitalized if they are five letters or more.To demonstrate, the conjunction “between” is capitalized, such as in the novel The Light Between the Oceans.
There are some styles that take exception to this rule. Associated Press and MLA capitalize words with four or more letters, APA with five or more, and Chicago Manual of Style doesn’t base capitalization on word length.Always be aware of what style is required.;
, Despite word length, and whether the word is a conjunction, preposition, or an article, the first and last words should always be capitalized.For example, in the novel Of Mice and Men, the word “of” is capitalized even though it is a preposition that is less than five letters.

, Regardless of word length, part of speech, or position of the word within the title, these words are always capitalized., The content within the parentheses should follow the same rules regarding parts of speech and word length. However, they do not follow the rule about capitalizing the first and last words within a title, unless the parentheses actually appear at the beginning or end of the book title.To illustrate, in the book (Un)arranged, the prefix “un” is capitalized because it appears as the first “word” of the book title.
However, when the parentheses appear in the middle of the title, such as in the book How Carrots Won the Trojan War: Curious (but True) Stories of Common Vegetables, all capitalization rules apply. The word “but” is not capitalized because it is a conjunction, while the word “true” is capitalized because it is an adjective.

, A noun is defined as a word that identifies a person, animal, place, thing, or idea.Capitalize all nouns, even if they are less than five letters.For instance, in the title Animal Farm the word “animal” is capitalized because it is an animal, and “farm” is capitalized because it is a thing (despite being less than five letters).

, Verbs are “doing” words that express a physical action, a mental action, or a state of being.Capitalize all verbs, even if they contain fewer than five letters.For example, in the novel To Kill a Mocking Bird, “kill” is capitalized because it is an action verb, even though it is less than five letters.
Common verbs that cause difficulty are: be, been, am, are, is, was, and were. For instance, in the title I Am the Walrus, “am” is capitalized because it is a verb that demonstrates the action of being., Adjectives are words that describe or modify a noun. They are used to describe what kind, what color, or how many nouns are being described.Capitalize any words that describe nouns, even if they are less than five letters in length.To demonstrate, in the book One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish, all numbers are capitalized because they are adjectives and describe how many fish are present. Additionally, the colors “red” and “blue” are capitalized because they describe the looks of the fish.

, Adverbs modify verbs and describe when, where, or how an action is completed.Adverbs will often end in “ly” but they do not always. Capitalize any adverbs, even if they are less than five letters long.To illustrate, the word “barefoot” in the novel, Running Barefoot, is capitalized because it describes how one is running.
Occasionally, the conjunction/preposition “but” will function as an adverb, and should be capitalized in these situations. When it is used as an adverb, it will immediately follow a verb and can be replaced by words like “only” or “just”. For example, in the title Life Is But a Dream, “but” is capitalized because it describes the verb “is”., Conjunctions are words that join together other words, or groups of words. Common conjunctions are words such as “and,” “or,” and “nor”. Conjunctions should only be capitalized if they are five letters or more in length.


For example, in the novel The Old Man and the Sea, the word “and” remains un-capitalized because it is a conjunction that is of lesser importance, and is only used to join together groups of words.
Regardless of length, conjunctions should be capitalized if they are the first or last word of the title., The word preposition means “positioned before,” so prepositions are words that precede a noun, and demonstrate a relationship between two words. Common prepositions include: in, on, at, around, above, from, of and for.Avoid capitalizing prepositions, unless they are five letters or longer.


To demonstrate, in the novel The Wizard of Oz, “of” is the preposition which shows the relationship between the Wizard, and the land of Oz. It remains lowercase because it is a preposition that is less than five letters.
Prepositions that are five letters or longer should be capitalized. For instance, the preposition “among” is capitalized in the novel, A Walk Among the Tombstones.
Regardless of length, prepositions should be capitalized if they are the first or last word of the title., Articles are used to demonstrate to the reader whether a noun is specific or non-specific. Articles in English include “the,” which is a definite article, and “a,” and “an,” which are indefinite articles.To illustrate, in the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, “a” is an indefinite article, and is therefore not capitalized.
The only time articles should be capitalized is when they are the first or last word of the title.For instance, in The Great Gatsby, the article “the” is capitalized as the first word of the title.

Determine your present level of vocabulary.,
Read a dictionary.,
Buy a few books to assist in your studies.,
Begin at your present level.,
Prepare a study schedule.,
Subscribe to a website which sends A Word A Day to your Inbox.,
Say each word as you read it.,
Write down the definition of any new word you learn.,
Repeat the word you learn each day, adding one new word every day.,
Consider studying etymology, the history of words, and mnemonics.",How to Master English Words," This is something you can do by taking few Vocabulary tests which are available through a variety of websites. By taking these tests, you will come to know the strengths and weaknesses in your present level of vocabulary, Prepare your own list of vocabulary that you can go through everyday.;
, A dictionary is a good resource for learning and mastering English words. You don't have to read it cover to cover, just pick out a few words that interest you and learn how to use the properly. Alternatively, try an encyclopedia.

, Go to any good library or bookstore and find a knowledgeable member of staff to help you. This person may be able to listen to you speaking English and then help determine the books that will be the most useful to you

, If your level of vocabulary level is high, start at the highest level where you recognize and understand every word put before you. If your vocabulary is small, work gradually to improve in constant, small steps.

, Follow your schedule, even if it is only for 30 minutes per week, once a week. It's better if you can spend 10 minutes per day - daily usage and practice will help fastest.

, One such site is through Merriam-Webster, the dictionary company. You can find many others, as well.

, This is very important. Make sure your pronunciation is correct. There's nothing more embarrassing than trying to impress people with your newfound language skills, only to find out that the word you were going for was pronounced ""Fa-SEE-Shus,"" not ""Fa-KET-EE-uss."" (That's ""facetious,"" by the way.) Pronouncing the words out loud will help them form naturally when you speak them in front of others. It is especially important for non-native speakers to do this as English pronunciation of letters and sounds may differ from your native language. English bis notoriously tricky to master as so many of its 'rules' have exceptions.

, Write a few sentences using the words too. This will help them stick in your head, along with the meanings. Read your sentences aloud, making sure to pronounce carefully. There is, potentially, a little muscle memory at play here - forming the words correctly the first few times will ensure that you always form them this same way. If you start saying a word wrong, it's really hard to get your brain around to saying it the correct way later. If your English skills are quite advanced, why not combine the vocabulary you've learnt over a number of days, perhaps a week, or 10 days, into a short story.

, As you feel sure you will not forget word #1, drop it from the list, and continue.

, Many people believe the best way to master words is to learn them through etymology and mnemonics. Learn a root so that you can learn many other words based on that root. For example the word 'literate'. Once you know that word, you can learn the modifications to that word, such as: illiterate, literature, literacy, literalism and a host of other words, to assist you in your mastery of English words.

Gather your supplies.,
Write down the vocabulary words on one side of the cards.,
Write down the definitions on the other side.,
Use neat hand-writing.",How to Make and Organize Vocabulary Index Cards1," In order to make flashcards by hand, you should first gather your supplies. You can get most of the supplies you need at a local department store. You may also find some materials at an office supply store.


You will need index cards, which are 3 by 5 inch cards on which you'll be writing your vocabulary terms.
You'll need a pen and a pencil. It's a good idea to write the cards down in pencil first, in case you misspell something, and then trace over them in pen so they're clear and easy to read.
Consider investing in several different colors of pen. This way, you can color-coordinate your cards by subject or unit. Choose colors you can easily read, however. Something written in yellow ink may be hard to make out, while something written in blue or red is easily readable.;
, Vocabulary index cards are very simple to make. To start, write down the vocabulary term on one side of each card. Usually, index cards have one lined side and one blank side. It's a good idea to write the vocabulary term on the blank side, as you can use the lines to guide your writing when you write down definitions.Write the words in pencil first and then write over them in pen.
Color coordinate the cards as needed. For example, all the vocabulary from English class can be written in red. All the vocabulary from history class can be written in blue. This way, if the cards accidentally get jumbled, you can easily separate them again by subject.You can also color coordinate by difficulty. For example, you could write the vocabulary words you already know in green, the tougher ones in red, and the extremely challenging ones in blue.

, When you've written all the vocabulary words on the blank side of the cards, flip your stack over. Write down the definitions of the terms on the lined side of your index cards.


Write slowly. You want to make sure your handwriting is as neat as possible. If you cannot read the definition for a particular word, your index cards will not be effective.
Make sure you leave yourself enough room. Some words may have longer definitions. Try to write small for these words.

, When writing index cards, try to use your best handwriting possible. You do not want your cards to be illegible. Write slowly and neatly through all of your cards.


Take breaks when necessary. If your hand begins to feel tired, this can affect the legibility of your handwriting.
Limit how much you put on each card. Try to only write down one vocabulary word per card. Writing too small could cause your handwriting to become muddled and hard to understand."

Love words.,
Look up words you don't know whenever you encounter them.,
Use a Thesaurus.,
There are many computer programs and websites that have ways of giving you a short ""Word of the Day"" list with new words every day.,
Get a personalized Google homepage and click on ""Add Content"".,
Read.,
Play word games with friends.,
Use the words you learn when you're talking to people or writing letters or e-mail.,
Learn roots, prefixes, and suffixes.,
If you learn any romance language (eg: French, Spanish, Italian), or Latin or Ancient Greek, these will help you immensely with improving your vocabulary, especially the two ancient languages here because so many complicated English words are derived from words that are simple and commonly used in them.

,
Find a friend who speaks English.,
Listen to the radio, watch television, or find a podcast that you like in English, and practice understanding the language when spoken, too.

",How to Enrich Your English Language Vocabulary," You have to really want to learn new vocabulary if you're going to succeed.

, After encountering and looking up a word several times, you should eventually be able to remember its definition. Try them in your regular conversation so you will be sure when and where to use them.

, A thesaurus is a great resource which enables you to know the more advanced equivalent of basic English words.

, Try going to www.dictionary.com. Scroll down and click on ""Get the Word of the Day e-mail"". If you enter all of the required information, you will get a new e-mail every day with a word, its definition, and an example usage sentence.

, Search for ""word of the day"" in the search box, and pick some of the content choices that you'd like to have on your homepage. We recommend Merriam-Webster (www.m-w.com), Dictionary.com, and Wordsmith.org. When you log on to your homepage, there will be a list of new words every day.

, Read all genres of books. When you come across a word you don't know, read the sentences around the word and try to figure out what it means from the context. Check your guess with a dictionary. This doesn't mean you should start reading medical textbooks or other books with lots of new words on every page. Set aside time each day to sit down with your book. Enjoy yourself!

, Try Boggle, Scrabble, or Catch-Phrase. There are so many great games out there to teach you new words. If a friend comes up with a word that you don't know, ask them what it means.

, Using your new vocabulary is not only fun, but a great way to remember all these new words. Try to use at least three new words a day when communicating with anyone.

, Many words in the English language come from Latin or Greek words. When you combine these Latin or Greek words, you get new words in English. For example: astro (""astron"" meaning ""star"") + logy (logos meaning ""speech"") = astrology (meaning ""telling of the stars""). Buy an etymological dictionary (meaning ""a dictionary of word origins"").

,, It's good to practice using your new words. With a web connection, your conversation partner does not need to live near you. You can email, chat, and even phone each other using your computers. A friend who understands that you are learning can help you practice, use new words in your conversations, and offer you advice. Since talking to a friend is fun, it won't feel like work! If your friend wants to learn your language, too, it will be easier for both of you to understand each other's mistakes.

Find a safe place to store the cards.,
Always stack cards in the same direction.,
Divide the cards to study sessions.,
Store your cards in a designated study space.",How to Make and Organize Vocabulary Index Cards2," Make sure you store your flashcards in a safe place. You want to store them somewhere where they'll stay in order and not get damaged and smudged.


You can store index cards in your desk at school or at home. You can also keep them in a binder, folder, or empty pencil box. You may want to tie a rubber band around the index cards to keep them in place.
You can also punch a hole in the top right or left corner of each index card. Then, you can purchase a metal ring, like you would use for a key ring, and place the cards through the ring. This will make them easy to flip through when studying and keep them in the order you want. One small downside to this method, however, is that you may want to reorganize the cards on occasion. Changing the order of things slightly when studying can help improve memory. It may be cumbersome to adjust the order of your cards if you have to remove them from a ring.

, When you finish using your index cards, make sure they're stacked in the same direction. For example, make sure the sides with the vocabulary words are pointed up while the sides with the definitions are pointed down. This way, you can more easily keep things consistent when you're studying.

, For effective studying, you should not try to cram everything into a signal session. It's recommended that you study 30 minutes to an hour at a time, with breaks in between. Organize your index cards to accommodate short study sessions.Try to figure out how much vocabulary you can reasonably learn in an hour. For example, maybe you can set out to learn 10 words. Divide your cards into sets of 10.
You may have to do some trial and error to figure out a good pace for you. You may find, for example, it takes you less than an hour to learn 10 words or that it takes you a lot longer. You can add more or less cards to the deck for your next study session.

, Where you study matters a lot in terms of effectiveness. When you're studying, you should bring all the materials you need and leave behind any unnecessary materials.Try storing your index cards on your desk or workspace. This way, when you go there to study your cards will be there waiting.

Type your index cards.,
Get flashcards for your computer.,
Look into downloading flashcards on a Kindle or other device.,
Eliminate distractions when working from an electronic device.",How to Make and Organize Vocabulary Index Cards3," If your handwriting is particularly bad, consider typing your cards on a word processor. You can print out pieces of paper with vocabulary words and definitions written on them. Then, you can cut out these chunks of texts and glue them on cards. Some printers, however, may have a feature where you can print directly on to index cards. Check your printer's settings and see if this is possible. Printed, typed index cards may be more effective as it lessens the risk of illegibility or misspelling.

, There are many websites and softwares that allow you to create and print flashcards to use on your computer. If you don't mind reading and studying from a screen, this could be a great way to save time.


Quizlet and StudyBeans are websites that allow you to create flashcards to use online by typing in the terms and definitions you need to memorize. The sites will then automatically generate flashcards you can use.If you're studying vocabulary for the SAT, UnderGrad Flash is a computer program that contains flashcards and study guides for SAT vocabulary terms.If you're studying vocabulary for the GRE, GradFlash and Kaplan GRE Vocabulary Exam Flashcards offer digital flashcards containing GRE words., If you have a Kindle or a similar device, there are many applications and softwares you can purchase or download for free that can generate vocabulary flashcards. Websites like Quizlet and StudyBeans can easily be accessed and used through Kindle.The main advantage to using Kindle over a regular computer is that you can take your Kindle anywhere. As many people read on their Kindle frequently, you may find it easier to concentrate on that device. Your mind is already prepped for reading and comprehension when you turn on your Kindle.You can also add images to the flashcards, as well as organize them by subject, unit, or study session using Kindle., The major downside to using flashcards on a computer is the potential for distractions. You have access to the internet, as well as games, pictures, and so on. If you choose to use flashcards on a computer or portable electronic device, take steps to lessen distractions.


Disconnect from the internet, if you're able to use the flashcards without going online. In fact, it may be a good idea to go to a place where you cannot get a WiFi connection. This removes the temptation altogether.
If you have to be online to access your flashcards, sign out of all social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter. You should also close any programs running in the background that may be distracting.

It is not found on the real number line at all. 

Some examples of complex numbers are listed below. Notice that the number 3 is a complex number. It just has an imaginary component equal to 0, because 0i=0.{\displaystyle 0i=0.}


2+3i{\displaystyle 2+3i}


4−i{\displaystyle 4-i}


3{\displaystyle 3}



By convention, complex numbers are denoted using the variables z{\displaystyle z} and w,{\displaystyle w,} similar to x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} denoting some real numbers. So we say that z=a+bi.{\displaystyle z=a+bi.} Some authors may say z=x+iy.{\displaystyle z=x+iy.}

As we can see, now we have a solution to the equation x2+1=0.{\displaystyle x^{2}+1=0.} After using the quadratic formula, we have x=±i.{\displaystyle x=\pm i.}
;
, We said that i=−1.{\displaystyle i={\sqrt {-1}}.} Then i2=−1.{\displaystyle i^{2}=-1.} If we multiply that with i{\displaystyle i} again, we get i3=−i.{\displaystyle i^{3}=-i.} Multiply i2{\displaystyle i^{2}} with itself and we get i4=1.{\displaystyle i^{4}=1.} This underscores a strange property of the imaginary unit. It takes four cycles to get to 1 (a positive number), whereas a number on the real number line -1 takes just two. 
, A real number is a number that you are already familiar with; it exists on the real number line. A purely imaginary number is a number that is some multiple of i.{\displaystyle i.} The key concept to note here is that none of these purely imaginary numbers lie on the real number line. Instead, they lie on the imaginary number line.

Below are some examples of real numbers.


6{\displaystyle 6}


145231{\displaystyle {\frac {145}{231}}}


π{\displaystyle \pi }



Below are some examples of imaginary numbers.


2i{\displaystyle 2i}


(3+5)i{\displaystyle ({\sqrt {3}}+{\sqrt {5}})i}



What do all five of these numbers have in common? They are all part of the field known as the complex numbers. 

The number 0 is notable for being both real and imaginary. 


, In order to facilitate the imaginary numbers, we must draw a separate axis. This vertical axis is called the imaginary axis, denoted by the Im{\displaystyle {\mathrm {Im} }} in the graph above. Similarly, the real number line that you are familiar with is the horizontal line, denoted by Re.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {Re} }.} Our real number line has now been extended into the two-dimensional complex plane, sometimes called an Argand diagram.

As we can see, the number a+bi{\displaystyle a+bi} can be represented on the complex plane by drawing an arrow from the origin to that point. 

A complex number can also be thought of as the coordinates on a plane, though it is extremely important to understand that we are not dealing with the real xy-plane. It just looks the same because both are two-dimensional.

Perhaps one of the most nonintuitive part of understanding complex numbers is that every number system that we have dealt with – integers, rationals, reals – are deemed to be ""ordered."" For example, it makes sense to think of 6 as being greater than 4. But in the complex plane, it is meaningless to compare if 4+i{\displaystyle 4+i} is greater than 3+2i.{\displaystyle 3+2i.} In other words, the complex numbers are an unordered field. 


, By definition, every complex number can be written in the form z=a+bi.{\displaystyle z=a+bi.} We know that i=−1,{\displaystyle i={\sqrt {-1}},} so what do a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} represent?


a{\displaystyle a} is called the real part of the complex number. We denote this by saying that Re⁡z=a.{\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} z=a.}


b{\displaystyle b} is called the imaginary part of the complex number. We denote this by saying that Im⁡z=b.{\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} z=b.}


(Important!) Both the real and imaginary parts are real numbers. So when someone refers to the imaginary part of some complex number w=c+di,{\displaystyle w=c+di,} they always refer to the real number d,{\displaystyle d,} not di.{\displaystyle di.} Certainly, di{\displaystyle di} is an imaginary number. But it is not the imaginary part of the complex number w.{\displaystyle w.}

As a basic exercise, find the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers given in step 1 of this part.


, The complex conjugate z¯=a−bi{\displaystyle {\bar {z}}=a-bi} is defined as z{\displaystyle z} but with the sign of the imaginary part reversed. Conjugates are very useful in a number of scenarios. You may already be familiar with the fact that complex solutions to polynomial equations come in conjugate pairs. That is, if z0{\displaystyle z_{0}} is a solution, then z0¯{\displaystyle {\bar {z_{0}}}} must also be one as well.

What is the significance of conjugates on the complex plane? They are the reflection over the real axis. As seen in the diagram above, the complex number z=x+iy{\displaystyle z=x+iy} has a real part x{\displaystyle x} and an imaginary part y.{\displaystyle y.} Its conjugate z¯=x−iy{\displaystyle {\bar {z}}=x-iy} has the same real part x{\displaystyle x} but a negated imaginary part −y.{\displaystyle -y.}


, Because complex numbers are defined such that they consist of two components, it makes sense to them of them as two-dimensional. From this perspective, it makes more sense to make analogies using functions of two real variables, instead of just one, even though most complex functions are functions of one complex variable.
, Now that we know what complex numbers are all about, let's do some arithmetic with them. Complex numbers are similar to vectors in this sense, because we add and subtract their components. 

Let's say that we wanted to add two complex numbers z=a+bi{\displaystyle z=a+bi} and w=c+di.{\displaystyle w=c+di.} Then adding these two complex numbers is as simple as adding the real and imaginary components separately. All we do is to add the real parts, add the imaginary parts, and sum them up.


z+w=(a+c)+(b+d)i{\displaystyle z+w=(a+c)+(b+d)i}



The same idea works for subtraction as well.


z−w=(a−c)+(b−d)i{\displaystyle z-w=(a-c)+(b-d)i}



Multiplication is similar to FOILing from algebra.


zw=(a+bi)(c+di)=(ac−bd)+(bc+ad)i{\displaystyle zw=(a+bi)(c+di)=(ac-bd)+(bc+ad)i}



Division is similar to rationalizing the denominator from algebra as well. We multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.


zw=a+bic+di=(a+bi)(c−di)(c+di)(c−di)=ac+bdc2+d2+bc−adc2+d2i{\displaystyle {\frac {z}{w}}={\frac {a+bi}{c+di}}={\frac {(a+bi)(c-di)}{(c+di)(c-di)}}={\frac {ac+bd}{c^{2}+d^{2}}}+{\frac {bc-ad}{c^{2}+d^{2}}}i}



The point of showing these steps is not to derive formulas to memorize, even though they do work. The point is to show that the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two complex numbers all must output another complex number that can be written in the form z=x+iy.{\displaystyle z=x+iy.} Adding two complex numbers gives another complex number, dividing two complex numbers also gives another complex number, etc.

While messy, the above substeps were shown so that we are confident that the arithmetic of complex numbers is consistent with the way that we have defined them.


, You are familiar with the commutative and associative properties of real numbers. Such properties extend into the complex numbers as well.

Adding two complex numbers is commutative, because we are adding the real components separately, and we know that addition of real numbers is commutative.


z+w=w+z{\displaystyle z+w=w+z}



Adding two complex numbers is associative, for a similar reason.


(z+w)+v=z+(w+v){\displaystyle (z+w)+v=z+(w+v)}



There exists an additive identity of the complex number system. This identity is called 0.


z+0=z{\displaystyle z+0=z}



There exists an additive inverse of a complex number. The sum of a complex number with its additive inverse is 0.


z+(−z)=0{\displaystyle z+(-z)=0}




, 

The commutative property holds for multiplication.


zw=wz{\displaystyle zw=wz}



The associative property holds for multiplication as well.


(zw)v=z(wv){\displaystyle (zw)v=z(wv)}



The distributive property holds for complex numbers.


z(w+v)=zw+zv{\displaystyle z(w+v)=zw+zv}



There exists a multiplicative identity of the complex number system. This identity is called 1.


z(1)=z{\displaystyle z(1)=z}



There exists an multiplicative inverse of a complex number. The product of a complex number with its multiplicative inverse is 1.


z1z=1{\displaystyle z{\frac {1}{z}}=1}



Why bother showing these properties? We need to make sure that the complex numbers are ""self-sufficient."" That is, they satisfy most of the properties of real numbers we are all familiar with, with one additional caveat foreign to the real number system: i2=−1,{\displaystyle i^{2}=-1,} which is what makes the complex numbers unique. The properties that have been laid out in the last two steps are needed to call the complex numbers a ""field."" For example, if there is no such thing as a multiplicative inverse of a complex number, then we cannot define what division is.

Although a rigorous concept of a field is beyond the scope of this article, basically, the idea is that the properties shown above must be true in order for things in the complex plane to work out for all complex numbers, just like the field of real numbers. Luckily, these concepts are all intuitive in the reals, so they can easily be extended to the complex numbers.


, On the real coordinate plane, coordinates can either be rectangular or polar. In the Cartesian system, any point can be labeled with a horizontal and a vertical component. In the polar system, a point is labeled with the distance from the origin (the magnitude) and the angle from the polar axis. Such coordinate transformations are given below.


x=rcos⁡θ{\displaystyle x=r\cos \theta }


y=rsin⁡θ{\displaystyle y=r\sin \theta }

Looking at the diagram above, the complex number z{\displaystyle z} has two pieces of information defining it: r{\displaystyle r} and ϕ.{\displaystyle \phi .} r{\displaystyle r} is called the modulus of the number, while ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } is called the argument.


, Substituting, we have the expression below.


z=r(cos⁡θ+isin⁡θ){\displaystyle z=r(\cos \theta +i\sin \theta )}

This is the complex number in polar form. We have its magnitude r=x2+y2{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}} on the outside. Inside the parentheses, we have the trigonometric components, related to the Cartesian coordinates by θ=tan−1yx.{\displaystyle \theta =\tan ^{-1}{\frac {y}{x}}.}

Sometimes, the expression inside the parentheses is written as cis⁡θ,{\displaystyle \operatorname {cis} \theta ,} which is an abbreviation for ""cosine plus i sine.""


, Euler's formula eiθ=cos⁡θ+isin⁡θ{\displaystyle e^{i\theta }=\cos \theta +i\sin \theta } is one of the most useful relations in complex analysis because it fundamentally links exponentiation to trigonometry. The next part of this article gives a visualization of the complex exponential function, while the classic series derivation is given in the tips.


z=reiθ{\displaystyle z=re^{i\theta }}

Right now, you may ask, how can any complex number be represented as some number times an exponential? The reason is that because complex exponentials are rotations in the complex plane, the eiθ{\displaystyle e^{i\theta }} term gives us the information about the angle. 


, We know that on the complex plane, the conjugate is simply a reflection over the real axis. That means that the cos⁡θ{\displaystyle \cos \theta } part is unchanged, but the sin⁡θ{\displaystyle \sin \theta } changes sign.


z¯=r(cos⁡θ−isin⁡θ){\displaystyle {\bar {z}}=r(\cos \theta -i\sin \theta )}

When we compact the notation using Euler's formula, we find that the sign of the exponent is negated.


z¯=re−iθ{\displaystyle {\bar {z}}=re^{-i\theta }}




, Recall from part 2 that, while addition and subtraction in Cartesian coordinates were straightforward, the other arithmetic operations were quite clumsy. In polar coordinates, however, they are made much easier.

To multiply two complex numbers is to multiply their moduli and add their arguments. We can do this because of the properties of exponents. 


z1z2=(r1eiθ1)(r2eiθ2)=r1r2ei(θ1+θ2){\displaystyle z_{1}z_{2}=(r_{1}e^{i\theta _{1}})(r_{2}e^{i\theta _{2}})=r_{1}r_{2}e^{i(\theta _{1}+\theta _{2})}}



To divide two complex numbers is to divide their moduli and subtract their arguments.


z1z2=r1eiθ1r2eiθ2=r1r2ei(θ1−θ2){\displaystyle {\frac {z_{1}}{z_{2}}}={\frac {r_{1}e^{i\theta _{1}}}{r_{2}e^{i\theta _{2}}}}={\frac {r_{1}}{r_{2}}}e^{i(\theta _{1}-\theta _{2})}}



Geometrically speaking, this makes complex numbers a lot easier to grasp, and simplifies pretty much everything associated with complex numbers in general.


, Complex functions require four dimensions to fully visualize their behavior, because a complex number is made up of two real parts. However, we can skirt past this obstacle by using hue and brightness as our parameters.

The brightness is the absolute value (modulus) of the output of the function. The plot of the exponential function below defines black to be 0.

The hue is the angle (argument) of the output of the function. One convention is to define red as the angle θ=0.{\displaystyle \theta =0.} Then, in increments of π3,{\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{3}},} the color goes from yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, to red again, across the color wheel. 


, The complex plot of the exponential function gives insights into how it can possibly be related to the trigonometric functions. 

When we restrict ourselves to the real axis, the brightness goes from dark (near 0) in the negatives, to light in the positives, as expected.

When we restrict ourselves to the imaginary axis, however, the brightness stays the same, but the hue changes periodically, with a period of 2π.{\displaystyle 2\pi .} This means that the complex exponential eiθ{\displaystyle e^{i\theta }} is periodic in the imaginary direction. This is to be expected from Euler's formula, because the trigonometric functions cos⁡θ{\displaystyle \cos \theta } and sin⁡θ{\displaystyle \sin \theta } are periodic with periods of 2π{\displaystyle 2\pi } each as well.

Be well-read.,
Understand the specific skills required of an online proofreader.,
Develop your computer skills.,
Consider formal training as a proofreader.,
Familiarize yourself with several stylebooks.,
Build a reference library.,
Practice your proofreading skills on what you read.",How to Become an Online Proofreader1," To be an online proofreader, or any proofreader, requires a love of reading. You should enjoy reading several forms of writing and become familiar with a number of writing styles, as well as acquire knowledge in a broad range of subjects.;
, Proofing online text successfully requires a knowledge of correct word usage and punctuation, spelling words correctly and recognizing common word confusions (""then"" for ""than,"" etc.), and understanding what the writer intended to say through careful re-reading of the text.

, Website text you'll proofread will either be sent to you by email, or you'll be given access to a site where the draft text can be downloaded from or edited directly. If you download the text to your computer, you'll need to be familiar with the proofreading and editing tools in your word processing program, such as Microsoft Word's ""Track Changes"" and ""Insert Comments"" features. If you proofread the text directly, you'll need to learn whatever online proofing tool you'll be asked to use.


Some clients may instead prefer you to print out the text, proofread it manually, then fax it back. In those cases, you'll need to know how to use a printer and fax, as well as the symbols used in proofreading and copyediting by hand.

, At a minimum, high school courses in English, journalism, and literature will give you a foundation in the language and proofreading skills you'll need to have. You can supplement this knowledge with courses at a college or university, a community college, or online, as well as with online tutorials.


Online classes are available from such organizations as eLearners, Universalclass.com, and Mediabistro.com.

, While classes can give you a foundation in English, the organizations you'll be working with often adopt an established style guide or create their own in-house guide. At a minimum, you should become familiar with the AP Style Guide, used by most newspapers and online news organizations and many websites, and the Yahoo Style Guide, used by many other organizations with a Web presence. Other stylebooks to consider include the Chicago Manual of Style, the New York Times Manual of Style, and the AMA Manual of Style.


For an overall refresher on usage, read ""The Elements of Style"" by William Strunk and E.B. White.

, In addition to the style manuals listed above, you should have a dictionary and thesaurus and, depending on the clients you plan to work for, specialized dictionaries of medical, scientific, legal, or financial terminology.


You should also become familiar with and bookmark reference websites such as Dictionary.com; however, it can sometimes be faster or more effective to look something up in a book than online.

, Look at books, newspapers, websites, and even the text displayed on TV news programs and commercials with a critical eye. This will teach you to spot errors in spelling, punctuation, and usage of words.

Use the spelling and grammar checker built into your word processor.,
Use standalone grammar-checking software.,
Use an online grammar checker.,
Have someone else read your work.,
Proofread it yourself.",How to Check Grammar1," Most word processing programs, such as Microsoft Word, feature a built-in spelling and grammar checker. These checkers can work passively, such as Word underlining misspelled words in red and incorrect grammar examples in green, or actively, reviewing your work and asking you whether you wish to correct highlighted incidences or leave them as they are.


All recent versions of Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Publisher, OneNote, and InfoPath) feature spell-check and grammar checking capabilities.;
, Although most word processing software includes spell- and grammar-checking capabilities, they usually miss a good many grammar errors and flag items as errors that aren't errors. Dedicated grammar-checking software, however, is designed to recognize more errors and exceptions than the grammar checkers built into word processing programs.


Grammar checking software can be purchased at software stores or online, either through an online retailer or direct from the manufacturer. Examples of grammar checking software include Correct English, Grammarly, WhiteSmoke, and Writer's Workbench.

, A number of websites allow users to cut and paste their text into an entry window on the site and have it analyzed for spelling and grammar. These sites are convenient for those writers who do a lot of writing online and have no access to other methods for checking their grammar.


Some sites are sponsored by companies who produce grammar-checking software for purchase or download, such as Grammarly, while others operate strictly as an online service. Usually, there is no cost to use the basic online checker, while more advanced features, either online or through the company's software product, require a fee.

, While the software options described above will catch many grammar errors, it's helpful to have a knowledgeable friend, classmate, or professional editor read your work over for grammatical accuracy either for a class or if you plan to publish it somewhere other than a personal blog.

, Even with the help of software or having someone else read your work, there's no substitute for learning the rules of grammar and checking what you've written yourself for spelling and grammar errors. The section ""What to Look For When Checking Grammar"" tells you some of the most important things to proofread for, and ""Things to Do When Checking Grammar"" offers advice on how to go about it.

, Practice being a Grammar Nazi as soon as you possibly can. Some people may get angry when you correct them. Therefore, it’s best to learn the different ways of telling someone that their grammar is incorrect with people who are less likely to get especially angry. Practice your skills during family meals and gatherings and learn how to interrupt people without making them too angry.

Be aware of how the method works.,
Draw a floor plan of your memory palace.,
Make a linear path through the floor plan.,
Number your “stations”.,
List your “stations” and add corresponding words from the dictionary.,
Apply imagery and action to each word using the memory palace.,
Add more rooms to your memory palace as you memorize more words.",How to Memorize the Dictionary1," The memory palace method is a type of mnemonic. This is a learning device that can help you recall difficult information. Everyone has a “memory palace”, which is a space in your mind where you build memories and store information, from images of the past to words and phrases.Think of your mind as one big memory palace. Within the palace, there are “stations” or separate spaces, like a bedroom or a sitting room. The distance between these rooms is called a “journey”. As you construct your memory palace, you can leave words and phrases at these stations and then pick them up later when you take a journey through your palace to retrieve them. This method will help you remember words from a text, such as a dictionary, in a limitless way, as there is no limit to how many rooms or spaces you can add to your memory palace.
The memory palace method is not just made for visual learners. Everyone has the ability to picture a palace or a home and the rooms or spaces in a palace or home. You can use your own home as a way to map out your memory palace, or create your own palace out of a combination of several familiar spaces.;
, Start by taking out a sheet of blank paper and a pen or pencil. Think about a home or space you are familiar with, like your family home, your school or your workplace. Choose a space that has multiple rooms. You can also combine spaces to form the layout of your memory palace.Start with the largest rooms. Arrange the rooms so they are in a circular or half circle shape with at least two exits. For example, your floor plan could include four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a large kitchen, a large living room, and a den, as well as long areas for a front yard and a backyard. Try to fit as many rooms as possible on the floor plan, without cramming rooms together. Leave enough space between the rooms to make a pathway.

, You want to make sure you can draw a linear path through the space. You should be able to move through the memory palace without reaching a dead end. This will allow you to move from station to station in the memory palace easily and avoid overlapping or getting trapped in one station.Use a pen to draw a clear linear path from one end to other end of the floorplan so it flows in a continuous path. If you were walking through the floorplan, you should be able to access every room or station on the path and move in a fluid line through the palace.

, Starting with “1”, number your stations in order, moving from one end of the floorplan to the other end. Try to fit at least four numbers in each corner of each room or station.For example, you may have 1,2,3,4 in one room on each corner of the room and then 5,6,7,8, in the next room on each corner of the room. This will allow you to store more than one word in a room and maximize the space in each room or station in the palace. Try to number up to at least “50” in your memory palace.

, Open a word document or use pen and paper to make a list of the stations on the floor plan. Include the numbers associated with each station or room. For example, “Bedroom” may have 1,2,3,4, listed underneath it and “Bathroom” may have 5,6,7,8, listed underneath it.Open the dictionary and choose words you would like to memorize. For example, you may start at the beginning of the dictionary with the letter “a”. Place the words in the list of stations, one for each number. If you are using “a” words in the dictionary, such as “aardvark, aardwolf, Aaron, aasvoel”, you will place them on lines 1,2,3,4 in the “Bedroom” of the memory palace. You can then place the next set of “a” words, “ab, aba, abac, abaca”, on lines 5,6,7,8 in the “Bathroom” of the memory place., Once you have situated the words from the dictionary in the stations of your memory palace, you can encode them so you remember where they are located. Do this by creating bright, colorful, and weird images that involve each word and associate them with a particular room in the memory palace.


For example, you may be trying to remember the set of words: “aardvark, aardwolf, Aaron, aasvoel”. You may create an weird and bold image that combines these words, such as an aardvark in a tutu dancing with an aardwolf named Aaron in your bedroom. The aardwolf may be singing to an aasvoël perched in the corner of the bedroom by the window. You can then imagine all four words existing together in one room of your memory palace and you likely will not forget the image of them interacting with each other in such a particular way.
You can then add these images to your list of rooms to keep track of the images associated with the words in a particular room. Try to keep the imagery and action to one to two sentences so they are easy to remember.

, As you work your way through the dictionary, you can add more stations or rooms to your palace. Focus on creating images with action for each set of words (3-4) so you can recall a set of words by picturing the room in your memory palace. This will strengthen your long term memory of each set of words and allow you to recall them easily.

Decide on the area(s) in which you wish to specialize.,
Use the Internet.,
Approach website owners directly.,
Build your own website.,
Consider volunteering your services initially.",How to Become an Online Proofreader2," If you have particular areas of interest, such as proofreading financial, legal, or medical websites, you may want to concentrate your efforts in these areas. You may need some additional training in your area(s) of specialty, but you may also reap more financial rewards and more personal satisfaction from specializing than from trying to proofread anything that comes across your radar.

, You can find a number of websites offering online proofreading jobs by typing ""online proofreading jobs"" or ""proofreading at home assignments"" into an Internet search engine. You can register with these sites, and you can list your services on job boards and freelance marketing sites.


Websites that specialize in providing proofreading and editing services include Mulberry Studio, Proofread NOW, and Wordfirm. Some services specialize in areas such as business communications, while others provide additional services such as transcription, indexing, or proofreading in multiple languages. Some services also offer promotional assistance to proofreaders who contract with them, such as the ability to create or link to their own websites. You may have to have at least 2 to 3 years of proofreading or editing experience, sufficient computer equipment and typing speed, and you may also have to take a test to qualify to work with them.
Freelance marketing sites include Elance, Guru, and Odesk.com. These sites list clients with jobs, and you bid competitively with other freelancers to win the job. Freelancers are listed on these sites by level of experience; some sites also offer enhanced listings for a fee.
Job boards include Monster.com and Jobs.com. You post a resume with your experience and set up a keyword search for jobs you're interested in. Job boards are devoted primarily to job seekers looking for full- or part-time work as employees of a company, but they may also offer telecommute positions or contract work as well.

, Look for websites with a lot of written content and approach the site owner or webmaster. Look in the Contact Us section of the website for email addresses; you'll want one with a person's name or at least ""webmaster"" in the address instead of a generic term such as ""info.""

, Having your own website will let you advertise your online proofreading services and show your professionalism to prospective clients. You'll have to develop your skills in search engine optimization (SEO) to help clients find your site in an Internet search, and you'll also have to make sure your site is free of spelling and grammatical errors.

, You can approach non-profit organizations and start-up businesses with an offer to proofread their websites for free, in exchange for referrals to other, paying clients. Be upfront about your purpose at the beginning, so that you receive the kind of referrals you want, instead of other volunteer assignments.

Learn to read your audience.",How to Impress Others With Your Words," To delight your friends and amuse your colleagues, you must have an expansive vocabulary. After all, language is power., One of the best ways to build your vocabulary is to encounter new and difficult words in context. Reading top-tier newspapers will expose you to new vocabulary words and inform you about the world in which you live -- both necessary components of witty repartee.Publications such as the New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly, The Economist, The New Yorker, and The Guardian are all excellent sources of elevated English.

, Another superlative source for vocabulary enrichment is classic fiction. Whether they’re short stories or triple-decker novels, classic works of fiction contain many unusual and interesting words.Consider reading “modern classics” such as Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy and Beloved by Toni Morrison in addition to the “traditional” authors such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Exposure to a wide variety of literary styles will help you sound urbane and witty, rather than outmoded., Non-fiction writing can provide you with rich sources of vocabulary in addition to informing you about important topics of the day. It will also inspire you with numerous writing styles and authorial voices, from which you can learn to hone your own.


The “Best American” series published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt offers a wide variety of genres and styles.

, This will send you a new word each day, along with its definition and customary usage.


A “word of the day” calendar could also be a fun way to expand your vocabulary on a daily basis.

, A thesaurus can be an effective way to learn unusual synonyms for common words. However, thesauruses group synonyms very loosely, so you cannot rely that words in a listing will all have the same nuances of meaning.


Use a dictionary to look up the synonyms you discover to ensure you use a word correctly.

, To impress people, you must know how to recognize opportunities in which you can be witty. Improvisation, or “improv” for short, teaches you valuable skills, such as being able to quickly respond to situations, think creatively, manage anxiety, and display self-confidence when speaking., Your impressive words will not pique your friends’ interest if you don’t sound comfortable using them. Practice using your new vocabulary as often as possible.Remember to be yourself. By all means be the best, most impressive version of you, but stay you.


,


“Bombastic” is a word that describes people who try to impress others by using language that is overblown or sounds inauthentic.Don’t be bombastic.

, About 70% of all communication is done through non-verbal communication, such as body language and gestures. In order to thrill your audience, you should convey confidence when you speak.Stand straight, with your chest out and your chin parallel to the floor. Balance your weight on both legs. Don’t fidget or shift your weight from foot to foot.Practice some controlled gestures. Don’t flail wildly about, but learn to emphasize words with appropriate hand gestures.
Make smooth and controlled movements. Don’t rush through your words or your gestures. Moving too quickly is a sign of nervousness.Make eye contact. Aim for the 50/70 rule: make eye contact about 50% of the time when speaking, and about 70% of the time when listening. Make eye contact with everyone in your group., Watch the world around you carefully, taking it all in. Expanding your reading with excellent sources such as newspapers and journals will help you stay informed about significant goings-on. When someone asks you your opinion on something, it needn’t be a typical ""I think this is good because...."" response. You will be able to express a fascinating opinion on any subject.

, This involves quick thinking by the speaker.

, One of the best ways to learn to read an audience is to watch and listen. A person who only listens to the sound of his own voice will not impress others.People who approach conversations as demonstrations of their own superiority to those around them will likely be perceived as arrogant, not awe-inspiring. Make sure to listen as well as speak. If you don’t listen, you will not be able to see opportune moments for wittiness.Don’t make stereotypical assumptions about your audience. Don’t assume that women will only want to discuss shopping or that men will only want to discuss sports.

Observe the way you write and speak.,
Learn the differences between the following:


I vs Me.,
Fun with Plurals.,
Subject Agreement.,
""Quotation Marks"" and __Underlining__.,
Commas and Semicolons.,
Capitalization.,
The Dangling Participle.",How to Avoid Common Usage and Grammar Mistakes," Speaking improperly is one thing; writing improperly, however, is a red flag. You can see how terrible your grammar is by simply writing an essay. The next time you have to write an essay for school or work, take a moment to look over your sentences and structure. If you can pick out a few pieces of improper writing, you're already half-way there.

, When trying to figure out which to use, remember who or what the subject is. For example, ""I"" would be the subject in the following sentence:

""Sofia and I are eating tacos for dinner tonight."" (""I"" is the subject because if you remove ""Sofia and"" and replace ""are"" with ""am"", you'll see that the sentence will still make sense.) ""I am eating tacos for dinner tonight.""
""Me"" would be the subject in the following sentence: ""Would you like to have dinner with Sofia and me?"" (Still not convinced? Remove ""Sofia and"" from that sentence and re-read it.) ""Would you like to have dinner with me?""


Your vs You're. Your is used as a possessive. You're is the contraction of ""you are"".

""Your acne has really cleared up!""
""Thanks! You're the first person to notice.""


There vs Their vs They're. There is used as a direction. Their is used as a possessive. They're is a contraction of ""they are"".

""Bye, Mom. I'm going to the movies with Danny and Logan. They're going to meet me at the front.""
""Do you know how to get there by yourself in case they're late?""
""Yeah. Their sister showed me how to get there from here.""
""They're going there with their sister too?""
""No, it's just the three of us.""


It's vs Its. It's is a contraction of ""it is"" and ""it has"". Its is used as a possessive.

""Look, Nate! A frog! It's hiding behind the leaves.""
""Wow, its eyes are huge!""


Using Apostrophes. A lot of people toss in apostrophes where they shouldn't be, like in plural nouns. Use apostrophes in contractions such as ""you're"", ""it's"", and ""there's"". Apostrophes are also used to show possession like in ""Mark's"" and ""Dr. Science's"". Also, when showing possession, remember this rule of thumb: if one person or thing owns something, the apostrophe goes before the ""s"". If more than one person or thing owns something, the apostrophe goes after the ""s"".

""The girls' dog likes to bark a lot.""
""Hobart's dog likes to bite a lot.""
A good exception to note: Children is already plural, so for possession, you add the apostrophe before the s, even though there is more than one individual; you'd say ""children's dog.""


Then vs Than. Then is used to show direction. Than is used as a comparison.

""I walked out of my house and then locked the door.""
""I would rather lock my door than have someone break in while I'm gone.""


Affect vs Effect. This one is simple to remember; affect means to influence and effect means to cause.

""The disastrous hurricane affected many people.""
""The overall effect was that homes and businesses were destroyed.""


Good vs Well. When describing a noun, use the word ""good"". When describing how something is done, use ""well"".

""Have you been good to your little sister today, Tommy?""
""Yeah, she still doesn't feel well.""


To vs Too. To is used to state a direction. Too is used as ""also.""

""I just got invited to Keith's pool party.""
""Wow, me too!""



, Remember the old adage: When a word ends in ""y"", drop the ""y"" and add ""ies"" to make it plural. If it ends in a vowel, add an ""s"". Add ""es"" when the last two letters of a word are consonants.


Taco -----> Tacos
Branch -----> Branches
Movie -----> Movies
Baby -----> Babies

, If you get in the habit of re-reading your sentences, this should never be a problem. The subject of the sentence (the part that the sentence is about) should always match the pronoun (he, she, etc.).


""Who forgot his or her lunch in the cubby?"" (Who is the subject of this sentence.) The common mistake people would make is, ""Who forgot their lunch..."" or even worse, ""Who forgot there lunch..."". My goodness... the tingles are crawling up my back already.

, Remember this rule of thumb: short pieces of work get quotation marks, such as poems, song titles, and short stories. Longer pieces of work, such as book titles, movies, and epic poems should be underlined.


""The Road Not Taken"" by Robert Frost
""My Girl"" by The Temptations
__Of Mice and Men__ by John Steinbeck
__Back to the Future__, the movie

, Commas and semicolons are the most misused parts of grammar known. It helps to know how exactly they are used.



Incorrect: I love pumpkin pie, it's my favorite dessert.

Correct: I love pumpkin pie; it's my favorite dessert.

Incorrect: There are so many things I'd like to see, and so many things, I want to do in the city.

Correct: There are so many things I'd like to see, as well as do, in the city.
(Commas are often used as another form of parenthesis (). By using a set of commas like in the correct sentence above, you can avoid a run-on sentence. To make sure you're using this trick correctly, remove the phrase in between the two commas, remove the commas, and read the sentence to make sure it makes sense. In this case, you would get, ""There are so many things I'd like to see in the city."")
This thing right here ; is called a semicolon. You may recognize it as the winky-eyes. A semicolon is used to separate two independent clauses. An independent clause is a statement that can stand alone.
""This party sucks; I don't know anyone here and the music is bogus.""
An incorrect way to use a semicolon is to use it like a comma: ""If you think this party sucks; maybe you should just leave.""

, This is one of the simplest, and yet most common, mistakes people make. Proper nouns such as holidays, days of the week, places, and names get capitalization.


""Thomas Edison invented the phonograph.""
""The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776.""
""Ruby Tuesday's is located on Pine Street in Fake City.""
Improper capitalization can also lead to some really bizarre sentences:

Correct: ""Can you help your friend Jack off the horse?""

Incorrect: ""Can you help your friend jack---"" (Well, you see where that one is going. Though this is an extreme example, it could happen very easily!)

, This rule is a little hard to catch if you're not a grammar whiz but if you read certain sentences carefully, you might be able to pick up on them.


""After meowing constantly for hours, I finally let my cat inside."" (Why were you meowing constantly for hours?) The opening phrase should always modify what immediately follows.
Instead, the sentence should read, ""After my cat was meowing constantly for hours, I finally let him inside.""

Keep in mind “only” is a modifier.,
Be aware of the casual use of “only” in English.,
Understand the common misplacement of “only” in common speech.,
Create examples of the different ways to use “only” in a sentence.,
Use ""only"" in front of a subject to modify the subject.,
Place “only” before the first verb in a sentence to modify the first verb.,

You could look at this placement in a different situation or setting.,
Use “only” in front of the second verb in a sentence to modify the second verb.,
Place “only” in front of the ending phrase in the sentence to modify the phrase.,
Adjust your use of “only” in your own writing.",How to Use the Word Only Correctly," This means that it modifies what you are trying to say and acts as a descriptive word in your sentence. “Only” can have a strong presence in a sentence and can shift the meaning of a sentence drastically if it is used incorrectly.To create a clear sentence, you should place “only” next to the noun, subject, verb, or phrase you are trying to modify.


When the word “only” is misplaced in a sentence, it becomes a “misplaced modifier”. This means the modifier, for example “only”, is not placed beside the noun or other word it is trying to modify. This creates confusion on the part of the listener or reader because the sentence becomes awkward.;
, You may notice that in everyday speech, people tend to place “only” in the wrong place in a sentence, and often, you can get a general sense of what they are trying to say. As with some grammatical rules, it can feel awkward to use the proper placement of a modifier in a casual conversation. Sometimes, you do not need to use “only” correctly, and your listeners can still understand what you mean.But it’s important to use the correct placement of “only” in your sentence when writing a formal letter, a paper, or a piece of writing for the general public to ensure you do not confuse your reader.

, When we are talking in a conversation, we will often use “only” to indicate someone did only one thing. For example: “She only ate strawberries for dinner.”In this sentence, the speaker likely means to say, she had strawberries for dinner and nothing else. The speaker is trying to modify “strawberries” when in fact “only” is misplaced and is modifying the verb “ate” in the sentence. So this means that the subject in the sentence, “she” does nothing else but eat strawberries for dinner. She doesn’t pick strawberries, she doesn’t prepare strawberries. She just eats them.
The correct placement of “only” in the sentence, based on the intended meaning, is: “She ate only strawberries for dinner.” The modifier, “only” is next to the noun it is modifying and is now grammatically correct. At first, it can feel awkward to say this sentence out loud. However, when you realize that the original sentence didn't mean what you intended, the correctly constructed sentence will start to feel more comfortable.

, The best way to get a sense of the proper use of the word “only” is to make your own example sentences and note what the “only” is modifying in each sentence.For example, consider these five different placements of “only” in the same sentence:
“Only I like dancing at a party.”
“I only like dancing at a party.”
“I like only dancing at a party.”
“I like dancing only at a party.”
“I like dancing at only a party.”

, For example: “Only I like dancing at a party.” In this sentence, “only” is modifying the subject “I”. You are telling someone that no one else likes to dance at a party, only you. You could view this sentence another way: “Only John danced at the party.” In this case, John was the only person who danced at the party, no one else. If this is your intended meaning, that John was the only dancer at the party, then you would place “only” at the beginning of the sentence so it modifies the subject, “John”.

, For example: “I only like dancing at a party.” In this sentence, “only” is modifying the verb “like”. So this sentence means that the “I” likes to do just one thing at a party: dance. The “I” doesn’t praise or put down dancing at a party, the “I” just likes it. This use for the actual meaning is kind of rare because it's used to distinguish which verb is being referenced., For example: “John only cooks meat for his family.” This sentence works if John is a vegetarian and does not buy, prepare, or eat meat. But when he is with his family, who are diehard meat eaters, he will cook meat for them. In this case, the modifier is correctly placed as the sentence indicates that John will only cook meat for his family, and not do anything else with the meat.

, For example: “I like only dancing at a party.” In this sentence, “only” is modifying “dancing”. This means that the “I” likes only one thing at a party: dancing. The speaker does not like talking, singing, chatting, or drinking in a party setting. The speaker likes dancing at a party and that is all, nothing else.


The use of “only” works better in a sentence that indicates the speaker only does one thing in a certain situation. For example: “I eat only vegetables.” This sentence is clear if you are a vegetarian and are telling someone about your diet. This means you consume vegetables and no meat or other food products.

, For example: “I like dancing only at a party.” In this example, “only” is modifying “at a party”. This indicates that the speaker likes to dance when she is at a party, and that she does not dance any other time or at any other type of event.You can look at this use of “only” another way: “John drinks scotch only with his dad.” This sentence means that John drinks scotch with his dad and with no one else.

, Now that you have looked at the four different ways “only” can be used in a sentence, note how you use “only” in your next essay, letter, or conversation.Remember to always place “only” next to the item you want to modify in the sentence so the sentence is clear and your meaning is not confusing or awkward to your reader or listener. Look at the above examples to determine where ""only"" belongs in your sentence.
Another good tip is to do a search of your document if it is on a word processor for the word “only”. Check that you are using “only” correctly in each sentence and adjust the placement of “only” in a sentence if it is unclear or incorrect."

Match singular nouns with singular verb forms and plural nouns with plural verb forms.,
Use singular or plural nouns and pronouns consistently within a sentence.,
Use the same tense consistently within a sentence.,
Do not use possessive forms in place of plurals.,
Distinguish between homophones.,
Understand the subjunctive form of ""to be."",
Avoid contractions in formal writing.,
Avoid ending sentences with prepositions in formal writing.,
Avoid splitting infinitives in formal writing.",How to Check Grammar2," Third-person singular verbs often end with ""s"" or ""es,"" as ""he says"" or ""she argues,"" while third-person plural verbs don't, as in ""they argue."" A series of singular nouns (""Smith and Jones""; ""Moe, Larry, and Curly""; ""Murdock et al."") is treated the same as a single plural noun and takes the plural verb form.


Corporate or collective nouns, which use a singular noun form to represent more than one person or item (""team,"" ""group,"" ""management""), take a singular verb in American English and a plural verb in British English.

, In addition to matching singular nouns with singular verbs and plural nouns with plural verbs, you need to match singular nouns with singular pronouns (""Batman pulled a rope from his utility belt"") and plural nouns with plural pronouns (""The Dynamic Duo donned their gas masks"").


Some style guides allow using ""they"" or ""their"" as singular pronouns or possessives when the gender being represented is unknown, while others prefer the inclusive ""he or she"" and ""his or her.""

, Tenses represent when an action occurred or will occur. There are three basic forms: present, past, and future. Use present tense (""he runs"") for actions happening now, past tense (""he ran"") for actions that happened in the past, and future tense (""he will run"") for actions yet to happen.


Many novels and movies describe actions using the present tense. Case studies often describe actions in present tense as well, although the study methods and results are usually presented using the past tense.

, Most nouns take an ""s"" or ""es"" suffix to indicate the plural, never with an apostrophe. The exception to this is for plurals of single-letter words: it's acceptable to write ""A's"" to represent multiple renderings of the letter ""A.""

, Homophones are words that sound alike, but are spelled differently and have different meanings. The ability to distinguish between homophones is important because spell checkers are designed only to find misspellings, not incorrect uses of correctly spelled words. Some commonly confused homophones are given below:


�It's,"" the contraction for ""it is;"" and the possessive ""its,"" meaning ""belonging to it.""
�To,"" a preposition; ""too,"" a comparative or synonym for ""also;"" and ""two,"" a number.
�Their,"" a possessive pronoun; ""there,"" an adverb denoting location; and ""they're,"" the contraction for ""they are.""
�Peak,"" meaning ""summit;"" ""peek,"" meaning ""look;"" and ""pique,"" meaning ""stimulate.""
�Compliment,"" meaning ""to praise;"" and ""complement,"" meaning ""to go together.""
�Bare,"" meaning ""to uncover;"" and ""bear,"" the animal.
�Led,"" meaning ""directed;"" and ""lead,"" the metal. (It doesn't help that ""led"" is the past tense of ""lead,"" which is spelled the same as the metal lead but pronounced differently.)
�Red,"" the color; and ""read,"" the past tense of ""read."" (This homophone confusion exacerbates the confusion between ""led"" and ""lead."")
�Pour,"" meaning ""to dump or spill;"" and ""pore,"" meaning a microscopic skin opening or ""to examine."" (You pore over a gravy recipe, but you pour gravy over mashed potatoes.)

, The subjunctive form is used when writing about hypothetical situations, usually in clauses beginning with ""if"": ""If I were in your shoes"" and ""If she were taller"" are correct in these cases, while ""I was in your shoes"" and ""She was taller"" are correct when not writing hypothetically., When writing a formal essay or business communication to another business, use separate words (""do not,"" ""will not"") instead of contractions (""don't,"" ""won't""). Contractions are acceptable in business communications to consumers when a less formal tone is called for.


Also, write out ""and"" instead of representing it with an ampersand (""&"").

, The rule against ending sentences with prepositions (for, in, to, with) is relatively recent, but many regard it as a hard-and-fast rule. If possible, recast the sentence to avoid ending it with a preposition, unless the revision would sound more awkward than ending with a preposition.

, Infinitives are verb forms preceded by ""to:"" to be, to live, to read, to write. Splitting an infinitive is placing an adverb between the ""to"" and the verb, as in ""to boldly go where no man has gone before."" This rule was created at a time when there was a desire to make English more like Latin, whose infinitives cannot be split. In writing for an academic audience, infinitives should not be split, but in less formal writing, they may be.

Set your writing aside for a time before checking its grammar.,
Take your time.,
Try reading from the end to the beginning.,
Try reading aloud.,
Consider working from a printed copy.",How to Check Grammar3," This puts you in a different frame of mind than when you were busy writing your work and makes you less likely to gloss over errors. You may need as little as a few minutes away from the piece, to let it sit overnight, or longer, depending on what you're writing and your schedule., The slower you read through a piece, the more likely you are to spot grammatical and other mistakes. The faster you read, the more you're likely to miss.

, By reading backwards, you're more likely to see mistakes than if you read from start to finish.

, Reading aloud forces to read words individually and therefore slowly, making it more likely you'll catch grammatical and other errors., Although many word processing programs include editing tools, such as Word's Track Changes feature, many writers find it easier to read printed text instead of on-screen text.


If you do print out a draft to edit, consider printing the text double-spaced. This will allow you more room to make corrections and to place them above the incorrect text.

Create your own flashcards.,
Make a practice schedule.,
Test your memory with a partner.",How to Memorize the Dictionary2," Flashcards have been used in education for decades to help students remember vocabulary terms and definitions. Because you are focusing on memorizing the words in the dictionary, you can write each term on a flashcard and use the flashcards to practice remembering each term.You can use plain white flashcards or colored flashcards for terms that are more difficult for you to remember. You may also want to use colored flashcards to signify each letter of the alphabet. For example, blue flashcards for all “a” letters, yellow flashcards for all “b” letters, green flashcards for “c” letters, etc.
Write down one word per flashcard. Follow the word order of the dictionary and write them in order on the flashcards. For example, “aardvark, aardwolf, Aaron, aasvoel” should follow one after the other, one word per flashcard.

, Once you have made the flashcards, put them to use by setting aside one to two hours a day studying the flashcards. Do this in sections, focusing on 50 cards at a time. To strengthen your long term memory, you should review the cards you have already studied so you can work your way up slowly to remembering 50 cards, then 100 cards, then 150 cards, etc.Another technique is to practice with the flashcards by placing them in areas around your room or home that you use often. Tape them on the walls, on mirrors, or on any surface that you look at every day. This will force you to study them throughout the day and help you remember them.

, Ask someone to help you review the flashcards by testing your memory of the words on the flashcards. Start with 20 cards at a time, and have the person ask you to name each word on the card. Say the words out loud to reinforce your memory of each word. Over time, you can have the person speed up how fast they ask you to name each word so you improve your ability to memorize each word quickly and in succession.Once you become confident with 20 cards, increase the amount to 50 cards and ask the person to quiz you. Work your way to 100 cards and then 150 cards. Add more flashcards as you work your way through the dictionary, but be sure to circle back and repeat past words so you can remember them long term.

Connect independent clauses with a dashed vertical line.",How to Analyze Sentences," The words in a sentence are given names according to the type of function they serve in the sentence. There are 8 parts of speech:Nouns are words that represent persons, places, or things. Examples include ‘’boy,’’ ‘’girl,’’ ‘’cat’,’ ‘’dog’,’ ‘’grass’’, and ‘’home’’.
Pronouns are words that stand in for nouns so they don’t have to be repeated. Examples include ‘’he,’’ ‘’she,’’ ‘’it,’’ ‘’you,’’ ‘’we,’’ and ‘’they.’’
Verbs are words that express action or state of being. Examples include ‘’is’’/’’are’’, ‘’do’’/’’does’’, ‘’has’’/’’have’’, ‘’perform’’, and ‘’sing’’. Form of verbs, called verbals, can serve as other parts of speech. Gerunds are verbals that act as nouns; they usually end in ‘’-ing’’ (as in ‘’acting,’’ the profession). Participles are verbals that act as adjectives; they usually end in ‘’-ing’’ or ‘’-ed’’ (as in ‘’melted’’ when describing melted chocolate).Adjectives are words that describe, or modify, nouns. Examples include words representing size (‘’big’’, “huge’’, ‘’small’’, ‘’tiny’’), color (‘’red’’, ‘’green’’, ‘’blue’’), quantity (‘’one’’, ‘’two’’, ‘’three’’), or condition (‘’good’’, ‘’bad’’, ‘’happy’’). A special group of adjectives are called articles or determiners; these include ‘’a’’, ‘’an’’, and ‘’the’’.
Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Many adverbs end in ‘’–ly’’ (‘’quickly’’, ‘’badly’’, ‘’really’’), but others do not (‘’very’’, ‘’fast’’). They describe how, when, where, why, and how much.Prepositions are words that connect nouns to other words so they can describe those words. Examples include ‘’at’’, ‘’in’’, ‘’on’’, ’’before’’, and ‘’after’’.
Conjunctions are words that connect other words or parts of sentences together. Examples include ‘’and’’, ‘’but’’, and ‘’or’’, as well as ‘’because’’ and ‘’when’’.
Interjections are words exclaimed to represent outbursts of emotion or pain. Examples include ‘’hello’’, ‘’ouch’’, and ‘’oh’’. Interjections are followed by commas when the feeling is mild, or by exclamation points when the feeling is strong.
Some words can be used as more than one part of speech, depending on where they are placed in a sentence. The word ‘’well’’ can be used as a noun (place where water is drawn from), an adjective, an adverb, or as an interjection, for example.;
, A phrase is a grouping of one or more words that conveys an idea, usually about something that exists or some type of action, and may include other words that modify it. The most important word in the phrase is called its head.Some of the types of phrases are given below:


A noun phrase is a phrase built around and including a noun.In the sentence ‘’The big, red dog barked loudly at the mailman.’’, ‘’The big, red dog’’ is a noun phrase, with ‘’dog’’ the noun that forms the head of the phrase; the words ‘’big’’ and ‘’red’’ describe, or modify, it. Noun phrases can also be built around gerunds, as in ‘’loud, repeated barking’’.
A verb phrase is a phrase built around and including a verb. In the sentence above, the phrase ‘’barked loudly’’ is a verb phrase, with ‘’barked’’ the verb that forms the head of the phrase; the word ‘’loudly’’ describes, or modifies, how the dog barked.An adjective phrase is a phrase built around an adjective. In the sentence ‘’I am fond of peanut butter.’’, ‘’fond of peanut butter’’ is an adjective phrase with ‘’fond’’ as its head.An adverb phrase is a phrase built around an adverb. In the sentence ‘’The mailman ran very rapidly from the barking dog.’’, ‘’very rapidly’’ is an adverb phrase with ‘’rapidly’’ as its head.An appositive is a phrase that adds detail to the sentence but won’t change the sentence’s meaning if it’s removed. In the sentence ‘’The big, red dog, an Irish setter, barked loudly at the mailman.’’, the phrase ‘’an Irish setter’’ is an appositive. Appositives are set off by commas. If the appositive is a name used to address someone, it’s called a vocative.
A prepositional phrase is a phrase that begins with a preposition and includes one or more nouns that serve as objects of the preposition. The phrase ‘’at the mailman’’ is a prepositional phrase beginning with the preposition ‘’at’’ and including the noun ‘’mailman’’ as its object. A prepositional phrase typically acts as an adjective or adverb.Phrases can contain phrases of the same or different kinds within themselves. For example, the prepositional phrase ‘’at the mailman’’ contains the noun phrase ‘’the mailman’’. Likewise, the adjective phrase ‘’fond of peanut butter’’ includes the prepositional phrase ‘’of peanut butter’’., To be complete, a sentence must have a word or phrase that serves as its subject and a word or phrase that serves as its predicate.


The subject is a noun phrase that tells what the sentence is about. It’s what does the action or experiences the state of being described in the predicate. In the sentence, ‘’The dog barked.’’, “dog” is the subject, or more correctly, the simple subject. (‘’The dog’’ can be called the complete or entire subject.)
The predicate is a verb phrase that tells the action the subject performs or the state of being the subject experiences. In the sentence, ‘’The dog barked.’’, ‘’barked’’ is the predicate. In a longer sentence, such as ‘’The dog barked loudly.’’, ‘’barked’’ is the simple predicate, while ‘’barked loudly’’ is the complete predicate., Some sentences also have an object, which is the part of the predicate that tells who or what received the action the subject is performing. Objects can be either direct or indirect.


A direct object is one that the action was done on; it can be the answer to the question “Who?” or “What?” In the sentence, ‘’The dog gave the puppy a bone.’’, ‘’bone’’ is a direct object.
An indirect object is one that the action was done for. In the sentence, ‘’The dog gave the puppy a bone.’’, ‘’puppy’’ is an indirect object. (An indirect object functions the same as a prepositional phrase beginning with the preposition “to” or “for” that could be written after the direct object, as in ‘’The dog gave a bone to the puppy.’’)Verbs that can be followed by an object are called transitive verbs; those that can’t be followed by an object (other than the object in a prepositional phrase) are called intransitive verbs., A clause is any portion of a sentence that includes both a subject and a predicate.There are two main types: independent and dependent clauses, with dependent clauses further divided into subtypes.


An independent clause can stand alone by itself as a complete sentence if all other information is removed. A sentence can have more than one independent clause; multiple independent clauses are connected with a coordinating conjunction (‘’and’’,’’ or’’, ‘’nor’’, ‘’but’’, ‘’so’’, ‘’yet’’) or a semicolon.
A dependent clause cannot stand alone by itself but instead requires another clause to express a complete thought. (The frustrated parent’s reply of “Because I said so” is an example of an incomplete sentence made of a dependent clause.) Dependent clauses can function in sentences as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.Dependent clauses may be introduced by subordinating conjunctions (‘’although’’, ‘’because’’, ‘’if’’, ‘’since’’, ‘’unless’’, ‘’when’’, ‘’while’’). These kinds of dependent clauses are called subordinate clauses.
Dependent clauses may be introduced by relative pronouns (‘’who’’/’’whom’’/’’whose’’, ‘’what’’, ‘’which’’, ‘’that’’). These kinds of dependent clauses are called relative clauses.
Dependent clauses that are essential to the meaning of the sentence because they limit what the sentence refers to are called essential or restrictive clauses. They are not set off by commas. In the sentence ‘’The big, red dog that lives on Pine Street barked loudly at the mailman.’’, the clause ‘’that lives on Pine Street’’ is a restrictive clause because it identifies a specific dog.
Dependent clauses that add information that isn’t essential to the meaning of the sentence are called nonessential or nonrestrictive clauses. Like appositives, these clauses are set off by commas. In the sentence ‘’The big, red dog, which is seven years old, barked loudly at the mailman.’’, the clause ‘’which is seven years old’’ is a nonrestrictive clause because the dog’s age isn’t important information., As noted earlier, the subject is a noun phrase (or a pronoun) that tells what the subject is about. The subject also determines the form the verb in the predicate takes.


In a simple declarative sentence (statement) or exclamatory sentence (‘’Harry threw the ball’’, ‘’I did it!’’), the subject is usually stated first.
In a declarative sentence introduced with an appositive or a nonrestrictive clause (a complex sentence), the subject usually appears shortly after the comma that sets off the appositive or clause. (‘’After winding up, Harry threw the ball.’’)
In an imperative sentence (command), the subject is usually not stated. (‘’Bring that over here.’’) It is understood to be whoever the command is given to, or more simply, “you.”
In an interrogative sentence (question), the subject can sometimes begin the sentence (‘’It’s raining in Nebraska?’’, ‘’Who broke this?’’), but it can also follow the predicate (‘’Is this your car?’’) or fall between parts of it (‘’May I have this dance?’’). Often, you can rewrite the question into a statement (‘’This is your car.’’); in those cases, the subject of the statement is also the subject of the question.A sentence can have more than one subject. Multiple subjects are called a compound subject; the individual subjects are usually connected with the conjunction ‘’and’’.

, Also as noted earlier, the predicate tells what action the subject is taking or has taken or the subject’s state of being. In most sentences, the predicate immediately follows the subject, while for interrogative sentences, the predicate verb usually comes before the subject.


The predicate may include a main verb and a helping verb, as in ‘’I can speak German’’. ‘’Speak’’ is the primary verb, but ‘’can’’ serves as a helping verb, telling that I am able to speak German.
The primary helping verbs are the forms of ‘’be’’, ‘’do’’, and ‘’have’’, while ‘’can’’ is part of a group of helping verbs that expresses need or possibility, called modal helping verbs. The others are ‘’could’’, ‘’may’’, ’’might’’, ‘’must’’, ‘’ought to’’, ‘’shall’’, ‘’should’’, ‘’will’’, and ‘’would’’.Just as a sentence can have more than one subject, it can also have more than one predicate. Multiple predicates are called a compound predicate; the main verbs are usually connected with the conjunction ‘’and’’.

, Objects, when present, typically follow the verb in the predicate. A verb followed by one or more objects is called a transitive verb, while a verb that isn’t followed by an object is called an intransitive verb.


An indirect object often follows the verb immediately, while a direct object may be preceded by modifiers or an indirect object. A sentence may have multiple direct or indirect objects.
Not all nouns or pronouns that follow the predicate verb are objects, however. If the verb just connects the subject to a noun that describes it (‘’I am a man.’’), the noun that follows the verb is called a predicate noun.

, Often, you can determine what words modify other words by their position in the sentence.


Adjectives are usually placed before the noun they modify, whether it is the subject or the object of the sentence. If several adjectives modify a noun, they may be separated with commas if they describe different attributes of that noun.
However, sentences with verbs that connect the subject with information about the subject, called linking verbs, place the adjective after the linking verb, as in the sentence ‘’He is happy.’’ The most common linking verbs are the forms of ‘’to be’’ (‘’am’’, ‘’are’’, ‘’is’’, ‘’was’’, ‘’were’’), ‘’become’’, and ‘’seem’’, but other verbs, such as ‘’appear’’and ‘’feel’’, can also function as linking verbs.Adverbs can be placed either before or after the verb they modify, but usually after. Adverbs that modify adjectives or other adverbs usually come before the word they modify.

, Parse trees can be used to analyze a complete sentence or just a clause or phrase within a sentence.


If you want to analyze an entire sentence, write the word ‘’Sentence’’ or the abbreviation ‘’S.’’
If you want to analyze a clause, write the word ‘’Clause’’ or the abbreviation ‘’C.’’
If you want to analyze a phrase, write the word ‘’Phrase’’ or the abbreviation ‘’P.’’ You can further define the type of phrase you’re analyzing: a noun phrase (NP), a verb phrase (VP), etc.
For the purposes of this example, we’ll use the sentence ‘’The gaudily dressed Wink Martindale remains popular with long-time fans of television game shows.’’

, The exact length of each line will vary. For a sentence with a short noun phrase as a subject and a long verb phrase as a predicate, you’ll need to draw a longer line for the subject and a shorter line for the predicate. If the lengths of the two phrases are about the same, your lines should be about the same length.

, Use labels according to how much of the sentence you’re analyzing and the components that make that part up.


If you’re analyzing a complete sentence or a clause, you’re looking for a subject and a predicate. Your subject will be a noun phrase, while your predicate will be a verb phrase. You can use ‘’Noun Phrase’’ or ‘’NP’’ to label the noun phrase as such, or ‘’Subject’’ to label it as the subject. You can use ‘’Verb Phrase’’ or ‘’VP’’ to label the verb phrase as such or ‘’Predicate’’ to label it as the predicate.
In our example sentence, the subject is the noun phrase ‘’The gaudily dressed Wink Martindale’’, while the predicate is the verb phrase ‘’remains popular with long-time fans of television game shows’’.
If you’re only analyzing a phrase, you’ll only be looking for components that make up the phrase.

, By drawing the new lines, you’re preparing to break down the noun phrase of your subject and the verb phrase of your predicate into their components.


The noun phrase ‘’The gaudily dressed Wink Martindale’’ breaks down into an adjective phrase, ‘’The gaudily dressed’’, and the (proper) noun ‘’Wink Martindale’’, so you draw two branching lines from the label ‘’Noun Phrase’’ or ‘’Subject’’.
The verb phrase ‘’remains popular with long-time fans of television game shows’’ breaks down into the verb ‘’remains’’ and the adjective phrase ‘’popular with long-time fans of television game shows’’.

, The labels conform to the parts you’ve identified for the subject and predicate.


For the branches created under ‘’Noun phrase’’ or ‘’Subject’’, you’d write ‘’Adjective Phrase’’ or ‘’AdjP’’ and ‘’Noun’’.
For the branches created under ‘’Verb Phrase’’ or ‘’Predicate’’, you’d write ‘’Verb’’ and ‘’Adjective Phrase’’ or ‘’AdjP’’.

, As noted earlier, types of phrases can be broken down into smaller and smaller component phrases.


The adjective phrase ‘’The gaudily dressed’’ breaks down into the article or determiner ‘’The’’ and the adjective phrase ‘’gaudily dressed’’, which, in turn, breaks down into the adverb ‘’gaudily’’ and the participle acting as adjective ‘’dressed’’.
The adjective phrase ‘’popular with long-time fans of television game shows’’ breaks down into the adjective ‘’popular’’ and the double prepositional phrase ‘’with long-time fans of television game shows’’. Each of the prepositional phrases breaks down into a preposition and noun phrase (‘’with’’ and ‘’long-time fans’’, and ‘’of’’ and ‘’television game shows’’), and the noun phrases break down further into adjective phrases followed by nouns, and so on.

, If you’ve broken the example sentence down completely, you’ll have this series of labels: “Determiner” (or “Article”), “Adverb,” “Adjective,” “Noun,” “Verb,” “Adjective,” “Preposition,” “Adjective,” “Noun,” “Preposition,” “Adjective,” “Adjective,” “Noun.” You can use abbreviations: “Det” for “Determiner,” “Art” for “Article,” “Adv” for “Adverb,” “Adj” for “Adjective,” “N” for “Noun,” “V” for “Verb,” and “Prep” for “Preposition.”

, This shows the function of each word in the sentence; the tree branches show the relationships between components of the phrases that make up the sentence.For the example sentence, you’d draw a dotted line from ‘’The’’ to ’’Determiner’’ (or ‘’Article’’), from ‘’gaudily’’ to ‘’Adverb’’, from ‘’dressed’’ to ‘’Adjective’’, and so on.

, This is the line you will write the subject and predicate of the sentence on.


For most of the steps in this section, we’ll use the same sentence as for the parse tree diagram example: ‘’The gaudily dressed Wink Martindale remains popular with long-time fans of television game shows’’.
If you have a sentence composed of multiple independent clauses, make a line for each clause in the sentence.

, The vertical line separates the subject from the predicate.

, See the step about where to look for the subject of the sentence in “Part Two: Analyzing a Sentence.” For this method of diagramming, we want only the simple subject of the sentence, not the complete noun phrase.


For our example sentence, the simple subject is the proper noun ‘’Wink Martindale’’.
If the sentence is an imperative (command) sentence, the subject is understood to be “you.” The subject is written on the line in parentheses, as “(you),” or as “(X).” If the sentence also includes a vocative (‘’Wink, tell us the categories.’’), put the vocative on a horizontal line floating above the understood subject.If the sentence has multiple subjects, draw a branch (a horizontal “V”) from the left of the subject-predicate divider and a separate line for each subject. Write each subject on one of the lines, and connect the subject lines with a dashed vertical line. Write the word ‘’and’’ on the dashed line., If the verb has a linking verb, write it in front of the main verb.


For our example sentence, we’d write the verb ‘’remains’’ after the divider.
If the sentence has multiple predicates, draw a branch from the right of the subject-predicate divider and a separate line for each predicate. Write each verb and linking verb (if any) on one of the lines and connect the predicate lines with a dashed vertical line. Write the word ‘’and’’ on the dashed line., If the sentence has a direct object, it goes on the same line as the subject and predicate and is separated by a vertical line that rises upward from the subject-predicate line.


Our original example sentence doesn’t have a direct object. However, if our sentence were ‘’Wink Martindale gave the contestant a new car.’’, the word ‘’car’’ would be written after the line dividing the predicate ‘’gave’’ from the direct object.
If the sentence has one predicate but multiple objects, draw a branch from the right of the predicate-object divider and a separate line for each direct object. Write each direct object on one of the lines and connect the direct object line with a dashed vertical line on which you write ‘’and’’.
If the sentence has multiple predicates with an object for each predicate, extend the predicate lines and draw in a vertical predicate object divider for each line, then write the objects that correspond to the predicates on the line of the predicate the object corresponds to.
If the sentence has multiple predicates but only a single direct object, draw lines from each predicate line that converge at a single point. (This should mirror the branching out from the subject-predicate line, making the diagram look something like a wrapped candy.) Draw a horizontal line out from this point, with a predicate-object divider, then write the object to the right of the divider., Draw a slanting line from the predicate side of the subject-predicate line downward and to the right. Draw a horizontal line from the end of the slanting line and write the indirect object on it.


Using our example sentence from the previous step, ‘’Wink Martindale gave the contestant a new car.’’, the word ‘’contestant’’ is the indirect object, so it would be written on the horizontal line below the predicate.
If there are multiple indirect objects, draw a branch from the slanted line and a horizontal line for each indirect object. Write each indirect object on its own line and connect the indirect object lines with a vertical dashed line on which you write ‘’and’’., A predicate noun or adjective goes in the same place as a direct object would, except that you separate it with a slanted line that points in the direction of the subject. This shows the predicate noun or adjective refers to or describes the subject.In our original sentence, the word “popular” is an example of a predicate adjective. If the sentence read ‘’Wink Martindale remains a popular game-show host.’’, the word ‘’host’’ would be an example of a predicate noun.

, Draw diagonal lines under the subject(s), the predicate(s), and the object(s).


Draw one line under the subject for each adjective that directly modifies the subject and write an adjective on it. If your sentence connects the adjectives together with ‘’and’’, draw a dashed line between the adjective lines and write ‘’and’’ on it.
Using our original example sentence, the words ‘’The’’ and ‘’dressed’’ would appear on diagonal lines extending from the subject ‘’Wink Martindale’’.
Draw one line under the predicate for each adverb that directly modifies the predicate and write an adverb on it. If your sentence connects the adverbs together with ‘’and’’, draw a dashed line between the adjective lines and write ‘’and’’ on it.
Draw one line under the object for each adjective that directly modifies the object and write an adjective on it. If your sentence connects the adjectives together with ‘’and’’, draw a dashed line between the adjective lines and write ‘’and’’ on it.
If you have adverbs that modify adjectives or other adverbs, draw a branching line from the modifier line downward and to the left. Then, draw a line perpendicular to this line but parallel to the modifier line. Write the modifying adverb on this line.Using our original example sentence, a branching line would be drawn from the line labeled with the word ‘’dressed’’. The word ‘’gaudily’’ would be written on the line paralleling ‘’dressed’’ to show it modifies that word.

, The line segments for prepositional phrases look the same as for an indirect object, except that you write the preposition on the diagonal line that connects the object of the prepositional phrase to the subject-predicate line.However, while an indirect object always connects to the predicate, a prepositional phrase can be connected to the subject, predicate, object, an adjective, an adverb, or even to another prepositional phrase!
Using our example sentence, we’d draw a diagonal line under the predicate adjective ‘’popular’’ and write the preposition ‘’with’’ on it, then draw a horizontal line and write the noun ‘’fans’’ on that. We would draw a diagonal line for the adjective ‘’long-time’’ and another diagonal line for the preposition ‘’of’’. We would draw a horizontal line from the preposition ‘’of’’ for the noun ‘’shows’’ and diagonal lines under ‘’shows’’ for the adjectives ‘’television’’ and ‘’game’’.

, Just as you connect multiple subjects, predicates or objects together with a dashed vertical line with ‘’and’’ on it.If your sentence uses a different coordinating conjunction, use that in place of ‘’and’’.
There are additional structures for more complex sentences, but these are the components you’ll find in most practice sentences. An online graphic diagramming aid is available at http://1aiway.com/nlp4net/services/enparser/default.aspx?text=diagram+this+sentence.

Understand the difference between who and whom.,
Use who when referring to the subject of a sentence or clause.Who brought the paper inside?,
Use whom when referring to the object of a verb or preposition.,
Ask yourself if the answer to the question would be he/she or him/her.,
When trying to decide whether who or whom is correct, simplify the sentence.,
Remember that the distinction between who and whom is less important in informal spoken language than it is in formal written language.",How to Use Who and Whom," Both who and whom are relative pronouns.However, who is used as the subject of a sentence or clause, to denote who is doing something (like he or she).On the other hand, whom is used as a direct or indirect object of a verb or preposition.


While a preposition (at, by, for, in, with, etc.) often comes before whom, this is not always the case, so the key question is to ask, “Who is doing what to whom?” What follows is a quick way to determine which pronoun to use in a particular question.;
,
Who talked to you today?
Who went to dinner?
Who ate the cake?
Our job is to determine who qualifies.

,


To whom it may concern:
To whom did you talk today?
Whom does Sarah love?

, If you can answer the question with him/her, then use whom. It’s easy to remember because they both end with m. If you can answer the question with he/she, then use who.


Example: A suitable answer to the question, “To did the prize go?” is, “It went to him/her.” (It is improper to say “It went to he/she.”) The correct pronoun for the question is whom.
Example: A suitable answer to the question, “went to the store?” is, “He/She went to the store.” (It is improper to say “Him/Her went to the store.”) The correct pronoun for the question who.

, Where other words in a complex sentence might throw you off track, simplify the sentence to include just the basic subject, verb, and object. It helps to move the words around in your head to identify the word relationships. For example:


“Marie Antoinette and her ladies-in-waiting only invited people to their party they considered to love parties as much as they did.” The simplified mental version becomes: “whom they considered.”
“Marie Antoinette prevented her mother from knowing she invited to the Petit Trianon.” The simplified mental version becomes: “she invited.” Then, you could rearrange it again to say: “she invited whom”, clarifying that she did something to (invited) whom.

, It’s possible that the distinction might someday erode altogether. For now, though, it is important to keep this clear in written language.

Remember that stank is the past form.,
Remember that stink (stank - stunk) is what is called an irregular verb.,
Don't worry about using the word like this: ""You're sure making a big stink about nothing!"".,
Don't worry about using the word like this: ""I can't stand that stinking tree in front of the window anymore"".,
Think about the word when you want to make a sentence like this: ""You really stunk at checkers last night."",
Think about the word when you want to make a sentence like this: ""She hasn't stank that badly since you bought her that cheap perfume.""",How to Use Stunk or Stank Properly," Use it when you refer to a finished time, such as last night, yesterday, etc. stunk is the participle form (okay, never mind that word), but it means you use it with have, has, or had. These sentences are correct:


She sure stank up the kitchen last night with that burned milk!
I'm sorry, but the baby's diaper really stank on the way home yesterday!
The house hasn't stunk this badly since the day we found that rat behind the dryer.
If you hadn't stunk up the bathroom, I wouldn't have opened the window and let your orchids freeze in the snow.;
, That means it doesn't have an -ed at the end (like live - lived - lived). It's like this verb: drink - drank - drunk.

, That's not your problem. (It's a noun here.)

, That's also not your problem. (It's an adjective here.)

, That's wrong. It should be stank.

, That's wrong. It should be stunk.

,How to Use Italics1,
"
Understand what the abbreviations stand for.,
Associate each abbreviation with more easily remembered phrases.,
Use creative mnemonic devices.,
Use ""i.e."",
Use ""e.g."",
Use e.g.,
Consider your audience.,
Italicize only if specifically asked.,
Use parentheses or commas with both.,
Determine any style manual requirements.,
Ensure that what you write after i.e.,
Try replacing the abbreviations with their meaning.","How to Use ""i.e."" Versus ""e.g."""," ""i.e."" is an abbreviation of the Latin words id est, which means ""that is"". ""e.g."" is an abbreviation for the Latin words exempli gratia, which means ""for the sake of example""., It may be difficult to memorize Latin words, so pretending that ""i.e."" stands for ""in essence"" or ""in other words"", and ""e.g."" stands for ""example given"" can help.

, Sometimes, not even associating the abbreviation with another phrase helps. If you’re still having trouble, try using more creative mnemonic solutions, such as associating i.e. with “I explain” or e.g. with “egg sample” (which sounds like ""example"").You could also try memorizing a bizarre example sentence using the correct abbreviation, such as “The best way to drive unicorns out of your neighborhood is to play them loud Baroque classical music (i.e., complicated classical music composed between 1600-1750).”, to paraphrase. Make a statement, then add ""i.e."" to explain, specify, or describe what you just said in another way:


The elephant is a pachyderm, i.e., a large animal with thick skin and nails on feet resembling hooves.
I went to my least favorite place (i.e., the dentist).
Note that what follows ""i.e."" is often a further explanation. This can also be a metaphor. If you substitute ""i.e."" with ""in other words"" the sentences still make sense. If you plug in ""for example"" they do not.

, before giving one or more examples. Think of what precedes ""e.g."" as a category, and what follows it as something (or a few things) that would fall into that category (but not everything in that category):


Buy some vegetables, e.g., carrots.
I like power metal (e.g., Firewind, Iced Earth, Sonata Arctica).
Observe how using ""i.e."" wouldn't make sense in these examples. ""Carrots"" is not another way to describe vegetables in general, it is just one of the many foods that are considered to be vegetables. If you wanted to use ""i.e."" you would write ""Buy some vegetables, i.e., the edible part of any plant."" Likewise, the bands given are examples of power metal, but not a description. If you were using ""i.e."" you would write something like ""I like power metal, i.e., fast metal with symphonic elements and epic themes.""

, and i.e. in short comments. It’s common to use the abbreviations e.g. and i.e. when adding a parenthetical statement, such as a clarification or explanation. However, if the clarification or explanation is part of the main sentence, spell out the phrase that is appropriate to your meaning instead.


For example, if you’re writing a paper and want to provide some examples of sources that argue a particular point, use e.g.: “Some studies (e.g., Smith, 2015; Yao, 1999) support this assertion, while others -- for example, Abdullah’s (2013) research on pizza and topping choice -- disagree.”

Use i.e. to provide short clarifications and a phrase to provide longer or more detailed clarifications: “In our research we altered the order of image display (i.e., first, second, or third) as well as their color scheme, that is, whether we had applied a blue or green filter.”


, Substantial confusion exists surrounding i.e. and e.g., even amongst highly educated readers. If you think that your readers may not understand what the abbreviation is used to signal, skip it and use a clarifying phrase instead. , It’s common for English speakers to see Latin words and phrases italicized, such as in medias res (“in the middle of things”) or in loco parentis (“in the place of a parent”). However, Latin words and phrases that have entered common usage are usually not italicized -- including i.e. and e.g., To indicate a separate clause, you can either insert a comma before ""i.e."" or ""e.g."" or you can use parentheses, both of which are shown in the examples above. If you use parentheses, open them right before the ""e.g."" or ""i.e."" and close them after you have given your example or alternate definition.


For American English usage, you should always put a comma right after both ""i.e."" and ""e.g."" as shown in the examples above. For British English usage, do not put a comma right after either ""i.e."" or ""e.g.""

, If you’re just writing for yourself or in an informal situation, you may not have any specific requirements. However, if you’re writing in a particular academic discipline, or in a particular profession (such as journalism), you will probably be asked to write in accordance with the relevant style manual.


For example, APA Style, the official style of the American Psychological Association, is used widely in the social sciences and in professions like journalism. APA states that you should always put a comma after e.g. and i.e. when using them: “Some sources (e.g., Janet, 2010; Jeff, 2015) argue that mushrooms are tasty” and “There are three meals in the day (i.e., breakfast, lunch, and dinner)”., means the same as what precedes it. If you use a sentence that includes i.e. and a parenthetical comment, make sure that the restatement is directly equivalent to what you said first: you should be able to swap them out without a loss of meaning.The sentence “His favorite type of sandwich is an open-faced sandwich (i.e., one that uses only one piece of bread rather than two)” represents correct usage of i.e.
The sentence “His favorite type of sandwich is an open-faced sandwich (i.e., a panini or similar type of sandwich)” represents incorrect usage, because “a panini or similar type of sandwich” is NOT directly equivalent to “an open-faced sandwich.”

, If it sounds reasonable, then you are probably using the right one. For example, ""I like quiet activities (e.g., reading)"" becomes ""I like quiet activities (for example, reading)"". When trying this with i.e., it is often easier to use ""in other words"" instead of ""that is.""

Solve for the variable.,
Draw a number line.,
Draw a circle indicating the relative value.,
Draw an arrow indicating the included values.",How to Graph Inequalities1," To  solve the inequality isolate the variable using the same algebraic methods you would use to solve an equation.Remember that when you multiply or divide by a negative number, you need to flip the inequality sign.

For example, if you are solving the inequality 3y+9>12{\displaystyle 3y+9>12}, isolate the variable by subtracting 9 from each side of the inequality, then dividing by 3:3y+9>12{\displaystyle 3y+9>12}3y+9−9>12−9{\displaystyle 3y+9-9>12-9}3y>3{\displaystyle 3y>3}3y3>33{\displaystyle {\frac {3y}{3}}>{\frac {3}{3}}}y>1{\displaystyle y>1}

Your inequality should only have one variable. If your inequality has two variables, it is more appropriate to graph it on a coordinate plane using another method.
;
, Include the relative value on your number line (the value you found the variable to be less than, greater than, or equal to). Make the number line as long or short as required.

For example, if you found that y>1{\displaystyle y>1}, make sure to include a point for 1 on the number line.


, If the value is less than (<{\displaystyle <}) or greater than (>{\displaystyle >}) this number, the circle should be open, since the solution does not include the value. If the value is less than or equal to (≤{\displaystyle \leq }), or greater than or equal to (≥{\displaystyle \geq }), the circle should be filled in, since the solution includes the value.For example, if y>1{\displaystyle y>1}, you would draw a circle at 1 on the number line. You would not fill in the circle, since 1 is not included in the solution.


, If the variable is greater than the relative value, your arrow should point to the right, since the solution includes values greater than that number. If the variable is less than the relative value, your arrow should point to the left, since the solution includes values less than that number.For example, for the solution y>1{\displaystyle y>1}, you would draw an arrow pointing to the right, since the solution includes values greater than 1.

Write the equation for each line with y on the left side.,
Set the right sides of the equation equal to each other.,
Solve for x.,
Use this x-value to solve for y.,
Check your work.,
Write down the x and y coordinates of the intersection.,
Deal with unusual results.",How to Algebraically Find the Intersection of Two Lines1," If necessary, rearrange the equation so y is alone on one side of the equal sign. If the equation uses f(x) or g(x) instead of y, separate this term instead. Remember, you can cancel out terms by performing the same action to both sides.

If you do not know the equations, find them based on the information you have.


Example: Your two lines are y=x+3{\displaystyle y=x+3} and y−12=−2x{\displaystyle y-12=-2x}. To get y alone in the second equation, add 12 to each side: y=12−2x{\displaystyle y=12-2x}
;
, We're looking for a point where the two lines have the same x and y values; this is where the lines cross. Both equations have just y on the left side, so we know the right sides are equal to each other. Write a new equation that represents this.


Example: We know y=x+3{\displaystyle y=x+3} and y=12−2x{\displaystyle y=12-2x}, therefore x+3=12−2x{\displaystyle x+3=12-2x}.


, The new equation only has one variable, x. Solve this using algebra, by performing the same operation on both sides. Get the x terms on one side of the equation, then put it in the form x = __. (If this is impossible, skip down to the end of this section.)


Example: x+3=12−2x{\displaystyle x+3=12-2x}

Add 2x{\displaystyle 2x} to each side:


3x+3=12{\displaystyle 3x+3=12}

Subtract 3 from each side:


3x=9{\displaystyle 3x=9}

Divide each side by 3:


x=3{\displaystyle x=3}.


, Choose the equation for either line. Replace every x in the equation with the answer you found. Do the arithmetic to solve for y.


Example: x=3{\displaystyle x=3} and y=x+3{\displaystyle y=x+3}


y=3+3{\displaystyle y=3+3}


y=6{\displaystyle y=6}


, It's a good idea to plug your x-value into the other equation and see if you get the same result. If you get a different solution for y, go back and check your work for mistakes.


Example: x=3{\displaystyle x=3} and y=12−2x{\displaystyle y=12-2x}


y=12−2(3){\displaystyle y=12-2(3)}


y=12−6{\displaystyle y=12-6}


y=6{\displaystyle y=6}

This is the same answer as before. We did not make any mistakes.


, You've now solved for the x-value and y-value of the point where the two lines intersect. Write down the point as a coordinate pair, with the x-value as the first number.


Example: x=3{\displaystyle x=3} and y=6{\displaystyle y=6}

The two lines intersect at (3,6).


, Some equations make it impossible to solve for x. This doesn't always mean you made a mistake. There are two ways a pair of lines can lead to a special solution:

If the two lines are parallel, they do not intersect. The x terms will cancel out, and your equation will simplify to a false statement (such as 0=1{\displaystyle 0=1}). Write ""the lines do not intersect"" or no real solution"" as your answer.

If the two equations describe the same line, they ""intersect"" everywhere. The x terms will cancel out and your equation will simplify to a true statement (such as 3=3{\displaystyle 3=3}). Write ""the two lines are the same"" as your answer.

Use italics to denote legal cases.,
Use italics to denote species names, variety, and subspecies names.,
Know the exceptions.",How to Use Italics2," You should italicize the titles of long creative works in your paper. These include books, long poems, plays, television shows and films, artworks, or musical compositions. If you are writing in Chicago or MLA style, you should also italicize these titles on your works cited page or bibliography and use title case (i.e., Capitalizing Each Major Word in a Title). In APA style, italicize but do not use title case.Italicize:Book titles: I just can't stop reading Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.

Anthology and collection titles: I need the Norton Anthology of English Literature for a class I am taking next fall.

Long poems: The Bhagavad Gita is a long Hindu poem written in Sanskrit.

Plays: Sophocles is one of the most famous ancient Greek playwrights. He wrote plays such as Antigone and Oedipus the King.


Movie and television show titles: We watched Halloween last night, and it terrified us! Fortunately we followed it up with Brooklyn Nine-Nine to lighten the mood.

Album titles: In Utero is my favorite Nirvana album.

Long musical works: Mozart’s Don Giovanni is one of my favorite operas. I also really enjoy Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata for piano.

Works of art: Mexican artist Frida Kahlo painted many self-portraits, including the famous Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird.

An exception to italics exists for citing titles that incorporate other titles. For example, if you wanted to cite the (made-up) book titled Shakespeare’s King Lear and the Pagan Tradition, you would need to de-italicize the title of the play because it is present in another book’s title.

, You should italicize the titles of newspapers, journals, magazines, and radio series. News programs with a specific name should also be italicized. As with the literary examples, italicize these titles on your works cited page or bibliography in Chicago or MLA style and use title case. Italicize without title case for APA style. Italicize:Newspapers: My mom subscribes to the New York Times.


Journals and magazines: I read articles from the New England Journal of Medicine for school, but when I’m reading for fun I prefer People.


Radio series and podcasts: I listen to This American Life whenever I get the chance. Like nearly everyone else in 2014, I was also hooked on the podcast Serial.


News programs: The Rachel Maddow Show is one of the top-performing news programs on cable news networks.

, You should italicize the titles of specific editions of sacred texts, such as the The New American Standard Bible.However, you should not write the names of holy books, such as the Bible, in italics.This rule applies whether you are including the title within your paper or on your works cited page or bibliography.

, Names of documents like the Declaration of Independence or the Magna Carta are not italicized.However, some academic styles such as the American Sociological Association (ASA) recommend that you italicize the titles of specific public documents, but not well-known documents (e.g., the Constitution). For example: Telecommunications Act of 1996, Public Law 104-014, 110 U.S. Statutes at Large 56 (1996)., Even if “the” is part of the official name, such as “The Wall Street Journal,” most style guides recommend that you do not capitalize or italicize “the” when it comes at the beginning of a title.Obviously, if you use the title as the beginning of your own title or a sentence, you would capitalize the word “the.” You would not italicize it, however. For example: The Wall Street Journal is the premier source of business and financial news in the US.

, Words like alumni do not need to be italicized, but words like semper fi do need to be italicized. The difference is that alumni is understood by English speaking people as graduates of a particular university, whereas semper fi requires translation to be understood.This rule, like several others, is open to interpretation. A general rule of thumb is that if the foreign word is in an English dictionary, you do not need to italicize it., You should italicize the names of ships, airplanes, missiles, and man-made satellites. Do not italicize modifiers on the name such as “the” or “U.S.S.” or “H.M.S.”.The Enola Gay

U.S.S. Cole

Don’t italicize types of vehicles, such as the Learjet.

, When you need to provide the name of a legal case in a paper, italicize the case title including v.. You should also italicize the legal case name on your works cited page or bibliography.The famous case of Gideon v. Wainwright was a landmark in American legal history.

, The Latin names of species, varieties, and subspecies need to be italicized, but common English names do not need to be italicized. For example:For example: Homo sapiens is the binomial nomenclature for the human species. Homo is the Latin genus name, and Homo sapiens is our species name.
In scientific writing, it is customary to give the full binomial nomenclature in the title and the first time it is used in the paper. After that, abbreviate like so: H. sapiens.

You would not italicize “humans,” the common English name for H. sapiens.


, While most style guides recommend using italics as shown in the above examples, some don’t. The AP (Associated Press) style does not use italics in news stories at all, even to refer to titles.In APA style, if you are not sure whether something should be italicized, the preference is to not italicize it.Many writers for the web prefer to use underlining or quotation marks to highlight text. This is because italics can be difficult to distinguish on a computer screen. Use your judgment to determine whether italics or other forms of highlighting are appropriate for your purpose."
"
Use Italics when you want to emphasize a certain word or phrase.,
Italicize words, letters, and numbers when used as specific terms.,
Use italics when you want to show a contrast between two words or phrases.,
Avoid using italics to provide emphasis or show contrast in formal writing.",How to Use Italics3," A common use for italics is to draw attention to a particular part of a text in order to provide emphasis. If something is important or shocking, you might want to italicize that word or phrase so that your readers don’t miss it.For example:


He had managed to eat ten cookies.
I love the word flabbergasted.

, If you want to call attention to a word, letter, or number as a specific term, use italics. For example:When defining an unfamiliar term, you may want to italicize its first appearance: “The scientific term for sneezing is sternutation.”Use italics to emphasize a letter on its own: I got an A in history this term.
When he moved to the Denver Broncos, quarterback Peyton Manning retained his famous 18 on his jersey.

, It is also common to use italics to show contrast to your readers. If you want your readers to notice a contrast between two words or phrases, you might want to italicize that word or phrase so that your readers don’t miss it. You can italicize one or both words depending on your objective.He had managed to eat not nine, but ten cookies.
The words through and threw may sound the same but obviously have very different meanings.

, Using italics to provide emphasis or show contrast is usually accepted in informal writing. However, most style guidelines advise against these uses in formal, professional, or academic writing. In most cases, it’s preferable to use syntax to emphasize your point in these types of writing.


For example, APA style specifies that using italics to provide emphasis is inappropriate unless the reader might miss your intended meaning without the italics.
Chicago style also does not recommend the use of italics for emphasis."

For example, for the inequality 3y+9>9x{\displaystyle 3y+9>9x}, you would isolate the y variable by subtracting 9 from both sides, then dividing by 3: 3y+9>9x{\displaystyle 3y+9>9x}3y+9−9>9x−9{\displaystyle 3y+9-9>9x-9}3y>9x−9{\displaystyle 3y>9x-9}3y3>9x−93{\displaystyle {\frac {3y}{3}}>{\frac {9x-9}{3}}}y>3x−3{\displaystyle y>3x-3}


, To do this, turn the inequality into an equation, and  graph as you would any equation of a line.Plot the y-intercept, then use the slope to graph other points on the line.

For example, if the inequality is y>3x−3{\displaystyle y>3x-3}, you would graph the line y=3x−3{\displaystyle y=3x-3}. The y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y axis) is -3, and the slope is 3, or 31{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{1}}}. So, you would draw a point at (0,−3){\displaystyle (0,-3)}. The point above the y-intercept is (1,0){\displaystyle (1,0)}. The point below the y-intercept is (−1,−6){\displaystyle (-1,-6)}.


, If the inequality is less than (<{\displaystyle <}) or greater than (>{\displaystyle >}), the line should be dashed, since the solution does not include values equal to the line. If the value is less than or equal to (≤{\displaystyle \leq }), or greater than or equal to (≥{\displaystyle \geq }), the line should be solid, since the solution includes values equal to the line.For example, since the inequality is y>3x−3{\displaystyle y>3x-3}, the line should be dashed, since the values do not include points on the line.


, If the inequality shows y>mx+b{\displaystyle y>mx+b} you should shade in the area above the line. If the inequality shows y<mx+b{\displaystyle y<mx+b}, you should shade the area below the line.For example, for the inequality y>3x−3{\displaystyle y>3x-3} you would shade above the line.

Determine whether you have a quadratic inequality.,
Graph the line on a coordinate plane.,
Draw the parabola.,
Find some test points.,
Shade the appropriate area.",How to Graph Inequalities3," A quadratic inequality takes the form of ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c}.Sometimes there may not be an x{\displaystyle x} term or a constant, but there should always be an x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term on one side of the inequality, and an isolated y{\displaystyle y} variable on the other side.

For example, you might need to graph the inequality y<x2−10x+16{\displaystyle y<x^{2}-10x+16}.


, To do this, turn the inequality into an equation, and  graph the line as you normally would. Since you have a quadratic equation, the line will be a parabola.For example, for the inequality y<x2−10x+16{\displaystyle y<x^{2}-10x+16}, you would graph the line y=x2−10x+16{\displaystyle y=x^{2}-10x+16}. The vertex is at point (5,−9){\displaystyle (5,-9)}, and the parabola crosses the x-axis at the points (2,0){\displaystyle (2,0)} and (8,0){\displaystyle (8,0)}.


, Draw the parabola with a dashed line if the inequality is less than (<{\displaystyle <}) or greater than (>{\displaystyle >}). If the value is less than or equal to (≤{\displaystyle \leq }), or greater than or equal to (≥{\displaystyle \geq }), you should draw the parabola with a solid line, since the solution includes values equal to the line.For example, for the inequality y<x2−10x+16{\displaystyle y<x^{2}-10x+16}, you would draw the parabola with a dashed line.


, In order to determine which area to shade, you need to pick points from inside the parabola, and from outside the parabola.

For example, the graph of the inequality y<x2−10x+16{\displaystyle y<x^{2}-10x+16} shows that the point (0,0){\displaystyle (0,0)} is outside the parabola. This would be a good point to use to test the solution.


, To determine which area to shade, plug the values of x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} from your test points into the original inequality. Whichever point produces a true inequality indicates which area of the graph should be shaded in.For example, plugging the values of x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} of the point (0,0){\displaystyle (0,0)} into the original inequality, you get:y<x2−10x+16{\displaystyle y<x^{2}-10x+16}0<02−0x+16{\displaystyle 0<0^{2}-0x+16}0<16{\displaystyle 0<16}Since this is true, you would shade the area of the graph where the point (0,0){\displaystyle (0,0)} is found. In this case, this is outside of the parabola, not inside of it.

Write the point coordinates.",How to Algebraically Find the Intersection of Two Lines2," In a quadratic equation, one or more variables is squared (x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} or y2{\displaystyle y^{2}}), and there are no higher powers. The lines these equations represent are curved, so they can intersect a straight line at 0, 1, or 2 points. This section will teach you how to find the 0, 1, or 2 solutions to your problem.

Expand equations with parentheses to check whether they're quadratics. For example, y=(x+3)(x){\displaystyle y=(x+3)(x)} is quadratic, since it expands into y=x2+3x.{\displaystyle y=x^{2}+3x.}

Equations for a circle or ellipse have both an x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} and a y2{\displaystyle y^{2}} term.If you're having trouble with these special cases, see the Tips section below.


, If necessary, rewrite each equation so y is alone on one side.


Example: Find the intersection of x2+2x−y=−1{\displaystyle x^{2}+2x-y=-1} and y=x+7{\displaystyle y=x+7}.

Rewrite the quadratic equation in terms of y:


y=x2+2x+1{\displaystyle y=x^{2}+2x+1} and y=x+7{\displaystyle y=x+7}.

This example has one quadratic equation and one linear equation. Problems with two quadratic equations are solved in a similar way.


, Once you've set both equations equal to y, you know the two sides without a y are equal to each other.


Example: y=x2+2x+1{\displaystyle y=x^{2}+2x+1} and y=x+7{\displaystyle y=x+7}


x2+2x+1=x+7{\displaystyle x^{2}+2x+1=x+7}


, Use standard algebraic techniques to get all the terms on one side. This will set the problem up so we can solve it in the next step.


Example: x2+2x+1=x+7{\displaystyle x^{2}+2x+1=x+7}

Subtract x from each side:


x2+x+1=7{\displaystyle x^{2}+x+1=7}

Subtract 7 from each side:


x2+x−6=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+x-6=0}


, Once you've set one side equal to zero, there are three ways to solve a quadratic equation. Different people find different methods easier. You can read about the quadratic formula or ""completing the square"", or follow along with this example of the factoring method:


Example: x2+x−6=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+x-6=0}

The goal of factoring is to find the two factors that multiply together to make this equation. Starting with the first term, we know x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} can divide into x, and x. Write down (x    )(x    ) = 0 to show this.

The last term is -6. List each pair of factors that multiply to make negative six: −6∗1{\displaystyle -6*1}, −3∗2{\displaystyle -3*2}, −2∗3{\displaystyle -2*3}, and −1∗6{\displaystyle -1*6}.

The middle term is x (which you could write as 1x). Add each pair of factors together until you get 1 as an answer. The correct pair of factors is −2∗3{\displaystyle -2*3}, since −2+3=1{\displaystyle -2+3=1}.

Fill out the gaps in your answer with this pair of factors: (x−2)(x+3)=0{\displaystyle (x-2)(x+3)=0}.


, If you work too quickly, you might find one solution to the problem and not realize there's a second one. Here's how to find the two x-values for lines that intersect at two points:


Example (factoring): We ended up with the equation (x−2)(x+3)=0{\displaystyle (x-2)(x+3)=0}. If either of the factors in parentheses equal 0, the equation is true. One solution is x−2=0{\displaystyle x-2=0} → x=2{\displaystyle x=2}. The other solution is x+3=0{\displaystyle x+3=0} → x=−3{\displaystyle x=-3}.


Example (quadratic equation or complete the square): If you used one of these methods to solve your equation, a square root will show up. For example, our equation becomes x=(−1+25)/2{\displaystyle x=(-1+{\sqrt {25}})/2}. Remember that a square root can simplify to two different solutions: 25=5∗5{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}=5*5}, and 25=(−5)∗(−5){\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}=(-5)*(-5)}. Write two equations, one for each possibility, and solve for x in each one.


, Two lines that barely touch only have one intersection, and two lines that never touch have zero. Here's how to recognize these:

One solution: The problems factor into two identical factors ((x-1)(x-1) = 0). When plugged into the quadratic formula, the square root term is 0{\displaystyle {\sqrt {0}}}. You only need to solve one equation.

No real solution: There are no factors that satisfy the requirements (summing to the middle term). When plugged into the quadratic formula, you get a negative number under the square root sign (such as −2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {-2}}}). Write ""no solution"" as your answer.


, Once you have the x-value of your intersection, plug it back into one of the equations you started with. Solve for y to find the y-value. If you have a second x-value, repeat for this as well.


Example: We found two solutions, x=2{\displaystyle x=2} and x=−3{\displaystyle x=-3}. One of our lines has the equation y=x+7{\displaystyle y=x+7}. Plug in y=2+7{\displaystyle y=2+7} and y=−3+7{\displaystyle y=-3+7}, then solve each equation to find that y=9{\displaystyle y=9} and y=4{\displaystyle y=4}.


, Now write your answer in coordinate form, with the x-value and y-value of the intersection points. If you have two answers, make sure you match the correct x-value to each y-value.


Example: When we plugged in x=2{\displaystyle x=2}, we got y=9{\displaystyle y=9}, so one intersection is at (2, 9). The same process for our second solution tells us another intersection lies at (-3, 4).

You might try reading one new book a week, or reading the newspaper every morning. Pick a frequency and pace that works for you, and develop a reading routine that fits into your schedule.
Try to read at least one book and several magazines every week. Be consistent. As well as improving your vocabulary, you'll also keep updated and backdated, your general knowledge will increase, and you'll be an intelligent, well-rounded person.;
, Challenge yourself by reading as many books as you have the time and inclination for. Read classics. Read new fiction and read old fiction. Read poetry. Read Herman Melville, William Faulkner, and Virginia Woolf.


Try reading nonfiction and technical books: these will rapidly teach you not only new ways to speak, but also new ways to think. Read about a variety of subjects, like philosophy, religion, and science.
If you usually read the local paper, consider trying the long, difficult stories in national, international and business newspapers and magazines, like The New Yorker or The Economist.

There are many classics available for your perusal at Project Gutenbergand LibriVox.

, Read online magazines, essays, and blogs on a variety of subjects. Read record reviews and fashion blogs. Vocabulary isn't just high diction. To have a rounded vocabulary you should know the definition of both ""soliloquy"" and ""twerking."" To be well read is to be familiar with both Geoffrey Chaucer and Lee Child.

, When you see an unfamiliar word, do not skip over it impatiently. Try to puzzle out its possible meaning in the context of the sentence, then look it up in the dictionary and confirm its definition.


Consider keeping a small notebook with you and quickly jot down unknown words as you come across them for checking later. If you hear or see a word you don't know, be sure to look it up.

, Dive in. Read entries for words you aren't yet familiar with. This requires the ownership of a quality dictionary to make it more interesting, so look for a dictionary that has lengthy explanations on the origins and uses of words, as these will go a long way to helping you remember the word and enjoy using your dictionary.

, Look up words you use a lot so you can learn similar words, and use those words as well.

, If you're committed to building your vocabulary, set a goal for yourself. Try to learn three new words a week and work them into your speech and writing. With conscious effort, you can learn several thousands of new words that you'll remember and use. If you can't use a word effectively and accurately in a sentence, it's not a part of your vocabulary.


If you're easily learning three words a week, start upping the ante. Try to learn ten words next week.
Looking up 20 new words a day in the dictionary will make it difficult to use any of them accurately. Be realistic and build practical vocabulary that you'll be able to use.

, If you're going to make a habit of learning new words, try some simple memorization techniques as if you were studying for a test. Hang post-its with the definition of a particular word you hope to memorize above the coffee maker, so you can study it while fixing your morning cup. Affix a new word to each house plant so you can study while watering.


Even if you're watching TV or doing other activities, keep some flashcards with you and study your new words. Always be building.

, Start journaling if you don't already, or start a blog. Actively flexing your writing muscles will keep your vocabulary strong.


Write letters to old friends and use lots of specific details. If your correspondence is typically short and informal, switch it up and write a longer letter or email than you're used to writing. Take time in crafting letters as you would an essay for school. Make considered choices.
Consider taking on more writing responsibilities at work. If you typically avoid composing memos or writing group emails or participating in group discussions, change your habits and write more. You might as well get paid to build your vocabulary.

, The best writers aim for concision and accuracy. Get out the thesaurus and use the most accurate word possible in your sentences. Don't use three words when one will do. A word is a useful addition to your vocabulary if it reduces the number of words in a sentence.


For instance, the phrase ""dolphins and whales"" can be replaced with the word ""cetaceans,"" making ""cetaceans"" a useful word.
A word is also useful if it is more descriptive than the word or phrase it replaces. For example, many people's voices could be described as ""pleasant"". But someone with a very pleasant voice could be said to have a ""mellifluous"" voice.

, Inexperienced writers think using the Thesaurus function in Microsoft Word twice in every sentence makes writing better. It doesn't. Using flashy vocabulary and ""spelling bee"" words makes your writing pompous. What's worse, though, is that it also makes writing less accurate than more common words. Using the appropriate word is the mark of a real writer and a sure sign of advanced vocabulary.


You could say that ""Iron Mike"" is Mike Tyson's ""sobriquet,"" but ""nickname"" might be the more accurate and useful word in the sentence. Therefore, ""sobriquet"" may be less useful in your vocabulary.

, You can also procure for yourself a Word of the Day calendar; be sure to read the word on the page each day and aim to remember each day's word and even use it somewhere in your day.


Visit word building sites such as freerice.com and construct an expansive vocabulary while nourishing the hungry or doing something else useful.
There are many online sites devoted to compiling alphabetical lists of unusual, weird, old-fashioned, and difficult words. Avail yourself of the search engine to find these sites and to learn from them. This is a great way to while away time waiting for a bus or in the bank queue.

, Word puzzles are an excellent source of increasing your word knowledge because the puzzle creators will often need to resort to an array of unusual words to ensure that the words fit into their puzzles and that they are interesting for the puzzle doer. There are many varieties of vocabulary puzzles, including crosswords, find-a-word and hidden word puzzles. As well as strengthening your word knowledge, puzzles are also good for improving your critical thinking skills. For word games, try such games as Scrabble, Boggle, and Cranium to extend your vocabulary.

, Although it might seem like a dead and done language, knowing a bit of Latin is an excellent way to learn the roots of many words in the English language and can help you figure out the meaning of a wide range of words that you don't yet know without having to resort to the dictionary. There are online Latin learning resources, as well as plenty of texts (check out your favorite used books bookstore).

Understand the function of pronouns.,
Understand pronoun agreement.,
Understand the function of these.,
Understand the function of those.",How to Use These and Those1," These and those are both pronouns, words that refer to or substitute for other nouns in the sentence. They draw attention to something specific. Because a pronoun takes the place of another noun, using the correct one helps your reader understand what the referent of the pronoun is (i.e., what noun it took the place of).These and those are plural pronouns: they refer to or replace plural nouns.;
, ""Agreement"" means that the pronoun takes the same number as the noun it replaces. If the noun is singular, you would use this or that. If the noun is plural, you would use these or those.


American English considers collective nouns, or nouns that refer to a large group of things that cannot be counted individually (such as milk or data), as singular nouns. Use this or that rather that these or those for collective nouns. For example: ""This milk has spilled all over the floor!""
British English differs from American English in using collective nouns. British English refers to some collective nouns such as crowd or data as plural, so it is appropriate to use these or those in British English. For example: ""These data don't match the graphs you gave me.""

, These is the plural form of this. You will use it to refer to or replace a plural noun.


Singular: This book (a single book) on the shelf next to me belongs to Rajeev.
Plural: These books (several books) on the shelf next to me belong to Rajeev. Singular: Look at this bracelet (a single bracelet) on my wrist!
Plural: Look at these bracelets (many bracelets) on my wrist!
Singular: Who put this cupcake (a single cupcake) in the refrigerator?
Plural: Who put these cupcakes (some cupcakes) in the refrigerator?

, Those is the plural form of that. You will use it to refer to or replace a plural noun.


Singular: That mountain (a mountain) looks really small from here.
Plural: Those mountains (several mountains) look really small from here. Singular: Could you hand me that box (a box) on the other side of the room?
Plural: Could you hand me those boxes (a few boxes) on the other side of the room?
Singular: Why hasn't that scientist (a scientist) at NASA found extraterrestrial life?
Plural: Why haven't those scientists (many scientists) at NASA found extraterrestrial life? "

Learn the overlap between assure and ensure.,
Understand assure used as insure.,
Accept insure used as ensure.","How to Use Assure, Ensure and Insure"," Assure means ""to tell someone with confidence, removing doubt."" If you are trying to convince or reassure someone, use assure. The object of the verb is usually a person. Here are a few examples:


""I assure you, I'm not dead.""
""Can you assure me that you will be here?""
Having never been on a plane before, Delilah was anxious. A more experienced traveler assured her that flying was safe.
""Stand firm in your refusal to remain conscious during algebra. In real life, I assure you, there is no such thing as algebra."" –Frances A. Lebowitz;
, Ensure means ""to make certain that something will happen."" The object of the verb is always a thing, never a person. If you are taking action to guarantee the result you want, use ""ensure.""


To ensure your cooperation, we have posted armed guards throughout the facility.

Ensure that it does not happen again.
I ensured our safety by locking the door.
Cooking meat to the proper temperature ensures that you don't become ill.
""To win the War, to overcome the enemy upon the fields cannot alone ensure the Victory in Peace. The cause of War must be removed."" —Haile Selassie I

, Insure means ""to arrange for compensation in case of damage or loss."" Although it sounds similar to the other words, it almost always refers to a financial agreement. There is no need to use it in any other context.


Tippecanoe Mutual will insure your vehicle for accidental damage or theft.
I make regular payments to a company so that my home is insured against damage. If lightning strikes my home, the company will pay me to compensate for the damage.

, Occasionally, assure can also mean ""to make something certain to happen"". This is most common in the phrases ""assure success"" or ""assure victory."" Since these definitions overlap, the author's judgment or personal preference determines which word is best.


For example, ""We have ensured victory"" and ""We have assured victory"" are both correct. Ensure is the more common usage.

, In British English, assure is sometimes used instead of insure. For example, an English bank might ""assure"" a sum of money in case of damage, or ""assure"" your life (grant you life insurance)., In American English, insure is occasionally used instead of ensure.For example, some people might say ""We hired a caterer to insure an excellent meal,"" but ensure is the more common usage. Some grammar guides consider ensure the only correct usage here, but others disagree.

Use ""et cetera"" to mean ""and so forth"" as well as ""all items of the same class."",
Do not use an introductory phrase for a list, such as ""such as"" or ""for example,"" along with etc.,
Do not use ""etc."",
Do not use ""and"" before ""etc."",
Do not use ""etc."",
Do not use ""etc."",
Use the correct spelling.,
Punctuate ""etc."",
Learn how to put in the punctuation around it.","How to Use ""Etc."" Correctly"," Et cetera is used as a short way to say, ""and so forth"", ""and so on"", or ""and other things"", and is also used to describe a list without listing everything. However, it's important that the items in the list are of the same kind so that ""etc."" does not confuse the reader.


For example, you can say, ""We could use cupcakes, cookies, etc."" This shows that they can use any kind of dessert, and it could be rewritten by, ""We could use cupcakes, cookies, and so on.""
However, you cannot say, ""Bring hamburger buns, paper plates, cupcakes, etc."", because the items on the list are not the same and the person you're talking to would not know what you are referring to.
Items of the same class do not need to be physical items. They can be emotions, or other forms of ""things."" For example, you could say, ""Please write down your three primary emotions today (sadness, anger, fear, etc.)"";
, You cannot say, ""Bring items such as cake, chocolates, ice cream, etc. to the party,"" because ""such as"" already implies that you are not talking about a complete list. You can simply say, ""Bring items such as cake, chocolates, and ice cream to the party"" or ""Bring cake, chocolates, ice cream, etc. to the party.""

, more than once in a sentence. Though some people think it's cute to use ""etc."" more than once in a sentence to stress the fact that many additional items are needed, just one ""etc."" will suffice. Saying something like, ""I have to do the dishes, wash the car, clean my room, etc., etc., etc., before the party"" is never correct.

, Since the ""et"" in ""et cetera"" already means ""and,"" it would be redundant to use the phrase ""and etc."" because you'll really be saying, ""and and the rest."" Make sure to avoid using ""and"" when using ""etc."", if you're discussing a specific list of items that are needed and not anything more. If you only need cookies, cake, and donuts for the party, writing ""cookies, cake, donuts, etc."" will not be appropriate because it will give the reader the assumption that he can bring another dessert.

, to refer to people. ""Etc."" can only refer to things; ""et al."" is used to refer to people. You cannot say, ""I can't help but get annoyed by my younger cousins – Mary, Joe, Sue, etc. – though I try to be nice to them."" Instead, you can say, ""I can't help but get annoyed by my younger cousins – Mary, Joe, Sue et al. – though I try to be nice to them."" In this example, you are using ""et al."", which means ""and others,"" to refer to the other annoying younger cousins., You can write it either way, ""Et Cetera"", or ""etc."" Some other versions of etc. include et caetera, et cœtera or et coetera, but its usual spelling can be etc. Remember exactly how it's spelled, because when it's misspelled, it can look very obvious. Don't spell it, ""ect"" or ""cet"" or anything, although it can be spelled &e., &/c., or &ct. You don't need to learn all of these spellings, but choose one that you can rely on to use.


Be careful how you pronounce et cetera. If you're in the habit of saying ""ek-SET-ra"", it's time to kick out the ""k"" sound! The real pronunciation is ""eht-SEHT-er-uh.""

, correctly. At the end of ""etc"", there should be a period. (This does not apply if you are using modern ""open punctuation"", which dispenses with periods for eg, ie etc). That's obvious, right? However, when you still have more to say in the sentence, you should put a comma after the period. If you are finished with the sentence, end with that period, don't put anything else, but if you still have more to say, put a comma at the end and finish. For example:


""They ate cookies, cakes, peanuts, fairy floss, etc., and it's little wonder they ended up with stomach aches.""

, Yes, you should use a period and a comma, but when you also work with semicolons, question marks, and exclamation points, ""etc."" can be confusing. Here are a few examples:


Put a question mark after the period in ""etc.""
Put an exclamation point immediately after the period.
Put the semicolon in right after the period and put a space between it and the next word.
Put parentheses around the items you are using along with etc. when necessary. For example: ""Students should not pack liquids in their carry-on bags (water, shampoo, makeup remover, etc.)""

Contrast the more abstractly applied verb ""arise"".",How to Know the Difference Between Rise and Raise," The meanings of ""rise"" and ""raise"" differ slightly and therefore need to be applied in different ways. For example, very basically the meanings can be said to be as follows:


Rise refers to something being moved upwards or an amount of something being increased. For example, to say that the sun rises and hot air rises refers to the action of these objects moving upwards.
Raise refers to something being moved to a higher position or something getting improved. For example, to say that you raise your hand or your voice refers to the action of moving your hand or voice to a higher level than previously. Or, you might refer to a need to raise efficiency in the factory, when factory efficiency needs to improve.;
, ""Raise"" is a regular verb. This makes it easy to remember in both the past and perfect participles. On the other hand, ""rise"" is an irregular verb and its past and perfect participles therefore changes in its past participle and perfect participle forms.


Raise:

Past participle : Raised.
Perfect participle : Raised.


Rise:

Past participle : Rose.
Perfect participle : Risen.



, This means that it always needs an object to act on, such as ""I raised the object into the air"". On the other hand, rise is intransitive; that is, it does not need an object and only ever involves the subject. It can help to remember that intransitive verbs denote something that you do ""to yourself"", such as ""I rise at dawn"", whereas if it's your arms being raised at dawn, your arms become objects rather than your whole self. More examples:


Raise (raise, raised, raised, is raising):

I raised my head to look at them.
She raises the book from the floor.


Rise (rise, rose, risen, is rising):

My head rose upon hearing the harsh noises.
My book is rising to the bestsellers top ten list.


It might help you to remember this mnemonic: To rAise grammatically has an Attack to or an Action on an object, but to rise does not have.


, There are some fairly standard usages of both verbs, depending on the context. For example:


""I rise each day at 8 o'clock"" - this is a formal way of saying ""I get up each day at 8 o'clock"".
""She rose when the queen entered the room"" - another formal way of saying ""she got up when the queen entered the room"".
""The wind and water level are rising, please evacuate!"" - this refers to the wind becoming stronger and the water level moving upwards.
""He wanted to rise to the top of his field"" - is one way of saying ""He wanted to be promoted to the top of his field"".
""Use of disposable water bottles rose during the 90s"" - is another way of saying ""Use of disposable water bottles increased during the 90s"".
""Those of you wishing to visit the museum today, please raise your hand."" - refers to ""putting up or lifting"" your hand.
""I have to raise my voice because he's a little deaf."" - refers to ""lifting the level"" of the person's voice.
""She raised the hem slightly to make the skirt shorter."" - refers to placing the hem in a higher position than before.
Learn various relevant idioms, such as ""to raise the alarm"", ""to raise the roof"", ""to not raise a finger"", ""to raise a smile"", ""to rise to the bait"", ""to get a rise from"", ""to rise to the occasion/challenge"", and so forth. Each of these needs to be learned as unique phrases within their relevant context if you're learning English as a second language.

, In some cases, the usage of raise and rise is switched around depending on which form of English you're using. A good example is to do with salary. In British English, you receive a ""pay rise"", while in American English, you receive a ""pay raise"". Both are correct and you are likely to be understood whichever you refer to.

, Arise can mean ""to get up"", ""to emerge from a source"" or ""to come into being/come to one's attention"". It's used widely too and should be used in a similar fashion to ""rise"".


The past participle is ""arose"", the perfect participle is ""arisen"".
It's often used to express abstract notions or uncertainty. For example:

""If the possibility arose, I'd definitely go to Paris."" - You're not sure if the chance to go to Paris will happen.
""I'd like to return this iPhone––a problem has arisen with its ability to receive calls."" - You know the outcome of the problem but not necessarily what's causing it.


To see the difference between ""raise"" and ""arise"", see this example:

""Immediately I raised the question as to the witness's credibility."" (you have to use transitive verb raise).
""The question arises whether the witness is credible."" (intransitive verb arise is used).

Amplify your voice by ""duplexing"" word usage, sometimes by inlaying meanings side by side -- without mere redundancy.,
Define success in communication as blazing or following a path of verbiage, as your life's goal -- not necessarily reaching one, ultimate destination like a monument, or tombstone -- but, instead, ricocheting off thousands of temporary, intermediate goals (reflecting and apprehending ""mini/many-conceptual destinations"" every hour/day).

Practice/Repeat steps.",How to Become a Master of English," Books can apply an exciting, sensational power: you may develop an instinct called concept. Conceptualize the books. The more books you read, the more rational you may become!;
, A relationship between two books/as concepts will combine both -- effecting a ""super concept"". Relate books with common similarities, disregarding their various fields. Hybridize concepts, as ongoing blending.

, Do not read all the time!.......it will attenuate(weaken) your brain energy. This will make it very hard to imbibe. Read for 2-3 hrs(Standard reading time).

, Well, your words can. You can develop soaring rhetoric like projecting your dream! Like ""I have a dream! I have a dream that some day...!"" How? By skillful wording, phrases, building communication skill, with deeply felt combinations of words, making choices on the wing, as you fly (inch or crawl) through the minutes and years on God's green earth.

, For example layer definitions into your context: ""loving your vocation and avocation, enjoying work and leisure time, and stepping up your earning and relaxation potentials"". That was, perhaps, two-ply triplexing: ""vocation -- work -- earning"" and contrasting that with ""avocation -- leisure -- relaxing"" in manifold exporting of knowledge. So if avocation is an unfamiliar word, yet it becomes easy to access its denotation. That kind of phrasing doubles and triples your impact while concurrently defining words for various levels of readers or listeners to whom you wish to communicate while elevating their comprehension. But it can be tiresome, if overused. So, though that can extend and expand your progress, into multiform advancements, yet do it modestly and moderately.

,, Every living organism or mechanism needs rest or cooling down and recuperating, repair. In the perspective of reading, your brain accumulates/decodes words depending on your reading speed and comprehension level, of what matters to you spiritually and physically. If your mind and soul is overworked, you won't understand what you are reading as you skip/smash through it. Let your mind have a chance to sleep and mull ideas, in the depths of the well of your creative subconsciousness.

, Words are grain for your ""grinding-mill"", but give your mind a chance to, figuratively, package the product, to make confections, candy and cake -- not just stirring up a choking dust but generating word-power to emit, folding in various ingredients and putting it out as nourishment, as soul-food for a friend or the human race, on the Internet.

, Casual exercises like riddles, puzzles, quizzes will contract and extend the brain ""muscles"", thereby accumulating more ways to access neurons (units of storage). What good are words that are not enjoyable, but dull or dusty.

Study an amazing dictionary at the reference department of a library such as the OED (20 volume Oxford English Dictionary), relate meanings, derivation, do cross checks, outline. Earmark scintillating words. Set up an optimal number of new words to learn, per day or per week, a quantity which is ""right for you"". You will be glad you decided to have fun, adventure and challenge yourself with new words.

, A thesaurus is a corpus of synonyms and antonyms (a body of words with the similar and contrasting meanings). They are very handy/helpful as to write an article, essay, poem or song, etc.

, Make it a labor of love to share your findings with persons who might be interested. Don't push too hard. Discuss new words (words embody ideas).

Make a list of the words you don’t know.,
Look up the words and write down definitions.,
Make flash cards for each word.,
Break it down.,
Draw pictures.,
Make up mnemonics.,
Take practice tests.",How to Ace Your Vocabulary Tests1," If you know the words you’re going to be tested on, that’s great, and you can easily make the list. If you’re studying for the ACT, SAT, or GRE, that makes it a little more complicated. However, there are many lists of words commonly used on these exams, so with a little online research, you can easily find a good number of words to start working on., Think about synonyms that you already know for the new words. As you write down the definition, focus strongly on that word. If you can, don’t write down all the definitions at one time – it’s too much and the words can all run together. Do a few definitions at a time as you let the words sink in.

, That way you can easily discard the ones you learn and focus on the more difficult ones. The act of making flash cards can also be useful in and of itself – you have to write the words and their definitions down. It’s also very helpful for mixing up the order and getting someone else to quiz you., Group the words in groups of 5. You could group them alphabetically, by type (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), kind (legal word, ancient/old word, foreign word), or with other words that have similar meaning. With them broken down, it becomes easier to study them, and feels less overwhelming.

, Make images of the words you’re trying to remember. Try drawing the words incorporated into a larger drawing that defines the word. Or, doodle with the letters in the word to come up with a way to help you remember the definition. Some examples would be:


Draw someone throwing up the word “regurgitate”
Draw the word “defenestration” being thrown out a window.

, Mnemonics are memory devices that help you remember something. That's it. They're usually formed by association.For example, if you wanted to learn the word ""gregarious"" (which means outgoing, vivacious, sociable), you might imagine a giraffe wearing a party hat. The giraffe's name is Greg Arious. Congratulations: now you have a mnemonic!
Another example might be the word ""melange"" (which means a mixture). Imagine putting together a melon and an orange - voila! You have a mixed-up mnemonic.

, For any of the major tests – ACT, SAT, GRE – there are practice tests for the vocabulary section. Take advantage of this, and test yourself. If you don’t own a test prep workbook that includes practice tests, check one out from the library. Most public libraries have many test preparation books, and it won’t matter if it’s for the most recent test – vocabulary words don’t change much!"

Use ""A"" before all words that begin with consonant sounds.,
Understand that there are some exceptions to this rule.,
Read words aloud if you're unsure.","How to Use ""A"" and ""An"" Correctly1"," In English, nearly all words that begin with consonants will be preceded by the article ""A.""For example: a pet, a door, a green onion, a cat, a hysterical joke.;
, Some words may be spelled beginning with vowels but be pronounced with initial consonant sounds. Words that begin in h, y, u, and eu or ""e"" are common words that can cause confusion.


Use ""A"" when u makes the same sound as the y in you: a union, a unicorn, a used napkin, a usability study.
Use ""A"" when o makes the same sound as w in won: a one-legged man.
Use ""A"" when eu or ""e"" makes the same sound as y: a European trip, a ewe lamb
Do not use ""A"" when the h is silent.

, Sometimes, the way the word looks on the page is not enough to tell you which article to use. Read the word aloud in the way it sounds appropriate to you, and then base your article use on that.

Remember the difference in case between the pronouns.,
Think like a native.,
Reduce or simplify the sentence.,
Avoid ""Bizarro-speak."",
Use pronouns correctly in comparisons to prevent ambiguity.","How to Choose Between ""I"" and ""Me"" Correctly"," Both I and me are pronouns that we use to refer to ourselves, but I is nominative, suitable for use as the subject of a sentence or clause, and me is accusative, suitable for use as the object of a verb.Nominative – The nominative case is used when the pronoun is the subject (e.g. ""I rode in the car"") or, when speaking very formally, after a form of ""to be"" (e.g. ""It is I,"" would be formal, ""It's me"" would be informal).

Accusative – The accusative case is used when the pronoun is the object (e.g. ""He drove me to work"") or with prepositions (e.g. ""between you and me,"" not ""between you and I"").

, Most native speakers rarely make case errors with these pronouns, except when they are paired with other nouns as part of a compound subject or object. (Unfortunately, problems with pronoun case are more common today than twenty years ago.) Although almost no one would say, ""Harry took I in his car,"" one often hears sentences such as ""Harry took Jordan and I in his car.""


If you're trying to determine which pronoun to use in a sentence with a compound subject, try the sentence using only the pronoun part of the subject. Whichever pronoun, I or me, sounds right alone is the one to use in the compound subject.

, It can be hard to tell whether to use ""I"" or ""me"" in a long, complicated sentence with more than one subject or object. For example, ""Me, Hector, and Sam went to the store"" doesn't sound to most people all that much better or worse than ""Hector, Sam, and I went to the store.""


Mentally delete all other subjects or objects so that the sentence is reduced to its simplest form, with just ""I"" or ""me"" remaining. In this example, you would be left with ""Me went to the store"" and ""I went to the store.""
Now, it's much easier to see that ""I"" is correct.

, In Superman comics, there's an imperfect version of Superman called Bizarro, and he does everything in a backward sort of way. He says, ""Goodbye"" when he means, ""Hello,"" and he says things such as ""Me am so sad to see you"" (meaning ""I'm glad to see you""). Bizarro, and a little bit of conceit, can help you learn proper pronoun use: If you change the subject around to a different spot in the sentence, and make it about you and only you, you can easily spot the places where the wrong usage of ""I"" and ""me"" will make you sound like Bizarro.


Examples:

""Harry and me went to the store."" (Change it around so that Harry's out of the picture and it's just about you - you would never say, ""Me went to the store."")
""Who's at the door?"" You answer, ""It's me."" (No, no, no! You would really properly say, ""It is I."" Consider a related sentence: “That writer is me.” Try reversing the word order,and you end up with “Me am that writer.” You use nominative pronouns such as ""I"" after forms of “to be” (i.e. am, are, is, was, were, be, being, and been). The “to be” functions as an equal sign, so the nouns and pronouns on both sides of the “equal sign” are nominative.
""The cake was made by Justin and I."" (Would you ever say, ""The cake was made by I""?)



, Write out the full comparison to decide which pronoun to use.In the following sentence, ""I"" or ""me"" may both be correct, but the word you select changes the meaning of the sentence: ""She likes Winifred more than I/me.""


""She likes Winifred more than I"" means that ""She likes Winifred more than I like Winifred.""
""She likes Winifred more than me"" extends to ""She likes Winifred more than she likes me.""
Writing out the implied words can help you avoid ambiguity and use the correct word in context.

Use the words in songs or quotes.,
Look for video footage.,
Make a podcast.,
Get a friend to quiz you.",How to Ace Your Vocabulary Tests2," Think of a word that means the same as the word you’re trying to learn. Then think of a song or quote that includes the word you already know, and switch the words. Sing or say these to yourself over and over again until you get them into your head. An example might be:“I’ve obtained you, babe” rather than “I’ve got you, babe”
“What’s the big notion?” rather than “What’s the big idea?”

, Search for your word in the search engine function of online video sites. It can be really helpful to hear the word spoken, see the footage, and be able to link the word and the video. If you play the video enough times, you will start to hear the word in your head in the voice of the person on the video. This can help you differentiate it from all the other words you’re studying., Record yourself saying the words, then saying them in a sentence, or as part of a song or quote. Listen to your recording repeatedly. For many of us, listening to something over and over works even better than using flash cards.

, Using the list of vocabulary words you need to know, have a friend ask you what one means and then use it in a sentence. It’s a good way to force yourself to prove to someone else that you know the words, and saying it out loud can help in the memorization process.

Take your words and exercise.,
Make up gestures.,
Study in a different position.",How to Ace Your Vocabulary Tests3," While you’re running, on an elliptical machine, or doing whatever exercise you do, work on a group of five words. Say them over and over to yourself and think about them as you work through the rhythm of your workout. Do the first one from your flashcard, and then repeat the word and definition without it 10-20 more times., If you’re really have a tough time remembering some of the words, you could make up different gestures to go with each word. The gesture you choose might have something to do with the meaning, but it could also be tied to the rhythm of the word, the number of syllables, or how it sounds. Find the gesture that most accurately mimics the word for you. Keep doing it over and over with your word.


Try kicks or jumps for the syllable with the most emphasis.
Try hand gestures or head motions for the syllables that aren't emphasized.

, Sometimes you need to get out of your comfort zone and do something different to help yourself remember the words. If you normally work at a desk, choose a different place in your study area to sit cross-legged on the floor. In that position, think about one word that you want to remember. Focus on that word and its definition. Repeat 10-20 times. For the next word, find a different position – standing by the window, sitting against the wall, leaning against the door – the position doesn’t matter. What matters is that then hopefully you will associate that word with being in that place and that position and remember the word.

Read widely.,
Learn from context.,
Keep track of new words.,
Learn another language.",How to Ace Your Vocabulary Tests4," This means reading books and articles on a variety of topics. By reading a lot and about different topics, themes, and ideas, you’re going to start learning a whole new set of vocabulary words. Your new words will also start to pop up in other places, including vocabulary tests!Read works written more than 50 years ago. These will include older words less in use now. Standardized tests such as the SAT and GRE love testing students on archaic vocabulary.
Check out some academic works in fields that interest you. Each academic field tends to have some specialized vocabulary.
Find books written in other countries that share your language. For example, British and American English have slightly different vocabularies and usage – you can learn great new words by reading books by Americans if you’re British, or vice versa.

, When we see a new word for the first time, the first impulse most of us have is to try and learn what it means from the context. Sometimes you can get an almost complete sense of the word’s meaning just from the context. At other times, however, it’s obvious that it’s a specialized word, and you’ll need to look it up. But keep honing those context skills – they will stand you in good stead during a vocabulary test!, When you learn a new word, write it down, along with a definition. Keep it on your phone, on your computer, in a notebook – wherever is going to be the most convenient for you to make a note of the new word.

, Even though this might sound counterintuitive, learning or knowing another language can be very helpful when it comes to vocabulary. Since many English words have roots in other languages, if you know another language sometimes it can help you piece together a meaning. For example, many words have Greek or Latin roots. Learning either of these languages (or just learning the important roots) can help immensely in both spelling and understanding words with which you aren’t familiar."

Use ""An"" before all words that begin with vowel sounds.,
Understand that there are also some exceptions to this rule.,
Understand that pronunciation may vary depending on geographical location.,
Understand that the word ""historic"" is a special case.","How to Use ""A"" and ""An"" Correctly2"," In English, nearly all words that begin with vowels will be preceded by the article ""An.""For example: an apple, an elbow, an Indian.

, Some words may be spelled beginning with consonants but be pronounced with initial vowel sounds. Words that begin in h are the most common causes of confusion, but there are some other letters that can pose a challenge, too.


Use ""An"" before a silent h: an hour, an honorable peace, an honest error.
Use ""An"" before words that are spelled with consonants but pronounced with vowel sounds: an MBA.

, For example, British and American pronunciation of certain words varies dramatically, particularly words beginning in h such as ""herb."" In American pronunciation, the h is silent, so correct usage would be ""an herb."" But in British pronunciation, the h is pronounced, so correct usage would be a herb.

, There is substantial debate over whether the correct usage is ""a historic event"" or ""an historic event.""Nearly all style handbooks and usage guides prefer ""a historic event,"" citing the consonant sound explanation given in this article.However, you may see ""an historic"" crop up from time to time, particularly amongst British writers.


Some American writers will also use ""an"" with longish words (three or more syllables) beginning with H, where the first syllable isn't accented: ""a hypothesis,"" ""an habitual offender.""

Capitalise the first word in a sentence.,
Capitalise all proper nouns.,
Capitalise adjectives derived from proper nouns, or ""proper adjectives"".,
Capitalise personal titles when used specifically as titles, but not when just referring to the rank in general.,
Check capitalisation for abbreviations.,
Respect that publication titles have different capitalisation rules dependent on in-house guides and rules.,
Respect any words with inherent capitalizations.",How to Capitalise," One of the most basic rules of grammar: no matter what type of word the first word in the sentence is, it is usually capitalised. After you write a full stop (also known as a period in American English) at the end of one sentence, make a note in your mind to capitalise the first word of the next.


The first word of sentence written in brackets (also known as parentheses in American English) in the middle of another sentence does not need to be capitalised; for example, in this sentence ""also"" is not capitalised. However, a sentence written in brackets which is not embedded in another sentence will need to start with a capital letter, for example: I didn't really understand what was going on. (I don't often, to be honest!) Oh well.

If a complete sentence follows a colon (:), then the first word can be capitalised, although this is optional. However, note that capitalisation in this case is considered standard in many North American English grammar books.Capitalise the first word in a quotation, unless the quotation is syntactically joined to the sentence. A quotation describing what someone said is usually capitalised as it is apart from the sentence. Quoting a short word or phrase is not usually capitalised, as it does form part of the sentence, for example: What is he doing with that ""thing""?. You can also have longer quotes that are syntactically joined to sentences, for example: She was sent here to ""observe and discreetly ascertain what the hell we were up to"".
Although many spell-checking services may correct this, the first letter of the first word after an ellipsis (...) does not need to be capitalised if it is in the same sentence. The spell checker will recognise the full stops (periods in American English) and try to capitalise the subsequent word, although this is wrong unless it is in a quote. When using an ellipsis in a quote, the next word is allowed to be capitalised at the writer's discretion, as the ellipsis signifies that the writer is still quoting from the same source, but has skipped a part. Capitalise if it makes sense in context.;
, This is perhaps the hardest thing to grasp when capitalising, as you need to be able to identify the difference between proper nouns which must be capitalised, and common nouns which, in English, do not require capitalising. Proper nouns are nouns which refer to one specific, unique thing, such as people, places and objects, as opposed to a common noun which could refer to more than one entities which are not unique. For example, a boy and the boys are left uncapitalized as common nouns, as they could refer to any boy. However, Bob refers to one specific boy, and thus is a capitalised proper noun. Likewise, the village could refer to any village, whereas Hethersett refers to one village in particular.Proper nouns can often be distinguished by the fact that you can't usually put a ""the"" in front of them, for example, you can say the city, but it doesn't really sound right to say the London. Similarly, you can say the program, but you wouldn't say the Skype. Proper nouns also include things like organisations, religions, particular ideas and unique things. The following are some groups of proper nouns that must be capitalised that you should watch out for:



Personal names of people or animals. People's first, last, and however many in-between names are nearly always capitalised. Even though there are probably other people with the same name, when the name is used it refers to one person in particular and thus is a proper noun. One of the most obvious examples of proper nouns, you should nearly always capitalise names. There are a few exceptions, sometimes be seen with people who have a non-English derived surname, such as Dafydd ab Hugh, L. Sprague de Camp, Tim LaHaye, or D. J. MacHale. As a matter of courtesy, one should spell a personal name as the person so named desires.

Brand names and trademarks. Brands (legally called trademarks) refer to one specific brand of products, distinguishable from their competition and are usually proper nouns. They are defined as a ""name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers"".Specific places and countries. Geographical locations like countries, established regions, seas, roads, cities, towns, etc. are all proper nouns as they refer to that place in particular. This also includes geographical features like the Equator, rivers, mountains and public places, structures and buildings. Note that the compass points or directions north, south, east and west do not need to be capitalised as they are not proper nouns, unless they are used as part of the name of an established region, for example, East Anglia or Southern California. Some examples:""Go north, then you'll find yourself in North Carolina.""
""I've come all the way from the South to see you!""
""Our house is in the southwest region of Adelaide."" In this case, the direction acts as an adjective, not a noun.



Calendar items. Days of the week, months and public holidays all need to be capitalised. Days of the week and months are fairly simple to remember, although you must remember that some of the month names have other meanings that should not be capitalised, for example, I may go to the opera or Time to march! Public holidays like Easter, Christmas Eve or St Patrick's Day must be capitalised, no matter which words they are made up of. Similarly, famous historical events and time periods are also capitalised, for example, the Middle Ages or the Revolutionary War

Seasons do not get capitalised. Capitalising the seasons is a very old-fashioned habit that still lingers but spring, autumn (fall), summer and winter are not capitalised unless they are at the beginning of a sentence or form part of a renowned name.Avoid capitalising descriptors of eras, such as the eighties, the sixties, etc.



, These are usually adjectives made up from proper nouns, and must be capitalised just like their ancestors. Note that any other parts of speech derived from proper nouns should also be capitalised, for example, a ""proper verb"" like Americanise or a ""proper adverb"" like Britishly.



Nationalities and languages. These are the biggest example of proper adjectives, and must always be capitalised, as they are proper adjectives derived from the name of that particular region. For example, from the proper noun Germany comes the proper adjectives German (referring to the language that is spoken there) and German (referring to a person, object, custom, etc. that originates from Germany). However, this is not limited to nationalities which derive from a specific proper noun – it includes any race, tribe, etc. including names like ""Cherokee"" and ""Asian""

Note that this is complicated by varying approaches to national references when used in a non-literal sense, such as French fry/french fry, French doors/french doors or French poodle/french poodle. The capitalization or otherwise of these ""non-literal"" words is dependent on the style guide you're referring to and often on how much you'd really like to associate the French with French... or is it french... fries., This includes the more common mister and miss, familial titles like sister and father, courtesy titles like earl and duchess and military ranks like wing commander and sergeant. When used as a title, the first letter must be capitalised whether the title is in its abbreviated form or not, for example, Mister Jones and Mr Jones (in each of these cases, the person's specific name is attached to the title). In the example given in the picture, the two titles are capitalised because they are used as personal titles, rather than just a captain, it is the captain. Although ""Captain"" does not precede a name, it is still capitalised because it is used in place of a name. Some examples:




""I disagree Senator Bandy Andy."" (direct address to person)
""Senator Bandy Andy disliked attending committee meetings in the month of May."" (before a person's name)
The senator gave a speech at the dinner party held in honour of his years in office. (common noun)


Royalty is also included. Any royal, imperial or position of office titles are also included in the title rule, although it is a little more complicated. You can say both the king and the King and either will be right depending on in which context it was used. When you are referring to a specific king, and this is clear, you can capitalise, for example, the King of Denmark. If you are in England, their queen is always referred to as ""the Queen"", and it is obvious which queen this is referring to. This title stands for her name - not many people would just refer to her as ""Elizabeth""! Royal styles are also capitalised, e.g. His Majesty.
Family names can also be thought of as personal titles. They are capitalised only when used in place of a name or preceding a name, e.g. Uncle Joe. Normally, the familial term is just a regular noun, e.g. I have one sister. However, when used as a substitute for a name, that usage is a proper noun. Remember: all names are capitalised. When used in front of a name, that is a personal title. This above rules about personal titles do also apply when ""family"" names are used in a medical or religious context, as in that case they are used as titles, for example, Father Joseph, or Sister Kate.

, Initials and abbreviations are often written in all capital letters, although this differs depending on the word in general. (An initialism is a term often used for acronyms that are made up of and pronounced as a series of initial letters, for example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the British Broadcasting Corporation). These can be written in all capitals, for example, FAQ or USA, or also as a normal word, for example, Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization) or laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation).If you're not sure, look up the word in question in a search engine and see how others capitalise it.


The capitalisation of ""internet"" or ""Internet"" is an interesting case still under evolution. Either way is currently accurate, dependent on what you use as your reference source, although it does seem to be evolving more towards being treated as a common noun, especially outside of North America., Things like book titles, movie titles, song and album titles, historical documents, laws, newspaper headlines, etc. are each treated a little differently. It's ""War and Peace"" not ""War and peace"", right? These titles aren't all always capitalised the same way, but follow similar patterns, quite like wikiHow article titles. Often, the first word (whatever it be may) and maybe the last word of the title is capitalised, along with any words that are not articles (like a or the), coordinate conjunctions or prepositions (like of, to, or in) that have less than five letters, for example, The Catcher in the Rye.


Titles using all capitalisation is a personal or organisational preference.While the initial letter should be capitalised at the beginning of the title, always aim for consistency of use with either all upper or all lowercase (after the initial word) for the entire title. Always check your organisation's or publisher's style guide to see what they prefer for titles.

, Some nouns have odd capitalization, most commonly brand names, websites, etc. For example, this includes Apple Inc. products, often titled things like iPad, iPod; software like MediaWiki and websites like deviantArt and even wikiHow! These words are always spelt thus regardless of other rules. wikiHow can go at the start of the sentence without capitalising its first letter, because it is always spelt with a lowercase w.


Where possible, do your best to avoid placing an unusually capitalised noun at the beginning of the sentence, and that way you can avoid writing ""IPod"" or ""WikiHow"".

For example, change ""IPods are used by high school students for learning purposes"" to ""High school students use iPods for learning purposes"".

Acquire a map.,
Look at a key.,
Consult basic color references.,
Know your map.,
Know how to read the native language you're in.,
Figure out where you are.,
A good way to find your location if you are unsure is to find two landmarks.,
If you just want to go from one place to another, all you need to do is to plot that single route out.

,
If there are several places you intend to go to, you may want to plan your route in such a way that you visit all the places in the shortest possible way.,
If you are using public transport


You will need to do the above map alignment, to make sure it is turned the right way around, at your destination(s) too

",How to Read a Foreign City Map," This can be found at tourist centers, at some restaurants, and sometimes on the ground. They may seem a little dirty, but still work just as well;
, This tells you what different symbols mean. Be sure not to mix up things by little details. The key is normally located in the lower right hand corner of a map.

, If the map is in color. Normally, green means ground and blue means water. This won't help much for directions to a hotel, but can help if you're looking for a beach or lake.

, If there isn't a key, it is important to know basic land-forms like roads, buildings, and mountains. If you don't know:


Roads and highways are normally represented by yellow or gray lines.
Buildings are represented by the shape of the roof.
Mountains are represented by up-side-down V's or M's.

, If it is in a different alphabet to the one that you are used to, you will have to compare the lettering as if it were a picture. Most of the time the map will be in native tongue, so knowing how to read it is often essential with the key, landmarks, and buildings.

, You have your map and you're ready to use it.


Now you need to figure out where you are before you can plot where you're going. You can do so by matching what you can see in real life with what is on the map. Common features that help identify your location on a map includes road names, landmarks and prominent natural features, like rivers.

,


For example, if you can see a prominent tower which appears on the map in front of you, and a marked street behind you to your left. Find those two landmarks on the map. Hold the map so that the tower in front of you is at the top of your map, and the marked street is below where you are, on the map, so that all other points on the map represent all that you see around you.

,, You can do so by visiting the nearer places first before the further places.

Graduate with a bachelor's degree from an accredited university.,
Attend lectures and conferences on foreign aid work and meet as many people involved in the field as you can.,
Volunteer with an aid organization either at home or abroad.,
Secure full-time employment in your field of expertise as you seek out an international position and volunteer with aid organizations.,
Travel abroad, preferably in the area in which you would like to work as an aid worker.,
Pursue internships or training programs in international aid organizations that are meant to introduce young workers to the field.

,
Contact alumni from your university and connections you have made during your volunteering and work experience who work in the international aid field.,
Search for job openings online.,
Apply for a job for which you are qualified.",How to Become an Aid Worker for the UN," Study subjects relevant to aid work, such as nursing, social sciences, or languages.;
, Introduce yourself as an aspiring aid worker.


In general, the international aid worker community, and especially that of the United Nations, is a rather close community, and you will need to make yourself known to that community before applying for positions.

,


You do not need to volunteer with a United Nations project at first, and the exact nature of your work is not as important as the experience you gain on an aid project. Even working in the office of an international organization will give you valuable exposure to the aid world.

,


A good heart is not enough to win a position as an aid worker; professional experience and a demonstrated work ethic are essential. Working for a year as a nurse or a teacher will make you a much more attractive candidate for the UN.

, Gain as much language proficiency as you can.

,, Ask them about available positions with the United Nations and any friends they may have in the organization.


The hiring process for aid work, including that of the United Nations, relies heavily on connections and recommendations. It is essential that you know someone in the field, if not at the UN, who can vouch for you.

, Look for positions marked FS-1, which require the least amount of experience.

, In your cover letter, emphasize your professional experience and not your ideals.


Have your friends or connections attach a recommendation or make a phone call on your behalf. Veteran Aid workers emphasize those connections and demonstrated ability are much more important than professing a desire to change the world.

Be skeptical of ""great deals."",
Slow the salesman down.,
Ask for information in writing.,
Do your own research.",How to Report Travel Scams1," Often a travel scam will try to entice you with language proclaiming a unique offer or an extreme discount.Keep in mind that few legitimate businesses can afford to offer expensive items such as airfare or lodging for free. A free trip typically will include hidden fees and other costs that make it more expensive than if you'd paid market rates.
Be especially wary if you are told you ""won"" a sweepstakes or drawing that you don't remember entering.;
, An individual trying to sell you on a scam doesn't want you to think about it, and typically will speak quickly and forcefully about the deal you're going to pass up if you don't act now.If someone is speaking quickly, interrupting your questions, or is pressuring you to act fast, be skeptical. If the offer was legitimate, the salesman would be willing to answer questions and provide any information you needed.
Scammers use high-pressure tactics to get you to commit to something on the spot. When you later figure out it's a scam, it may be too late to get out of it.

, If you receive details of an offer in writing, you have the opportunity to thoroughly evaluate it and check for any hidden fees or other costs the salesperson may try to downplay.Don't give a telemarketer your credit card or bank account number over the phone – even if they say they only need it to verify your identity. There are plenty of ways to verify someone's identity that don't involve getting a credit card number.
If you do receive written information, pay attention to dates and other restrictions. Be wary of offers that restrict your travel dates or your ability to choose certain dates.
Double-check what is actually included in the offer and what is required of you. For example, it might sound great to stay at a five-star resort for a week for $100, but there may be other charges assessed by the resort (such as daily cleaning fees) and you may have to sit through a lengthy, high-pressure sales pitch to purchase a timeshare at the resort.
Look for the rights claimed by the company extending the offer, typically located in the legal fine print of the written information. For example, if a company reserves the right to cancel or reschedule your trip without notice to you, this means you probably will never get the trip you purchase.

, Even if you're convinced the offer is genuine, look into the company and learn from the experiences of other customers.If the company provides reviews from ""satisfied customers,"" keep in mind that the company will edit the information it provides to entice others. A company isn't going to publish a review itself if someone says the offer was a scam or that they had a bad experience.
Do an online search for ""scam"" or related words such as ""complaints"" and see what comes up. This is sometimes the quickest way to locate real reviews about a potentially fraudulent company.
If the offer requires accommodations at a particular hotel, or flight through a named airline, contact customer service for those companies and confirm that they have knowledge of or have approved the offer.

Bring two of everything.,
Only take basic toiletries.,
Pack efficiently.",How to Save Money on Travel Gear2," Try to avoid bringing a combination of outfits. Instead, only pack the clothing that you will absolutely need.

Clothes that are neutral in color make it easier to mix and match to create new outfits.

, Basic toiletries like a toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, contact solution (if it applies to you), and soap are the only toiletries that you really need to bring. Additionally, try to buy products that can be used for multiple purposes, especially for your make-up products. Travel-size products are also cheaper than their regular versions and take up less room.The make-up stick, Nars The Multiple, works as a blush, lip tint, and highlighter. Eyebrow and lip liner can also double as eye liner.
Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soap can be used as a body wash, shampoo, and even as a toothpaste.
Instead of bringing your expensive make-up products, buy cheaper products at discount pharmacies, like CVS and Walgreens.

You can also use your shoes for additional space by packing your socks and underwear into your shoes.

To locate the nearest embassy, check here: http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country.html

Navigate to the country or geographic area you are visiting.
Once you view the specific country's webpage, look under the ""Embassies and Consulates"" section to find the nearest location.



, This is the section of the embassy or consulate equipped to handle passport troubles.


Make sure that you specify whether or not your passport is merely lost or if it has been stolen.
Let the staff know the details of your travel plans, especially if you need to leave the foreign country within a short period of time.

, Usually, you will need to take a new photograph for your replacement passport. If you call the consulate or embassy, the staff should be able to direct you to a location where you can obtain that photograph.


You will need this photo before you can advance through the process, so you should try to have it before you visit the Consular Section in person.
The photograph must be a full frontal view of your face and in color. It should also measure 2 inches by 2 inches (5 cm by 5 cm) in size.

, Aside from a valid photograph, you will also need to show the consulate staff valid identification, evidence of your U.S. citizenship, your travel itinerary, and a police report (if applicable). You will need to complete Forms DS-11 and DS-64, as well.

, The majority of U.S. embassies and consulates will not issue passports on weekends or holidays. Each one has after-hours duty officers, however, so you can still contact the embassy or consulate after hours if you have a life-or-death emergency or have been the victim of a serious crime.


Duty officers will only respond to serious emergencies. For instance, if you need to get home to the United States for urgent medical treatment, the officer will likely help you obtain your replacement passport.

Allow states to impose trade restrictions for human rights concerns.,
Require states to recognize contracts and property rights, including intellectual property rights.,
Encourage governments to support businesses in conflict-affected areas.,
Include recognition of human rights as a condition for entering international trade agreements.,
Provide for penalties and sanctions within trade organizations.",How to Protect Human Rights in International Trade1," Although international free trade agreements typically stress openness among the countries signing the agreement, they protect human rights by allowing trade restrictions to remain in place against countries violating human rights.For example, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allows states to ban imports produced using prison labor.
GATT also allows states to set trade restrictions where necessary for moral reasons, or to protect human life or health.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has come under criticism that its system interferes with the ability of member-states to punish human rights abuses through trade sanctions.
WTO rules do allow for trade restrictions in response to violations of human rights, but only within agreed limits. Other agreements such as GATT, however, provide exceptions to WTO rules under which greater sanctions can be made.;
, Providing legal recognition of basic property rights not only makes a developing country more attractive in terms of trade and investment, but may improve human rights.Enforcement of contractual and property rights leads to economic growth, but recognition of these fundamental rights is important to continued social development.
Basic recognition of property rights in many cases is a necessary prerequisite to any significant foreign investment, particularly in the tech industry.
Empirical evidence suggests that better economic rights, including secure property rights, leads to an increase in social development and stronger human rights protections.
At the same time, broad recognition of intellectual property rights, and in particular of pharmaceutical patents, can negatively impact the right to health and medical care in developing countries.

, Human rights are most likely to be abused when an area is facing internal conflict, particularly when that conflict is centered around competition for territory or resources.In countries or regions experiencing conflict, businesses may seek guidance from governments on how to avoid contributing to or exacerbating human rights problems.
Global companies operating in a conflict-torn location may require assistance from their home countries to continue protecting human rights and avoid being involved in human rights abuses in that context.
Close cooperation between countries, international organizations, and nonprofit development organizations can help protect human rights in conflict-affected areas while continuing open international trade and economic engagement with the area.

, Countries can protect human rights in international trade by requiring other states to sign existing human rights agreements before they are eligible to join free trade regimes.Basic treaty law requires countries who sign international treaties to amend their own national laws where necessary to conform with the requirements of the treaty.
Under this method, individual states have the responsibility for ensuring that national laws and regulations are developed to protect human rights, and that companies within their borders that violate these laws are prosecuted.
Free trade agreements also may include side agreements through which state governments agree to produce annual reports on the impact of the trade agreement on human rights and adjustments that can be made to lessen negative impacts.
The U.N. General Assembly has passed resolutions calling for human rights obligations to be a central consideration in international trade agreements.

, Trade regimes and other international organizations impose economic penalties and trade sanctions on governments that fail to regulate and control the actions of private parties within their borders that violate human rights.This idea comes primarily from the growing understanding among international organizations that human rights must have priority over economic interests.
As parties to an international trade agreement, governments have the obligation to ensure that companies within their borders are complying with any international human rights agreements the country also has joined.
Without penalties and sanctions, membership in an international trade organization or regime could be seen to ratify a government's systemic violations of human rights.
Providing sanctions within a regime allows a country with a poor human rights record to remain within the international community, rather than being violated. Evidence shows human rights tend to deteriorate even further when violating countries are cut off from economic interaction with other countries.
However, keep in mind that in many cases incorporating human rights protections within the framework of international trade organizations such as the WTO would require those organizations to amend their existing rules.

"
"
Accord rights to non-state actors.,
Set minimum human rights standards as conditions for international loans and other financial assistance.,
Develop benchmarks to monitor compliance.,
Allow victims of human rights violations to file private lawsuits.",How to Protect Human Rights in International Trade2," Before an international trade regime can impose human rights rules or regulations directly on private entities such as corporations, it must provide them with the same rights as nation-states have within the regime.For example, the World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes rights of economic actors such as international businesses, and requires their needs to be considered when disputes are decided by WTO tribunals.
This also requires making room for non-state actors such as global organizations in international organizations, which previously have been made up solely of state governments.
Creating opportunities for global corporations to collaborate with governments on the development and implementation of human rights agreements can strengthen the protection of human rights in international trade.
Providing global corporations with a voice in the organizations that create and administer international trade agreements ensures all actors due process rights are protected under the trade regime.

, International financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) may require states to prove a percentage of funds will be used to improve the human rights of its citizens as a condition of receiving financial assistance.The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights publishes a set of guiding principles for businesses and international organizations to use in entering trade and investment agreements with developing countries that have mixed records on human rights.
Both the World Bank and the IMF, in response to criticism from non-governmental organizations, have pledged to place greater emphasis on poverty reduction and the recognition of basic human rights as fundamental to sustainable development in poor countries.
When particular policies or practices are required to obtain funding, the lending organizations can impose human rights protections directly on the businesses receiving the money.

, If a country receives funds contingent on the continued development of human rights, international financial organizations can create benchmarks to measure the country's progress towards improved human rights.Benchmarks also are beneficial in monitoring and evaluating human rights progress in countries that have joined trade regimes such as the WTO but which have objectionable human rights records.
Setting goals for progress and requiring independent evaluation and assessment of the country's steps towards those goals allows continued economic involvement and investment in the country without sending the message that the international community approves of continued violations of human rights.
Allowing time to correct human rights abuses also acknowledges the fact that policies and standards can take time – and considerable economic investment – to change.

, Multinational corporations can be held liable for the violation of international human rights laws if victims are empowered to sue those companies.Such lawsuits have been allowed in American and British courts, in which individual plaintiffs sue to hold multinational corporations responsible for violations of international human rights laws that occur in their factories overseas.
These lawsuits reflect an understanding that global corporations should be held responsible for violations of international law.
This is a change from the traditional understanding that only national governments were accountable for violations of treaties and international agreements, not private actors.
However, states allowing private lawsuits also is in line with the understanding that states have a duty to protect the human rights of their citizens, both from government action and from the action of private parties.

"
"
Encourage global corporations to lead by example.,
Use consumer purchasing schemes to influence corporate behavior.,
Empower international industry commissions to enforce human rights through trade restrictions.",How to Protect Human Rights in International Trade3," The employment practices and environmental safeguards of global corporations can impact governments and other companies in developing countries to insist on higher standards that protect the human rights of their people.Global corporations can use the U.N.'s guiding principles on human rights to focus their strategies and develop polices for operating and investing in countries with histories of human rights abuses.
Many global corporations have included policies stressing adherence to basic human rights in their company codes of conduct, although the full implementation and enforcement of these standards is erratic.
However, opponents argue allowing corporations to have a role in setting national economic and social policies may undermine democratic participation and the voice of the people in their governments.

, Nonprofit organizations dedicated to protecting human rights often use the power of the consumer to pressure global corporations to implement human rights standards.For example, consumer boycotts can exert economic pressure on a company, and if successful cause the company either to change and enforce more stringent human rights policies in its operations, or to abandon projects in developing countries with poor human rights records.
Labeling regimes inspect and certify items produced by people whose human rights have been protected. To earn certification, companies must implement strict policies that provide fair wages and employment standards for all workers.
Global corporations that see value in being known as good global citizens may be pressured by consumer behavior into ceasing operations in countries with widespread and systemic abuses of human rights.

, Trade councils in specific industries can weave recognition of human rights into their rules, refusing to grant membership to companies that ignore human rights in pursuit of profit.For example, the international diamond industry worked with the U.N. to implement a ban on trade in rough diamonds from Sierra Leone following reports that these diamonds were being used to support bloody conflict in the country.
Industry organizations also have entered into human rights agreements with international labor organizations. These agreements typically cover issues such as minimum wages, working conditions, hours and overtime, and maternity leave.

Learn to distinguish sex trafficking from other commercial sex operations.,
Review posts on personals sites.,
Track profiles on social media.,
Create your own blog or website.,
Start or participate in an online awareness campaign.",How to Help Reduce Sex Trafficking in Your Town1," Unlike other commercial sex, which may or may not be legal depending on where you live, sex trafficking induces or recruits young women into commercial sex using force or fraud.Minors under the age of 18 who work in commercial sex are considered to be victims of sex trafficking without regard to whether they entered the industry due to force, fraud, or coercion.Websites such as the Trafficking Resource Center include links to federal and other laws that deal with sex trafficking in the U.S. You can use this and other similar websites to research the issue and learn how to identify possible sex trafficking operations.;
, Sex traffickers often use sites such as Backpage and Craigslist that offer free or anonymous personal ads.


These ads may be used to find clients or to recruit new girls. In addition to looking at personals or ads for escorts or companions, also look at employment ads targeted towards young women.
Take notes of patterns you see, including photos of younger-looking girls in front of similar backdrops, or similar descriptions accompanying different images.
If you see posts that you suspect were created by sex traffickers, or that include pictures of unwilling participants, flag the posts so the website will remove them.
This activity doesn't necessarily stop sex trafficking, but it does make it more difficult for the sex traffickers to use these free online services to find clients or recruit new girls.
Don't confuse your activism with policing. You should never attempt to contact the girls, as you could make their lives more dangerous. Don't attempt to contact the adults, or to bait or trap them – leave that up to law enforcement officials.

, Some sex traffickers have profiles of their own on social media sites such as Facebook, or create pages for their girls to attract clients or other girls.


Take screenshots of the pages if you find them, and report inappropriate content to the website or to other authorities.
If you find an account you believe is related to sex trafficking, don't try to engage the people running the account or the girls advertised. Simply observe and take screenshots to give to authorities.
Within the U.S., you can call the National Human Trafficking Resource Center at 1-888-73-7888 to report information on potential sex trafficking activity 24 hours a day, seven days a week., In addition to tracking down the online advertisements of sex traffickers, you may consider creating your own website to discuss incidents of sex trafficking in your area.


Be careful about naming names, as you could subject the girls you're trying to help to greater danger, and anyone you name could potentially sue you.
Use your blog or website to write articles explaining sex trafficking facts and statistics in the U.S. and around the world. Include links to government agencies and non-profits that get girls out of sex trafficking.
If you create crafts or works of art, use your creative endeavors to bring attention to sex trafficking in your town by donating a percentage of your sales to a local or national organization that works to reduce and prevent sex trafficking.

, Use a particular hashtag to start a challenge or game that raises awareness for sex trafficking in the U.S. and around the world.


If organizations have already begun hashtag campaigns, participate in those activities and encourage all your friends and followers on social media to participate as well.
You also can use social media to amplify your message and educate more people about the problem of sex trafficking in your town."

Understand the economic factors.,
Understand the role of education.,
Research organizations.",How to Take Action to End Child Labor1," Before we can take action, we need to understand what leads to child labor. In many impoverished countries, children make up nearly half the labor force. Sometimes families need their children to work and help pay household expenses, and employers take advantage of this desperation by forcing children to work long hours in hazardous conditions for low pay and no rights., One of the root causes of child labor is poor or corrupt schools and a “lack of earning during learning.” Most basically defined, “lack of earning during learning” means that children are not earning money while they are attending school; this lack of earning and the need for families to earn more money results in school dropout. Improving access to quality education is one way to intervene and help stop child labor.

, Use the internet to find out which organizations support anti-child labor initiatives. Browse their mission statements and events pages to get a sense of their stance on the issues, and how they plan to help exploited children workers. Here are a couple of websites to start with:

Learn about the economic reasons behind poverty creation.,
Consider how capitalism has benefited the people with the loudest economic voice.,
Understand the strategic reasons behind global poverty.,
Realize that there are many key economic and strategic reasons for the US and the Western world to actively be involved in solving global poverty.",How to Understand the Costs of Global Poverty," Currently, over a billion people live on less than $1 per day. They are recipients of large amounts of aid, yet so far the international community has been unable to substantially reduce the prevalence of global poverty.


Foreign Policy Magazine describes the world's poor as the largest untapped market on earth.If global poverty is reduced or eliminated, then developed countries can stop receiving aid and and become independent. People will transition from surviving on handouts into consumers, thus becoming new markets for US companies.
Most of the US top trading partners were once recipients of US foreign aid. After WWII, the US used large amounts of foreign aid to prop up the European and Asian economies, Japan and Germany in particular. Today, Japan and Germany are among the U.S's main trading partners.;
, Poor people in rural areas of developing countries have little say in affecting how businesses sell their products. That is why a cure for balding has been more profitable than a cure for malaria. Bill Gates describes this disparity between the supply and demand for goods in the developing world and the failure of capitalism in a Time Interview (video below).


If the developing world can increase its economic standing, then it stands to produce and consume a large number of new goods and services. The world's economy stands to increase in size by several billion people.
The developing world contributes very little to the global economy right now. If global poverty were to be drastically reduced, this would not be the case. One of the costs of widespread poverty is a global economy that falls very short of its potential.

, One of the main reasons behind anti-American sentiment in the global south is the vast economic inequality between the US (and the West) and the developing world.


The National Security Strategy of the Bush Administration noted, ""A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human race lives on less than$2 a day, is neither just nor stable"".Impoverished, hopeless people are often easy prey for terrorists organizations, drug cartels and other groups that pose a threat to global security.
Poverty doesn't make people into terrorists, but it does create the conditions of instability that allow terrorists groups to operate freely.
Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia, North Korea: Many of the poorest countries on earth are also regions where the United States has national security concerns.
""The events of September 11, 2001, taught us that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders.""- Bush 2002 National Security Strategy
One aspect of the 2010 US National Security Strategy involves ""proactively investing in stronger societies and human welfare"" because it ""is far more effective and efficient than responding after state collapse""

, The opportunity costs that have been lost because of global poverty (i.e. untapped economic potential, poor countries posing security threats) are perhaps the most significant tangible costs of poverty. The amount that is contributed to foreign aid is minuscule compared to the costs incurred because of the economic and strategic effects of poverty.

Draft or sign a petition.,
Hold a public demonstration.,
Call your congressman or local representative.,
Speak at a town hall meeting.,
Work with schools and youth programs.,
Write a letter to the editor.",How to Help Reduce Sex Trafficking in Your Town2," Search for a petition asking state or local government officials to pass a law that more closely regulates sex trafficking, or provides greater punishments for sex trafficking convictions.Check local or national rules to determine what guidelines you must follow to make sure your petition is legitimate. For example, if you want a government body to take action on a particular piece of pending legislation, you probably must make sure that all signatures are made by adults who are residents of the area., A protest can be a powerful means of raising public awareness about sex trafficking in your own community, particularly if you place demonstrators in the location where victims of sex trafficking often are found.


For example, if there is a hotel where sex traffickers have been observed operating, you might consider having demonstrators encircle the hotel to draw attention to the activities and make it difficult for sex traffickers to operate without being seen by the demonstrators.
Check with your local government and find out what permits you need to secure before you schedule the demonstration, as well as any legal restrictions you must follow while conducting the demonstration.
Restrictions typically revolve around ensuring you don't block the flow of traffic or unduly disturb people in the area.For example, if you wanted to hold a demonstration in a residential area, you probably would be restricted from blasting loud music or using bullhorns in the evening when people were at home or sleeping.

, Speaking to your representative directly can increase government activity to reduce sex trafficking as well as signal to your representative that sex trafficking is an issue of concern among his constituents.


Consider sending a written letter or email if you want to make sure you communicate all the points you need the government official to know. The other benefit of a letter is that once you've written a good letter you can send it to multiple officials, so you don't have to recreate your statement from scratch each time you talk to someone.You may find elected representatives more receptive to your calls if they are up for re-election, as they will be more interested in addressing issues of concern to local constituents during that time.

, If your local area holds regular town hall meetings, prepare a statement to make at that meeting along with educational materials.


You also can request a specific meeting or public hearing be held to discuss the issue of sex trafficking in your town. If you know when the hearing will be held, you can plan speeches and organize material to educate the public and communicate the problem, as well as galvanizing community support for victims of sex trafficking in your area.
Check with the city government ahead of time and see if you need to get on the agenda before the meeting is held, or if there is a period of time in which the floor is open for general comments from residents., Educational programs at schools and in other youth programs can empower young women and keep girls from falling victim to sex traffickers out of fear or desperation.If the local schools don't yet have any programs that address the dangers of sex trafficking, encourage teachers and school administrators to include the issue in their curriculum, and provide educational materials to assist them., If you can get a letter published in your local paper, you can raise awareness of the issue of sex trafficking in your town.


In your letter, include tips on what people can do to help reduce sex trafficking, and provide phone numbers or websites that provide additional resources.Make it a point to stress that sex trafficking is not just a faraway problem happening on the other side of the world, but is something that happens every day all over the U.S. and may be happening in your town as well.Keep your letter concise, but write with passion and grab the reader's attention. Use your letter to educate the public about sex trafficking in your area as well as providing information on actions people can take to reduce sex trafficking."

For example, if you have clothes that you intend to donate, you might donate them specifically to sex trafficking victims who are trying to re-integrate into society, rather than to a general donation service.
If you have skills or education that enable you to provide services sex trafficking victims may need, such as legal or medical services, consider donating time in which you provide your skills free of charge to victims in need., If an organization already involved in combatting sex trafficking in your area stages a concert or other program to raise money and awareness for the cause, attend or volunteer to help work the event., Even the smallest amount of money can make a huge difference in what a non-profit organization is able to do to help young women escape sex traffickers and get back on their feet.If you can buy a t-shirt or bumper sticker that includes a hotline or website address, you can raise awareness of the dangers of sex trafficking every time you wear the shirt or drive your car., If you have a lot of connections, you might consider holding your own event to help raise money for a non-profit in your area., If there isn't a significant non-profit presence in your area, you could work with a national non-profit organization to start a small branch operation in your town."

Practice!",How to Use Microsoft Office PowerPoint," When you start a new PowerPoint file, you can either create a blank presentation or a template. Blank presentations allow you to apply your own style, but this can be a time-consuming process. Templates can give your presentation a uniform style, but they may not suit your exact needs.


You can edit any aspect of a template, so feel free to choose one that mostly matches your vision and tweak it as you see fit.
You can apply themes to your project at a later time after you've added content. Click the Design tab and select a theme. It will be immediately applied to your project. You can either undo it (Ctrl + Z) or revert to a blank theme if you don't like it.
You can access templates from the File tab. Click New and then browse the available templates. You can also download additional templates from a variety of resources online.;
, Your title is the first thing that your audience will see. It should be easy to read and give a basic overview about the topic of the presentation. Most presenters will include their or their group's name on the title as well.

, Press Ctrl + M for a new slide. A blank slide will be added after the slide you are currently on. The slide will contain a title box and a text box. You can choose to use these or insert your own objects using the Insert tab.


When adding a text box, you can click and drag to make it whatever size you'd like. You can then adjust this later by grabbing one of the corners with your cursor and then clicking and dragging again.
You can click on any text box and start typing to begin adding text to your presentation. You can format text just as you would in Word, with formatting options available in the Home tab.

, You can use the frame on the left side of the window to quickly scroll through your slides. Clicking any of them will open that slide so that you can edit it. You can click the Outline tab to see an outline tree of your presentation. Each slide will be labeled by the slide title.

, You can get a basic feel for the flow of your presentation at this point by pressing F5 to start the slide show. Click the mouse to advance the slides. Use the preview slide show to get an idea of how long the presentation is and how well information flows from one slide to the next.

, Once you have some content in your slides, you can start adding some effects to help make it a bit more interesting for your audience. Select a slide and click the Transitions tab. You will see a list of the most common transitions. You can also click the arrow at the end of the list to open the full listing of available transitions.


When you pick a transition, it will affect how that slide appears. For example, adding a transition to Slide 2 will affect how Slide 1 transitions into Slide 2. You will be able to see a preview in the slide editing window when you click each transition.
Avoid going crazy with a bunch of different transitions. This can be distracting to the audience and keeps them from focusing on what's most important: your content.

, Plain white is boring. If your presentation is standard text on a plain white background, half of your audience will be asleep before you reach the third slide. Use subtle backgrounds to add a little visual flair to your project.


Right-click on a blank section of your slide and select ""Format Background"", or click the Design tab and the click the arrow icon next to ""Background"" on the far right.
Choose your fill type. You can choose a solid color, a gradient fill, a picture background, or a pattern fill. Selecting each choice will display several options for it, such as fill color, picture location, gradient settings, and more. Experiment until you find the background that fits your presentation.
By default, the background will only be applied to your active slide. Click the ""Apply to All"" button to apply your background choices to every slide.
Make sure that your text is still easily readable with the background you choose.

, Adding pictures, diagrams, and other visual aids can help the audience grasp the ideas of your presentation and drive your point home. Images break up the monotony of text and help keep the audience from tuning out.


Click the Insert tab. There will be a large number of options when it comes to inserting objects. Click the Picture button to insert a picture from a file on your computer. You can click the Photo Album button to insert an entire album of photos into the slide as well.
Use the Charts button to insert easy-to-read charts that will help the audience understand your data. Once you choose your Chart type, Excel will open, allowing you to enter in your data or copy it from an existing spreadsheet.
Use the Shapes button to insert pre-made shapes or dray your own. You can use the shapes to outline important text or create arrows and other visual indicators.
Avoid drowning your presentation with pictures. If it looks too busy, the audience will have a hard time parsing your written information.

, You can add links to your slides that will allow you to quickly access websites or email addresses. This can be especially useful if you are distributing the presentation and want people to be able to easily view related webpages or send you an email.


To add a link, place your cursor in a text box and then click the Hyperlink button on the Insert tab. You can choose to link to a file on your computer, a webpage, an email address, or even another slide in your presentation.

, You can add video files to your slides. This can be useful for reports or any other video file that may relate to your presentation. The video file will play when the slide appears.Click the Video button in the Insert tab. you will be able to browse your computer for video files.
While it's not as straightforward, you can embed YouTube videos as well. See this guide to learn how.

, Extremely long presentations will bore your audience, even if they are obsessed with your subject matter. Extraneous slides with little to no content will also make the presentation drag and wear on the audience's interest. Try to keep your presentation short and sweet, and make sure you are using the space on each slide to it's maximum potential.

, Presentations are designed to be read, otherwise it would just be a speech. Make sure that your audience will be able to easily read what you have written. A 10 point font may look okay when you're sitting at your computer, but when it's projected on the screen, people may be leaning forward in their seats straining to read.


On a related note, make sure that your font choice is readable as well. Curvy and extravagant fonts may look cool, but they'll make your audience just stop caring if they can't read it.

, The best presentations are those that have a consistent, deliberate style. use minimal amounts of color and stylistic accents to make your presentation stand out without being garish. When in doubt, use one of the templates for a guide.

, If you misspell a word, you might not notice it, but someone in your audience will be sure to spot it. Spelling and grammar mistakes will lower your credibility, even subconsciously, so you'll want to work extra hard to ensure that everything is written clearly and correctly.Get someone to help you proofread your presentation before you give it. A fresh set of eyes are much more likely to catch mistakes that you gloss over.

, The PowerPoint is only part of your presentation. The other part is you! Take some time and practice your talking points as well as moving through the slides. Work on your timing and ensure that each slide accurately sums up your talking points. Make your own notes or memorize your presentation; reading off of your slides while you are giving your presentation is a big no-no.

Write the conclusion and discussion.,
Write the introduction.,

Cite while you write.,
Edit your research paper.",How to Write a Medical Research Paper," You probably have a general idea of what you want to write about. Narrow that down to a specific focus by reading up on the current research. Find background information about your topic and identify potential sources that you can use. Ask your professor for feedback and suggestions.


Pick something that really interests you to make the research more fun.
Choose a topic that has unanswered questions and propose solutions.;
, The format of your paper depends heavily on what type of paper you want to write. It also affects the type of research you use.


Quantitative studies consist of original research performed by the writer. These research papers will need to include sections like Hypothesis (or Research Question), Previous Findings, Method, Limitations, Results, Discussion, and Application.
Synthesis papers review the research already published and analyze it. They find weaknesses and strengths in the research, apply it to a specific situation, and then indicate a direction for future research.

, Interview individuals who have special knowledge or experience with your issue. Find reliable sources to support your ideas. Your research paper is only as credible as the sources you use. Academic journals, databases, and books are a great source of information.


Keep track of your sources. Write down all publication information necessary for citation: author, title of article, title of book or journal, publisher, edition, date published, volume number, issue number, page number, and anything else pertaining to your source. A program like Endnote can help you keep track of your sources.
Take detailed notes as you read. Paraphrase information in your own words or if you copy directly from the article or book, indicate that these are direct quotes by using quotation marks to prevent plagiarism.
Be sure to keep all of your notes with the correct source.
Your professor and librarians can also help you find good resources.

, Sorting your notes by topic will make it easier to find the information you need while writing the actual paper. Using digitized notes allows you to easily search for specific information and quickly reorganize reference information.


Keep all of your notes in a physical folder or in a digitized form on the computer.
Start to form the basic outline of your paper using the notes you have collected.

, Organize it in a way that makes sense and is easy to follow. Determine what information fits best under each heading or section and integrate your sources as you go. Starting with an outline is also an easy way to get started with the writing.


Start with bullet points and then add in notes you’ve taken from references that support your ideas.A common way to format research papers is to follow the IMRAD format. This dictates the structure of your paper in the following order: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion.The outline is just the basic structure of your paper. Don’t worry if you have to rearrange a few times to get it right.
Ask others to look over your outline and get feedback on the organization.
Know the audience you are writing for and adjust your style accordingly., Look up the guidelines and formatting requirements before you begin. Each journal or grant writing institution has different format requirements as to length and style. The length of your paper will probably be pre-determined, but aim for 10 – 20 pages unless instructed differently.


Use a standard font type and size, such as Times New Roman 12 point font.
Double-space your paper.
If necessary, create a cover page. Most schools require a cover page of some sort. Include your main title, running title (often a shortened version of your main title), author's name, course name, and semester.

, Divide the paper into logical sections determined by the type of paper you are writing. If it is a quantitative study, it needs to include the sections mentioned above (i.e., Hypothesis, Previous Findings, etc.). If it is a qualitative study, organize your paper into main points that make sense and progress naturally.


Break up information into sections and subsections and address one main point per section.
Include any figures or data tables that support your main ideas.
For a quantitative study, state the methods used to obtain results.

, Tell the reader what you have found, why it is relevant to the field, and what future studies could be done to further this research. Avoid repeating information that has been stated elsewhere in the paper.


Clearly state and summarize the main points of your research paper.
Discuss how this research contributes to the field and why it is important.Highlight potential applications of the theory if appropriate.
Propose future directions that build upon the research you have presented., Write the introduction after the bulk of your paper is complete so you know exactly what is necessary to include for the reader to understand your paper. Introduce your reader to the topic of your research paper. Provide basic background information, why you are writing this paper, and what they can expect as a result of reading it.State why the problem is important to address.
Discuss what is currently known and what is lacking in the field.
State the objective of your paper.
Keep the introduction short.

, An abstract summarizes the article by highlighting the main points and allows the reader to know what information your paper contains. Write the abstract last after you have finished the paper so you can properly summarize everything you have written about.Highlight the purpose of the paper and the main conclusions.
State why your conclusions are important.
Be concise in your summary of the paper.
Show that you have a solid study design and a high-quality data set.
Abstracts are usually one paragraph and between 250 – 500 words.

, Citing sources is an absolute must to avoid plagiarism and give others credit for their ideas. Adding citations while you write the paper is much easier than digging through your sources at the end to determine where an idea came from.


Unless otherwise directed, use the American Medical Association (AMA) style guide to properly format citations.
Add citations at end of a sentence to indicate that you are using someone else's idea. Use these throughout your research paper as needed. They include the author's last name, year of publication, and page number.
Compile your reference list and add it to the end of your paper.
Use a citation program if you have access to one to simplify the process.

, You want to make sure that your paper is logically organized and flows well. It’s also important to turn in a final draft free of any spelling and/or grammatical errors.


Continually revise your paper to make sure it is structured in a logical way.
Proofread your paper for spelling and grammatical errors.
Make sure you are following the proper formatting guidelines provided for the paper.
Have others read your paper to proofread and check for clarity. Revise as needed.

For works of fiction or paintings, you will need to ask yourself what evidence the author presents in an attempt to explain his or her thesis.

, Use a dictionary and encyclopedia to briefly look up words and other material that you know little to nothing about.


More in-depth research is not usually necessary. The only exception would be if the entire work is built around an unfamiliar concept, at which point, you should consider reading other articles that describe the concept more clearly in order to provide context to the piece you are analyzing.

, One option is to make an outline of the work, while the second is the write a brief summary. An especially thorough reading of the work will include both.


If writing a summary of the work, it only needs to be one or two paragraphs. Try to phrase the summary in your own words as much as possible.

, The three basic types of appeals are pathos, logos, and ethos.


Pathos is an attempt to appeal to a reader's emotions. Works meant to entertain generally rely on pathos.
Logos is an attempt to use logic and reason to sway a reader's perspective or opinion.
Ethos is an appeal to credibility. An author who explains why he or she should be trusted based on personal, professional, or academic merit is using ethos.

, Determine how effective the author's appeals were from your own perspective as a reader.


Ask yourself if you had an emotional response to an emotional appeal. Did you become happy, upset, or angry at any point? If so, ask yourself why.
Determine if the author's attempts at logic and reason were enough to change your mind. Also ask yourself if the material was clear, accurate, and cohesive.
Ask yourself if you believe the author to be credible. Determine why or why not.

,


For a critical review, you will usually focus on how effective an author's appeals at pathos, logos, or ethos were. You can focus on one area if it appears stronger than the others, or you could look at two or three appeal types as they apply to a particular main idea used in the work.
Alternatively, you can examine the author's overall ability at making his or her point. Your analysis can examine how well the author's research was performed, how cohesive the work is as a whole, how the author's use of structure and organization impacted the work, and other similar matters that stand out to you.
Divide each major point into a separate paragraph. No matter which areas you choose to write about, each major thought should be given its own paragraph. For more complex ideas, you may need to expand your discussion into several paragraphs.

,


If your critique includes more positive elements than negative, begin with the negative before defending the article with the positive.
If your critique includes more negative opinions than positive, identify the positive elements first before defending your opposition with the negative.
If you have both negative and positive remarks to make about the same point or aspect, you can write a mixed paragraph that reflects this. To do so, you will usually end up stating the positive aspect first before explaining why the idea is limited.

, If the author chose to write about a disputable matter, include information about the other side of the issue and explain how the author did or did not succeed in arguing against it.


This is especially significant when specific points or issues from the other side are mentioned directly in the article.
Even if the author did not specifically mention opposing opinions, you can still mention common oppositions in your critical analysis.

, Convince the reader of your essay that he or she should care.


Let the reader know that the topic is relevant by contemporary standards. An article can be considered relevant if the subject has implications for the current day and age, but it can also be relevant if a notable writer or thinker is the author.

, Even though much of this is subjective, you should keep your tone academic instead of personal.


Avoid phrases like ""I think"" or ""in my opinion."" In fact, you should stay away from the first person completely. By identifying something as your own personal opinion, you actually end up weakening them in an academic sense.

, You need to provide enough summary about the work for your critique to have sensible context, but the majority of the essay should still contain your thoughts rather than the author's thoughts.

, Include both bibliographical information and more in-depth information.


Specify the title of the work, the type of work it is, the author's name, and the field or genre the work addresses.
Include information about the context in which the article was written.
Clearly state the author's purpose or thesis.
The overall introduction should only consume roughly 10 percent of your paper's total length.

, Your thesis should be a brief statement that summarizes your overall evaluation of the work being critiqued.


A thesis that is both positive and negative is common for a critical review, but it can also be strictly positive or strictly negative.
Note that your thesis statement is technically part of your introduction.

, Quickly sum up the key points the author of the original article mentioned in his or her defense.


You can provide a limited number of examples, but be brief. Overall, the summary should take up no more than one-third of your essay's body. Less is usually preferred.
You can also briefly describe how the text is organized.

, The critical analysis itself should form the majority of the body and should conform to the guidelines mentioned.


The analysis plus the summary should form roughly 80 percent of the overall essay.
Each separate idea should be addressed in its own paragraph.

, In your concluding paragraph, clearly restate your thesis or overall opinion of the analyzed work.


You should also use this space to briefly present recommendation on how the analyzed work could be improved. Improvements can include ideas, appeals, and research approach.
The conclusion should only take up about 10 percent of the overall paper.

Start with level 1 after your introduction: Your paper always begins with an introduction followed by a level 1 heading for the sub-sections.,
Format your Level 1 heading: The L1 heading must be aligned centrally, bold and should be in title case.,
Use level 2 heading for the next sub-section: Level 2 headings come second in terms of priority after level 1 headings.,
Format your level 2 heading: Level 2 headings are left aligned, bold and must be written in Title Case.

,
Write the heading in level 3 for more complicated data and content: Level 3 headings come after you have written substantial amount of content in the level 1 and 2.,
Format your level 3 heading: While formatting level 3, you must use bold, write it in sentence case and end with a period.,
Create a level 4 heading where you need detailed explanation for your text: Level 4 headings are usually the sub-sections of the text and they are a continuation of level 1 and 2.,
Format your level 4 heading: Level 4 headings have similar formatting as level 3 except that they are in Italics.,
Check all formatting requirements for the four levels: Headings in your APA style paper are not numbered, only formatted as per the levels.",How to Use Four Heading Levels in APA Style," Highlight the most important headings in your level 1. It is the primary topic related sub-section.;
, A paragraph must follow the level 1 heading in your text.

, If your heading is not as important as the level 1 heading, use the second level heading format to make your point. Usually all your chapters must have a level 2 heading as well.

,, The text in level 3 headings must be relevant to your topic but it usually isn’t as important as level 1 or 2 texts.

, Also, the level 3 heading is indented.

, Use level 4 heading where you want to give a detailed explanation in a particular chapter and it needs special attention.

, So your text must be indented, bold, sentence case and should end with a period.

, You must always start with level 1 heading in your paper and continue further as per the requirements.

Plan the report out.,
Do the background research.,
Determine the format required.,
Begin writing.,
Pull the report together.,
Add a watermark.,
Edit the report.,
Send the draft report to the relevant persons.,
Receive the comments, amendments, suggestions, additional input, etc.,
Finalize the report.",How to Write a Draft Report," This can be helped by producing a table of contents from the outset, even though the exactness of this may change as the report is written. It serves as a great guideline to follow as you add the ""flesh to the bones"".


Consider when the introduction, conclusion and executive summary (if writing one) are best left until last. These parts are often improved by relating back to the input already within the body of the report, even though you will often feel inclined to write skeleton summaries for each.;
, This can consist of reading books, articles, websites, journals and such, as well as doing interviews, visiting field sites, observing processes, and the like. Gather all the needed information, turning it into diagrams, photos, pictorial representations, etc., if needed. It may involve the undertaking of experiments, tests or trials, in which case, these need to be properly documented and contextualized for the report.


Research information that has been gathered can be stored on note cards, in a writing book, digitally or in other ways that work for you. The main thing is to ensure that you have easy access to the information, that it's not one messy pile that simply confuses you, and that it is as extensive as required for your report. If there are missing links or unfinished research areas, be sure to make a note of this, so that you don't accidentally overlook it when writing up the report.
Save yourself a ton of time by writing down the author, the day it was published, and who published it, and any other identifiers. Information absent these important details is painful for you, as you'll have to backtrack to confirm the source and that can sometimes be very time consuming.

, At the outset, work out what sort of numbering system is to be used. This will often be determined by your workplace, client's preferences or educational institution. If there is a preferred formatting, do not deviate from this without permission or good reason. Many places use the formatting style either to conform to an expected approach or to represent the standard for each publication for that organization. If you're not sure what it is, find out first; it saves a lot of effort while writing to get it correct from the beginning.


Also find out such basics as indentation requirements, quote style, use of text boxes, placement of images, etc.

, Using the research, your own knowledge and experience and the required purpose of the report, write the contents. If you are to collaborate on the contents, be sure to do so in a way that gives each person inputting plenty of time to prepare their written sections, pieces or chapters. Follow up with them regularly, to ensure that their work will be produced on time.


Talk to others if you have writer's block. If may be just a standard report but writer's block occurs for technical, professional and educational writing just as much as for novelists!
If you're new to report writing, check in with your supervisor, teacher or other mentor regularly, to be sure that you're headed in the right direction. It's painful to have to undo a lot of thorough and thoughtful work just because you didn't understand what was expected.
Use prompts that already exist in your workplace, educational institution or other relevant organization. Existing reports can help you to determine the style, the expected approaches and what sort of content is considered appropriate and adequate.
Reference as you go. That way, you won't have to spend ages working out where the references came from or have to fact check your statements later. Use a program that can help you to format footnotes or endnotes, as required. Once again, conform to the style expected by your workplace or institution.

, Once you've written the main body, the conclusion and introduction are likely the next steps. Follow this with the executive summary, if relevant. Then comes the nitty gritty - the bibliography, the references, the table of contents, the header pages, and such. If you've used a program that does most of these things for you, they still need to be thoroughly checked and rechecked, to ensure that nothing is missing or out of place.


Liaise with the graphic designer for development of any design work required, such as the cover pages, internal images, graphs and charts that you were unable to do yourself, and so forth. This should actually be underway during the report writing stage, as it takes time and you will likely reject some of the designer's drafts and seek amendments until the items look as you wish them to.

, This is useful because it clearly states that the report is in draft form only. Mark each page with ""Draft""., Check for grammar, spelling, sense, consistency, logical flow, accurate summation of issues, placement of images/diagrams/charts, etc. and general pulling together of the report. Make adjustments as needed. Treat this seriously; just because it's a draft, it doesn't mean it should be sloppy. The better the shape that the draft is in, the less likely that major changes will be made to it, making your life a lot easier. If you want the report to be convincing and persuasive for others, this editing stage is vital.

, As part of this, make the note clear as to what is expected of each receiver, such as review, editing, accuracy checks, additional input, clarification, expert assessment, and so forth. Directing the reviewer to the exact requirements of them saves them time and hones their expertise to what is really needed. This also avoids the temptation for them to roam outside of their expertise and start critiquing things you don't think they need to be bothered with.

, Sit down with your team and supervisor and go through all of these things to work out what is needed to pull the report together in its final format. This can take a while, depending on what type of work, study project, or such that you're doing, so try to allot it a decent amount of time, to avoid the last minute rush changes.

, At this point, it's no longer a draft, so remove the watermark. Send it to the printers or print it in-house, make PDFs/eBooks or other digital formats and it's ready for the board, marker, client or public.

State your overall assessment of the work.,
Summarize your key reasons for this assessment.,
Recommend any areas for improvement, if appropriate.,
Provide a list of references.",How to Write a Critique in Five Paragraphs," Be sure you understand exactly what you are being asked to do. The assignment may use the word “critique,” or it might use a phrase such as “critical assessment,” “critical review,” or “critical evaluation.” All of these are critique assignments and will require you to not only summarize but evaluate the work you are discussing.;
, Keep in mind some questions and take notes as you read. These will help guide your formulation of your ideas later. For example:


Does the creator clearly state her/his main point or goal? If not, why do you think that is?
Who do you think is the creator’s intended audience? This can be crucial to determining the success of a work; for example, a movie intended for young children might work well for its intended audience but not for adult viewers.
What reactions do you have when reading or viewing this work? Does it provoke emotional responses? Do you feel confused?
What questions does the work make you think of? Does it suggest other avenues of exploration or observation to you?

, You usually will not need to do a lot of research, but in order to talk about how the work relates to a larger issue or context, you will need to know what it is responding to, what context it was created in, etc.For example, if you're critiquing a research article about a new treatment for the flu, a little research about other flu treatments currently available could be helpful to you when situating the work in context.
As another example, if you're writing about a movie, you might want to briefly discuss the director's other films, or other important movies in this particular genre (indie, action, drama, etc.).
Your school or university library is usually a good place to start when conducting research, as their databases provide verified, expert sources. Google Scholar can also be a good source for research.

, The first paragraph is your introduction to the work, and you should give the basic information about it in this paragraph. This information will include the author’s or creator’s name(s), the title of the work, and the date of its creation.For a work of fiction or a published work of journalism or research, this information is usually available in the publication itself, such as on the copyright page for a novel.
For a film, you may wish to refer to a source such as IMDb to get the information you need. If you're critiquing a famous artwork, an encyclopedia of art would be a good place to find information on the creator, the title, and important dates (date of creation, date of exhibition, etc.).

, The type of context you provide will vary based on what type of work you’re evaluating. You should aim to give the reader some understanding of what issues the creator or author may have been responding to, but you don’t need to provide an exhaustive history. Just give your reader enough information to be able to understand the rest of your critique.For example, if you’re assessing a research article in the sciences, a quick overview of its place in the academic discussion could be useful (e.g., “Professor X’s work on fruit flies is part of a long research tradition on Blah Blah Blah.”)
If you are evaluating a painting, giving some brief information on where it was first displayed, for whom it was painted, etc., would be useful.
If you are assessing a novel, it could be good to talk about what genre or literary tradition the novel is written within (e.g., fantasy, High Modernism, romance). You may also want to include details about the author’s biography that seem particularly relevant to your critique.
For a media item, such as a news article, consider the social and/or political context of the media outlet the item came from (e.g., Fox News, BBC, etc.) and of the issue it is dealing with (e.g., immigration, education, entertainment).

, This element should consider what the thesis or purpose of the work is. Sometimes, this may be clearly stated, such as in a research article. For other texts or creative works, you may have to formulate what you believe to be the creator’s goal or purpose yourself.The authors of research articles will often state very clearly in the abstract and in the introduction to their work what they are investigating, often with sentences that say something like this: ""In this article we provide a new framework for analyzing X and argue that it is superior to previous methods because of reason A and reason B.""
For creative works, you may not have an explicit statement from the author or creator about their purpose, but you can often infer one from the context the work occupies. For example, if you were examining the movie The Shining, you might argue that the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick's goal is to call attention to the poor treatment of Native Americans because of the strong Native American themes present in the movie. You could then present the reasons why you think that in the rest of the essay.

, Describe, briefly, how the main points are made. For example, you might talk about a work's use of characters or symbolism to depict its point about society, or you could talk about the research questions and hypotheses in a journal article.


For example, if you were writing about The Shining, you could summarize the main points this way: ""Stanley Kubrick uses strong symbolism, such as the placement of the movie's hotel on an Indian burial ground, the naming of the hotel ""Overlook,"" and the constant presence of Native American artwork and representation, to call viewers' attention to America's treatment of Native Americans in history.""

, This will serve as your thesis statement, and should make a claim about the work’s general effectiveness and/or usefulness. Is your evaluation going to be principally positive, negative, or mixed?For a research article, you will probably want to focus your thesis on whether the research and discussion supported the authors' claims. You may also wish to critique the research methodology, if there are obvious flaws present.
For creative works, consider what you believe the author or creator's goal was in making the work, and then present your assessment of whether or not they achieved that goal.

, These should form the bulk of your critique and should be a minimum of three paragraphs. You can choose to organize your critique differently depending on how you want to approach your critique. However, you should devote a paragraph to each main topic, using the rest of the steps in this section to develop each paragraph's discussion.If you have three clear points about your work, you can organize each paragraph by point. For example, if you are analyzing a painting, you might critique the painter’s use of color, light, and composition, devoting a paragraph to each topic.
If you have more than three points about your work, you can organize each paragraph thematically. For example, if you are critiquing a movie and want to talk about its treatment of women, its screenwriting, its pacing, its use of color and framing, and its acting, you might think about the broader categories that these points fall into, such as “production” (pacing, color and framing, screenwriting), “social commentary” (treatment of women), and “performance” (acting).
Alternatively, you could organize your critique by “strengths” and “weaknesses.” The aim of a critique is not merely to criticize, but to point out what the creator or author has done well and what s/he has not.

, This is particularly important when evaluating creative works, such as literature, art, and music. Offer your evaluation of how effectively the creator uses the techniques or stylistic choices s/he has made to promote her/his purpose.


For example, if you are critiquing a song, you could consider how the beat or tone of the music supports or detracts from the lyrics.
For a research article or a media item, you may want to consider questions such as how the data was gathered in an experiment, or what method a journalist used to discover information.

, This may be more useful in a critique of a media item or research article. Consider how the author of the work uses other sources, their own evidence, and logic in their arguments.Does the author use primary sources (e.g., historical documents, interviews, etc.)? Secondary sources? Quantitative data? Qualitative data? Are these sources appropriate for the argument?
Has evidence been presented fairly, without distortion or selectivity?
Does the argument proceed logically from the evidence used?

, There are a couple of ways to approach this. Your goal in this section should be an assessment of the overall usefulness of the work.


If the work is a creative work, consider whether it presents its ideas in an original or interesting way. You can also consider whether it engages with key concepts or ideas in popular culture or society.
If the work is a research article, you can consider whether the work enhances your understanding of a particular theory or idea in its discipline. Research articles often include a section on “further research” where they discuss the contributions their research has made and what future contributions they hope to make.

, Back up your assertions with evidence from your text or work that support your claim about each point. For example, if you were critiquing a novel and found the writing dull, you might provide a particularly boring quotation as evidence, and then explain why the writing did not appeal to you.

, This should be a statement about the overall success of the work. Did it accomplish the creator’s goal or purpose? If so, how did it achieve this success? If not, what went wrong?

, While you should have already presented evidence for your claims in the body paragraphs, you should provide a short restatement of your key reasons here. This could be as simple as one sentence that says something like “Because of the researcher’s attention to detail, careful methodology, and clear description of the results, this article provides a useful overview of topic X.”, Your assignment or prompt will usually say if recommendations are appropriate for the critique. This element seems to be more common when critiquing a research article or media item, but it could also apply to critiques of creative works as well., How you present these will depend on your instructor’s preferences and the style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.) that is appropriate to your discipline. However you format this list, you should always include all the sources you used in your critique.

Serve.",How to Make Stuffed Capsicums or Bell Peppers1," For this recipe, you'll need to combine the following ingredients: 1 cup uncooked rice, 1 can pureed tomatoes, 1 tbsp. dried paprika, 1 chopped onion, and 2 tbsp. chopped basil. Stir them together until they're completely combined., Wash the peppers and then carefully slice off the top and remove the seeds from the inside, until the inside is nice and empty. Using a spoon to remove the seeds is ideal, though you can also use your hands. Be careful to keep the rest of the pepper intact.


Though the typical way to stuff the peppers is through the top, if you want to go against the grain, you can also cut them lengthwise and stuff both halves.

, Give your oven a few minutes to fully heat up.

, Fill peppers with the stuffing and if you cut them in the second style, you can add the lids back on. You should be able to stuff each pepper with about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of the stuffing mixture. Use a spoon to do this for best results. When you're done stuffing the peppers, you can place the tops back on.

, You can also just add water instead.

, Bake these peppers for an hour or a little bit longer or less time, depending on when the rice and peppers are tender. Move the peppers around occasionally while you're cooking them with a large spoon so they cook evenly. Baste them with the water or bouillon in the dish so they stay moist and flavourful and so that the filling does not dry out.


1 hour is suitable for thick fleshed peppers. If your capsicum has thinner flesh, then adjust the time to suit as the flesh of the pepper will be too soft.

, Let the peppers cool off for at least 5 minutes before you dig in to them.

, Enjoy these tasty peppers while they're nice and hot. You can serve them with more vegetables, rice, and pasta, or you can enjoy them on their own. Use the remaining broth in the casserole dish as a serving sauce to make the capsicums or peppers even more flavorful.

Serve.",How to Make Stuffed Capsicums or Bell Peppers2," Green or red work for this recipe. After you wash the peppers, cut off the tops and carefully gut the peppers to remove any of the seeds on the inside. You can use a spoon or your hands. Just be careful not to cut into the sides of the pepper since you'll need it to stay strong., Place the following ingredients in a large bowl: 1 ½ cups cooked black beans, 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, ¾ cup salsa, ½ cup corn, 1 cup cooked brown rice, 1 tsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. cumin, and 1/2 lb. ground beef. Stir the ingredients together until you've combined them pretty evenly.

, Just use a spoon to place the stuffing in each pepper. Leave some room at the top for the ingredients to expand a bit. You don't want to over-stuff those peppers or they might explode.

, Put the stuffed peppers in the pot with the tops facing up so that they are just touching each other.

,, This can take a bit less time or a bit longer depending on how long it takes for the peppers to get tender.

, Sprinkle the peppers with 1/2 cup of chopped chives and serve them with sour cream for an extra kick.

",How to Make Stuffed Capsicums or Bell Peppers3," A large capsicum or bell pepper will be able to hold about 1/2 to 1 cup of stuffing, so plan your recipes accordingly. The recipes below are meant for 4-5 bell peppers, so be prepared to make some adjustments.

, Just combine 1 cup of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of sour cream, 1 cup grated cheese, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley, dried chili flakes, dried cumin seeds, and dried paprika to taste (about 1 tsp of each). Then add 1 tablespoon of sugar. This recipe is also highly recommended for sweet paprika peppers.


If you choose the cream cheese filler recipe, it is better to heat the oven to 200°C/400°F and roast them in a lightly oiled pan without water until the peppers flesh is tender - about 20 minutes. Then top with any surplus cheese filling to serve.

, Use a cup of pasta sauce and mix it in with one cup of water. Then, get 2 cups of dried pasta, which can be anything from penne to gnocchi, and combine it with 1/4 cup of grated cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste for this recipe.

, For this one, all you need is 1 cup of herb and pine nut pesto, 2 cups of ricotta cheese, 1 egg, and 1/2 cup of grated cheese. Mix all the ingredients together and add salt and pepper to taste. Your peppers will be all ready to stuff.

, Take about 300 grams of any minced meat and gently brown it in a pan with 1/2 a cup of white onions. You can add this meat to any of the recipes to make them more meat-friendly.

If you are writing a report for work, talk to your boss about his or her expectations for your report. Clarifying what you need to include in your report before you start is an important first step in writing a great report. Ensure you adhere to any and all requirements when writing your report.You will likely want to ask your teacher or boss what the word (or page) requirement of your report is, if you should include tables, figures, or illustrations, and even discuss small specifics, such as what kind of font and size of type your report should be in.
Most reports will include a title page, summary (or abstract), introduction section, methods section (if applicable), results section (if applicable), discussion section, and conclusion.;
, Sometimes you'll be required to write a report on a specific topic, while other times you will be able to choose your own. If it's possible, choose a topic that you have an interest in, particularly if you are working on a long-term project. Or, choose a topic that is relatively unfamiliar to you. This will give you the opportunity to learn about something new.


Before you begin writing a report, you will want to understand the topic and ensure that you know what the purpose of the report is.Many science and engineering courses require reports. Sometimes, you may need to write a book report or other type of report for a humanities class.If you are having trouble choosing a topic, try reading the newspaper, a favorite magazine, or an online news source for some inspiration. You may want to write on a current event (such as a political event, a sporting event, or an economic situation), as there will be a lot of information available for “pop culture” topics.

, Start reading up on your topic. You may want to use books from a university or public library, or do a Google search for online information. To write a great report, you will want to become an expert on the topic on which you will be writing. It is important that you include the most up-to-date information about your topic, so a good amount of research is necessary before writing your report.


At first, conduct a “broad” review of your topic (as opposed to a “deep” review). This means that you will want to briefly read many different sources about your topic instead of spending a lot of time focusing on a small number of articles.
If you are writing on a topic that has more than one side (for example, something that you can argue, such as whether the U.S. should allow the death penalty), you will want to familiarize yourself with both sides of the issue and be able to discuss the pros and cons of both.
You can meet with a reference librarian to assist you with finding the literature that will help you write your report. A reference librarian will help you locate credible sources that you can use for gathering information about your topic. In addition, many reference librarians will also guide you through the process of conducting research and can also help you learn to use online databases.

, While there will probably be many sources that provide information about your topic, you will want to make sure that you find the most credible and reliable sources. A reliable source will list an author, and will often be associated with a reputable institution (such as a university, a credible media outlet, or a government program or department).If you have doubts about a source, discuss it with your teacher, boss, or librarian. Sometimes poorly sourced or badly written articles are published to appear like peer-reviewed scholarly work, and you don’t want to be fooled by one of these articles., Will you be writing this report for a group of experts on the specific topic, or for someone that does not have any prior knowledge about the topic of your report? You should aim to write as much as possible for the audience of your report.If you are writing your report for someone who is unfamiliar with the topic of the report, make sure you introduce the basics (this can include background information, related information, and necessary terminology). Don’t jump into a complex description of your topic without providing context first.

In order to set the context, make sure what you write answers to questions such as “why is this topic important?”, “who is doing work on this topic, what kind of work are they doing, and why are they doing it?”, and “what kind of broader impacts and effects can this topic have?”


If you are writing for experts, feel free to use more complex language and jargon that is specific to the topic at hand. However, if you are writing for novices or people unfamiliar with your topic, you will not want to use confusing language, and if you do include jargon, make sure that you also include a definition.

, This briefly describes the content of your report and answers the question ""What did you do, why did you do it, and what did you learn?"" It should not be longer than a half page.You may find it easier to write the abstract after you've finished the body of the paper. However, the abstract will come before the body in the final report., This section will provide some background information about the topic of your report. If you need to include a literature review, it will go here as well.In the introduction, describe the problem or topic your report investigated. This could be a scientific issue, such as the rate of growth of mealworms, or a current affairs topic, such as increased security in airports.Summarize relevant research, but don't let it take over the introduction. The bulk of your report should be your work, not discussion of others'.
If you performed an experiment and are writing the report about it, describe your experiment in the introduction.

, In scientific writing, this is often presented in a section called ""Methods.""In this section, explain what procedures, materials, etc. you used.


You can order your methods chronologically, starting with what you did first. Alternately, you can group them by type, which may work better for humanities research.Use past tense to describe the actions you took.

, In this section, you present your observations, or the results of your methods.You'll need to describe the experiment or procedure briefly (use less detail than you did in the Methods section) and report the main results.


You can present the results in several different ways. You can organize them from most to least important, from simplest to more complex, or by type.
Don't interpret your results here. You will do that in the next section.

, This is the meat of your report. It's where you analyze your results and tell the reader what they mean.Summarize the most important findings at the beginning of the discussion. You can go into further detail in subsequent paragraphs.Explain the relationship between your results and the previous scholarly literature.
Note what additional research would help fill in gaps in your research or resolve any problems.
Explain the broader relevance of your results. This is called answering the ""So what?"" question. What do your discoveries mean? Why are they useful and important?
In some reports, you may be asked to wrap up with a separate conclusion that reminds the reader of the most important points. For many reports, however, you can conclude your report at the end of the Discussion section., A good way to think about writing a report is to consider it as telling your reader ""this is what I did, and this is what I found"" or “this is what I know about this particular topic.”Don’t write to impress; instead, write to communicate. In doing so, you will impress without even trying.

, Avoid using “slang” terms. For example, instead of saying “the results were great,” say “the results were important and significant.” Avoid overly colloquial (casual and conversational) language.This means that your text should not necessarily read as if you were speaking to a friend, but should instead have a professional feel to it.


Clarify with your teacher (or whoever will read your report) whether it is appropriate to use first person (meaning sentences in which you use the word “I” as a subject). Many times, first person is not appropriate for use in academic or report writing. However, there are times when the use of first person is effective and persuasive.Instead of guessing whether it is appropriate to use first person, you should confer with your teacher.

, Sentences should not be overly complex or run-on. Try to use fairly short sentences with a clear sentence structure. If possible, avoid excessive use of commas, semi-colons, and colons. Use of short, explicit sentences is an important feature of a great report.Make direct and active statements. Your sentence structure should look something like this: “I investigated this topic, found these data, and determined this result.” Try to avoid using passive voice, if possible, because it makes your report more confusing to the reader.

,


You may want to make your heading distinct to separate it from the rest of your text by putting it in bold font, italic font, or a larger font size. If you are following a specific style guide, such as APA, make sure to follow their guidelines for headings.

, Using a wide range of sources will broaden your knowledge of your particular topic, provide you with more information to include in your report, and reduce the chance that you accidentally plagiarize.


Use books and textbooks, newspapers, academic and trade journals, and government report and legal documents for reputable sources.Many of these can be available both in print and online.
If you are having trouble finding information about the topic of your report, ask your librarian! He or she is trained to help with these sorts of assignments.
You will likely want to avoid source material that is based on opinion.In other words, look for source material that is derived from facts, and, if applicable, includes the data to back up any assertions.

, Writing a report takes time. Writing a great report takes even more time. Give yourself adequate time to prepare, compose, and revise your report. This means you will likely want to start several weeks before the report is due, depending on the speed at which you work and the length and other requirements of the report.


Set aside a period of time to simply research your topic without writing. Give yourself time to become an expert on your topic by familiarizing yourself with as much material written about it as possible. When you are ready to proceed to the writing stage, you will have a solid foundation of knowledge that you can then convey in your report.

, Your first draft of your report should be just that: a first draft. You should expect to revise and rewrite your report several times before submitting it to your teacher for a grade or to your boss for evaluation. Leaving enough time to make the appropriate and necessary edits and changes is important if you want to write a particularly great report.

, You should do a thorough review of your report for both spelling and grammar. Remember that your computer’s spell check will not catch every error. For example, you may mix up the use of the word “there” with “their.” This will not be caught by a spell-checker, so do not depend on this function alone. Paying attention to the small details of your report (such as spelling and grammar) will improve the overall quality of your report.

, Make sure that you have complied with any specific requirements in your assignment or project description. You may need a title page, a certain type or size of font, or margins of a particular size., Revision should be more than just proofreading; instead, revision should be a critical examination of your work. Ultimately, you will want to look for errors that detract from the overall quality of your report, and this may mean deleting or rewriting large portions of your report.


Ask yourself: Does my report fulfill its goal? If not, you may need to consider significant revisions.

, If possible, have a trusted friend, peer, or colleague read your report. In addition to proofreading for spelling and/or grammar errors, he or she may be able to provide critical and productive feedback. This can help your report go from good to great.

Take a break.",How to Write a Paper for College Literature Classes," The text in question is the starting point for any literary analysis. You will want to read the text at least once and take careful notes to prepare for writing your essay. As you read:Think about what most interests you: imagery, characters, plot, pacing, tone, etc. Note examples.
Consider the context. Is this text influenced by other texts, such as the Bible or Shakespeare or even contemporary pop music? Does it use a style or form popular in a particular era, like the epistolary novel of the 18th century?
Reflect on what you know about the author. How might his or her biography influence the text?
Focus on why certain elements are in the story and how they work. How do characters contribute to the story or theme? Why does the author choose particular a particular setting, image, or tone?Decide what argument you think the text is making or what theme it is exploring. What do you think the main idea is that the author wanted you to understand once you finished reading?;
, A topic is the subject you will focus on. The earlier you choose a topic, the earlier you can begin collecting evidence to support it. Ideally, you'll have an idea of what you want to write about before you finish reading the text. There are two types of essay, each with their own type of topic:Expository essays give information to the reader.

Your topic may be a single literary element of the work, such as character, plot, structure, theme, symbols, style, imagery, tone, etc.Another common topic is how a work illustrates or breaks the forms of a particular genre or school of thought.You may also draw parallels between the work and real-life subject matter such as historical events or the author's life.Argumentative essays take a position on a debatable topic in order to change the reader's mind. Your topic will typically be your thesis.

Your topic can't be factual: i.e. The nobles in Shakespeare's Hamlet talk in iambic pentameter.
And the argument can't be too easy to win: i.e. Nobles speak in formal iambic pentameter in Hamlet to emphasize their class.
It needs to be something people might reasonably disagree about: i.e. In Hamlet, Shakespeare writes noble speech in iambic pentameter not to emphasize their elite status, but rather to underscore how constrained noble characters actually are vis-à-vis the freer commoners.



, A good topic needs to be narrow enough that you can completely address it within the page limit. The key is to start broad and then narrow your focus.Eventually, you'll want to develop an argument regarding the topic. That argument will be your thesis. For example:


Broad topic – The use of humor in Hamlet.
Add words that make it more specific – Hamlet's use of humor in Hamlet.
Turn it into an even more specific sentence – Hamlet's use of humor belies his madness.

, The next step is to transform your topic into an argument – i.e. Hamlet's sense of humor is key to convincing the reader he is in fact sane. While your thesis will likely be revised as you write, it is still important to produce a preliminary thesis regarding the text, what it is trying to achieve, and the techniques the author uses to do so. A thesis will help you organize your ideas.


Be specific. For example: ""The technique of allowing the reader the freedom to flesh out sparsely described images reinforces the theme of freedom versus destiny explored in the The Night Circus."" This works better than something vague like: ""The author uses rich visual imagery to great effect in The Night Circus.""

, Now that you have chosen a topic and preliminary thesis, you can focus your research. Reread the work or selected sections, looking for quotes that you can use to develop your argument. You will probably want to search for evidence in conjunction with the next step: outlining your essay.

, It is always a good idea to write an outline. At a minimum, you'll want to include your thesis statement and a description of what each succeeding paragraph is about. For example:


Thesis: The technique of allowing the reader the freedom to flesh out sparsely described images reinforces the theme of freedom versus destiny explored in the The Night Circus.
Paragraph 1: Summary – The Night Circus is a novel about a young man and woman competing in a magical contest they do not fully understand, with a fantastical circus as the setting for their wonders.
Paragraph 2: While the novel is visually compelling, the descriptions are in fact surprisingly sparse, as in this description of the fantastic clock that sits at the entrance to the circus.
Paragraph 3: Her description of the magical snow garden is also surprisingly simple.
Paragraph 4: The simplicity gives the reader the freedom to fill out the descriptions using the guidelines offered by the text, just as the main characters flesh out the circus within the boundaries of the game's rules.
Paragraph 5: The simple yet beautiful descriptions thus reinforce the underlying theme of freedom versus destiny in the book.

, If you write an outline early in the research process, you can use it to help focus on the specific areas you need to explore in more detail. This will save you time, by sparing you research into areas that won't figure in your paper.

, An outline can also provide ""container"" in which to put information. Once you have an outline, you can start placing evidence and analysis into it as you come up with them to produce a more detailed outline that incorporates quotes and evidence for each paragraph, as in this sample outline.

, Include the title and author of the main works you deal with, as well as your thesis. The goal is to clearly define the issues your essay will deal with.


Don't write something vague like ""This story deals with the problems of human civilization.""
Be specific: ""By the end of the story, Rainsford becomes another Zargoff, another civilized murderer. He has adopted his adversary's brutal attitudes so easily that we are led to question civilization's claim to control human aggression."", If the text is one that the entire class has read, you will not need to summarize it. However, if it is one that your reader might not be familiar with, you will need to give a brief (one paragraph) summary.Be careful that you do not spend too much time on summary, however. If you have more summary than analysis, your paper won't show your ideas about the text.

, If you are discussing a particular aspect of the work – characters, plot, style, etc. – you will want to begin with a representative example of the literary device you will analyze., Each paragraph will provide evidence to support the claim made in your thesis, as well as analysis of that evidence. You will also want to anticipate counter-arguments. A good essay will include:Evidence – Examples from the text under discussion that support your thesis.
Warrant – An explanation of how the evidence supports your thesis.
Backing – Additional reasoning that may be necessary to support the warrant.
Counterclaims – Anticipate arguments that disagree with your thesis.
Rebuttal – Evidence and argumentation put forward by you that negates the counterclaim you introduced.

, Start by considering what you want your readers to take away from your paper. However, a good conclusion will not simply restate the thesis. It will go on to discuss why it is important, to speculate on its broader implications (i.e. is it true for a genre or period as a whole?) or to provide suggestions on how it might be pursued further., Don't worry about style, spelling, or length. Your first draft should focus on the argument you are making and on marshalling evidence to support that argument. It is very difficult to perfect your prose, grammar, essay structure, and argument all at the same time. You can actually save time by writing multiple drafts that focus on these elements one at a time., Once you have your main ideas and supporting evidence down on paper, it's time to move them around to create an essay that flows logically from one point to the next.


Try using a reverse outline to understand the structure of your essay. In the left hand margin, write out the topic of each paragraph in as few words as possible. In the right margin, write how each paragraph advances the overall argument. This will help you see how each paragraph fits into your paper, and which ones might be shifted for better effect.Once your paragraph is in the right order, focus on smoothing out transitions between paragraphs. If your paragraph flows well, you shouldn't need transition words (see https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/Transitions.html for a list of such words). The end of one paragraph should logically lead to the start of the next.

, Once you have a paper that you feel makes a clear argument, develops that argument with ample supporting evidence, and which is well organized, it's time to get someone else's opinion. Many universities have writing centers that will provide feedback on drafts. At the very least, let a fellow student take a look. They will be able to point out areas that are confusing or statements that are poorly supported. Use their feedback to write a third draft.

, Now that you have a clear, well-organized paper, it's time to edit it line by line to make sure your prose is concise and it contains no errors of spelling or grammar. It is easier to find errors on the printed page, so be sure to work form a hard copy. It can also help to change the font, as this tricks your brain into viewing the paper as a new document.You can find a list of common errors at http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/proofing_grammar.shtml.

, Watch out for wordy verbs (i.e. ""has knowledge of"" instead of ""knows""), adverbs, unnecessary prepositional phrases, and overly inflated language (i.e. ""utilize"" instead of ""use""). For a list of common unnecessary words, see http://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/Clear,_Concise,_and_Direct_Sentences.pdf.

, When drafting, writers commonly say the same thing two sentences in a row in slightly different ways as they work through ideas. Delete or combine the sentences to avoid this, as in the example below:


Original text: ""Rachel Watson, the protagonist of Paula Hawkin's Girl on a Train, is a classic unreliable narrator. In particular, her inability to remember events in her own life due to alcohol-induced blackouts leaves the reader unable to rely on her version of events.""
Rewrite as: ""Rachel Watson, the protagonist of Paula Hawkin's Girl on a Train, suffers from alcohol-induced blackouts that leave her unsure what has happened in her own life, making her a classic unreliable narrator.""

, How you came to your conclusions does not matter. Present your ideas stripped of ""I"". It's already clear that the work reflects your beliefs because you put your name on it.Don't write: ""I initially thought Hamlet was only feigning madness, but then after a second reading, came to believe that he actually is mad.""
Instead, you might write: ""Many critics take for granted that Hamlet is only feigning madness, but their analysis relies on a more modern understanding of insanity. If we take the worldview of Shakespeare's audience into account, it seems more likely that Hamlet was in fact mad.""
Or, more simply: ""A close reading that takes into account the worldview of the time reveals that Hamlet is indeed mad.""

, This technique is especially effective for catching run on sentences and other grammatical errors, like the excessive use of commas., Reading one sentence at a time, starting at the end, interrupts the flow of your essay and helps you to see what the sentences actually say, rather than what you meant to say.

, Always run spell check as a last step. Be careful to pay close attention to names and jargon, as spell check may suggest you substitute different words for already correct spellings.

, Writing does not progress at a linear pace. Sometimes you can write a dozen pages in an hour. Other times, you might struggle to grind out a page. In both cases you are doing productive work. However, if you start your paper too late, a period of slow writing can induce panic that leads to writer's block. To avoid this, start early and schedule plenty of time to write.


Work in 2 to 6 hour sessions spread over multiple days. It is hard to stay productive past 6 hours.
Start at least a week before your paper is due.

, A page goal – particularly a large one like 15 or 20 pages – can be intimidating. Don't worry about pages. It is time that matters. Focus on putting in time, not the number of pages you write in a given session.

, Sometimes when your stuck, it helps to change the format in which you are writing. Writing on a computer, in particular, can slow you down due to the easy ability to repeatedly edit each sentence. Pen and paper can help you move through a draft more quickly.

, If you're having a hard time getting started with a part of your paper – thesis, outline, or draft – start a new document and write whatever comes to mind. It might be an analysis of a particular passage, a summary of the story, or just a list of ideas. It doesn't matter. The important thing is to get writing again.

, The challenge of writing well-constructed sentences while also formulating a clear argument and organizing evidence can sometimes be too much. If you're stuck drafting your essay, try writing in detailed outline form: plug in evidence and you analysis of it, and don't worry about the language or even writing complete sentences. This can be a great way to speed through a first draft. You can then focus on fleshing out your sentences in draft 2.

, If none of these strategies work, it often helps just to step away. Take a walk and give your mind time to sort things out. Sit down and focus on your breathing. Take a nap and let your subconscious have a crack at it."

Whisk the vegetable stock into the mixture.,
Taste and season the gravy.",How to Make Vegetarian Mushroom Gravy1," Heat ½ cup (120 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add ½ of a small onion that's finely chopped and 1 cup (4 ounces or 75 g) of finely chopped baby portobello mushrooms. Saute the onion and mushrooms for 8 to 10 minutes. The onion will soften and the mushrooms will release their liquid.Baby portobello mushrooms are also called cremini mushrooms or baby bella mushrooms.;
, You'll be making a roux with the oil in the onion and mushrooms. Just add ½ cup (60 g) of all-purpose flour to the onion and mushrooms. Stir the mixture until the flour is completely absorbed by the onion and mushrooms. Let this mixture cook for 3 to 5 minutes.The roux will turn golden brown as it cooks. It's important to cook the mixture for the full 3 to 5 minutes or the gravy may taste floury.

, Get out 4 to 5 cups (950 ml to 1.18 liters) of vegetable stock. Slowly pour the vegetable stock in a thin stream while you continuously mix the gravy. Keep whisking and cooking the gravy for 2 to 3 minutes. The gravy will thicken as it cooks.If your gravy is lumpy, just use an immersion blender to blend up any lumps. Keep in mind that this may also puree the mushrooms for an even smoother sauce.

, Once the gravy has thickened to your liking, taste the vegetarian mushroom gravy. Stir in 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, ½ teaspoon of kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasonings. Serve the gravy immediately or keep it warm until you're ready to serve it.If you want a thinner gravy, consider pushing it through a fine mesh strainer. Discard any solids and serve the thinned gravy.

",How to Make Vegetarian Cannelloni," While the pan is heating, crush eight cloves of garlic and add them to the oil. Stir the crushed garlic in the oil for one minute or until it starts to soften.


If you are short on time, you can choose to use store-bought tomato sauce instead. Store-bought garlic and basil tomato sauces work particularly well for this recipe.;
, These ingredients will make up the majority of your sauce. Turn the heat down to a simmer and let the sauce cook for approximately 20 minutes. Make sure that you stir the sauce occasionally so that it doesn’t burn on the bottom., Once the sauce is done simmering, you can add the basil, give it a good stir, and then set the sauce aside. Either keep it in the pan or put in a container if you plan on making your cannelloni later in the day.


You can also separate the sauce into two different baking dishes if you prefer to have the sauce under the cannelloni. Or, pour half the sauce into the baking dish and save the other half of the sauce to pour over the cannelloni.

, This is an optional step but highly recommended. Scoop 250 grams of mascarpone (approximately two tubs) into a medium sized bowl. Add three tablespoons of milk to the mascarpone and beat the ingredients together. Add any desired seasoning and then set this topping aside.

, While the oven is heating, fill a large with water. Add a dash of salt and bring the pot to a boil. You don’t want to cook the cannelloni the whole way through--the goal is actually just to soften them up a little bit. Place the cannelloni into the water once it is boiling. Cook them for several minutes. They should should begin to get a little softer while still retaining their shape.You can also use square pasta pieces, rather than traditional cannelloni. Lightly heat them as well.

, Once rinsed, do not pat it dry. Instead, transfer it to a frying pan and bring it to medium-high heat. Stir the spinach until it becomes wilted--this should take about one minute. Once wilted, place the spinach in a colander and use the back of a spoon to press out any remaining moisture.If you are pressed for time, you can also use a package of frozen chopped spinach. Simply stick it in the microwave and then place it in a colander and use the back of a spoon to press any excess liquid out.

, Chop it finely using a large chopping knife. The spinach will make up part of the filling, so the finer you chop it, the smoother your filling will be.

, Add the spinach to the ricotta. Use a large wooden spoon to mix the ingredients so that they become smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste. Once the filling is seasoned to your taste, add one egg and stir it into the mixture. If you aren’t planning on using the filling right away, cover it with tin foil or plastic wrap and stick it in the fridge.There are many variations on what you can add to the filling of the cannelloni. You may also wish to consider adding some pine nuts, a touch of nutmeg, or roasted vegetables.

, This will be your filling device. If you happen to have a piping bag lying around, you can use that instead. Scoop the ricotta filling into the plastic bag. Carefully squeeze the bag so that the ricotta mixture fills up the cannelloni.


If you chose to use the pasta squares, lay them out flat. Use a spoon to scoop ricotta filling onto the squares in a neat line down the middle. Roll the pasta sheet up and around the filling.

, They should not be lying on top of each other, but rather perfectly side by side (so you can fit as many into the dish as possible without the pasta sticking together)., If you chose to make the mascarpone sauce, spoon it onto the cannelloni. Pour the rest of the sauce onto the cannelloni and sprinkle parmesan on top of the sauce.


If desired, you can pour half of the remaining sauce onto the cannelloni and keep the rest in a bowl. When the cannelloni is done cooking, heat up the remaining sauce and let your dinner guests spoon as much sauce as they would like onto their cannelloni.

, Place the dish in the oven and bake it for 20 minutes. Once the 20 minutes have passed, remove the aluminium foil and continue to bake the cannelloni for another 20 minutes or until the top becomes golden.

, Let it stand for five minutes before serving it up. Enjoy!

Make TVP chili.,
Make TVP lasagna.",How to Prepare Textured Vegetable Protein," TVP looks like dried cereal and may be purchased in plastic bags or resealable containers. It has a long shelf life and can be found in your grocery store's health food section or with other bulk foods.


Textured vegetable protein in a non-sealed sack has a shelf life of about a year, but textured vegetable protein in an airtight container will last much longer.
Because textured vegetable protein is made from soybeans, the cost of the product is relatively inexpensive.
You can purchase flavored TVP, either dry or frozen, which can be heated and added to a number of dishes. However, since TVP is so easy to cook with and flavor yourself, it's best to start with dried TVP free of additives and flavors. That way, you can add whatever spices and flavors you want, without the extra chemicals.;
, Ground beef cooks down and shrinks when you apply heat, but since TVP gains volume when you reconstitute it, it will stretch a lot further. To make a meal that will feed 2 - 4 people, you'll need about 2 cups of dry TVP.

, The ratio of water to TVP should be 1:1. To reconstitute the TVP, you simply add hot water and let it sit for 5 - 10 minutes. The TVP will begin to fluff and take on the texture of ground beef.


If you'd prefer, you can simply add the TVP to a pot of soup or a sauce that contains plenty of liquid. The TVP will reconstitute as part of the dish - there's no need to do it separately.
If you're working with larger pieces of TVP, such as TVP cutlets, you might want to squeeze the reconstituted pieces so they aren't full of excess water., Now that you have a bowl of reconstituted TVP, use it as a canvas to add your favorite spices, just the way you would any other protein. You can season it with a simple mixture of salt and pepper, give it Italian flair with some oregano and sage, or make it spicy with cayenne.

, You can make TVP tacos or enchiladas, TVP chili, TVP burgers - the sky's the limit. Once the TVP has been reconstituted, simply use it as a filling the same way you'd do with ground beef.


You can brown the TVP if you want to maximize the flavor.
Try reconstituting it with stock or broth instead of plain water.

, TVP lasts a long time on the shelf when it's still dry, but once you reconstitute it, the mixture won't keep for long.

, If you have a craving for a hearty burger, TVP serves as a great substitute for ground beef or bison. Serve it with a side of chips or fries for a classic, meat-free meal.


Reconstitute 2 cups of TVP in vegetable broth.
Mix in salt and pepper to taste.
Add soy sauce and ketchup to taste.
Mix in one egg (to bind the TVP).
Mix in 1/4 cup flour.
Form the mixture into patties. Bake them in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 - 15 minutes, until they're brown and crispy.

, TVP is a great option for a spicy nacho topping. The same recipe can be used to make a filling for tacos, burritos and enchiladas.


Reconstitute 2 cups of TVP in vegetable broth.
Mix in a package of taco seasoning
Sprinkle on top of tortilla chips along with melted cheese, chopped olives, green onions, and other favorite toppings.

, TVP is a great ingredient to use in chilis and soups - you don't even have to reconstitute it first. Simply make your favorite chili recipe without the meat, and add dried TVP once the liquid has come to a simmer, toward the end of the cooking process. In 10 minutes, the TVP will be reconstituted and your meal will be ready to enjoy.

, Prepare lasagna according to your favorite recipe. In place of the meat, spread a layer of reconstituted TVP mixed with salt, pepper and an Italian spice mix in between the pasta layers. Bake according to your recipe's instructions.

While people who class themselves as vegetarians or vegans do not consume meat, some are not strict about avoiding all animal products, some zealous in their avoidance of anything derived from animals and many falling in a middle ground of being conscious about avoiding meat and animal products as much as they feel is reasonable to avoid any cruelty of animals.
Remember Vegans do not usually consume any animal by-product, including products tested on animals or created by animals (such as honey).
There are vegetarians whom consume eggs, but not any dairy, and others who will not consume eggs, but will eat dairy products such a recent free cheese..;
, A barbeque gathering can be formal or informal. Provide your guest with a starter, main course, sides and dessert if you wish, or just provide a variety of grilled items and sides at the same time. Don't forget about drinks, providing cutlery, plates, napkins etc., There are many commercially available vegan and vegetarian foods suitable for cooking on a grill. These include, Tofu hotdogs and Tofu hamburgers or tofu turkey burgers.


Consider these types of products if you want to serve food similar in style to meat. Keep in mind, not everyone like these types of products.
Prepare grilled vegetables. Sliced aubergine, sliced courgettes, quartered red onions, capsicum peppers, yellow squash and Portobello mushrooms are all delicious grilled. You can also make vegetable kebabs. Try making chick pea burgers and consider serving grilled corn.

, Vegetables can be seasoned with herbs and spices too.

Extra-wide egg noodles will cook in about 10 to 12 minutes., Pour the pasta through a strainer or colander. Save about ½ cup (120 milliliters) of the cooking water. If the sauce ends up being too thick, you can stir this water into it. The extra salt will help make the sauce more flavorful.


You might not end up using the water at all, but it still would be a good idea to reserve some.

, Pour the pasta into the sauce. Stir everything together with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Keep stirring until the pasta is evenly coated.

, Turn the burner back on and set it to low heat. Let the stroganoff cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring it occasionally. This will help blend the flavors further.If the sauce turns too thick, add some of your reserved pasta water to thin it out. You may not need to use all of it. The more water you add, the thinner the sauce will be.

, Place the stroganoff into a large platter or divide it up into four serving bowls. For extra flavor, garnish it with a sprinkle of parsley. If you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge, and eat them within 2 to 3 days.

, In a small bowl, add the soy sauce, liquid smoke, maple syrup, and paprika. Use a fork or wire whisk to beat the ingredients together. When you're done, you should be left with an even consistency., Place your coconut flakes in a separate bowl. Drizzle the flavoring over them. Toss the bowl gently so the coconut flakes get evenly coated with the flavoring.Choose a bowl that's large enough to leave a lot of headspace at the top after adding your flakes. This way, coconut flakes will not fall out while tossing your flakes.

, Make sure to spread the flakes in an even layer. You do not want any of the flakes on top of one another, as this will prevent them from cooking. Once you have an even layer of flakes, your coconut flakes are ready to bake.Make sure to wash your hands before handling the flakes.

, Remember the oven should be set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (or 177 degrees Celsius). If you prefer softer bacon, bake the flakes for 12 minutes. If you want crispier bacon, bake them for 14 minutes., Halfway through the baking process, you should flip the flakes. Watch them closely as they bake for an additional 12 to 14 minutes. When done, they should be just brown and crisp on the edges. Coconut can go from brown to burnt quickly, so be vigilant about checking., After the flakes are golden brown, remove them from the oven. Set them aside to cool for a few minutes. You can use them immediately or store them in your fridge.You can also place them in an airtight container and store them in the fridge for several months.

, Vegan bread is fairly easy to find at the supermarket, and the other main ingredients of a BLT, lettuce and tomato, are vegetables.

Decide if the eggs are used for moisture or richness.,
Decide if the eggs are used to help the food rise.,
Decide if the eggs are used to bind.,
Decide if the eggs are used to emulsify the ingredients.,
Decide if the eggs are used for taste or color.,
Notice if the recipe calls for three or more eggs per batch (one cake, one loaf of bread, etc.).",How to Replace Eggs in Your Cooking1," Read through the recipe and notice if it calls for many liquids. If there is very little liquid (in the form of milk, water, oil, etc), then the egg is probably being used to keep the finished product from drying out.Egg whites actually dry out baked goods and do not provide any moisture. If your recipe calls for all egg whites, then it is unlikely they are being used for this purpose.Cookies, muffins, flat foods like pancakes, and brownies are examples.;
, Also known as leavening agents, look for ingredients like baking powder, baking soda, or baker's yeast in the recipe. If you don't see any of these ingredients but the recipe calls for an acidic ingredient like buttermilk, vinegar, or citrus juice, then the eggs are likely necessary to help the dish rise.Egg yolks don't assist in leavening (they contain too much fat), so if the recipe calls for yolks only, then the eggs are serving some other purpose.Keep your end product in mind. If you are making a custard, which doesn't rise, it's unlikely the egg is being used to leaven. If you are baking a cake, which rises considerably as it bakes, then egg may be present as a leavening agent.Cake and cupcakes are examples of baked goods that uses eggs add rise, volume, and fluffiness.

, Eggs are often used to hold a product together and prevent crumbling. Dishes like meatloaves, casseroles, quick breads (like pound cake or zucchini bread), and cornbread all use eggs to provide structure. As the eggs are heated during baking, they change from a liquid mixture to a solid and hold the other ingredients together.Cookies, muffins, and savory dishes like burgers, vegetable loaves, meatloaves, and quick breads are examples.
Often recipes that use eggs to bind also use eggs to add moisture to the dish, especially if they call for breadcrumbs or flour. You may want to add a little more liquid or use a moist egg replacement (such as fruit puree) to keep your dish from drying out., Emulsifying is another way of binding ingredients, but it is specifically used to blend things that would not normally mix, like oil and vinegar.Egg yolks will thicken a product and add stability by allowing fats to become soluble in water and water to be soluble in fats.This makes baked goods creamy, smooth, and moist.


If the recipe calls only for egg whites, then the egg is not being used to emulsify any ingredients, as the white lacks enough fat to do so.Notice if the recipe calls for water-based liquids and a large amount of oil or butter (such as mayonnaise or hollandaise sauce).If so, the egg is likely being used as an emulsifier.

, If the eggs are part of a wash, or to glaze baked goods like pies and pastries, you can easily remove them from the recipe. If the eggs are clearly part of the taste of the recipe (like scrambled eggs), you may be able to replace them if the finished product isn't a baked good.Quiches, custards, pudding, chocolate pies, egg salads, and scrambled eggs are examples.

, When eggs make up the basis of a dish, such as Angel Food cake or sponge cake, it is unlikely an egg substitute will give you the results you want. The taste and texture will be compromised and the recipe will likely fail. Look for a recipe for something with a similar taste and doesn't call for quite so many eggs."

Replace one egg with 1/4 cup of banana puree.,
Use applesauce to add moisture, density, and sweetness.,
Use 1/3 cup pumpkin to replace one egg in muffins and breads.,
Replace one egg with 1/4 cup vegan sour cream.Sour cream will depth and richness to your dish while keeping it moist.",How to Replace Eggs in Your Cooking2," Banana is one of the most popular choices for egg replacements in sweet recipes like muffins, breads, and cake. Use 1/2 banana to yield 1/4 cup puree.The banana will alter the taste of your baked goods, so make sure you like banana-flavored muffins, breads, etc. before you add it to your recipe. Otherwise, look for something with a milder taste.

, Applesauce or other fruit purees will make whatever you were cooking or baking heavy and dense, so if you want something lighter, you will have to add baking powder as well.Applesauce works great with recipes like brownies are chocolate cake, because the chocolate hides the flavor of the applesauce. It won't alter the taste of your brownies like banana or another fruit might.Use 1/3 cup puree to replace one egg or 1/4 cup puree with 1 Tsp baking powder for a lighter, fluffier product., Pumpkin can also leave a distinct flavor in baked goods, so it's best to incorporate it in a recipe that works well with pumpkin. Bread, muffins, and spice cakes will all benefit from the moisture, binding properties, and taste of pumpkin.Make sure the pumpkin is pureed so that it is smooth and won't make lumps in your baked goods.

, Sour cream also makes an excellent binding agent.

Substitute egg whites with Agar powder.,
Use 1 can of soda to replace eggs and oil in boxed cake mixes.",How to Replace Eggs in Your Cooking3," Baking soda and baking powder are different chemically, but work in much the same way (baking powder actually contains baking soda). Baking soda will react with acids in your recipe (like vinegar, buttermilk, cream of tartar) and release carbon dioxide, causing your baked goods to rise. Baking powder actually leavens twice--once when it becomes wet and a second time when it is heated.Substitute one egg with 1 Tbsp. vinegar plus 1 Tsp. baking soda, whisked together.Substitute one egg with 2 Tbsp. water plus 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil plus 1 Tsp. baking powder, whisked together.Baking soda will give your baked goods a warm, golden brown color. Baking powder will give you a lighter, fluffier product., Agar powder is also known as agar-agar, Kanten, Japanese isinglass, or Ceylon moss.Mix 1 Tbsp agar powder in 1 Tbsp water. This is equivalent to one egg white, so increase as necessary for the recipe.Whip the mixture, then let it chill in the fridge. Then whip it again and it will be ready to use.

Use gelatin or Agar to bind sweet recipes like cookies and muffins.These will not alter the flavor in things like cakes and cookies.,
Use fruits like banana, applesauce, pumpkin or prunes to bind sweet recipes.",How to Replace Eggs in Your Cooking4," The seeds should be ground in a coffee or spice grinder, as finely as possible. Flax seeds have a slightly nutty flavor and may affect the taste of your recipe, so use it in recipes that would benefit from this flavor or have other, stronger flavors that will cover the taste of the flax.Chia seeds are darker and will deepen the color of your bake goods.Mix 1 Tbsp. ground flax seed and 3 Tbsp. water to replace one egg. Allow the mixture to sit for 30 minutes, until it thickens and has a jelly-like consistency.Mix 1 Tbsp. ground chia seed and 3 Tbsp. water to replace one egg.

If there is a lot of liquid in the recipe already, you can omit the water and just mix in the cornstarch.The cornstarch will act as a binder and thicken your food as well.

, You will probably need to experiment with quantities to find the right balance and really nail your recipe.


Add 2-3 Tbsp. mashed potatoes to replace one egg. Instant potato flakes or sweet potato can also be used.Add 2-3 Tbsp. rice to replace one egg. You can also try adding cooked rice to soups and pureeing them for thickness.Use 2-3 Tbsp finely crushed breadcrumbs to replace 1 egg.
Use 2-3 Tbsp cooked oatmeal or quick-cooking rolled oats to replace 1 egg in a recipe. This is a great for savory recipes and sweet baked goods like cookies, too.

Use tofu to replace eggs when they make up the majority of the dish, like a breakfast scramble, quiche or custard.,
Use turmeric to color your egg-free dish.",How to Replace Eggs in Your Cooking6," Look for egg replacers, not substitutes, as these can sometimes still contain egg. Make sure you check the label, just to be sure. They can replace eggs in baking cookies in muffins or in dishes like scrambles.Follow the directions on the box for each product. Generally, you mix the egg replacer with water and add it to your recipe.Vegan egg yolks must be mixed with a blender--hand mixing is not vigorous enough to get the desired consistency., Puree the tofu to make sure there are no lumps or chunks in your dish, and make sure you use silken or soft tofu--firm tofu won't blend very well.Make sure the tofu is plain and neither baked nor seasoned.Use 1/4 cup tofu per egg.Tofu will not fluff like eggs, but the texture is otherwise very similar to eggs.

Use tablespoons to convert recipes.",How to Use Aquafaba1," Even if you’re an omnivore, drain the aquafaba into an airtight container whenever you open a can of chickpeas. Sure, you may not have the incentive that vegans and people with lactose issues might have to use it for dairy-free cheddar or mayo, but you can easily use it as an egg substitute for an recipe that calls for them. Waste not, want not.Keep the aquafaba refrigerated and use within one week.;
, In general, the consistency of aquafaba is very similar to eggs. However, be aware that its consistency can vary slightly from can to can. Favor thicker aquafaba over thinner liquid when substituting it for eggs. If the liquid from your can appears watery, simply heat it in a small pot on the stovetop until it reduces by roughly a quarter before cooking., First, review the original recipe. See if it calls for one whole egg, the white of one egg, or the yolk of one egg. Then use the following conversions:


1 whole egg = 3 tablespoons aquafaba
1 egg white = 2 tablespoons aquafaba
1 yolk = 1 tablespoon aquafaba

Add air with long pours.,
Strain, top, and serve.",How to Use Aquafaba2," Add the simple syrup, lemon juice, bourbon, and aquafaba to a cocktail shaker. Leave the ice out for right now, since this inhibits foaming. Cap and shake it vigorously for about 10 to 12 seconds. Be sure to keep the shaker vertical to prevent leaks, since ice is what usually keeps a slanted shaker from leaking, thanks to the vacuum that the cold creates.Simple syrup is simply equal parts sugar and water.

, Uncap your shaker. Add a cube or two of ice. Cover the shaker again and shake for another 10 to 15 seconds., Uncap your shaker and slowly pour the liquid from as high as you can into the shaker’s top half or a tall glass (depending on what type of shaker you have). Allow the liquid to travel through as much air as possible so more air combines with it, which will make your foam that much foamier. Remove the ice from the shaker after the first pour, then repeat back and forth two or three more times., Depending on what type of shaker you have, either attach its strainer if it has an attachable one or, if it doesn’t, hold a strainer over your serving glass. Slowly pour the liquid through the strainer into the glass. Add a dash or two of Angostura bitters to taste, then serve."

Soak or boil your cashews.,
Blend and strain your nuts.,
Blend in all but the vinegar.,
Heat on stovetop to 170 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Mold, chill, and serve.",How to Use Aquafaba3," If you know you’ll be making your cheese tomorrow, simply place your raw cashews in a bowl, cover them with warm water, and let them soak overnight. If you’re making it today, just place them in a small pot, cover them with water, and then turn the burner on and let them boil for 15 minutes. Either way, dump the cashews and water into a strainer in the sink to drain them once you’re ready.Soaking or boiling the cashews softens them, which results in a creamier texture when blended.

, Transfer your drained cashews into a blender. Add the aquafaba. Blend at high speed. You want it as smooth as can be, so give it an extra minute or two just to be sure. Then pour the mixture through a sieve over a mixing bowl. Remove any chunks of cashew that may still be in the blender. Then transfer the mixture from the bowl back into the blender.Low-end blenders and food processors are more likely to leave chunks.

, To start, add all ingredients to the mix except for the apple cider vinegar and, for the moment, the coconut oil. This means your tapioca starch, kappa carrageenan, lactic acid, nutritional yeast, tomato paste, onion powder, paprika, turmeric, and salt. Pulse until they combine evenly. Next, pour in the coconut oil and pulse again until the mixture thickens a bit.The turmeric is mostly for coloring, so if you don’t have any on hand, don’t sweat it.

, Transfer your mixture to a medium saucepan on the stovetop. Turn the burner to medium-low. The starch will cause the mixture to turn lumpy, so stir constantly to keep it smooth. Measure the temperature with a food thermometer. Once it reaches 170 degrees F (77 degrees Celsius), stir in the apple cider vinegar and remove the mixture from heat.


The oil may separate from other ingredients during the heating process. If this happens at any point, remove from heat and stir it up to recombine it. If that doesn’t work, use an immersion blender.

, Transfer the mixture into a cheese mold. Place the mold in the refrigerator. Let it sit for a few hours, testing occasionally for firmness. Once it feels as firm as real cheddar cheese, slice, grate, or shred it as desired."
"
Blend together all but the oil.,
Add the oil.,
Refrigerate.",How to Use Aquafaba4," Add your apple cider vinegar, ground mustard, salt, and aquafaba to a small bowl. Blend them together with an immersion blender until they’re evenly mixed. This should only take a second or two., Once the other ingredients are mixed, keep the immersion blender running. Very slowly pour in ¼ cup (59 ml) of your oil while mixing it in with blender as you pour. The oil will cause the mixture to thicken, which means you’ll have to move the blender around more and more to cover it all, so pause between each ¼ cup to blend and judge the mixture’s consistency before repeating.You only need enough oil to thicken the mixture so it isn’t runny. If it doesn’t drip or pour off the blender when you remove it after the third 1/4 cup, stop there. If it still appears running, add another 1/4 cup.

, Pour the mixture into a jar with an airtight seal. Place the jar in the refrigerator. Give it a few hours to thicken, until it reaches the consistency of real mayo. Once it does, use it as a spread for sandwiches, a dip for french fries, or as needed in any recipe that calls for mayo.Once a can of chickpeas is opened, the aquafaba will last for one week when refrigerated, so adjust the recipe's proportions if needed to make an amount you're likely to use up in that time."

Purchase a vegan cookbook.,
Purchase several high quality spices.,
Invest in high quality cookware and food appliances.,
Stock your pantry with vegan approved foods.",How to Set up a Vegan Kitchen," Vegan cooking is different from regular cooking. Vegans cannot use eggs as binders in their baked goods or other dishes. Vegans must also use vegetable products as substitutes for popular meat products. As such, the array of spices, the various cooking times and temperatures, and the main ingredients that you use in vegan cooking may be new and unfamiliar to you. A good vegan cookbook can help to expand your knowledge of vegan cooking and provide you with suggestions about various vegan meals that you can prepare.;
, Vegans know that they must rely more heavily on spices because the foods that they eat will not have the natural flavors that animal products often have. Meats have fat which can flavor meat and provide a rich and hearty taste to any dish. Cheeses come in a wide variety of flavors and consistencies for use in different dishes. Vegans cannot eat any of these products. In order to ensure that your menu preparations are never bland, it is important to invest in high quality spices with which you can shake up some traditional vegan dishes.

, In a vegan kitchen, there are not a lot of shortcuts. Individuals who are committed to the vegan way of life are often required to prepare a lot more in the kitchen. Because they cannot rely on ground meat products, cheeses, or even milk, vegans must spend a lot of time finding new ways to prepare vegetables, legumes and grains. Investing in high quality kitchen appliances and tools will have a positive effect on the overall quality and taste of your vegan dishes.


A food processor will help vegan cooks to mill various grains and legumes and use them in different conglomerations.
A high quality set of cooking knives will make food preparation much easier.

, There are several food items which are forbidden on a vegan menu, but there are many more foods that are welcomed and accepted in the vegan way of life. Stocking your pantry with these approved foods will make it easier for you to prepare something that will not conflict with your vegan way of life. There are several food items that every vegan kitchen needs to have.


Legumes: stocking your pantry with legumes such as beans and peas is a necessity for any vegan. Veganism relies heavily on legumes because they can be used in so many different ways. Vegans can mash up black beans and make vegetable burgers or add chickpeas to a soup or stew to provide thickness and heartiness. No vegan pantry is complete without legumes.
Canned Vegetables: the vegan diet features vegetables prominently. Vegetables are rich in nutrients and vitamins and can be eaten with absolutely no guilt whatsoever. Vegans can stock up on canned vegetables with incredibly long shelf lives so that there are always veggies on hand when it's time to cook a vegan meal.
Grains and Flour: vegan cooking is not complete without a variety of high quality grains and flour with which to prepare delicious hearty meals. Because vegan cooking cannot feature any animal products, many vegans use grains and flours to add richness to dishes. Grains such as quinoa and oats can thicken stews and soups. High quality flour can be milled by hand or purchased already milled and used to create delicious desserts and baked goods.
Oils and Butters: because vegans cannot use any dairy products, traditional butter made from cow's milk is out of the question. Many vegans stock their pantries with butter alternatives made from soy and other vegetables. Nut oils and butters like peanut butter, almond butter or cashew butter also feature prominently in a vegan's pantry.
Tomatoes: tomato products are a staple in any vegan's pantry. Tomatoes are loaded with healthy vitamins and antioxidants which can destroy harmful free radicals. Filling your pantry with canned tomato products will allow you to make rich and hearty sauces, soups and stews. Tomatoes keep for a long time in cans.
Pasta: Instead of cooking a slab of meat, many vegans choose to create richness and heartiness by serving vegan pasta dishes. Pasta is a comfort food, and stocking a vegan pantry with pasta is a necessity. There are many different types of pasta that can be used to create a variety of different dishes.

Try other alternatives if you detest meat substitutes.,
Experiment.,
Read up.",How to Veganize Recipes,";
,, For example, you can substitute most items as follows:
Cheese - vegan cheese (soy or rice based)
Beef - veggie mock beef strips (usually seitan-based)
Chicken - veggie mock chicken (usually gluten-based)
Pork/bacon - veggie mock pork/bacon (usually soy-based)
Sausages - there are many mock sausage versions on the market
Sliced sandwich meat - a variety of mock veggie sandwich meats exist
Butter - substitute oils or vegan margarine. For baking, solid coconut fat is a great choice and it is good for you in small quantities owing to its vitamin E content.
Ice cream - try soy or rice substitutes
Milk - try soy, rice, nut or oat substitutes. Water or juice will often substitute in baking.

Eggs - there are many egg-substitutes on the market. Other ideas include pectin (for example, use pureed apple in cakes).
Honey - try agave nectar or brown rice syrup.
Half of a banana
Mashed tofu (1/4 of a cup)
1/3 cup of applesauce
Egg Replacer (brand)
Gelatin - agar agar and pectin are good choices; sometimes banana or apple can substitute. It is best to follow instructions in a vegan cookbook on substituting gelatin.

, For some vegans, anything resembling meat is off-putting and undesirable. There are still choices! Try chunky cuts of vegetables in stews and stir-fry, try tofu or seitan for substance and texture.

, It will take a while to get the ingredients right and also the measurements. It is a good idea to try to start out with keeping the measurements in the recipe as close as possible but you will find that you need to make adjustments with practice over time. Some of the hardest things to convert are in the area of baking, so it is very prudent to borrow some books on vegan baking to give you a good idea.

, Use the internet, the library and your local bookstore to browse through vegan cookbooks and recipes. Get as many ideas as you can and start trusting your own instincts for what textures, flavors and substitutes work well together. It takes some patience and some experimentation but within three months you should be starting to cook confidently with substitutes and remembering without having to check what can be quickly substituted for your non-vegan recipes.

One thing you do need to be careful about when going vegan is making sure you still get complete proteins.Meat-based proteins are considered ""complete"" because they contain all of the nine amino acids your body needs. The only stand-alone complete proteins in the vegan world are quinoa and soy.
However, though plant-based sources are often incomplete, they can be combined to form complete proteins, such as rice and beans or peanut butter with toast. You don't even need to eat them at the same time. Rather, you just need to make sure you're getting your protein from a variety of sources each day, including legumes, beans, nuts, vegetables, and grains.Some people who go primarily vegan may still eat meat occasionally, such as a piece of salmon. This is considered ""flexitarian,"" and may be option may a good one for you if you are primarily going vegan for health reasons.;
, As a vegan, you can still indulge in grains like pasta and breads. However, for your heart health, it's best to focus on high-fiber versions, which help protect your heart's health. In other words, you want to choose whole grains, such as 100 percent whole-wheat bread and 100 percent whole-wheat pasta.Also, pick brown rice over white rice. You can also eat other whole grains such as oatmeal, bulgur, and quinoa.

, When switching to a vegan diet, you can still get all your nutrients from your food. However, you might need to be a bit more careful about making sure you're eating a variety of fruits and vegetables to get the nutrients you need.For example, while meat-based iron is more readily absorbed, you can also get iron from raisins, broccoli, beans, and wheat. Tofu and fortified cereals can also provide you with iron.
For calcium, eat almonds, dark leafy greens (kale, collard greens, bok choy, etc.), soybeans, and fortified soy milk. For vitamin D, you'll need to drink fortified soy milk or almond milk or eat fortified cereals.
Vitamin B12 is found in fortified soy milk and cereals as well.
Zinc can be found in foods like nuts, beans, and soy.

, If you're going to go fully vegan, you need to get used to reading labels. You'll find that many foods you assume are vegan may actually contain meat or dairy products. For instance, lard, meat stock, and gelatin are all common ingredients. Eggs, milk, and yogurt also sneak into many foods., On a vegan diet, you may not always have vegan options available to you out in public. It's a good idea to take snacks with you when you travel and to be prepared to ask a lot of questions at restaurants.Of course, you can always go for simple snacks on the road, like peanuts or cashews. It's also good to know ahead of time what brands have vegan options.
At restaurants, you may have to stick to simple things like a side salad at times. Sometimes, you may need to be a bit flexible and choose a vegetarian option instead. However, how flexible you'll be is entirely up to you.

, When you're new to veganism, it's going to take time to find foods you love. In addition, you'll need to spend more time on meal planning and in the kitchen, as you'll be creating different meals than you're accustomed to. You'll find fewer prepared ingredients you can use, so you'll need to take the time to make many things from scratch, which is healthier anyway.If you have no clue where to start, consider taking a cooking class that focuses on vegan eating., To be successful, you'll need items in your pantry that work in a vegan diet. That means having things like beans, various grains, and whole-grain pasta on hand, along with flavorful additions such as vegan condiments, tomato paste, spices, and various kinds of vinegar. Once you're stocked up, you can experiment with a variety of recipes.Consider using bulk food sections at natural food stores to stock up on things like dried beans, nuts, and grains., When switching over, you may find it difficult to give up some of the foods you love. However, many foods can be made vegan. For example, if you love chili, you can go with an all-bean version or include soy-based ground ""beef"" in it. You may find that it's not that different from your original recipe., Like meat, you can find dairy substitutes to use in your favorite foods. For instance, you can use a milk substitute such as almond milk, cashew milk, soy milk, or rice milk. You can also find yogurt substitutes, usually made from soy milk or coconut milk. Vegan ""cheeses"" are also available.You may need to try out a few varieties before you find ones you like.

, Just like any diet, you need to focus on adding flavor in healthy ways. Adding too many fats, for instance, can increase your caloric intake, which isn't good for your heart health. Add flavor through spices, salsa, fruit juice, vinegar, and mustard. Miso, a fermented soy paste, can also add flavor., Many meals are meat-based in Western culture. However, if you look to other areas of the world, you'll find many dishes are vegan, or at the very least, vegetarian dishes that can be adapted to a vegan lifestyle. Adding new and different flavors will help keep your new diet interesting.Try checking out cookbooks from the library that focus on cuisines from other parts of the world.

, A vegan diet is naturally lower in saturated fats, though you'll still find it in coconut oil and palm oil. It's also cholesterol-free, so you have that going for you.However, if you're eating a lot of prepackaged foods, you could still be getting a substantial amount of trans fat (look for hydrogenated oils on ingredient lists), which is also unhealthy. Make sure you're focusing on eating healthy fats.Try cooking with olive oil or canola oil for healthier fats. Other healthy fats include nuts, avocado, and flaxseed oil and meal., Whether you're eating vegan or not, added sugars are not healthy for your heart. Try to avoid or limit foods that are high in sugar, such as sodas, fruit juices, and desserts, to keep your heart healthy.Try to limit your sugar to 6 teaspoons a day (100 calories) for women or 9 teaspoons a day (150 calories) for men.Sugar is a sneaky ingredient, as it can be found in things like bread, tomato sauce, and a whole host of other foods.

, While you don't have to give up alcohol altogether, it's best to drink it in moderation. Men shouldn't drink more than two drinks a day, while women should stick to a single drink a day. Any more than that can affect your heart health.A drink is considered one 12 oz beer, five ounce wine, or one and a half ounces of liquor.

, Salt can increase your blood pressure, which is a detriment to your heart health. Your daily intake should definitely be under 2,400 milligrams, but getting it under 1,500 milligrams is even better to help lower your blood pressure.Make sure to read labels, as many foods sneak salt in.
Try using other herbs and spices instead of salt in your food.

, No matter what kind of diet you eat, processed foods tend to not be as good for your health. Focus on cooking healthy, vegetable-centered foods for yourself at home, instead of purchasing highly processed foods from the grocery store.Case and point: a number of junk foods such as potato chips and hard candies are actually vegan.

, Meatless options are not necessarily healthier. Some meat substitutes are high in sodium and fats. Tofu, for instance, can be high in fat depending upon how it is prepared. Make sure you are always looking at the labels to see if they are actually a healthier option than regular meats., Without fish in your diet, it may be a bit more difficult to get the omega-3 fatty acids you need. One good source is walnuts.Flaxseed oil and flaxseed meal are also a good place to get omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for a healthy heart."

A qualified nutritionist can help you plan meals, readjust your daily routine, and help you get all the proper nutrients you need.;
, Even if you are vegan, it can be overwhelming or difficult to transition to a raw diet. Don’t try to do it all at once. Instead, try doing it one day at a time, or one meal at a time. Don’t get discouraged if you can’t jump into the diet immediately. You will need an adjustment period.Try being raw until dinner time. This can be a great method if you are only going partially raw. You eat raw until dinner, then eat some cooked foods with your dinner.

, One way to get started with a raw diet is to make a list of raw fruits and vegetables you already enjoy. This gives you a basis to start building your list of foods and menu.Make a list of raw foods you’d like to incorporate more into your diet. What would you like to eat or to try? Add these to your foods list.

, By transitioning to a vegan raw diet, you will eliminate a lot of foods from your diet, like sugar, salt, dairy, grains, and processed foods. Start slowly. Try getting rid of one food type at a time. This can help you ease into this new eating lifestyle.Refined forms of sugar, like dextrose, corn syrup, rice syrup, and malt, should be avoided. You can substitute with raw honey, raw agave, maple syrup, raisins, or dates. Stevia, coconut sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon are best. Also don't use artificial sweeteners, like aspartame and Splenda.Stay away from all white or processed sugars.
Salt should be eliminated from your diet.However, some people on raw diets use minimal salt. If you are going to use salt, don't use table salt or salt without any chemical additives, like iodized salt. Instead, use unrefined sea salt, or organic salt from plants, like celery or seaweed., Not all herbs and spices are appropriate for a raw diet. When using spices, make sure they are organic and air-dried without preservatives and other agents.With herbs, grow your own herbs and eat them fresh.You can dry your own herbs and spices, too.


Check to see if the herbs or spices have been dried using heat. If so, it's not raw.Some people who follow a raw diet don't use spices. They follow the idea that you can only eat something if you can make a meal of it, and since you can't make a meal of a spice, you shouldn't eat it. They also believe the spices are toxic because they confuse taste buds and give no nutritional benefit.You will have to decide if spices are allowed in your own personal raw diet.

, A raw vegan diet requires different appliances than a traditional diet. You will need a juicer, dehydrator, blender, food processor, and hand blender. You may also want to get a mandolin or vegetable slicer. You also will need a food thermometer, cutting board, and knives.These can all be purchased at a department store.

, Since a diet that is entirely raw and vegan can eliminate important nutrients, consider eating a partial or mostly raw diet. You need to make sure you get enough iron, zinc, B12, omega-3s, and vitamin D.Make sure you incorporate these nutrients into your diet.

, Everyone, regardless of diet, eats raw foods. An easy way to start the raw vegan diet is to eat what you are familiar with: salads, smoothies, salsas, guacamole, and fresh raw vegetables and fruit., Smoothies are one of the best ways to eat raw. Throw in all sorts of fruits and vegetables. Smoothies make good breakfasts and snacks., Juicing is another popular way to eat with a raw diet. After you invest in a juicer, you can juice almost all fruits and vegetables. Popular things to juice are celery, carrots, and greens like spinach and kale.You can also juice most fruits, which adds nice flavor to your juice.

, To get the most out of your raw vegan diet, make sure to buy organic. This ensures you are not getting any harmful toxins from your raw foods.This can be expensive, so you may need to start small at first.

, One of the major staples of a raw vegan diet are leafy greens. You can use leafy greens for salads, in smoothies, or when juicing. Leafy greens include kale, spinach, Swiss chard, collard greens, beet greens, arugula, and lettuce., When you eat grains as a raw vegan, make sure to soak and sprout the grains. Grains you can use for this diet are amaranth, millet, barley, buckwheat, kamut, oats, wheat berries, and wild rice.You should also limit the amount of sprouted grains you eat since they contain irritants.You can steam grains, just make sure to keep it at a low temperature.Make sure the grains you eat are gluten free.Some people believe you shouldn't eat grains at all on a raw vegan diet.You can also sprout some legumes. However, some people believe that larger beans, like soybeans, are not healthy. By sprouting them, you can eliminate what some believe are toxins, but they don't taste the best. Generally, people on a raw vegan diet don't eat legumes.Sprouts, such as radish, clover, and broccoli, are safe raw., Healthy oils are important to a raw vegan diet. They are a great source of healthy fat. You can use them for salad dressings, desserts, dips, and toppings.


Try using coconut oil, flax seed oil, hemp seed oil, walnut oil, olive oil, and avocado oil., Nuts and seeds are great additions to your raw vegan diet. You can use them on top of salads, as snacks, in desserts, to make crackers, and in many other things.Try almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds, chia seeds, and pumpkin seeds, among numerous others.

, Fish are not the only source of omega-3 fats. Vegan-friendly sources include:Seeds, such as flaxseeds (golden or dark brown), chia seeds, or hemp seeds, which can all be raw
Leafy green vegetables, like the greens of beets, radishes, mustard, collard, Swiss chard, turnips, spinach, kale, Chinese cabbage (bok choy), cabbage, brussel sprouts, broccoli, arugula, field greens, purslane, and romaine lettuce, which can also be raw

, Sources of vegan-safe vitamin B12 include fortified cereals and fortified yeast products.You can mix with nuts or seeds to make a snack mix.

, When choosing this diet, you need to keep track of your food. Use a nutrient calculator to ensure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs. There are many nutrient trackers you can get for your computer or phone that can help you with this., If you are going to start a raw vegan diet, have your blood regularly tested for deficiencies. Make sure your doctor is aware of your dietary habits. If your doctor finds any deficiencies, you can figure out ways to fix them. You should be able to do this by eating certain foods or taking supplements., If your food isn’t giving you all your nutrients, take supplements to fill in the gaps. You can find vegan-safe supplements.


You may need these supplements to get enough zinc, iron, selenium, and calcium., Vegans do not eat any animal products, and only eat foods from plant sources. This means that vegans do not eat meat, fish, eggs, or dairy products. Instead, they eat fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds., A raw diet is where you eat living, uncooked plant-based foods, like vegetables, fruits, seeds, and nuts.On a raw diet, no food is heated over 118F. Instead, foods are eaten fresh, dehydrated, or fermented. This is done because some believe that cooking food destroys helpful enzymes and destroy the nutritional value of the food., Vegan diets are very healthy, though vegans have to ensure that they get sufficient amounts of nutrients that are easily obtained from animal products. People who follow a raw vegan diet can have problems getting nutrients like protein, iron, calcium, zinc, selenium, vitamin K, vitamin B12, and omega-3 essential fatty acids.Studies have indicated that raw vegan diets can increase the risk of bone loss, osteopenia (soft bones), and osteoporosis (brittle bones).Some women on raw vegan diets lack enough fat to make estrogen and may cease having periods and become infertile.While a vegan diet can be recommended if the person knows that they have to get enough nutrients, a raw vegan diet is not recommended, especially for children, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions.

, Children raised on raw vegan diets are at serious risks for certain problems, like growth delays, developmental delays, and neurological disorders. This occurs because the nutrients that the diet makes so difficult to obtain in sufficient amounts are those that are most critical in growth and development, along with a healthy nervous and immune system.


There have been reports of babies, infants, and small children dying of malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies., Though it varies for each individual, the average person requires about 2,000 calories per day for a healthy, functioning body. Because the elements of a raw vegan diet are extremely low in calories, you may need to each much larger quantities to hit 2,000 calories.At bare minimum, women should eat at least 1,200 calories a day, 1,800 for men. This is the bare minimum necessary to survive, but you may suffer significant impairments including fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, gallstones, a slowed metabolism, muscle loss, and cognitive impairment."

Pack your salads with protein.,
Keep your sauces on the side.,
Include snacks of nuts and dried fruits.,
Place lime or lemon wedges in your salads.",How to Pack a Vegan Lunch for Work1," If you typically make a salad for lunch, make sure you're including plant-based sources of protein to give you the energy you need to make it through the rest of the workday.Tofu crumbles or other soy products are a good way to do this. Adding a handful of crushed almonds or ½ cup of cooked beans to your salad is another way to add a burst of protein.
You also want to make sure your salad has a good dose of healthy fats, which also provide energy. In addition to nuts, you might consider adding a few slices of avocado or a few olives.
Orange and apple slices also work well in salads and can provide healthy fats as well as a vitamin boost.;
, Regardless of whether you are able to refrigerate your food, mixing the sauce together with the food means it will be soggy by lunchtime. If the sauce is separate, you can add it when you're ready to eat.If there's a type of sauce or dressing that you use often, and that doesn't have to be refrigerated, you might consider taking an extra bottle of it to work so you always have it.
Make sure any sauces you bring with you are in water-tight containers, or cover the top with cellophane before sealing the lid to keep the sauce secure.

, You can buy bulk nuts and dried fruits and mix them together yourself in a bag or small container. This will give you something more for lunch, or a snack if you get hungry later in the day.Dried fruit is especially helpful to get in your daily fruit servings, if you're worried about the ability to keep fresh fruit without damaging or spoiling it.
Include nuts with protein, such as almonds, if you need a quick energy boost.

, Citrus wedges not only add flavor, but help keep raw vegetables crisp. Limes are especially effective if you need to keep your salad at room temperature for several hours before lunch.Lime and lemon wedges also double as a convenient way to dress a salad. Once you're ready to eat, you can squeeze the wedges for a drizzle of lime or lemon juice to add a dash of flavor. This is easier to transport than bringing a separate container of dressing, and you don't have to worry about leaking.

Chop greens into grains and soups.,
Make larger dinners and use leftovers for lunches.,
Prep food all at once.,
Use thermoses for soups and stews.,
Carve out time to make multiple batches.,
Roll up leftovers in a wrap or pita.",How to Pack a Vegan Lunch for Work2," It can be difficult to get leafy vegetables into your lunch, especially if you have limited storage space in your lunch container. Instead of packing a separate container of leafy greens, chop them up and mix them into a rice dish or soup to make sure you're getting all the greens you need.For example, you can chop up spinach and blend it into your brown or wild rice. The spinach will infuse your lunch with protein and iron.
You also can mix leftover greens into soups. Even if the soup is already prepared, you can still stir in finely chopped greens so you're getting more volume of leafy greens without taking up too much room.

, If you normally cook your dinner, you can easily prepare a little more and save the excess to take with you to work the next day, or a couple of days later.Refrigerate food that you plan to eat within three days. If you're going to wait any longer to eat it, go ahead and freeze it to keep the ingredients as fresh as possible.
If you're cooking a hot meal that you'll need to reheat for lunch, take out the excess you want to save for lunch right after you finish cooking it and refrigerate or freeze it. This will ensure that you have a lunch portion set aside already. It will also prevent the vegetables and other ingredients from getting overcooked if you plan to leave it on the burner, such as for a soup or stew.
Keep sauces on the side so they don't overly moisten your food while it's being refrigerated or frozen. You can pack a small cup of sauce with your lunch and use it the next day.

, You can save time making your lunches for work by chopping and dicing vegetables ahead of time and keeping them in a container in the fridge or freezer so they stay fresh. You can make a variety of lunches using the same ingredients.Take care with storage of sliced or chopped fruits and vegetables, and make sure they're sealed in air-tight containers. You may want to write the date you prepped them on the container so you can use them before they start to spoil.

, You may think of thermoses or insulated mugs as only being for drinks, but they also can be used for soups or stews that need to be eaten hot. While they typically won't retain heat overnight, they will for a few hours.This can be especially helpful if you don't have a microwave at your workplace, or if there's typically a line to use it that takes up valuable time. Simply heat your thermos by filling it with boiling water, heat your soup, and then pour out the water after a few minutes. Then, pour the soup into your thermos. Do this in the morning before you head to work and your soup will be warm enough to eat when you open it for lunch.
Another benefit of thermoses and insulated mugs is that they are easy to carry and won't take up too much space in your bag. If need be, many have a loop or hook that allows them to be tethered to the outside of your bag.

, If you have a couple of hours on the weekend, you can make larger portions of staples and sides. Split them into individual servings and freeze them so they'll be ready to add to lunches during the week.If you're making multiple batches of something that needs to be reheated, remember not to cook it completely. You want it to maintain its consistency upon reheating.

, If you made a salad for dinner, or have other leftovers, the ingredients often can be used to make a sandwich for work the next day. Use a whole-grain wrap and layer your food, putting the lightest on the bottom so they will be on the outside.Think about texture as well. Leafy greens typically should be on the outside so they stay crisp, and the wrap or pita itself won't get too soggy and fall apart.
Wrap tightly and store in the refrigerator. Most wraps and pitas will be okay at room temperature for several hours, but be aware of any ingredients that require refrigeration.
In many cases it's better to keep condiments separate and add them before you eat your wrap or pita, rather than letting the ingredients soak them in for several hours – especially if you won't have the opportunity to refrigerate your lunch during the morning.

Separate food by texture.,
Try glass instead of plastic.,
Get creative with unconventional containers.,
Use bento-box style trays and containers.",How to Pack a Vegan Lunch for Work3," As you're packing your lunch, paying attention to the texture of your foods can help ensure that everything maintains its consistency through the morning, and that lighter or crispier food isn't crushed by something heavier and denser.Use containers that have compartments that allow you to separate foods, or use a large kale or lettuce leaf as a divider.
For denser foods such as sweet potatoes or rice dishes, you often can pack them side by side without worrying too much about them mixing.
In addition to texture, you also should consider whether foods have to be heated. Keeping cold foods in a separate container from foods that have to be heated will save you prep time at work.

, Particularly if you're packing something that will need to be heated up, glass often works better than plastic. It's also better for the environment, easy to clean, and won't alter the flavors of your foods.Tempered glass dishes can be just as durable as plastic. However, they are heavier and can be bulkier. For these reasons, glass may not be the best option for you if you walk or bike to work.
Get containers with lids rather than covering your dishes with plastic wrap. They'll keep your food fresher and you won't have to worry as much about them coming off.

, When you're thinking about packing a vegan lunch for work, sometimes it helps to literally think outside the ""box."" Containers, such as mason jars, that aren't typically used for packing lunches can work well for vegan dishes.For example, you can use a mason jar for salads. Simply put your ingredients in the jar, and when you're ready for lunch, all you have to do is shake the jar to evenly distribute them. If you're using a salad dressing, you can add it to the jar, put the lid back on, and shake to evenly coat the entire salad.
Other jars and containers that aren't typically used for food can be used as well. For example, you might use travel-size toiletry bottles for sauces or dressings. Just make sure to use brand new ones that have never had soap or other toiletries in them.

, Bento boxes provide a handy way to keep your foods separate as well as ensuring you're using appropriate portion sizes and including enough variety in your lunch.Another advantage of bento boxes is that you can see everything laid out in front of you. It gives you the opportunity to plan your lunch in a balanced way, while also inspiring creative presentation.
You can find bento boxes at many discount or department stores, or at specialty kitchen stores. You also may be able to find them online at lower prices.
If you find a particular container that you like, buy two or three of them when you can so that you can rotate them. That way they won't wear out as quickly.

Make vegan mole.",How to Make Vegan Sauces and Dips1," Restaurant owner Alfredo di Lello invented Alfredo sauce for his wife by mixing together Parmesan, cream and butter in his kitchen. The sauce reportedly restored her appetite during an uncomfortable pregnancy. In this recipe, chopped raw cashews and almond milk thicken the sauce without requiring heavy cream or dairy. Traditional Alfredo is full of fat and calories; the vegan version is much healthier.;
, Marinara sauce has its origins in the 16th century. Supposedly, the Neapolitan sailors invented the sauce after the Spanish introduced the tomato, a New World crop, to Europe. A pot of simmering spaghetti sauce will fill your home with delightful aromas. You can add vegan meatballs or tofu crumbles if you prefer the texture of meat without animal ingredients.

, Italian cooks utilize a variety of vegetables when making their own homemade tomato sauces. Add some red pepper flakes to this recipe to transform it into an ‘arrabiata’ (angry) sauce. You can use vegan tomato sauce as a topping for linguine or other pasta, since its strong flavors contrast nicely with the mildness of pasta. This sauce can also serve as a topping for pizza or as a dip for calzones or garlic bread.

, Peppers are used in many different Italian dishes. For example, many Italians use peppers to make Nduja, which is similar to Andouille sausage. This article will teach you how to roast your own red peppers at home. Use the finished sauce to top pasta, ravioli or gnocchi.

, Peanut sauce is generally used in cuisine from Africa, Thailand, Malaysia, China, Vietnam and Indonesia. Ginger is a common ingredient, as is garlic, coconut milk and spices. Vegan ginger peanut sauce makes an excellent sauce for stir-fry. It combines well with rice and other grains as well as with tofu.

, Gravy is traditionally made by sautéing flour in animal fat to form a roux. Then, cooks add milk or water to make gravy. You can still “pass the gravy” with this recipe that substitutes olive oil for animal fat. You’ll also know that you’re serving a much healthier version of a rich and beloved classic.

, Curry with vegetables makes a wonderful, flavorful weeknight supper. With this recipe, you’ll create three batches of sauce that you can freeze and quickly thaw for a quick meal any time of day. Curry is associated with Southern Asia but was actually invented by the British. The term curry was a catch-all for sauces made from butter, nuts, spices and fruits that were poured over rice.

, The Aztecs invented the concept of wrapping, filling and eating tortillas. The word “enchilada” first appeared in the U.S. in 1885 and literally means, “in chile.” Traditional enchiladas are more of a street snack consisting of a corn tortilla dipped in chile sauce rather than the casserole-like dish that we prepare in the U.S. today. This article provides techniques for making both red and green enchilada sauce so that you can customize your recipe to your tastes.

, This traditional French sauce usually has a base of milk with a buttery roux. This recipe uses almond meal and almond milk to create a similarly creamy texture. Top it off with a pinch of nutmeg and serve it with stuffed squash or with pasta. In France, béchamel sauce is known as one of the four meres or “mother sauces” from which all other sauces are derived.

, Pesto means “pressed.” The inventors of this sauce had no access to food processors or blenders. Instead, they pressed the basil and other ingredients with a mortar and pestle. This vegan pesto recipe substitutes nutritional yeast for the traditional parmesan cheese. This flexible sauce makes a delicious topping for pizza, pasta and even warm potato salad.

, Historians believe that Mole was invented in the 1680s in a convent in Puebla de los Angeles. The sister superior of the convent supposedly created the dish to honor the archbishop who created a convent for her order. Vegan mole sauce still has the rich, cocoa-infused flavor of the traditional sauce. Use this sauce to add flavor to vegan chili or use it to create a twist on a traditional pot of beans.

",How to Make Vegan Sauces and Dips2," Globe artichokes originated in North Africa and were cultivated in Naples during the 9th century. The origin of the spinach and artichoke combination, however, is unclear. Soy cheese replaces the traditional cream cheese and mayonnaise. Serve this dip with bruschetta or pita chips that have been brushed with garlic and melted vegan butter.

, Hummus is actually the Arabic word for chickpea. Although its origins are uncertain, some speculate that it was invented in the Middle East. Pitas and almost any raw vegetable make the perfect accompaniment to hummus. You can also experiment with the recipe to create roasted red pepper hummus or chipotle hummus.

, Avocados provide rich flavor and an excellent source of monounsaturated fats. Dip tortilla chips and almost any type of vegetable in this delicious avocado-based concoction. The Aztecs actually invented guacamole, which was later adopted by settlers. The Aztecs called it ahuaca-mulli, which simply meant “avocado sauce.”.

, Salsa was another dip that was invented by either the Mayans, Incas or Aztecs and later adopted by the Spanish. Alonso de Molina created the name “salsa” in the late 16th century. Salsa makes a great dip for chips and vegetables as well as a tasty topping for omelets, burgers, tacos and burritos. If you don’t have fresh tomatoes on hand, chop some canned whole plum tomatoes instead.

, Dice up 4 garlic cloves and drop them into the pan. Be careful, once the oil is hot, it may pop when you add the garlic. Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes. Stir occasionally to keep the garlic from sticking.


Adding the garlic early gives it a chance to brown up a bit, helping it release flavor.
Garlic is a very strong herb packed with anti-oxidants that are great for the heart. Unfortunately, the sulphuric compounds that give garlic their health benefits and taste can also cause garlic breath. If you are sensitive to garlic, use just 1 clove of garlic, or a few dashes of garlic salt instead., Use your own personal preferences for this step. You can chop up 2 fresh tomatoes or use 2 canned tomatoes. Follow with 1 can of tomato sauce, or use homemade tomato sauce.


You can also remove the tomatoes and use only tomato sauce.
If you are using chopped up whole tomatoes, you may want to blend them first to get a smoother consistency for your sauce.

, Add 1/8 tsp cayenne powder, 2 tsp oregano and 2 tsp cumin. Cook for another 5 minutes.


Cayenne powder is very spicy so be careful how much you add. If you are sensitive to spices, just use a pinch. If you are interested in a spicier sauce, you can use 2/8 tsp and a dash of black pepper.

, Use either 3/4 cup water or vegetable broth, not both. Using vegetable broth will give your sauce more flavor, but many store bought broths have preservatives and additives so you may be better off making your own vegetable broth.


Making it yourself will take a little extra time, but will enhance the flavor of your sauce., Cook your sauce for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.


If you want to get creative with flavors, you can use a separate spoon to taste your sauce after it has had some time to cook and take the opportunity to add a little more oregano, cumin, or any other spice you desire.

Pair meatballs with nutritious pasta.,
Offer zucchini meatballs as an hors d'oeuvre.","How to Make Zucchini ""Meatballs"""," Rinse the zucchini under cool water, then pat them dry with a paper towel. Line the mixing bowl with a thin hand towel or cheesecloth. Use a medium or fine grater to reduce the zucchini to small shreds, allowing it to collect on top of the towel.There are lots of beneficial nutrients in the zucchini peels, so leave them on.
3 medium-sized zucchini should be enough to make a little over a dozen meatballs.;
, Gather the corners of the towel and lift the zucchini out of the bowl. Hold the towel-wrapped zucchini over the sink and give it a squeeze. This will help extract any remaining water.You can also heat the zucchini in a pan for a few minutes to evaporate the extra liquid.Zucchini naturally has a high water content, which can ruin the flavor and texture of the finished meatballs.

, Return the grated zucchini to the mixing bowl. Add one egg, two cloves crushed garlic, one cup seasoned bread crumbs, one half cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, three tablespoons chopped basil and a dash of salt and pepper to taste. Blend the ingredients until they’re distributed throughout the mixture.Together, the egg, breadcrumbs and cheese will serve as a binding agent to help the meatballs retain their shape.
Crush the garlic cloves using a manual press, or pulse it in the food processor along with the basil to save time.

, Grab a small handful of the zucchini mixture and use the palms of both hands to roll them. Try to use roughly one ounce of zucchini per meatball. Make sure each meatball has been pressed firmly to ensure that they’ll hold together while cooking.The meatballs will shrink somewhat as they cook.
If you find that your meatballs are falling apart, add a small amount of flour to the mixture and try again. The flour will soak up moisture and become slightly sticky., Set the oven to convection and make sure the center rack is clear. Let the oven begin warming up while you finish preparing the meatballs.Keeping the temperature relatively low will prevent you from accidentally burning the cheese and breadcrumbs.

, Lay out the meatballs in rows. Leave an inch or two of space between each to allow heat to circulate properly.Use a deep or rimmed baking sheet in case the meatballs slide around while in the oven.If you’re not using a nonstick baking sheet, grease it with cooking spray first.

, Dip a basting brush in the oil and lightly go over the tops of the meatballs. Oil will help the meatballs cook up nice and crisp and give them a crusty golden-brown exterior.Olive oil will provide the most complementary flavor to the seasonings in the meatballs.

, Place the meatballs in the oven and set a timer. Keep an eye on them as they bake so they don’t get too done. If you wish, you can turn the meatballs over at the halfway point, though convection heat should help them cook evenly throughout.Remove the meatballs from the oven and use a pair of tongs or fork to gently nudge them over.
Give the meatballs a few minutes to cool before serving them.

, If you’d prefer your meatballs to have a crispier texture, or if you’d like to shave a few minutes off the cook time, you also have the option of frying them on the stovetop. Cover the bottom of a large skillet with half an inch of olive or canola oil. Drop in the meatballs and pan fry for 3-5 minutes on each side until brown.Set the pan fried meatballs on a layer of paper towels to absorb excess oil as they cool.
Panko breadcrumbs hold up better to frying than other varieties., Transfer the hot meatballs to a saucepan and simmer them with tangy marinara or vodka sauce for 5 minutes. Or, enjoy them Swedish-style in a creamy sauce seasoned with black pepper, nutmeg and allspice. There’s really no wrong way to savor these marvelous meat-free morsels.Finish Italian meatballs with red pepper flakes or balsamic vinegar to coax more flavor out of the mild zucchini.
Be careful not to stew or simmer zucchini meatballs for too long, as this can cause them to become soggy.

, Zucchini meatballs can easily become a complete meal with the addition of spaghetti, linguine or penne cooked perfectly al dente. Top with fresh oregano and extra grated parmesan and serve with crusty Italian bread.Go with whole wheat pasta to cut down on calories.
While you’re at it, try making zoodles using a mandoline or spiralizer for an all-zucchini meal!, Vegetarian meatballs can make a perfect finger food for your next holiday party or get together. Simply bake or fry them, arrange them on a serving platter and stick a toothpick in each one. Their small sizes makes them easy to eat, and their rich, delicious flavor makes them hard to resist.Experiment with different dipping sauces, as well, such as a spicy currant jelly, smoky garlic ketchup or lemon-dill remoulade."

Add the other ingredients.Once the cashews and water are blended to a smooth consistency, you’ll need to add 1/4 teaspoon of salt, six to eight pitted dates, one teaspoon of nutmeg, one 14-ounce can of coconut milk, and (if you wish) one tablespoon of maple syrup.,
Enjoy your eggnog.Place your eggnog in the fridge for half an hour to chill.",How to Make Vegan Eggnog1," Making vegan eggnog with cashews requires one cup of raw, unsalted cashews, pitted medjool dates, nutmeg, salt, and a can of coconut milk.You’ll also need two cups of water and can, if you choose, add one tablespoon of maple syrup.


Be sure to get unsalted cashews or your eggnog will have a salty taste.
This recipe will make about two cups of nog.;
, Put your cashews in a bowl or cup and cover them with water. Many people find it convenient to soak the cashews in the fridge overnight. This helps soften them so they are ready for processing later.


Some recipes recommend rinsing the cashews after soaking and discarding the water, but it is not necessary to rinse them.

, You might notice the water start to darken or see the dates plump up. This is normal and indicates the dates are absorbing water and releasing their sugar.

, Blend until the mixture is uniformly smooth.


Do not use the same water you used to soak the cashews.

, Blend everything for several minutes until the mixture is smooth.

, Pour yourself or your friends a glass when it is ready. If you wish, add ice to the cup. Top with cinnamon or nutmeg.


Store eggnog you don’t drink in the fridge, covered, and drink within three days.

Collect your ingredients.,
Soak the almonds.Add the almonds in a large bowl.,
Bake the raw coconut.Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius).,
Rinse the almonds.Dispose of the water the almonds soaked in.,
Blend your ingredients.,
Strain the mixture.Once you’ve blended everything up, you’ll need to strain out the almond pulp and bean bits.",How to Make Vegan Eggnog2," To make vegan eggnog with almonds, you need water, one cup of raw almonds, one cup of shredded, unsweetened coconut, pitted medjool dates, one teaspoon of nutmeg, and half of a vanilla bean. The vanilla bean section should be about five inches in length.The amount of water you add depends on how much nog you want to make. Adding two cups of water will produce 1.5 cups of nog. Adding three cups of water will produce about 2.25 cups of nog.

, Pour water over the almonds so that it covers them. Set the bowl aside overnight. Placing the almonds in water allows them to soften and makes them easier to blend. It also increases the digestibility of the nut and increases your ability to absorb the nutrients within., Place the coconut in an even layer on a baking sheet. Check on it every three minutes until it is golden brown. The process will usually take about ten minutes. Remove when done and let cool.

, Pour the nuts into a colander and place it under running tap water. Run your hands through the almonds, rinsing them for about twenty seconds. Turn the tap off and give the colander a shake to help it drain.

, Add the nuts, vanilla bean, two or three cups of water, soaked dates, toasted coconut, and nutmeg to a blender. Pulse the ingredients for ten seconds, pause briefly, then pulse for another ten seconds. Set the blender on high. Blend everything for about one or two minutes, until smooth.


If you wish, you can hold off on adding the nutmeg until after straining the mixture.
You could also choose to soak the dates in warm water for one hour before adding the to the blender. This will draw out their sweetness.

, Place a nut milk bag over a mixing bowl or large pot and pour the blended mix slowly into the bag. The bag will filter the pulp and leave you with smooth, tasty nog in the bowl.


If you did not add the nutmeg when blending your ingredients, you can whisk it in now.
If you do not have a nut milk bag, you could use a cheesecloth or a mesh strainer. These alternatives will allow more pulp into the final product, though.

Make a boozy eggnog.If you are of legal drinking age, you could give your eggnog a kick.,
Thicken your eggnog.If you like a richer, fattier eggnog, you could leave the nut pulp in the eggnog after blending the nuts and water.,
Make a thinner eggnog.If the eggnog is too thick for your tastes, add a few extra tablespoons of water before blending it for the final time.,
Take the lazy way.,
Use different nuts.Instead of almonds or cashews, try raw, unsalted pecans or walnuts.,
Add a sweet note to your nog.",How to Make Vegan Eggnog3," Splash a shot of bourbon, rum, or whiskey in the eggnog when you blend it. Add as much or as little as you want.

, If you choose to do this, simply add the rest of your ingredient to the mixture without straining it.


Alternately, you could strain the pulp out, then add a portion of it back to the mixture after straining it out. For instance, if you want your nog just a bit thicker, you could scoop a table spoon or two of the strained nuts when blending the mix for the final time.

, This will reduce the thickness of the nog.


You could also add ice to your cup before pouring yourself a glass. As the ice melts, it will add water to the beverage, making it thinner.

, Cashew and almond milk are readily available in grocery stores. If you’re impatient or just too busy to make your own milk alternative, you could buy one at your local grocery store. You could also use soy milk, though the higher fat content in cashew milk and almond milk make them more appropriate for eggnog.


You could also save time by using vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean.One teaspoon per two to three cups of water should be enough.

, These adjustments can change the flavor profile of your tasty nog.


Pecans are sweeter than walnuts, and have a more mild taste.
Walnuts have a rich flavor and blend well.

, Toss half a frozen banana into the mix before blending everything to give the nog a fruity flavor. You could also play with the spice content of the nog by adding or removing nutmeg, cinnamon, or pumpkin spice.Alternately (or additionally), you could add a tablespoon or two of maple syrup to the blend."

Find Agar and decide which form works best for you.,
Add Agar to the liquid and mix with a whisk.,
Bring the solution to a boil and allow it to simmer.,
Pour the mixture into a mold or container and leave it out at room-temperature to gel.",How to Use Agar Agar1," Agar usually comes in three forms: powder, flakes, or a bar. All three work equally well; the real difference is ease of preparation. Powdered Agar is usually the easiest to use, as it can be substituted for gelatin in a 1:1 ratio (1 teaspoon gelatin is equivalent to 1 teaspoon Agar powder).The powder also dissolves easier than flakes or bars.If you're not sure which type to use, default to the powdered Agar.


Agar bars are white, lightweight and made of freeze-dried Agar. They can be ground in a coffee or spice grinder so they dissolve easier or can be broken up by hand. One bar is equivalent to 2 teaspoons of Agar powder.Agar flakes can also be ground in a coffee or spice grinder and are less concentrated than the powder. They are white and look a little like fish food. 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of Agar is roughly equivalent to 2 teaspoons of Agar powder.Look for Agar in natural food stores, Asian grocery stores, or online.;
, The firmness of the gel is determined by the amount of Agar you add. If your recipe doesn't give you a measurement, you can follow this rule of thumb: to thicken 1 cup (.25 liters) of liquid, use 1 teaspoon Agar powder, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) Agar flakes, or 1/2 Agar bar.If you are substituting gelatin with Agar you can use the same amount of Agar powder to thicken the recipe. Otherwise, for every teaspoon of gelatin you will need to use 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) flakes or 1/2 bar.
If you are trying to jellify a somewhat acidic liquid, such as those derived from citrus fruits or strawberry, you may need to add more Agar.Some fruits are too acidic or contain enzymes that prevent gelling and must be broken down by being cooked first. These fruits include kiwi, pineapple, fresh figs, papaya, mango, and peaches.Using canned versions of these fruits will cut out the extra step of cooking them, since canned fruits have all been pre-cooked.You can also hydrate the Agar in boiling water and then mix in the acidic liquid., The powder should simmer for about 5 minutes while the flakes and bars should take between 10-15 minutes.Stir the solution until the Agar is completely dissolved. This process will hydrate the Agar, which will allow it to jellify the liquid when it cools.Warm up the liquid as much as possible. One advantage of Agar is that it begins to set at a higher temperature than gelatin, so it is a solid at room temperature or even when you warm it up. The liquid will begin to gel when it falls below 113°F (45°C). Because the addition of other ingredients may cause the temperature to drop and the Agar to set before you are ready, getting the liquid as hot as you can will make it less likely to drop below 113°F (45°C) until you remove it from heat.If you are making an alcoholic gel, boil the Agar with any juices or mixers first, then whisk the alcohol in at the very last moment. This will prevent the alcohol from evaporating., The mixture will begin to gel when it reaches 104°F to 113°F (40°C to 45°C) and will stay in this form as long as it stays below 175°F (80°C). You don't need to refrigerate the gel unless you want to serve it cool, so you can leave your dish sitting out at room-temperature without it melting or collapsing.If you're not sure if you used the right amount of Agar, pour a small amount in a cold bowl to see if it firm up. If it doesn't set after 30 seconds, add more Agar. If it's too firm for your liking, add more liquid.Don't stir or shake the Agar jelly until it has completely set, or it will collapse.Don't grease, line, or oil the mold before pouring in the mixture. It should pop out of your mold just fine, and these things can actually affect how well your mixture gels.Unlike gelatin, you can melt the gelled mixture (if you wanted to add another ingredient, pour it into a different mold, add more agar to make the gel more firm or add more liquid to soften it), bring it to a boil again, then cool it again without compromising its gelling abilities."

Make vegan puddings or custards with an Agar fluid gel.",How to Use Agar Agar2," Agar is tasteless and will take on the taste of whatever it is mixed with, giving you endless flavor possibilities. These candies will stay firm at room temperature, so you can leave them out in a little dish or bowl without worrying about them melting and making a mess. Try mixing agar with teas, juices, broth, coffee--anything that sounds tasty to you!Try boiling chocolate milk with agar powder, then adding a pinch of cinnamon. Pour it into little glasses to cool for a rich treat.
Remember certain acidic fruits may require extra steps, as their acidity or enzymes interfere with Agar's ability to gel.Pour the mixture in silicone molds in cute shapes. Then your jelly candies can look like stars, kittens, hearts, shells, or any other shapes you can find.

, You can prepare little gelatinous shots for parties by boiling your mixers with Agar. After allowing the mixture to simmer and the Agar to dissolve and disperse, add the alcohol and stir. Pour the mixture into shot glasses or ice cube molds and allow them to set.Try mixing agar with the ingredients for a hot toddy and serve the cubes warm at holiday parties.

, If you have a recipe that calls for egg whites but you are vegan, allergic to eggs, or simply don't like them, Agar is a suitable replacement. To replace one egg, mix 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) Agar powder in 1 tablespoon of water. Use an immersion blender or whisk to vigorously whip the mixture, then put it in the refrigerator to chill. Once the mixture is cool, take it out and whip it a second time. This mixture should perform the same function as egg whites in your baking and won't even alter the taste or color., Gelatinous desserts usually call for a lot of eggs for thickening and texture. Instead of eggs, try making a basic gelled mixture of Agar and water, following the steps in method 1. Use a blender or an immersion blender to puree the gel until smooth.Mix this in with your other ingredients and you'll find you have a delicious, eggless dessert.


If you want to thicken the pudding or custard, add a little xanthan gum.If you want to thin out the dessert, stir in a little water or another liquid."

Use Agar as an appetite suppressant.,
Use Agar pills to stimulate bowel movements and act as a laxative.",How to Use Agar Agar3," Agar expands in your stomach, which tricks you into thinking you are full. It's know as the ""kanten diet"" in Japan and is used by many to try and prevent them from eating too much.People with type 2 Diabetes who supplemented their diet with Agar lost a significant amount of weight and improved their metabolism.It may also help stabilize blood sugar levels.Make sure you check with your doctor before embarking on this diet.
Make snacks using Agar to stay full throughout the day, or mix it into your meals so you stop eating sooner than you normally would.
Be aware that Agar can also stimulate your intestines and make you need to use the bathroom.Make sure you take Agar with at least 8 oz. of water, otherwise the Agar can swell and possibly block your esophagus or intestines., Agar is 80% fiber, so it can be helpful if you need to relieve constipation. It should never, however, be used when you have a bowel obstruction (a kink or blockage in your intestines that prevents you from passing gas or having a bowel movement), as this can make the obstruction much worse.If you have sudden, severe pain in your abdomen, swelling in your abdomen, and vomit or become nauseous, do not take Agar. Call your doctor instead, as you may have a bowel obstruction.Make sure you take Agar with enough water, at least 8oz, for it to work as a laxative."

Ease into the change.,
Find some like-minded people.,
Add more vegetables, salads and fruits to your regular diet while you are still eating meat.,
Read literature about factory farming.,
Be sure to get enough protein.,
Substitute for the meat.,
If you feel like eating meat just one time, think of the video, article, or even pictures you saw of the animal you want to eat, and you might not want to after that.

,
Reward yourself and be proud.",How to Stop Eating Meat," Few people are able to switch from carnivore to vegetarian overnight, much less when you've eaten a lot of meat in your diet. If you are really used to using meat for most meals, easing in will help you to take your time and to find alternative dishes and meal options that work best for you and your lifestyle.


There are some people who can stop eating meat just like that. However, most people find this a challenge, so don't be afraid to take small steps towards a bigger overall goal.;
, It's really helpful to have support when you make changes, and dietary changes are not different. Find people who are already vegetarian or even vegan and learn from them. Ask questions, watch how they prepare food and share their meals. (Just be sure to return the favor.)

, From here, switch to seafood and fish only, along with the increased amount of vegetables, beans, grains, etc.

Expect to feel full but not weighted down at this stage.

, The knowledge of how animals are treated and how unhealthy some of the meat products end up being can help you to grasp the importance of changing your diet. This can be a big perceptual shift that helps you make an entire lifestyle shift. However, not everybody wants to be a vegetarian spurred on by this reason; it is your right to choose to eat no meat for a variety of reasons, so read whatever inspires you.


There are some good books on ""Speciesism"", namely how we keep some animals for pets, kill some that enter our house unwanted or for scientific testing (mice, snakes, chimps), and feel justified in killing and eating others, and the inherent hypocrisy underlying that commonly accepted point of view. Once you start questioning things, vegetarianism/veganism will start making sense to you, and you will see this not as a diet change, but as a full-on lifestyle change.
At least only buy from cage-free facilities in which animals can graze freely before they produce your milk or eggs.

, At first you will be likely feel hungrier because your body isn't used to the different foods making up for the meat. Use the best sources of plant protein you can get, as this will ease the transition.


Be aware that there is a lot of protein in beans, grains and vegetables. Meat analog products are good, along with soybean fermented products. Use online charts to help you decide which ones sound the most tempting to you.

, Every time you feel like you want meat, try eating a morningstar, boca burger, meat analog products or tofu. Tempeh, with its tough texture, makes a fantastic substitute for meat. Try it with barbecue sauce. Seitan is very meaty but made from wheat; it's a great substitute for steaks and stews.


Eat alternatives, not only when you crave it, but just to eat them. They taste really good.






Only eat alternatives you like. If you don't like tofu, then you do not have to eat it.







,, You are really helping to save animals (and the environment).

Decide whether you really want to go vegan/vegetarian.,
Find out what vitamins, etc that you might miss out on from not eating meat, dairy, eggs, etc.,
Find a time when your parents are not busy.,
If they are sitting watching TV, that may be a good time-make sure its not their favorite show though!,
Sit down and ask them if you can have a talk.,
Tell them that you are not saying they have to do this too.,
Offer to take care of it yourself.,

Get recipes.,
Persevere.",How to Tell Your Parents You Want to Be a Vegan or Vegetarian," What are your reasons? Are you doing it because you want to be healthier? Do you want to stop supporting animal cruelty? Are you converting to a religion that requires you to be vegetarian/vegan?;
, For example, you may need to take vitamins such as Iron, B12, Omega-3, Zinc, and Vitamin D.

, Telling your parents when they are busy will most likely make them say no. Notice if your parents look relaxed and in a good mood then approach them.

, If it is their favorite show, chances are they will be annoyed, and get frustrated, which is not the mood you want them to be in.

, If they say 'yes say - ""Mum, Dad I just wanted to let you know that I have made the decision to go Vegan/Vegetarian. I would really appreciate if I could have your support on this."" If they disagree, educate your parents by showing them films about veganism such as Earthlings, Cowspiracy, Meet Your Meat and Forks Over Knives. Do some research and state the real facts about why meat, dairy, and eggs are unhealthy to your parents as well, who knows they may join you on your vegan journey.

, If your parents do allow you to become a vegan or vegetarian you could try to convince them to give veganism a try but if they don't want to respect their decision.

, Learn to cook some of your own meals. If it is a hassle, tell them you will make your own school lunches, and they will only have to cook your dinner.

, It is a good idea to make a little recipe book with ideas for meals that you can all eat together. For example:

Breakfast: porridge with fruit and nuts, smoothie bowl, toast with nut butter, fruit salad or an omelette with vegetables and tempeh bacon.
Lunch: pasta salad, roasted vegetables, sushi with avocado, carrots, cucumber etc, veggie wrap or sandwich or baked potato with salsa, corn, and beans.
Dinner: vegetable soup, vegetable lasagna, tacos with beans, potato curry with rice or stir fry with tofu, vegetables and rice or noodles.
Snacks: mixed berries, smoothie, carrots and hummus, nuts (walnuts, peanuts etc) or avocado toast.

, If they still disagree and force you to eat meat, you can either just give up and go vegan when you move out, reduce your meat intake and eat more fruits and vegetables or, if this means a lot to you, you can refuse and just eat whatever is OK for a vegan or vegetarian on your dinner plate.

Know what to avoid.,
Know what needs to be substituted.,
Substitute with suitable foods.,
Veganize it!,
Cook and bake.",How to Make Any Dish Vegan," This is imperative to vegan meal preparation. Whether it's your newly adopted lifestyle or whether you are preparing a meal for a loved one, the definition of vegan living is: No animal products. This means not eating or serving:


Anything that walks, swims or flies. Yes, that means chickens and fish, too.
Anything that is derived from animals, such as oils/fats or gelatin (from bones).
Anything created by animals, as in honey.;
, Obviously, the meat called for in any given recipe can be eliminated entirely, but you can also substitute a variety of acceptable and tasty things that will either mimic the original or add new textures and flavors––it's up to you. So have fun and use your imagination. Some of the most vital substitutions you need to be aware of to ensure the dish comes out correctly are listed below:


Eggs. Used to bind a dish, meaning 'hold it together'. Think of cutting a square of lasagne and how it holds its shape; that bound-together shape comes from the eggs. If eggs were eliminated entirely, it might simply be a loose scoop of pasta and sauce.
Cheese. Used in dishes such as pizza, enchiladas and mac 'n cheese, cheese is the star in many meals.
Milk or cream. The basis behind many creamy sauces and soups, as well as a wide variety of many dessert and confections.
Oils and fats. Keeping foods from sticking to the pan or baking dish is one reason to use a fat in your cooking, but did you know that flavor and moisture from oil is also an important aspect of making a good dish taste fantastic?

, Below you will find a basic substitution list for the most important ingredients listed in the previous step, to ensure that your recipe turns out just as well, if not better than the original. Also included here are some alternatives to meats, should you choose not to eliminate it from the recipe.


Eggs: Flax seed. Bananas. Tofu. Yogurt. Applesauce. Ener-G egg replacer (or other brands). You will have to use common sense when making your choice; obviously you wouldn't use bananas in your pasta dish, but rather in a sweet or fruity recipe.
Cheese: Nutritional yeast (see below). Homemade nut cheeses or store bought replacements work in any recipe. Pop into your local health food store and check out the range of vegan cheese––there are many on offer now. You can also make your own vegan cheese. Of course, you can totally eliminate cheese from any recipe, even from pizza and macaroni and cheese, too. Instead, use a creamy, vegan sauce.
Milk/cream: There is virtually an oasis of dairy milk substitutes out on the shelves and in the dairy section of any store you venture into these days. There's really no reason to ever buy and use dairy milk again. The days of soy milk being your only choice for dairy milk substitutes are long gone. Coconut milk, almond milk, rice and other grain milk products can be easily used in place of any milk called for in a recipe.
Oils and fats: Also easily substituted with vegetable oils, margarine and coconut oil.
Meats: The frozen and vegetarian sections of the produce department contain a wide variety of brands that mimic the taste, texture of mouth feel of meat. Nuggets, patties, crumbles, sausages and roasts, to name a few. Dried TVP (textured vegetable protein) and tofu are also great replacements. Beans, nuts, grains and some vegetables can also fill in for meat in many dishes.

, Basically you will need to view your recipes ingredients list and note the items you will need to swap-out, using the guide above. Some measurements you can exchange equally, such as a 1/4 cup honey for 1/4 cup agave or maple syrup. Milk measurements can also be easily swapped, ounce for ounce. Egg substitutes will need to be adjusted depending on the type you are using.


Remember, liquid egg products in the cartons are not vegan. They are derived from real eggs and other natural (and unnatural) ingredients. 

, Once you've adjusted your ingredients, go ahead and cook or bake them according to the method you've always used before, or that is instructed in the recipe you are following. Keep in mind that the final product may not be an exact duplicate of what you are used to making or eating! That's okay, though, because you have made your dish healthier and more importantly, acceptable to a wider range of guests to whom you may be serving.

Roast until tender and golden brown.",How to Roast Parsnips," Set it to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).



 ;
, Rub them under running water to remove dirt. Cut off the root tip and leaves if they are still attached.

, You can skip straight to roasting, but parboiling the parsnips first will help prevent dry or chewy parsnips. To parboil, put whole or halved parsnips in salted, boiling water and cook for 8 minutes or until slightly tender.Rinse with cold water until they stop steaming, then pat dry.


This is more important for mature parsnips more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, which have a woody, fibrous core. If you do not plan on parboiling, cut out the cores from large parsnips and discard them.Parboiling the peel will loosen it and allow you to slide it off by hand. If you did not parboil, leave the peel intact, since the best flavor is right underneath it., Cut the parsnips into 3 inch (7.5 cm) lengths. Cut pieces from the thicker end into quarters and the skinnier end into halves.Alternatively, cut into thick batons for a shorter cooking time.

, Drizzle the parsnips with olive oil or another vegetable oil. Toss well to coat using clean hands, until the parsnips are fully covered with a light layer of oil. If desired, add salt and pepper to taste, plus your favorite combination of savory herbs. Here are a couple ideas:


Rosemary, thyme, and/or crushed garlic.
A sprinkle of coriander and cumin., If you are using raw parsnips, a layer of foil over the pan will help retain moisture and prevent dry, shriveled vegetables. There is no need for foil if you parboiled the parsnips.

, The parsnips are ready when they are browned or lightly caramelized in a few places, but not yet shriveled. This typically takes 45 minutes, or as little as 20 minutes if you parboiled the vegetables first.Check on them early, since cooking time varies with the size of your pieces.


For more even browning, check on the parsnips after 10 or 20 minutes and flip pieces that are sticking to the pan.

, Like potatoes, parsnips tend to have a dry texture that improves when paired with butter, cream, yogurt, or crème fraîche.Optionally, toss with fresh herbs that match your seasonings, such as chopped cilantro to go with coriander and cumin.You can keep the dish warm in an oven on a low setting until the rest of your dinner is prepared., Set it to 400ºF or 200ºC.





, Rinse the parsnips and scrub away surface dirt. Trim both ends and chop into equal sized pieces.


Remove the woody core from large, mature parsnips.

, The honey or maple syrup glaze will stick to the pan during cooking. It's easier to clean this off of a foil tray than a standard metal roasting pan., Mix together roughly 1 part olive oil, 3 parts honey or maple syrup, and a little salt and pepper. (If you prefer exact amounts, measure 1 oz (30 mL) olive oil and 3.5 oz. (80ml) maple syrup or honey for each 2.5 lbs. (1kg) of parsnips.) Pour over the parsnips and toss until they are covered on all sides.


If your honey is cloudy and semi-solid, warm it up until it is runny enough to pour.You can use fake maple syrup, but it may not give the same depth of flavor. Avoid sugar-free substitutes, since you need the sugar to caramelize the parsnips.

, Depending on the size of your pieces, this can take 20 to 40 minutes. Turn the pieces over once during cooking, once they have browned on one side.

Consume enough calories.,
Make sure half of your calories come from carbohydrates.,
Get at least ten percent of calories from proteins.,
Get twenty percent of your calories from fat.,
Consume recovery foods within thirty minutes of exercising.,
Record your meals in a food tracker.",How to Prepare Vegetarian Meals for Athletes1," Athletes need to make sure they’re getting enough calories each day, and this amount will depend on the intensity of athletic training, age of the athlete, and the weight.


For example, college-aged athletes training 5-6 times per week for 30-60 minutes per session should typically consume 16-18 calories per pound of body weight. Athletes training 5-6 times per week for 60-90 minutes per session should consume 19-21 calories per pound of body weight, and those training 5-6 times per week for 90-120 minutes per session should consume 22-24 calories for each pound of body weight.Vegetarians can increase their calorie consumption by eating additional carbohydrates, vegetarian-friendly proteins, and lots of fruits and vegetables each day.;
, Fifty to 65% of the athlete’s total daily calories should come from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are critical for athletes’ performance and health. The body turns energy from carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose is stored in muscles and the liver as glycogen, which is the most readily available source of energy.Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are all good sources of carbohydrates for vegetarians.
Try serving a large serving of brown rice or whole wheat pasta with your meals.
Enjoy a slice of whole grain toast or a bowl of oatmeal at breakfast.

, Proteins should comprise between 10% and 30% of an athlete’s daily caloric intake. The building and repair of muscle tissue, skin, hair, and nails requires proper protein intake. This is especially important for vegetarians. Your body doesn’t use protein as a source of energy while exercising, but proteins help your body maintain a healthy blood sugar level.Tofu, tempeh, seitan, beans, lentils, and other legumes are all good sources of protein for vegetarians.
Try some tempeh bacon and scrambled eggs for breakfast.
Add a tofu salad sandwich or egg salad with crackers to your lunch repertoire.
If the athlete eats dairy, then you can include products like milk, yogurt, or cheese as well.

, Athletes should aim for a diet with between 20% and 30% of calories coming from fat. Fat is important for the absorption of fat soluble vitamins and minerals like vitamin D.Vegetarian-friendly sources of fat include whole milk, cheese, and nuts.
Try avocado toast for breakfast or for a quick snack.
Use olive oil for salad dressings or to sauté vegetables for lunch and dinner.
Grab a handful of walnuts, almonds, or cashews for a convenient snack.

, It’s key that athletes consume recovery foods that include a proper balance of macronutrients. Recovery foods should be eaten right after exercising and then again between one and two hours after exercise. They should include both protein and carbohydrates.Vegetarian-friendly recovery foods include grilled cheese, peanut butter and graham crackers, and fruit with yogurt.

, There are many online websites and apps that help you track how many calories and nutrients you consume each day. They can also record how many calories you are burning. These programs will help you understand your specific nutritional needs and whether you are reaching them.


My Fitness Pal and the USDA's Super Tracker are both good online food logs to use.

Stock up on vegetarian friendly snacks.",How to Prepare Vegetarian Meals for Athletes2," Vegetarian meals for athletes should contain lots of fruits and vegetables. These plant foods will provide the athlete with important vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates. Having fresh, frozen, or dehydrated fruits and vegetables on hand will make preparing a vegetarian meal for an athlete simpler.Include starchy vegetables like potatoes and sweet potatoes as they can be an incredible source of carbohydrate-based fuel for an athlete.

, Making sure your pantry is stocked with whole grains including brown rice, quinoa, bulgur wheat, farro, and whole grain breads will ensure you can pull together a vegetarian meal in a snap. Go for unprocessed and unrefined whole grains and pastas if possible., Athletes need to consume between 10% and 30% of their calories from proteins, and this can be tricky if you don’t have vegetarian sources of protein in your kitchen. Stock up on beans and other legumes, soy based proteins like tofu and tempeh, dairy products, and eggs. These foods will make it easy to prepare nutritionally adequate vegetarian meals for an athlete., It’s important for athletes to have access to snacks, especially after working out or completing an athletic event. Great snack options for athletes that are also vegetarian-friendly include crackers and cheese, almond butter with toast, and carrots and hummus.

Then add two bananas, one cup of frozen pineapple, one cup of frozen mango, and two scoops of a vegetarian-friendly protein powder. This will make two servings., A stir fry is an easy vegetarian meal that can provide adequate amounts of carbohydrates, protein, fats and essential vitamins and minerals. It’s also a quick option after a long run or after-school practice. Try stir frying broccoli, carrots, and tofu together with teriyaki sauce and serving over brown rice. The options for vegetarian-friendly protein, sauce, and vegetable combinations are endless., A great lunch option that is vegetarian-friendly is a veggie burger. You can make your own or, if you are crunched for time, purchase premade burgers in the frozen food section of your local grocery store. Serve on a whole wheat bun with a side of sweet potato fries and a kale salad., Salads provide an awesome opportunity for an athlete to load up on nutrient-dense vegetables and fruits as well as vegetarian-friendly proteins. Start with a base of greens and then add your favorite veggies, fruits, and dressing. Top with a great protein choice like seitan, hard boiled eggs, tofu, or beans. The options are endless.

, A tried and true standby of athletes and vegetarians alike is a classic pasta dish. Pasta will provide the carbohydrates an athlete needs, and adding vegetables and cheese amps up the nutrition. Try spaghetti with tomato sauce, fresh vegetables and parmesan. Or get creative in the kitchen by cooking up some whole wheat penne with lemon, walnuts, and feta., A great vegetarian option for a protein-rich meal before an athletic event or a snack once you’re done working out is a protein shake. There are numerous options out there for vegetarians. Try a formula with whey, rice, or pea protein.

",How to Make Basil Ice Cream," To make this ice cream, you will need your ingredients, a blender, medium saucepan with a lid, spoon, large bowl, strainer, ice cream maker, and a freezer-proof container with a lid.This recipe makes 2 quarts (1.9 L) of ice cream.
The best berries for this recipe are blackberries, blueberries, or strawberries.To make this ice cream in an ice cream maker, you must chill the freezer bucket for 24 hours prior to making the recipe. Wrap the bucket in a plastic bag first to protect it from freezer burn.;
, Set the berries aside and combine the remaining ingredients in the saucepan. Heat the mixture over medium heat, and give it the occasional stir. Remove the pot from the heat when the mixture begins to simmer.


Put the lid on the pot and let it sit for 20 minutes. This will give the basil flavor time to diffuse into the milk., To remove the basil leaves and any other chunky particles, run the mixture through a strainer or cheesecloth and into a large bowl.


When you’ve strained it, press or crush the basil leaves in your hand to remove as much moisture and flavor as possible.

, Pour the ice cream base into the blender, along with the berries and two or three of the basil leaves. Pulse the blender 10 to 20 times.The mixture is ready when the ingredients are combined, there are no chunks of fruit or basil, and the berry color has been evenly distributed throughout the liquid.

, Transfer the mixture back to the bowl and let it chill in the freezer for about 20 minutes before transferring it to the ice cream maker.


You can also chill the mixture in an ice bath for 30 minutes. Transfer the blended mixture to a bowl and set it into a larger bowl filled with ice water., For this ice cream recipe, you'll need a medium saucepan, blender, electric beaters, wooden spoon, candy thermometer, strainer, large bowl, larger bowl filled with ice water, ice cream maker, and a lidded freezer-safe container.


Place the freezer bowl from the ice cream maker into a bag and into the freezer about 24 hours before making your ice cream.

, To get the maximum basil flavor, combine the basil, milk, a pinch of salt, and ¼ cup (56 g) of the sugar in the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally.When the mixture comes to a boil, remove it from the heat, put on the lid, and let the basil diffuse for 30 minutes.

, Transfer the cooled mixture to the blender after 30 minutes. Blend on medium for one minute.


In the bowl, cream the egg yolks and remaining sugar together using the electric beaters. Beat the mixture for about a minute on medium, until it becomes smooth, creamy, pale yellow, and thick.Slowly add the milk mixture from the blender as you continue to beat the mixture. Mix to combine all the ingredients.

, Return the mixture to the saucepan and heat it over medium heat. To prevent the eggs from cooking, stir the mixture constantly, and don’t let it boil. Insert the thermometer into the pot, making sure it doesn’t touch the bottom.


Continue heating and stirring the mixture until it reaches 175 F (79 C). When the mixture is ready, it should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon without falling off., When the mixture reaches the right temperature, remove it from the heat and strain it into the bowl. Place the bowl inside the larger bowl filled with ice water and let it chill for about 20 minutes.


Once the mixture has chilled, it’s ready to go into the ice cream maker.

, When your ice cream mixture has finished chilling and is ready to become ice cream, remove the freezer bucket from the freezer and the bag.Place the bucket onto the ice cream maker base, and insert the paddle into the bucket.

, Turn on the ice cream maker and immediately pour the chilled mixture into the bucket. Put on the lid and let the ice cream maker work its magic!


Read through the manufacturer’s instructions to determine the exact time for your ice cream. Generally, it takes 20 to 30 minutes.The purpose of the ice cream maker is to freeze the ice cream, and the constantly moving paddle prevents ice crystals from forming so that the ice cream stays creamy and delicious.

, After about 20 to 30 minutes, turn off the ice cream maker. Use a spoon to help get all the ice cream out of the bucket. Cover the container with an air-tight lid and put it in the freezer.


If you prefer soft serve ice cream, you can serve it directly from the ice cream maker.Using a freezer-safe container with an air-tight lid will help prevent freezer burn. Don’t store ice cream in the ice cream maker’s freezer bucket, because it doesn’t have a proper lid and won’t prevent freezer burn., Most ice cream will take between four and six hours to reach the right consistency. For a softer ice cream, serve after two to four hours. For a harder ice cream, wait the full six hours or longer.


When serving leftovers, allow the ice cream to sit and soften for a few minutes before serving.,"

Buy bright, firm bok choy for eating raw.,
Trim the bottom stem off.,
Rinse the leaves.,
Chop the leaves to the desired thickness.,
Mix with other greens.,
Top with a vinaigrette.,
Pair with grilled steak.",How to Prepare Bok Choy1," Bok choy is perfectly fine and tender for eating raw, especially with the right pairings in a salad. If you're going to eat raw bok choy, buy them small and brightly colored. Young bok choy is tender and delicious.


Most bok choy is fairly limp, compared to heftier lettuces and other greens, so that's not necessarily a sign of quality. Avoid any especially soft ones, with brownness or other discoloration.;
, Each boy choy will be like a little head of lettuce. To start preparing raw for a salad, trim off the very bottom stem end. This should loosen all the individual leaves and let you examine, clean, and prepare them individually.


Don't discard the tender inside leaves. Those are the best-tasting part of the bok choy. The outside and the greenest parts tend to be somewhat bitter, so make sure to save the inside most of all.

, Sometimes, a little dirt and other sediment can get stuck inside the boy choy, so it's a good idea to rinse them all individually. Place them in a colander and rinse them all together, or run each under the water if you want. You can also use a salad spinner to dry them.

, Depending on the kind of salad you want to make, you can chop the leaves roughly, leave them whole, or chop them very finely, depending on your taste.


Generally, the salad leaves are a bit better if you chop them somewhat finely, helping the dressing mask the bitterness of the greens.
Use about 2-3 heads of medium bok choy for a good salad.

, Bok choy is generally not eaten as a salad by itself, but pairs excellently with other leafy green vegetables. Use a basic mixed-green package or salad mix that you enjoy to add some bok choy to, or pair with any of the following greens:


Bibb lettuce
Butter lettuce
Kale
Swiss chard
Baby spinach
Mint leaves, cilantro, or other fresh herbs

, Bok choy salad goes well tossed with any sort of oil-based dressing that you like. If you want to mix one up yourself, try whisking together the following ingredients until smooth:


Lime juice
Soy sauce
Asian fish sauce
Brown mustard
Minced garlic or shallot
Black pepper

, This salad goes excellently topped with some slices of grilled steak. Grill the steak, then slice it thinly and top the salad, letting the steak wilt the greens gently. Great combination.If you don't eat meat, fried tofu can be used in the same way.

"
"
Trim and rinse the bok choy.,
Grate or mince garlic and ginger.,
Heat some cooking oil in a skillet or wok.,
Stir the bok choy in and toss in the oil for 15 seconds.,
Add a cup of cooking liquid, cover, and cook for one minute.,
Top with sesame oil and salt to taste.",How to Prepare Bok Choy2," To stir fry bok choy, trim off the hard stem ends and separate the individual leaves and rinse them. Dry them thoroughly while you prepare the skillet for stir-frying.

, If you want to add bok choy as part of a stir-fry, you can add it to any basic mix of vegetables and meat. But if you want to feature it as a dish by itself, the best additions are a little garlic and ginger, which help to highlight and lift the flavors of the bok choy.Use about a half-inch piece of ginger and grate it finely. You can also chop it, but grating it helps to break up the fibers and make it more palatable.
Slice two cloves of garlic thinly, or mince it more finely if you don't want big pieces.

, Put your skillet on the heat, on medium-high. Garlic and ginger and burn very quickly, so add it to the skillet right at the beginning and let it heat up gently. When you can smell them, and see the garlic and ginger browning gently, add the bok choy.

, Bok choy will cook very quickly and can become overcooked. Wilt it, get it covered in the fragrant oil, and then add some cooking liquid to get it cooked more thoroughly.


At high temperature, the bok choy leaves should wilt pretty quickly, and might brown and curl at the green edges. That's a good sign.
Make sure the garlic and ginger don't burn, or this dish will taste quite bitter.

, White wine and chicken broth or stock make for excellent cooking liquids for bok choy, adding richness and flavor. Cover the lid immediately and allow the mixture to cook for about a minute.


Add a cup of cooking liquid per pound or so of bok choy leaves you've added.

, Check the leaves for tenderness after about a minute. Cook off extra liquid, if some remains in the skillet. Then serve in a bowl and top with salt, to taste, and a little drizzle of sesame oil. Serve with steamed rice. You could also add other flavors, to taste:


Red pepper flakes
Sesame seeds
Chopped peanut
Sriracha hot sauce
Soy sauce
Hoisin sauce

Communicate details about your food preparation techniques and preferences.,
Share details about your monthly food budget.,
Think about meals that will satiate both a vegan and a carnivore.,
Disclose your feelings about products that utilize animal products.,
Respect carnivore and vegan choices.",How to Live With a Vegan," This ensures that each person feels their choices and habits are respected in the kitchen. Some vegans won't cook food in the same pan that's held an animal product.


Know each person's quirks about mealtimes before living together. Allow enough time and space during mealtimes to avoid confrontation over meal preparation.;
, Often a meat based diet will cost more than a vegan diet, while purchasing specific vegan alternatives to animal products can lead to a more expensive diet.


Avoid heated discussions about food expenditures by creating an understanding that will allow both parties to purchase the foods they enjoy the most. Predetermine who will pay for what products, if income isn't shared.
Consider organic alternatives for more costly products. For example, expensive vegan margarine is nearly identical to conventional margarine except for the added preservatives.

, Instead of preparing 2 separate meals, consider making meals that can incorporate animal products after the basic ingredients are combined. For example, many ethnic dishes use meat as condiments instead of making them the center of the dish.


Reach vegan and carnivore compromises that allow the vegan to cook the main meal first, then incorporate meat into the dish when it's almost finished.

, Many vegans will not purchase skin care items, shampoos and cleaners made with animal-based ingredients. If you will share these items, ensure that both parties agree on what items to buy.


Learn about inexpensive household product alternatives that can work for both carnivore and vegan roommates. Homemade cleaning products made with baking soda or vinegar serve as alternatives to more expensive, commercially-made items.

, Instead of condemning a vegan or carnivore lifestyle, make a conscious choice to support each person's choices.


Meet halfway and decide to accept individual choices to maintain household harmony. This can also broaden each person's world by exposing both parties to new ideas they might not have considered before living together.

Begin your raw food cleanse by fasting for 24 hours.,
Gradually reintroduce specific foods into your diet after you have completed the 24-hour fast.",How to Cleanse With a Raw Food Diet3,"


If you are starting a cleanse on Monday and you eat your dinner the night before on Sunday at 8:00 pm, you will not eat or drink anything other than water until 8:00 pm on Monday.
After you complete your fast, you will be able to reintroduce a variety of foods into your diet.

, You will continue to eat these foods for the length of the cleanse.


Start by introducing fresh, uncooked fruits back into your diet. Fruits are generally easy on the digestive system and by starting with them first after the fast, you are less likely to experience any stomach discomfort. Examples of fruits that are good for cleansing include apples, pears, watermelon, mangoes, bananas, grapes, peaches, plums, coconut and any berries.
After you have introduced fruit, begin adding some fresh, uncooked vegetables to your diet. You can continue to eat fruits, but may want to alternate between fruits and vegetables or eat a combination of the two. Examples of vegetables that have excellent cleansing properties include cucumbers, celery, red beets, cabbage, onions, avocados and dark, leafy greens.

Come up with some responses to common questions that people ask.,
Ask yourself why became a vegan in the first place.,
Don't lose sight of the progress you have made by becoming vegan.,
Know that the majority of people are visual learners, so imagining real-life situations can be a good way to bridge the gap between your lifestyles.,
Know that some people think that all vegans push their beliefs on non-vegans, judge them, and have a ""holier than thou"" attitude.,
Find and interact with other vegans or vegetarians.",How to Explain a Decision to Become a Vegan," Here are some well-tested responses:


If someone has issues pertaining to the amount of protein in a vegan diet, remember that all vegetables and grains contain a full complement of amino acids, which are easier for the body to process than globular animal proteins.If people ask you what eat, say: Vegan food. Falafel pitas, pasta, bean chili, cheese-less pizza, roasted potatoes and other foods. Remind them that not all vegans eat tofu, although a lot of vegans do.
If people ask you about lack of vitamin B12, tell them that while vitamin B12 is most commonly found in eggs, milk and meat, it can also be found in almost all breakfast cereals, soya milk, yogurt, and vitamin tablets. It can also be naturally consumed in fresh organic vegetables that have been through minimal processing. Remember that vitamin B12 only needs to be 're-stocked' in your body once every 30 years.If people ask you if you get enough nutrition, say that with the amount of nutrient-dense food a vegan consumes to maintain their body weight, most vegans get more nutrition than meat-eaters.
If people ask you if you have an eating disorder, remember that unless the answer is yes, the answer is no. Not all food-based decisions are about weight, and make it clear why you became a vegan.;
, Common reasons are health, concern for animal welfare, financial benefits (yes, being a vegan is cheaper than eating animal products if done properly), and to lose weight. Becoming vegan is a tough decision at first, but after a while, it just becomes a habit.

, Think about the animals that would otherwise be dead or in pain, how your organs and arteries are working better,the extra years you will live,the common increase in concentration,and the vegan businesses you have supported. Give yourself credit, and let that happiness cheer you up when people make negative comments.

, You could:


Describe your favorite vegan foods. Also, remind the curious that junk food such as many chips, Oreos, and coke are vegan.
Tell people about how you became vegan. It usually doesn't happen overnight, so tell them about what you went through, and acknowledge that, in time, it becomes easy to stick to regular habits.
If you want to get graphic, you can show people YouTube videos of animal slaughter-houses, dairy farms, and hen-houses. Be aware that this can be very graphic and disturbing. Moreover, it is not something that all vegans think is an appropriate way to explain their veganism, and that's just fine too.

, While you have found something that you believe in and are happy with, understand that all people eat differently, so show them that you're okay with that. If you cannot accept a non-vegan, you cannot expect them to accept you as a vegan. If someone teases you with meat or animal products, just ignore them, or tell them that it's insensitive and that they should be more respectful and considerate. It's also a good idea to talk to people who support you, and to avoid discussing it with those who don't.

, Make a vegan cake with them. Everyone appreciates a free cookie; they're not going to care if it's vegan. Invite them to dinner and show them that vegan food is good, too.

,


Avoid anything made of leather. Non-vegans may forget that the wallet or handbag they are buying has been made from the skin of an animal. Belts, jackets, headbands, or even jewelry that has been strung on a piece of leather are not acceptable for a vegan.
True vegans will not accept products made of wool or silk. Be sure to stop and consider whether the object has been derived from an animal including insects.

Toss together a black bean and corn salad over spinach.",How to Choose Vegan Foods on a Budget," The source of protein is probably the key difference between a vegan or vegetarian diet and those of a more traditional meat-based diet. Luckily, there are plenty of affordable and healthful sources of vegan protein.


Try beans and lentils. These legumes are high in protein, fiber and many minerals. Canned options are affordable, but you might want to consider purchasing dried beans and cooking them yourself for the cheapest option.Nuts and nut butters are another source of protein that also come with the benefit of having some heart-healthy fats. Try to purchase these proteins on sale or purchase them at ""big box stores"" so you can buy larger amounts for a discounted price.
Also try tofu or tempeh. These foods are a great source of protein and even contain probiotics.When you purchase these foods plain, they're fairly low cost and can fit into your budget.;
, Fruits and vegetables are the mainstay of vegan diets. Most of your meals and snacks should revolve around these high-fiber, nutrient-dense foods.Be smart when choosing your produce so you stick to your food budget.


Purchase in season items. If you're going to buy asparagus out of season, you'll pay top dollar for this veggie. Consider printing out a list of what items are in season for winter, summer, spring and fall so you can avoid purchasing something out of season.Skip the pre-washed and pre-cut fruits and vegetables. These are convenient, but you're going to pay extra for the convenience. Buy whole fruits and vegetables that are not prepped in any way. This will be the cheapest option.Also consider frozen or canned fruits and vegetables. These are typically a little bit cheaper than some fresh items and can be stored for much longer periods of time. This is an especially smart tip if you want something out of season.

, Another essential component of a vegan diet are grains. They provide a complementary source of protein and will make your diet more balanced.In general, many grains are fairly inexpensive — even whole grains. Buy the bigger bags instead of individual servings for the most cost effective selection.
Purchase the ""store brand"" or generic whole grains. Store brand products often offer the same item for a lower cost.
Also skip purchasing the pre-made and par-cooked grains you can find both in the grain aisle and in the freezer section. You'll pay a higher price for the convenience of these foods.
Whole grains are the best choice since they are higher in fiber, protein and many minerals. Try to skip the refined processed grains like white rice, white bread or plain pasta.Instead go for: oatmeal, brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread and pastas.

, Purchasing special seasonings for different recipes or dishes can rack up a high tab on your grocery bill. Be smart with what you buy so you don't over do it.


Many dried herbs and spices can be expensive. Although they generally last about 1 year, you can try drying your own herbs yourself for a cheaper option.Purchase fresh herbs and allow them to hang in a dry, cool area. Once completely dried, crush and store in an airtight container.
You can also purchase fresh herbs and chop them into small pieces mix with a little oil and freeze them in an ice cube tray. They'll act like ""fresh"" herbs once you defrost and cook with them.
Items like garlic are also cheaper in their fresh form. Stored in a cool, dark place, garlic can last a good while.Ginger doesn't last as long but can be kept for a significant amount of time in the freezer.Many fresh herbs are easy to grow and do not require much space. Rosemary makes a nice shrub, while basil, thyme, and oregano can easily be grown in a windowsill.

, When you first transition to a vegan diet, you might think it'll be easy to replace your favorite meat and dairy foods with the vegan alternatives in the supermarket; however, these meat and dairy analogs can get quite pricey.Food manufacturers offer many options to vegans and vegetarians to make their diet easier to follow. You can purchase meat-substitute items like: hot dogs and deli meat, cheese, yogurt and sour cream, butter, breakfast sausage, chicken nuggets, chorizo, pepperoni and ground meat.
Although these foods do make following a vegan diet easier, they are also considerably higher in cost. Avoid or significantly limit how much or many of these items you buy.
Instead of relying on these substitutes, make vegan meals based off of whole grains, beans, nuts, fruits and vegetables instead. Try natural meat substitutes such as mushrooms, potatoes, jack fruit, eggplant, and lentils.These are all more cost effective than the trendy alternatives.

, Writing up a meal plan can make any diet a little bit easier to follow and cheaper to buy. When you're trying to plan out and prepare healthy and affordable vegan meals, start with a meal plan.Sit down and write out all the meals and snacks you're planning on eating during the next week. Make sure to include all breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks you're going to have.
Design your meals around low-cost foods like whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Note which items you might want to buy in bulk, which items you might want to buy fresh, and which ones you should purchase frozen or canned.
Try to make your meal plan seasonal. Again, purchasing items that are out of season is more costly. So make your meals for the week reflect this.

, After you've constructed your meal plan, write up a corresponding grocery list. This will also help you stick to a specific food budget while you're shopping.


Studies have shown that those people who shop with a list spend less money and also get in and out of the store a little more quickly.
While you're making your grocery list, check for flyers or advertisements that offer ""two for one"" sales or other discounts.
Also make sure to bring any coupons or other discount flyers with you. Cut these out of the paper ahead of time and bring them with you to check out.

, If you have a local farmer's market, consider getting some of your groceries here each week. It's a fun way to save money and purchase great local items.


Farmers markets are a great idea if you're on a budget as many items you can find here are cheaper than your grocery store.Even if some of the produce is the same price, you get the added benefit of buying local. You can also get to know the farmers and their processes better (you could ask specific questions about which pesticides are used, for instance).
Farmers markets offer you a large variety of foods. Many even offer local baked goods or pre-made vegan foods like soups or entrees.
The foods that are sold at farmers markets are local, seasonal and full of flavor. It's a great place to to explore new items and get inspiration for vegan meals.

, Many grocery stores now offer the option of buying some goods in bulk (from the bulk bins section). This is a great option for those vegans who are minding their food budget.Typical foods you can find in bulk bins include: grains and cereals, nuts, seeds, beans, nut butters and dried fruits.
Make sure you have the space for bulk goods in your kitchen and will be able to use or consume them before they spoil.
Consider prepping and freezing items you've purchased in bulk so they do not spoil before you can use them. You can pull them out whenever you need them.
Consider splitting larger quantities of items with friends or family members if you cannot eat or store larger quantities of certain foods.

, Many pre-made vegan foods are expensive. In addition, eating out can be expensive as well. Stick to making your vegan foods from scratch at home so you can stay within your budget boundaries.


One of the best benefits of making foods at home and from scratch is that you'll save a good amount of money.Skip the restaurant foods and make your own vegan meals at home.
In addition, cooking from home allows you to control all the ingredients in your foods. You can make a low calorie vegan meal, a low sodium vegan meal or a gluten-free vegan meal much easier.

, An easy and affordable vegan meal to make is a stuffed sweet potato. The ingredients are easily found at any grocery store and are very affordable.Bake a medium sweet potato in the oven until it's tender and cooked through. Split it lengthwise and open it like a hot dog bun. You'll put the filling into the center.
Sauté a combination of your favorite vegetables. You can try a mix of onions, garlic, bell peppers and zucchini. Sauté vegetables with a ""taco seasoning"" blend until they are tender, but not mushy. Toss the vegetable mixture with black or pinto beans.
Add about 1/2 – 3/4 cup of the vegetable and bean mixture over your split sweet potato. Top with a little sliced avocado for a quick and easy dish.
An easy way to change up this recipe would be to use a white potato with the skin on. Instead of sautéed vegetables, fill with salsa, olives, and red onions.

, Another super affordable and healthy vegan dish is soup. Basing your soup off of beans is a great way to make a hearty soup for only a few dollars.Sauté onions, garlic and chopped carrots in a large soup pot. Cook until vegetables are lightly golden and tender.
Add equal parts of white beans and vegetable stock. Bring to a boil and allow to cook for 30 – 45 minutes.
Add in a few large handfuls of roughly chopped kale to the soup. Continue to cook until the kale is wilted into the soup. Serve with a slice of whole wheat bread.
You could also make a vegetable soup using all of your unused veggies for the week. Sauté some garlic and onion, then chop up vegetables and add them to the pot. Once soft, add a vegetable broth and simmer.

, If you're in the mood for pizza, skip the delivery and make your own vegan pizza at home. This will help you save some money and make a healthier meal.


Skip the store-bought pizza dough — this can be a little expensive. Try using a whole wheat tortilla or pita bread instead. Or, find your local pizzeria and ask if they'll sell their dough. Many times they'll give you a good deal on it.
Roll out your pizza dough or set out your tortilla/pita bread on a sheet pan or cookie sheet.
Top your pizza with a little bit of homemade hummus. Spread the hummus in a thin layer until it's about a 1/2 inch from the edges.
Layer on thinly sliced vegetables. You can do any combination you like. Try onions, peppers, mushrooms and olives.
Bake pizza until the dough is light browned and crispy or the tortilla/pita bread is slightly golden. Drizzle with some extra virgin olive oil and serve.
Or, use tomato sauce and top with sliced veggies and pine nuts.

, Another great quick and cheap vegan meal is a salad. Make your salads a little more flavorful and exciting by tossing your greens with a Mexican-inspired black bean salad.In a small bowl, mix together 1 cup of black beans, 1 cup corn kernels, 1/2 cup of diced red onions, one diced jalapeño and a few halved or quartered cherry tomatoes.
Mix the black bean and corn salad with a little canola oil, lime juice, salt and pepper. Toss to combine.
Layer a handful or two of spinach leaves on your plate. Top with about 1/2 cup of black bean salad. You can also top with a little sliced avocado for an extra source of healthy fats.
Another modification is to top your salad with white beans and lightly sautéed walnuts for an extra crunch.

, Japanese macrobiotics emphasizes the principle of balance between YIN and YANG. Foods that have yin and yang in balance should be used regularly. Whole grains and whole-grain products such as: brown rice, barley, millet, oats, quinoa, spelt, rye, a variety of cooked and raw vegetables, beans, mild natural seasonings, nuts and seeds are recommended. Foods that are too Yin or too Yang should be avoided. Yin Food Items that should be avoided are: Sugar, Alcohol, Coffee, White flour products, Very hot spices, Drugs, Any additives and preservatives, Milk Products. Foods that are too YANG should also be avoided, they are too heavy, and create stagnation. These are: meat, eggs, refined salt.

, Add nuts and seeds to your vegetarian meals. Most plant foods are not complete proteins, they only have some of the amino acids. Consuming various sources of amino acids throughout your meals provide you with all the protein you need. Soy and quinoa are complete vegetable proteins. Some good sources of protein are: beans, peas and lentils, pumpkin seeds, nuts and other various seeds. A great source of proteins are whole grains.


Sesame seeds beneficial effects are great. It is one of the cholesterol lowering foods. They are naturally rich source of fiber, minerals and healthy fats. Sesame seeds contain minerals important in anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant processes within our cells.
Flaxseeds or linseed. Great seeds to add to your miracle seeds mixture. They help the body detox. Ground flaxseeds (linseed) are a wonderful source of fibre and a great source of omega 3 oils.

To help our digestion, we should regularly absorb good bacteria (probiotics) – natural yogurt, and we should soak, and sprout our food (especially our seeds and our grains). Leave your seeds soaking over-night and use them in cooking the day after.

, When you eat raw, all foods are alive. Heating food over 42 C destroys much of the nutrients within your food.

Try to mix things up: consider cooking vegetables in a sauté or stir-fry in order to add some zing to your recipe and make the vegetables taste more appealing.

,
Experiment using different kinds of sauces.,

Cook veggies on the barbecue.",How to Make Veggies Taste Good," You can also look online on social networking sites like Facebook or Pinterest; many people like to post healthy recipes there as well. Even if you don't end up making the dishes you discover, recipes can still help you come up with new ideas to improve your cooking.;
,, Though many people immediately think of teriyaki sauce or common combinations like cauliflower and cheese, you can also cook vegetables with soy sauce, Worcester sauce, and countless other tangy sauces. If you can't think of anything or are bored with your current palette, go to the store and just grab a random sauce off the shelf- surprise yourself with new exotic flavors!

, Many people also love to add nuts such as almonds or peanuts into their veggie stir-fries or stews. These not only can add more flavor to your meals but are also great for your body and skin. Your dishes will taste good and make you feel good.

, Spices can help mask the taste of certain unappealing vegetables and can also introduce you to brand new flavors and experiences. Even if you're simply boiling some broccoli, adding a little bit of Cuban spice can really deepen your palette. Chilli peps up lots of vegetables, especially tomatoes, peppers, (which are really fruits, obviously), and any vegetables enjoyed in a stir fry or curry.

, You can make a pasta dish with asparagus tips, try a new take on avocado, make some roasted pumpkin desserts or invent a new Australian-inspired vegetable dip: there are infinite possibilities! Try researching foreign vegetables and taking a trip to your local fresh food market to discover new tastes.

, Over done or undone vegetables are not nice. Whilst not everyone agrees on exactly how all vegetables should be cooked, experiment with the vegetables you may have tried before and not enjoyed to perfect your cooking techniques. Asparagus, brussel sprouts, aubergine and cabbage, amongst others, are all disliked by many people because they haven't eaten them cooked properly. Try cooking your veggies following a recipe, or through your own experience, and tasting them just before you think they're done. Still don't like it? Cook on and try again just when you think they should be ready. Still don't like it? Try cooking for half as long again from when they are undercooked. If you don't like it then, you probably don't like that veggie, at least not cooked that way.

, Just because you don't find a particular vegetable tasty boiled, doesn't mean you wouldn't enjoy it fried, or mashed. Almost all root vegetables can be fried. Beetroot crisps or 'chips' in the U.S., lightly seasoned with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper are a tasty alternative to potato-chips or crisps. Make chips, or 'fries' as they are known in the U.S. from parsnips - these are a great accompaniment to a quiche, ratatouille or bean casserole. Turnips and swede, boiled and mashed together with butter, cream and seasoning is great with a nut roast, or any other type of roast for that matter.

, Pretty much any veggie can be made tastier by coating it in batter and frying it. If you want a healthier alternative, grate or finely slice your chosen veggie, combine with a little egg (find a vegan as alternative if possible) and flour, mould into patties and bake or fry. Sweet Potato, broccoli, carrots and courgettes can all make tasty fritters., If you want to make veggies tastier and are not a vegetarian or vegan, meat is the obvious choice. Try leeks, pan fried with bacon, pea and ham soup or fried potatoes, tomatoes and chorizo. If you like your protein meat free, try brussel sprouts with chestnuts, green beans stir fried with cashew nuts or grated carrots as a salad dressed with orange juice and olive oil dressing sprinkled with sesame seeds or black poppy seeds., Simple vegetable kebabs, with or without a grill friendly cheese such as Haloumi, are enjoyable and easy to make and great to eat. Mushrooms, courgettes, tomatoes and aubergine all lend themselves to being sliced thickly, threaded onto a skewers then grilled till tender."

",How to Make Vegetarian Wraps," If you wish to have your wrap hot, such as containing hot fried onions, tofu, mushrooms and / or fried egg (etc) and have melted cheese, add the cheese on top of the fried filling (such as mushrooms) and grill / broil briefly until the cheese melts to your taste.;
, For the breads, little need to be done for these unless you wish to have them hot, in which case you can warm a non stick pan and lightly toast the bread on each side until heated through. You may also cook the bread directly over an open flame, however this is a high speed method and safety precautions must be taken.  


Alternatives, such as cabbage leaves may be blanched in boiling water and cooled and rice paper needs soaking in cool water for a few minutes until it is tender enough to be wrapped.
Some thick wraps or large tortillas may also be filled and then briefly grilled, heated in a panini press or baked lightly to to give a warm, crisp outside and a cold filling inside.

, You may spread the bread with the sauce to get an even coating, (suitable for mustard, mayonnaise & cream cheese dip type of sauces), otherwise you can add them on top of the fillings.

, There is a wide range of methods and styles to do this, depending on the shape of the bread (round or square), as well as presentation style. Ideally, avoid overfilling your wraps if you want the filling to stay crisp (such as lettuce), as the rolling method will compress the fillings. Some methods are as follows:


Visually divide the wrap in half and place the fillings in the top half.  Fold the lower half up over the filled half, then fold the sides in. This is suitable for smaller, or less flexible wraps.
Place your filling onto the wrap, leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the side free. Fold this inch over (this will end up as the base), then roll the wrap up starting from the side nearest you towards the size furthest away.
Place your filling evenly across the middle and simply roll up the wrap like a carpet. This method is suitable for very thin breads and for slicing into mini wraps or party snacks (ideally pin them with a toothpick).

,  Hot & cold wraps may be served with any additional salad, hot sauce or cold salsa, dressing or dipping sauces you desire to make a complete meal.

Store leftover tots in the refrigerator.",How to Make Veggie Tots," You can make veggie tots with a variety of different vegetables including, sweet potato, cauliflower, broccoli, and zucchini. Once you have selected the vegetable you would like to use, blanch it in a pot of boiling water for one minute., After the vegetable has been blanched, you need to chop it up into small pieces. The easiest way to do this is by grating the vegetable using a coarse cheese grater. If you do not have a coarse cheese grater, you could thinly chop the vegetables by hand, using a sharp knife and cutting board.Alternatively, you could use a food processor to cut the veggies. Use the pulse setting and only do a few pulses.
If you decide to use a food processor, be careful not to puree the vegetables. You want them to be coarsely chopped., Transfer the grated vegetables to a medium bowl. Then add ¼ teaspoon of salt to the veggies and mix well. The salt will help to remove any moisture from the grated vegetables., Once the salt has been added to the vegetables, let them sit for anywhere from 10-20 minutes., Then, remove the veggies from the bowl and place them in a clean dish towel or cheesecloth. Twist the cloth to completely drain any excess water. By removing all of the liquid from the vegetables, you will be able to make crispier veggie tots., Transfer the vegetable back to the medium bowl and then add ⅓ of a cup (237 ml) of panko crusted bread crumbs, ⅓ of a cup (237 ml) of minced parsley, 2 cloves of minced garlic, ¼ teaspoon of onion powder, 1 egg, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix together all of the ingredients.You can also add ½ a cup (118 ml) of your favourite cheese (i.e. parmesan, sharp cheddar, jalapeno cheddar etc.).
Experiment with different seasoning and flavour. For example, you could also add green onions, or carrots to give more flavour to the tots., It is very important that you line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the veggie tots from sticking to the baking sheet while they are cooking. Alternatively, you could grease the baking sheet with a thin layer of oil., Scoop out approximately 1 ½ tablespoons of mix and then use your hands shape the mixture into small cylinders. The easiest way to shape the tots is to create a tight ball and then press the sides to shape it into a tot.Place the tots onto the lined baking sheet.

, Prior to baking the veggie tots, you will need to preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). This can be done before you begin forming the veggie tots. That way the oven will be preheated by the time you are ready to put the tots in the oven., You want the veggie tots to be crispy and golden brown in colour. In order to reach the desired crispness, bake them for approximately 20-25 minutes., Once the tots have been in the oven for approximately 10-12 minutes, remove them from the oven. Flip over the tots using a spatula. This way you will ensure that all sides of the tots are cooked evenly., After 20 minutes you should check on the tots to see if they need a bit more time. When they are the desired crispiness, remove them from the oven. You should serve the tots immediately because they taste best when they are warm., For example, you could dip them in ketchup, ranch dressing, barbecue sauce, chipotle mayo, etc.

You could also serve them on a plate with melted cheese and bacon bits on top!

, If you do not finish all of the veggie tots at once, you can store them for a few days in the refrigerator. Store them in a single layer and make sure they are well-covered.Reheat the tots in the oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (400 degrees Celsius). Heat them for 5-10 minutes, or until they are warm.

Get your vitamin B12.,
Seek out foods rich in iron.,
Eat protein-hearty foods.,
Eat plenty of calcium.,
Incorporate foods with omega-3 fatty acids.,
Eat salt and seaweed for the iodine.,
Eat foods with zinc.",How to Be a Healthy Vegan1," B12 promotes healthy functioning of the brain and nervous system, and is an essential vitamin for any healthy person. The recommended daily intake for adults is 2.4 micrograms. However, B12 only naturally occurs in animal foods. Since B12 is not found in plant-based foods, vegans need to find ways to supplement their diet with foods that have been fortified with B12. Look for the following:


Breakfast cereals or oatmeal that have been fortified with vitamin B12. Check the labeling to make sure eating the cereal will give you the recommended daily intake.
Soy milk is also often fortified with B12.
B12 supplements are popular among vegans. Since B12 is the only vitamin you can’t get by eating plants, it might be worth adding this supplement to your daily routine.;
, This mineral aids in healthy oxygen circulation, and it’s most commonly found in red meat and fish. However, iron also occurs naturally in a number of different foods. When you eat iron-rich foods, eat vitamin C at the same time; it helps the body absorb iron more effectively. It is recommended that adults get 8 mg of iron per day.Here’s where to find it:


Dried fruits
Legumes
Seeds
Leafy green vegetables
Whole grains

, Protein contributes to the growth of muscle, hair, nails, and other very important systems in the body. Adults need 46 to 56 grams per day to stay healthy.There are plenty of plant-based protein sources, and these should make up a significant portion of your diet as a vegan. Here’s what to eat:


Black beans, kidney beans, chickpeas, pinto beans, lima beans, etc.
Whole grains
Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and other seeds
All nuts
Soy products

, It builds strong bones and teeth, and this essential mineral is most often associated with cow’s milk. However, you can get the calcium you need (1,000 mg daily, for adults) by eating the following fruits and vegetables:


Dark, leafy greens like kale and collards
Almonds
Fortified cereals, soy milk, or bread
Citrus fruits like oranges and lemons

, This healthy type of fat is essential for a range of functions in the body, both internal and external. It’s also beneficial for keeping your mood stable and your mind healthy. Adults need 12 to 17 grams per day, and you can get them from the following plant sources:


Flaxseed
Walnuts
Canola oil

Eat healthy, small meals often.",How to Be a Pregnant Vegan," These are some of the best plant sources to make sure your baby gets enough protein. Since most women get their protein from animal sources, it's imperative you find a replacement in these foods. Here are some ideas:


Seeds such as chia, hemp, sunflower, sesame seeds and flaxseeds
Nuts such as almonds, walnuts, pine nuts and Brazil nuts
Beans such as lentils, cannellini or white beans, black eye peas, kidney beans, mung beans, lima beans, and black beans.

Seeds and nuts not only provide the essential proteins but also provide fats that include omega-3.

;
, Whole grains such as millet, amaranth, oats, brown rice, and barley, and vegetables such as corn, artichokes, green peas, mushrooms, avocados, and potatoes are some good plant proteins. Nuts and beans can become monotonous, so mix it up with some healthier grains.


You can combine grains with legumes to obtain all the 9 essential amino acids in one meal. Good examples are corn and beans or any beans with rice.
You can also have 364 grams (12.8 oz) of pinto nuts and 12 grams of Brazil nuts to get all the 9 amino acids in one meal.

, Soy products are also a good source of protein; this includes soybeans, tofu, soy milk, and soy chips amongst other soy products. What's more, soy is a tasty alternative to meat that not only offers protein but makes your diet feel richer and more fulfilling. Meals that you thought were off-limits can easily be included in your diet with soy products.


1-1/2 cups of tofu (or lentils) and 3-1/2 cups of soy milk can directly add 25 grams (0.88 oz) of protein to your diet. Try a glass of soy milk in the morning and at night to get closer to this goal.

, Proteins are necessary for your baby's muscle building and weight gain. You need to have a total of 70 grams (2.5 oz) of protein daily. A woman who isn't pregnant needs 45 grams (1.6 oz); you require 25 extra grams of protein in addition to your daily protein intake.This is especially important in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.Protein is important in building the immunity of the baby. Pregnant vegan mothers are encouraged to watch out for symptoms of decreased protein levels by paying attention to general weakness, muscle cramping, and swelling of the hands and feet.
Although animal sources such as poultry, meat, seafood, and eggs contain all the nine amino acids and are complete proteins, you, as a vegan, can increase your portions of plants (aka incomplete proteins) to compensate for the absence of complete proteins.

, The green leafy kind – like spinach, kale, collard greens, chard, and lettuce – are best. Broccoli, asparagus, turnip greens, lentils, and kidney beans can fulfill your folate requirements to some extent, too.


Beans and pumpkin seeds are good sources of iron as well. Try to mix up your sources so you get a variety of other nutrients, too. Having a wide variety of vegetables, nuts, and beans in your diet will ensure that you're on the right track.

, Whole meal bread and dried fruit, like apricots and raisins, are also good for iron. Fenugreek, oatmeal, dates, and fruits such as bananas, apples, and pomegranates are rich in non heme iron and folates, too.


Make sure you have cereals, fruit juices, pastas, and breads fortified with iron, folic acid, and folates. Many products now come fortified with iron, often for this purpose.

, The pregnant vegan may need to take supplements to help meet the daily requirements of iron in the body. Supplements are usually taken after the first twenty weeks of pregnancy. However, you should be advised by your obstetrician or a nutritionist before taking any supplements.


Dietary iron comes in two varieties: heme and non heme. Heme is easier to absorb but it is found only in animal sources. However, you can increase your intake of non heme iron through plant sources and/or through a supplement to compensate for a lack of heme iron.

, Folates play a crucial role in fetal development; in fact folate deficiency can lead to neural tube defect and incomplete development of the fetal spine. Folates are present in some of the foods listed above, but a supplement may also be wise.


A daily folate supplement containing 400 micrograms of folate is recommended as soon as you start planning your pregnancy and should be continued through the 1st trimester.
Your doctor will likely suggest a multi-vitamin and multi-mineral supplement containing 18 mg of iron, along with vitamin B12 and folates in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Ferrous, ferrous sulfate, ferrous citrate, ferric gluconate, and ferric sulfate are the types of iron frequently used in these supplements.

, You require 45 mg of iron daily to compensate for increased blood volume and the baby’s requirements. Ideally, your hemoglobin should be above 11grams/dl.


The need of iron in the body is higher in pregnancy than normal because of the blood formation that is taking place in the baby and the increase in blood volume for the mother. Blood helps in the transport of the important nutrients that are needed by the body and therefore more of the blood is required to transport the nutrients while one is pregnant.
A vegan pregnant woman should watch out for signs of reduced blood in the body. This includes pale eyes, hands, having shortness of breath and getting tired easily. This is because iron helps in transformation of oxygen to the vital organs and therefore when it is reduced, the mother will have problems breathing.

, The sources of calcium for a pregnant vegan include white and brown bread, rice, oat drinks, dried fruit like apricots and figs, and nuts. As for your vegetables, add more collard greens, kale, butternut squash, broccoli, navy beans, and soya beans to your diet.


Fortified juices like orange juice can offer an equal amount of calcium like dairy products. However, stick to fresh, unsweetened juices to avoid spiking your blood sugar too high.

, Your healthcare provider may also prescribe an oral calcium supplement for you to take. The recommended calcium supplementation for women whose diets lack milk and milk products during pregnancy is 500-1000 mg through oral calcium tablets., Go out for a walk or just sit and enjoy the sunlight during the early morning or late evening to gain enough Vitamin D.


Otherwise, you'll need a supplement. Vegans should read the label carefully to ensure that the supplement does not contain any animal products. The recommended dose of vitamin D that should be taken is 15 micrograms of supplemental or dietary vitamin D.However, it is advisable to talk to your dietician, obstetrician or a midwife before taking supplements while one is pregnant because some of them can cause harm to the baby.

, Calcium and vitamin D are necessary to facilitate development of your baby’s teeth and bones. You require at least 1000 mg of calcium during pregnancy.Although some animal sources such as milk and milk products are important sources of calcium, and most doctors insist on having them during pregnancy, you could gain similar amounts of calcium by having at least 8 portions of calcium rich foods daily.
Animal sources of protein are more likely to cause calcium loss from the bones. Thus, being a vegan you have a lower chance of losing calcium due to animal protein intake.A vegan pregnant mother is encouraged to watch out for the symptoms of reduced vitamin D in the body that include muscle pains, general fatigue and back pains.

, A pregnant woman should have 2.6 micrograms of vitamin B12 per day.The downside of vitamin B12 is that it is present only in animal foods. As a result, most vegetarians are deficient in this important nutrient. You can still get enough of it through supplements and fortified foods.


Possible sources of this vitamin include soya drinks and fortified cereals that are used for breakfast like cornflakes.
Vitamin B12 is important in the body because it works together with folic acid in helping with the fetal development and helping in the formation of red blood cells because there is increased requirement of blood for the baby and the mother.
The mother is encouraged to watch out for signs of decreased vitamin B12 such as pale skin, bleeding gums and weakness.

, DHA is essential for normal development of your baby’s brain and vision. These hormones are extremely important for fetal growth. Although the chief sources of DHA (and iodine) is seafood you can use supplements to add them to your vegan diet.


DHA is present in plant foods such as flaxseeds, walnuts, almonds, canola oil, and soya beans.
Vegan DHA supplements prepared from microalgae are also available in health food stores.
Additionally, most folate supplements come enriched with DHA these days. You can opt for such supplements to make sure you get enough DHA.

, Iodine is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism in you and the baby. This can also lead to fetal abnormalities or disabilities. Again, the chief source is seafood, but you can get it through seasonings and supplements, too.


Make sure you have iodized salt for seasonings and cooking to avoid iodine deficiency. However, the recommended salt intake is 2300 mg – which is only one teaspoon! Too much and it could increase your blood pressure. Don't go overboard.

, Pregnant vegans are advised to avoid drinking coffee and tea with meals. This is because these drinks contain polyphenols and tannins that reduce the ability of the body to absorb irons from the vegetables that are eaten.


And, quite obviously, avoid alcohol. When you're pregnant (and even when you're not!), water, soy milk, and unsweetened juices are best.

, Make sure you have enough vitamin C enriched foods in your diet such as citrus foods, lemons, and tomatoes. Vitamin C facilitates the absorption of iron in your bowels, making your baby healthier and you happier.


Juiced vegetables like broccoli and juiced fruits like orange are great, too. Since you're not drinking coffee or tea in the mornings, try juicing some citrus fruits or vegetables to start off your day right.

, On average, you need to gain around 25 to 30 pounds during pregnancy so that your baby weighs and grows adequately. Here's a sample menu of how to ensure that you and your baby are as healthy as possible:



Breakfast:
One slice of whole bread spread with margarine and a whole fruit.
Half a cup of oatmeal mixed with maple syrup
I cup of soymilk and half a cup of vitamin D and calcium fortified orange juice

Lunch:
Vegetable burger with ¾ tsp of mustard and ketchup
One cup of steamed collard greens mixed with one cup of soymilk

Dinner:
¾ cup of fried tofu with 1 cup of vegetables
1 cup of brown rice
Half an orange
A banana, 1/2 cup of blueberries, 1 cup of soymilk, half a glass of apple juice, or whole grain crackers with 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml) of peanut butter may be had as a snack between meals.

Talk with a nutritionist.,
Eat a balance of protein, carbohydrates and fats.,
Fill up on healthy food.,
Avoid eating processed “vegan” foods.,
Have plenty of healthy snacks on hand.,
Get a vegan cookbook and learn how to cook tasty meals.",How to Be a Healthy Vegan2," If you’re making a serious switch to a vegan diet, it’s a good idea to get advice from a professional. He or she will be able to tell you how to best meet your unique needs as well as giving you resources to help you choose the right foods.


Kids, women who are pregnant, and elderly people all have slightly different nutritional needs than the average adult, so it’s especially important for people in these groups to talk to a nutritionist.

, Meat-eaters have it a little easier: they choose a meat, a vegetable and a starch, and that’s that. As a vegan it’s important to make sure your meals are balanced according to the new food pyramid issued by the US Department of Agriculture. Aim to get the following each day:6 oz. grains (half of these should be whole grains, like brown rice, quinoa, or whole wheat)
2.5 cups vegetables (eat a variety, not just one or two types)
2 cups fruit (choose whole, fresh fruit instead of juice whenever possible)
5.5 oz. beans and other protein sources
Healthy fats (olive oil, grapeseed oil, nut oils etc)

, Some Vegans feel hungry after eating the same amount of food as meat-eaters. Meat and dairy are very filling, and vegans need to eat larger portions of vegetables, legumes, and fats to feel satisfied. As long as you’re filling up on healthy food, it’s fine to eat more than one helping and stop your stomach from rumbling. Pears are very filling. Try a pear if you are a hungry Vegan.


To make vegetables more filling, add olive oil, nuts, dried fruit, seeds, and other goodies. Eating just plain vegetables won’t feel as satisfying.
Use plenty of spices to make your food taste just as rich and nuanced as any meat-eater’s meal.

, Did you know oreos are vegan? Hundreds of snack foods and candies you might normally pass up will look extra tasty when you’re feeling hungry, but try to resist the urge to eat loads of sugar and processed carbohydrates. These foods are devoid of nutrition; they might fill you up temporarily, but they won’t give you the nutrients you need to stay healthy.


Processed soy products aren’t necessarily healthy for you, even if they’re made with tofu. It’s fine to have “tofurkey,” seitan, and other soy products every once in a while, but these should not be staples in your diet. The same goes for faux dairy products like soy cheese and ice cream.

, Some Vegans like to graze, since they tend to get hungry more often than meat-eaters. Have plenty of healthy snacks and smaller meals on hand so you don’t get to the point where you’re ravenous (which will make you more likely to wolf down a whole bag of gummy worms or three bowls of cereal with almond milk). Here are some great vegan snacks that you can gobble down without guilt:


Nuts of any kind. Try roasting your favorite nuts in the oven with olive oil and spices. If you have a sweet tooth, use maple syrup and cinnamon.
Whole grain crackers topped with hummus.
Carrot sticks and other cut vegetables with hummus.
Bean and rice cakes with salsa.
Baked sweet potatoes topped with coconut oil and sea salt.
Dark chocolate and peanut butter.
Banana ice cream (blend a banana and run it through your ice cream machine; you will be amazed by how delicious it turns out).

, As a vegan, you’re going to have to fend for yourself more often than not. Unless you live in a town with lots of great options for vegans (lucky you!) you’ll probably have to do a lot of your own cooking to ensure your meals are balanced and healthy. There are loads of vegan cookbooks available, so pick one up and start bookmarking dishes to try out.


Look for vegan blogs, too. You’ll find recipes as well as hosts of commenters who will offer more suggestions.
Health food stores and vegan/vegetarian restaurants are also great spots for inspiration.

"
"
Find the vegan-friendly spots where you live.,
Check out the side dishes.,

Eat before you go to parties.",How to Be a Healthy Vegan3," Maybe you don’t have a vegan-dedicated restaurant in your town, but there are probably some places with menu items that are vegan. Before you go out, have a few places in mind where you know you’ll be able to get a healthy meal and enjoy yourself.


Steakhouses, barbecue joints and fried chicken spots are probably out. If your friends insist on going to one, you could always order a heap of fries and ketchup and call it a day.
Many restaurants that offer cuisines from outside the US have vegan menu items. Try checking some menus out online, then up the restaurants beforehand to double check that dishes are vegan.

, If you’re seated at a restaurant and weren’t able to vet the place beforehand, side dishes are often the best bet. Unless you’re at a place where everything on the menu is made with bacon or ham drippings, you’ll probably find some tasty items that don’t have any animal products.


If you decide to order vegetables, be sure to request that they be cooked in oil instead of butter.
Look for tasty beans, peas, or other legumes and rice. These items aren’t often cooked with animal products.

, If you’re at a restaurant with tasty salads, you’re in luck. See if you can customize a salad to include extra vegetables, beans, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and any other toppings they have that are vegan. Order it with oil and lemon juice or vinegar, since most dressings on offer probably contain an animal product or two.

, You might feel shy asking for favors at first, but as a vegan it definitely helps to speak up. You deserve to be able to eat a healthy, delicious meal, and most restaurant owners strive to be accommodating.


Explain that you don’t eat meat, milk or eggs, and ask if there’s something they can prepare for you without any animal products.
For example, they could give you plain pasta with garlic, olive oil and veggies, beans with veggies, rice and beans, and so on.

, Even if the host of a party knows you’re vegan, he or she might try to serve you something with eggs, milk or even fish, not quite understanding that vegans don’t eat any animal products. Hopefully your well-meaning host will have something on hand you can eat, but just in case, you should eat before you go.

Saute until they turn translucent (about five minutes). Stir in the rice, adding more oil as needed to coat them. Cook for another minute., Grate the tomatoes into a pulp, either directly over the skillet or in a small mixing bowl. Stir the pulp into the rice and onions. Next, stir in the parsley, dill, and mint, followed by the chickpeas., Reserve one of your lemons for later. Zest and juice the other into the mixture. Once that’s done, add salt and pepper to taste., Pour the vegetable stock into the mixture and stir the mixture so it’s evenly distributed in the stock. Then cover the skillet and cook for roughly ten minutes, or until the liquid has reduced. Once it has, taste for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if desired., While the mixture cools off, set up your assembly line for filling your grape leaves. Place a cutting board, parchment paper, or something similar in between the skillet and a large pot. Then line the bottom of the pot with any leaves that are too torn up to use, plus a few lemon slices from your second lemon, to keep the leaves from burning while cooking.If you don’t have enough leaves or lemon slices to cover the whole bottom, slice up a couple of medium-sized potatoes and cover them the bottom with those instead., Wait for the mixture to cool enough to handle safely with your fingers. Then, for each leaf, remove the stem and place the leaf before you, with its glossier side facing down. Top the bottom of the leaf with roughly a teaspoon of the mixture.Err on the side of too little filling than too much, because the rice will continue to expand when you cook it in the pot.

, Roll from the bottom up until you reach midway up the leaf. Fold the sides in so the filling doesn’t spill out. Continue rolling all the way up to the top, tucking the sides in as needed to keep them closed., As you finish rolling each leaf, place it in the pot with the open seam facing down. This way the weight of the leaves will keep the seam from unrolling. Fit as many leaves as you can along the pot’s bottom. Then start a second layer of leaves on top of the first.Packing them into the pot as tightly as possible will also keep them from unrolling. So, if you don’t have enough leaves to make a full top layer, continue placing them right next to each other, rather than spread them apart., Place a plate on top of the leaves to keep the leaves in place. Pour enough water in to cover all your leaves. Then continue adding water until there’s an extra couple inches (5 cm) between the top layer and the waterline.If you’re really worried about the leaves unrolling, you can place an additional food-safe weight on top of the plate.

, Put the pot on a burner and set the heat to low. Simmer uncovered for about 45 minutes. Then use a pair of tongs to remove the plate and then one leaf. Take a test bite to make sure the rice has cooked. If not, return it to the pot for a few more minutes, then repeat., Remove the leaves with tongs and place them in a colander so the excess water can drain. Let them cool to room-temperature, or chill them in the fridge if you like them cold. Serve as is, or pair them with lemon slices and/or plain yogurt for dipping.Seal leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate them. They should last a couple days.

, This recipe will give you basic vanilla-coconut flavored ice cream. You can add some extra ingredients to enhance the flavor of your ice cream, however. Here are some idea to get you started:


If you want chocolate ice cream, increase the sweetener to ⅔ cup (135 grams) and add ¾ cup (75 grams) of cocoa powder.For mint chocolate chip ice cream: use ½ teaspoon of mint extract instead of vanilla extract, and ½ cup (65 grams) of powdered sugar instead of your usual sweetener. If you want the ice cream to be green, add 2 drops of green gel food coloring.If you want to make strawberry ice cream, purée 2½ to 3 cups (500 to 600 grams) of sliced, frozen strawberries, then add the rest of the ingredients. You may want to decrease the sweetener to ⅓ cup (65 grams) and the vanilla extract to ¼ teaspoon., This should only take 1 to 2 minutes. From time to time, you may have to pause the blender/food processor, and scrape any lumps or clumps down the sides and towards the bottom.

, Follow the instructions that came with your ice cream maker, as each one will be a little different. It will take about 20 minutes for the ice cream to freeze.


If you don't have an ice cream maker: pour the mixture into a metal loaf pan and stir in your extras. Put it into the freezer, and cover it with a sheet of wax paper. Stir it every 30 to 60 minutes with a whisk. It will take about 6 hours for the ice cream to freeze., At this point, your ice cream is done and ready for freezing. You can, however, step it up by adding in ¼ to ½ cup (50 to 100 grams) of extras, such as chopped nuts, sprinkles, or chocolate chips. Be sure to match your extras to the base flavor!


If you are making mint chocolate chip ice cream, you might want to stir in ¼ cup (45 grams) of chocolate chips (dark chocolate or vegan).If you are making strawberry ice cream, you might want to stir in ¼ cup (50 grams) of chopped, frozen strawberries.

, If the container does not have a lid, press a piece of wax paper over the ice cream's surface. This will prevent ice crystals from forming."

Prepare the first meal.,
Find out how strict your vegan is.,
Proceed with purchasing and cooking food for your vegan, after answering all of the questions above and below.,
Discover a few different breakfast options.,
Have a few lunch and dinner options on hand.,
Make dessert.,
Remember that few vegans are alike in their food tastes.",How to Feed a Vegan for Three Days or More," You'll need to ask the vegan a bunch of questions outlined in the next step, but your guest might get hungry before you get a chance to do so. In that case, a great first meal option is spaghetti. You can get vegan noodles (easy, just check the package to make sure there aren’t egg whites or dairy in them). Check your tomato sauce to make sure that there isn’t Parmesan or other cheese in it. Mushrooms are a great vegan sauce addition; like your meaty meatballs, they can be cooked separately and added to the food at the end. One fun processed food product is vegan Parmesan cheese in a shake can. It is a fun addition to the table as a condiment for vegans. Make your own garlic bread with fresh garlic- instead of butter, use olive oil or vegan margarine (check for whey on the label; there are a lot of vegan-friendly margarine brand names) to mix and spread the garlic and salt. Get a simple sourdough or French bread; check the label for dairy or eggs. Steamed vegetables make a healthy side dish (use olive oil, don't use butter). This is a simple meal, and over dinner you can subtly find out most answers to the questions below.;
, The way to a vegan’s heart is through his or her stomach. There are a few questions that you want to ask a vegan before deciding what food to make them. There are several levels of veganism; vegans may or may not eat honey, yeast, casein or cane sugar. Just because someone eats any of these products does not mean that he or she is not a 'true' vegan, so be considerate. Onto the questions!


Do they eat cane sugar? If they do eat cane sugar, you are home free, almost everything you make for them the rest of your omnivorous family will be happy to eat. If they respond that they only use a little agave nectar or stevia, don’t have a sweet tooth, or don’t like sweets, you can still feed them tasty vegan food.
Do they eat casein (milk protein)? Many people eat tofu cheeses with casein in them (sometimes as much as 20% casein). The casein tastes decent (to vegetarians), and melts when heated, separating it from much of the vegan cheese on the market. If they do eat casein, ask them what brand of “cheese” they eat or if they even like to use cheese imitations in their food. Buy that brand, it will make them very happy. If they are strict vegans, they only have a few options. Your vegan may not want any fake cheese, this is a way to understand if they like processed foods at all. Some don’t. Many people find any soy cheese vile tasting and unsatisfying, while others find it delicious. This might not be a good food to feed your family as an example of “vegan food,” they won't like it (use vegan ice cream instead).
Do they like fake meats? Some vegans have strong opinions on this subject. Others were raised on meat and potatoes, and those habits die hard. Tofu, Tempeh, and Seitan are great meat alternatives, but they require knowledge of how to cook them (which isn't too difficult). A good general rule for meat alternatives is to cut them small, marinate in a good sauce, cook thoroughly, and serve hot. Some fake meats are already flavored and can be a great time saver that can make a meal seem heartier.





What kind of milk substitute do they drink? Soy, almond, rice, hemp or none of the above? You can get specific enough to ask about brand if you want. Soymilk is easy to find, you can buy it anywhere now, and most major brands taste amazing. Many contain ample amounts of sugar, keep this in mind and apply the answer to the question about sugar.
Do they have any allergies or strong dislikes to other foods? If you are going through all of the trouble to make them vegan food, make sure that they are going to like it, and be able to eat it. Some vegans don’t like fruits and vegetables, so feed them what they will like, and then they won’t have that starved/pinched expression that will force them to jump ship for the nearest natural food store to eat packaged food in the aisle before they pay for it.

,


Do they eat honey? If you're tired of asking questions, just don’t use it. Maple syrup and agave nectar are fine alternatives when you need a liquid sweet, just remember to check labels: granola, bread, and cereals are three places you often find honey. The vegan won’t care that honey isn’t around, but some will really care if it is in their food.
Do they eat whey? Just don’t buy products with whey in them. Whey is usually one of the last ingredients on many labels. Accidentally serving whey (from milk) and gelatin (usually made from pig skin) can unfortunately be ways you feed your vegan friend things they didn't intend to eat.
If a label goes on for a mile, many of the “natural flavors” as well as other ingredients you won’t recognize, can contain animal products and by-products. Stick to simple, less processed foods, your vegan will be happier, and you won’t go blind reading the fine print on those labels. Some packaged foods even have a V on them for vegan.
Do they eat non-organic foods? When cooking for a vegan, organic vegetables, fruits, and oil can be really important ways for them to feel at home in your home.
Do they eat white flour? Your vegan might prefer alternative flours like spelt flour, whole wheat flour or no flour. Again, this goes back to the processed foods issue. Some vegans refer to white flour and sugar as “white death,” needless to say, you might think twice about feeding them these substances.

, Breakfast can be very easy. Toast with peanut or almond butter or soy cream cheese, berries and tea is an excellent breakfast. Oatmeal with soymilk, raisins, berries and ground flax is also a great breakfast. Muffins can be easily made vegan. Granola or cereal with the milk substitute is a great option. Pancakes and French toast are two easy meals to make vegan. .

Once you have an answer to the cheese question (casein, vegan, or no processed foods) a great lunch meal is tacos or enchiladas. The excellent thing about this meal is that you can have multiple kinds of shells (corn, spelt, or wheat) and multiple cheeses (dairy, casein, vegan, or none). Refried beans (watch for lard on the ingredient list) are a wonderful high protein food. Mushrooms, olives, tofu, tempeh, and walnuts are other excellent foods to add to this meal.





Summer grilling is a great way to feed your vegan. Clean a portion of your grill to be veggies only. Corn grills beautifully if soaked in a water-filled bucket for an hour first. Steamed artichokes are great for grilling. Portobello mushrooms become a burger themselves when grilled. Kabobs with a mix of veggies and meat alternatives marinated in teriyaki or soy sauce mixes are great. Vegan sausages and hotdogs are great, as are vegan veggie burgers (some veggie burgers have egg and dairy products in them). Make sure your burger/dog buns are vegan; check the labels for egg, whey, and milk products.





Soup and sandwiches can be a great lunch. Tomato soup with rice, miso (note that most miso is made with bonito or other fish flakes) soup with green onions and tofu, minestrone with veggies and noodles (make sure the noodles aren’t egg noodles). Veggie sandwiches lightly grilled with olive oil, avocado added after. Crackers to break up in the soup, or French bread with olive oil are a great way to fill out a soup meal. Sprouted grain breads (freezer section of natural foods area) for those with the healthy vegan gene can be used to make quite delicious sandwiches.
Curry is an excellent meal that can easily be made vegan but still really rich. Coconut milk, garbanzo beans, cauliflower, garlic, ginger, and tofu or tempeh work great for this dish. Most recipes are already vegan or can easily be altered to be vegan. Check chili paste ingredients for fish products. Curry powder is vegan. Use white or brown basmati rice to go with this meal.
Pizza is an excellent choice for most vegans. Buy or make pizza dough as usual. Great toppings for vegans include: basil, pine nuts, olives, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, walnuts, spinach, onions, and peppers. Pesto made with basil, garlic and pine nuts without Parmesan is a great sauce, as is marinara. Even without cheese this meal tastes great, but if you have their fake cheese of choice, this meal becomes even better. Vegan cheese needs to be next to the sauce in order to melt effectively.

For dessert, you can easily purchase a vegan version of whatever you would usually eat. If you are having ice cream, get a pint of vegan ice cream. Rice Dream and So Delicious are a few brands. There are also rich coconut based ice creams that are decadent. Vegan cookies are also widely available, both locally made, and commercial varieties.

Those berries can easily be incorporated into breakfast if they do eat the ice cream and cookies. There are also some great cookie recipes online, just check the sources and citations below.

, Do not expect that the next vegan you run into will have the same food tastes as your current vegan. A person may be vegan for nutritional reasons, for ethical/religious reasons, and/or for environmental reasons. Some have no reason other than that's how they've been all their life. In addition, they may be “freegans” (people who will only buy vegan, but if something is about to be thrown away, or is offered for free, they will eat it, even meat). They may be “raw foodists” this means they will only eat foods that are cooked below 110 °F (43 °C), or are raw. Vegans may be really strict or not true vegans at all, they just use the label to simplify down to food choices that they prefer to eat as mentioned above. All self-described vegans are trying to do something that is very difficult, and it can seem like they are thwarted at every turn and treated like a second-class citizen at many restaurants. Imagine not being able to order 85% of the menu, or being told something is vegetarian or vegan only to discover it isn’t. It would be like if you were on a diet, and someone offered you a piece of cheesecake and promised you it was diet cheesecake with only 50 calories, and then after you ate it, they said it wasn’t diet and it had 500 calories, and they laughed. So if your vegan is a bit gun-shy about trusting others with food, it is usually with good reason.

Pulse the mixture until the nuts are finely ground.If you prefer, you can use all of one nut rather than a combination. The nuts should total 2 cups (240 g).;
, Once the nuts are ground, add ¾ cup (60 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of sea salt to the food processor. Pulse the mixture lightly until it is combined. Pour the mixture into a bowl and set it aside for the moment.You can substitute cacao powder for the cocoa powder if you prefer.

, After you’ve removed the nut mixture from the food processor, add 2 ½ cups (425 g) of pitted dates to it. Pulse the dates until they are reduced to small bits. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside for the moment.If you are using dried dates, be sure to soak them in warm water for at least 10 minutes. Drain them well and then process them.

, Pour the nut and cocoa mixture back into the food processor and begin processing it. Slowly add handfuls of the the ground dates to the nuts and cocoa to mix them in until you achieve a dough-like consistency.Keep in mind that you may not need to add all of the dates. If you squeeze the brownie mixture in your hand and it holds together, you don’t need to add any more dates.

, For the brownies, you’ll need an 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) baking dish. Use a piece of parchment paper to line the dish so the brownies won’t stick.You can use wax paper to line the baking dish if you prefer.

, Once you’ve lined the baking dish, transfer the brownie mixture to it. Add 2 tablespoons (22 g) of cacao nibs and the remaining ½ cup (47 g) of raw walnuts to mixture and toss the ingredients together until they’re evenly distributed.If you prefer, you can substitute almonds for the walnuts.

, When the brownie mixture is combined with the nibs and walnuts, use clean hands to press it into the dish. The brownies should be flat and firm when you’re finished.If you find that the brownie mixture is sticking to your hands as you press it, it may help to lay a piece of plastic wrap over it to form a barrier between the brownies and your skin.

, After you’ve pressed the brownies into the pan, use the edges of the parchment paper lining the dish to lift them out. Use your hands to squeeze in the sides to form a smaller square.Squeezing the mixture this way will create thicker, denser brownies. You can skip it if you prefer thinner brownies.

, After you’ve squeezed the brownies into a smaller square, return them to the lined baking dish. Place the dish in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes to firm up.Be sure to place the parchment paper back in the dish with the brownies.
You can chill the brownies in the freezer if you prefer.

, Add ¼ cup (59 ml) of almond milk to a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the milk on high for 45 seconds or until it is very warm.You can substitute another non-dairy milk for the almond milk if you prefer.
If you don’t have a microwave, you can heat the milk in a pan on the stove until it is just simmering.

, Once the milk is warm, add 1 cup (175 g) of chopped, dairy-free dark chocolate to the bowl. Loosely cover it with foil and allow the mixture to sit for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chocolate melts., After the milk and chocolate mixture has sat for a few minutes, add ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of sea salt and 2 tablespoons (26 g) of melted coconut oil to the bowl. Stir the mixture well with a whisk and chill it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to thicken up., After the chocolate mixture has chilled, remove it from the refrigerator. Begin adding ¼ to ½ cup (31 to 62 g) of powdered sugar a little at a time to thicken it up further. Whisk well to ensure that the frosting is fully combined.If the frosting is still too thin after you add ½ cup (62 g) of the sugar, you may need to add a little more.

, Once the frosting is prepared, use a butter knife or offset spatula to carefully smooth it over the brownies. Make sure all of the brownies are covered with a generous amount.The frosting is an optional step, but it definitely makes for more decadent vegan brownies.

, After you’ve spread the frosting over the brownies, sprinkle some chopped, raw walnuts over them. You can also add some cacao nibs as a garnish.The garnishes are optional. You can leave the frosting on its own if you prefer.

, When the brownies are garnished, use a sharp knife to cut them into 12 even squares. Serve them with a glass of non-dairy milk or your favorite warm beverage.Keep any leftover brownies in an airtight container. They will stay fresh for 3 to 4 days at room temperature or 7 days in the refrigerator.

At this time, you can also pinch the edges of the crust to make it more fancy.

If the dough breaks apart, simply press it back together using your fingers.
If the dough got too soft during the rolling, refrigerate it for 30 minutes before moving onto the next step., Once the baking time is up, reduce the temperature to 400°F (200°C) and bake the crust for a few more minutes. This will give your crust that nice, golden brown color., As the crust cools, you can start preparing your pie filling. You can make a tofu-based one, or soy-free based one.,, Make sure that you are using plain, pureed canned pumpkin and not the ""pumpkin pie filling."" The canned filling is not vegan. You may also want to cut the tofu into smaller cubes first.

If you don't have a blender, use a food processor fitted with blades instead.
If you can't find all of the spices, you can use 2¼ teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead., If the filling is not blending evenly, pause the blender, and use a rubber spatula to scrape any unmixed filling down the sides and towards the bottom. If the filling is still too thick, ad 1 to 2 tablespoons of non-dairy milk (such as almond, rice, or soy) to thin it out, and blend again.

, Use a rubber spatula to scrape all of the mixture out of the blender and to smooth down the top of the pie.

, The pie will not be completely baked, which is fine. You will continue baking it the rest of the way at a cooler temperature.

, The pie is ready when a knife poked into the center comes out clean.

, If the pie is not setting, let it cool down to room temperature first, then put it into the fridge until it sets, about 3 to 4 hours.

,, The molasses is not completely necessary, but it will give the pie a more complex flavor. Also, you can use canned pumpkin purée, but make sure that you are using plain pumpkin purée, and not the ""canned pumpkin pie filling."" The pumpkin pie filling version is not vegan.

If you can't find any cornstarch, you can use arrowroot powder instead.f you can't get all of the spices, use 2½ teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead.Alternatively, you can use ¼ to ¾ cups (60 to 180 milliliters) of full fat coconut milk instead of almond, rice, or soy milk for something richer., If the ingredients are not blending smoothly, pause the blender, and scrape any unmixed filling down towards the bottom of the blender with a rubber spatula., Use a rubber spatula to help guide the filling into the crust, and to scrape any mixture leftover out of the blender. Smooth the top of the pie down with the spatula, if necessary., The pie is ready when a knife poked into the center comes out clean., The pie will need to finish setting first before you can serve it. If the pie is still too soft, let it chill for another 1 to 2 hours."

Consider playing around with ingredients to develop your own cake.","How to Make a Dairy, Sugar and Egg Free Cake4"," In order to do this, you need to understand what can be replaced for the standard ingredients in a cake recipe, while also accepting that it will take trial and error before you get the replacement elements sufficiently accurate to produce a good quality cake. The following list may help you when experimenting to create your own cake that doesn't have eggs, sugar or dairy, or any such combination as befits your needs:

Replace eggs with: 1 tablespoon flax seeds, ground finely or 1 tablespoon chia seeds added to 3 tablespoons of warm water. Mix together, then chill for 15 minutes before using.Or, try 3 tablespoons applesauce for each egg or 1/2 mashed banana for each egg.Commercial egg replacer mixes are another good option. Other substitutes can be found in How to replace eggs in your cooking.
Replace milk with: Water, plant milks, seed milks and even leftover drinks such as lemonade, soda or fruit juice. It can be fun to experiment with different flavors for tasty outcomes.
Replace cream with: Coconut cream, soy cream, rice cream, and so forth. There are also fake cream recipes available with a quick search online.
Replace butter with: Oil (coconut, macadamia, olive, etc.); unsweetened applesauce;puréed pumpkin or avocado;coconut oil or butter;; and non-dairy yogurts.Replace sugar with: Artificial sweeteners that can be baked, syrups that you don't mind using (some people are concerned with these too), fruit juice, mashed or puréed fruit, dried fruits, spices, coconut milk, etc. In many cases, it's just best to cut down on the amount used rather than avoid it completely––many recipes do use too much sugar and it can be halved or even reduced to a quarter of the original amount and it will still taste great.

Review the recipe to determine the non-vegan ingredients.,
Search your pantry for items that make good substitutes for the non-vegan cake ingredients.,
Omit the use of eggs from the recipe and replace with a comparable ingredient.,
Replace any milk used in the cake recipe with non-dairy alternatives.,
Substitute butter with equal amounts of a vegan butter alternative, such as margarine.,
Choose a vegan sugar substitute, which is generally healthier than refined brown and white sugars.,
Replace refined white flour with healthier alternatives.,
Make the frosting.",How to Make a Cake Vegan," Typical non-vegan cake baking ingredients include eggs, butter, milk and even refined white sugar, which is manufactured with animal bones.;
,


Most non-vegan cake ingredients such as eggs and butter can be easily replaced with typical household grocery items. For example, bananas and applesauce replace eggs and margarine replaces butter.

,


One egg can be replaced with 2 tbsp. ground flax seed stirred into 3 tbsp. of water.
Replace a single egg by mashing half of a banana or using 3 tbsp. applesauce. 1 egg may also be replaced with 1/4 cup (59.14 ml) of soft tofu that's been run through a blender.
Buy a vegan egg replacement product. This non-dairy powdered mix is usually found in health food stores.

, Soy and almond milk are the most recommended replacements when baking. You can also use hemp, coconut, or hazelnut milk.


Use the same measurements when substituting dairy milk with vegan replacements.

, Be sure that the margarine you use is not made with animal-based ingredients. Health food stores usually carry 100 percent vegan margarine.


Another option for replacing butter with a vegan ingredient is vegetable shortening or applesauce, which can replace up to 3/4 of the total butter used in any baking recipe.

, These include granulated cane sugar and date sugar as well as new plant-based sweeteners. Granulated cane sugar may be used in the same proportion as refined sugar. If using date sugar or a plant-based sweetener, use less amounts in the recipe than refined sugar. These products are far sweeter than typical refined sugar.


Liquid sweeteners such as barley malt and maple syrup can also be used but be sure to slightly reduce the use of other liquids in your cake recipe.

, Vegans prefer to use non-refined flours made with barley, brown rice, potato and Kamut, which are found in health food stores.


Alternatively, you can ground 1 cup (236.5 ml) of whole rolled oats to create 3/4 cup (177.4 ml) of oat flour.

, For a vegan cake frosting, replace the use of butter with blended tofu and cooking oil or margarine.

Use the flax egg.",How to Make a Flax Egg1," You can do this in a blender, coffee grinder, or a spice grinder. It is best if you grind the seeds yourself rather than buying pre-ground seeds from the store. This is because flax seeds release oils as soon as you grind them; these oils are perishable and go rancid over time.
, Place the flax seeds into a small bowl or cup. If you have any ground flax seeds left over, place them into an airtight container, then store them in the freezer to preserve them., Give the mixture a quick stir with a fork or mini whisk. Don't worry if it looks watery or soupy at this point. The mixture will thicken up.

Warm water will speed up the gelling process. If you don't have warm water, you can use cool water, but it will take longer.

, This will take 10 to 15 minutes—if you are using warm water. The ground flax seeds will become gloopy, sort of like a real egg., This recipe makes one flax egg, which is equal to one chicken egg. They aren't good for frying, but you can use them in other recipes, such as pancakes or muffins."

When ground, flax seeds release oils, which start to perish immediately., You will need 1 tablespoon (10 grams) of ground flax seeds for every egg you plan on making. Because you will be cooking this recipe, it would be more convenient to make larger amounts.

If you have any ground flax seeds left over, place them into an airtight container, then store it in the freezer. This will preserve the oils and keep them from going rancid.

, You will need 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of water for each egg you are making. If you are making more flax eggs, you will need to use more water., This will take about 5 minutes. It may take less time if you are making just one egg, and it may take more if you are making several eggs., If you made several flax eggs, use 4 tablespoons (40 grams) of the mixture for each egg you plan on using. Store the rest of the eggs in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

If you have a large ice cube tray or mini containers, you can divide the mixture up into individual portions.

Do not cover the saucepan at any point during this step.

, Place a fine, mesh strainer into a bowl. Pour the hot mixture through the strainer and into the bowl. Scrape the strainer with a rubber spatula to help the mixture drain faster.

The mesh needs to be woven tight enough so that the seeds don't fall through.

It will take about 1 hour for it to cool at room temperature, but you can speed up the process by placing it into the refrigerator., You will need 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of flax gel for every egg you will be replacing in your recipe.

Although you don’t have to work with firm or extra firm tofu, the process of marinating it is easier the firmer the curd.;
,,,, This will remove any excess moisture from the tofu and allow the marinade to be absorbed. Leave this in place for 30 minutes to overnight. The longer you press it, the better the tofu will soak up the marinade.

,, You could use a stir fry sauce

or a different recipe from a cookbook or the internet.,,, The tofu can marinate overnight if desired.

Cut the tofu roughly into it's finished shape to speed up the process.",How to Press Tofu," Silken tofu does not need pressing, as it is softer and used more often in blended dishes. Firm and extra firm tofu almost always needs to be pressed, as it's density allows it to keep more water when cooking. Whether or not to press tofu depends, more often than not, on how you plan to cook it:


Blending, mixing, or raw: Don't press.

Frying, grilling, baking: Press as much water out as possible.;
, Water and oil do not mix well, so any cooked or fried tofu needs to be drained. This water is to help the tofu stay fresh in stores -- dump it all out now and rinse off your block. Pat dry when done.

, Make sure you drain off all the excess water, then wrap the tofu in towels. Give it a good, firm press with your hands, draining off any water that comes out., After the initial pressing, you'll need to weight the tofu down and let it sit for 30 minutes or more to remove the rest of the water. Wrap the tofu in something to absorb the water, the place on a cutting board, plate, or shallow bowl., Place a flat board on top of the tofu, then add weight (cookbooks, pots of water) to the top of the cutting board. Make sure you evenly distribute the weight.

, Once you've got the water out, you don't need to press anymore. Use a fresh towel to pat the tofu dry and start cooking., Make sure that your cuts aren't too small -- generally keeping chunks at least 1"" big in every direction. Cut the tofu so that it is still sliced but holds it's original block shape, then proceed.

Place the tofu on a plate and drape a paper towel or piece of cheesecloth over the top. Rest a heavy object, like a cookbook or metal saucepan, on top of the tofu block. This will help force out the excess moisture contained in the tofu.Leave the tofu under constant compression for 20 to 30 minutes.
Not squeezing the water out of the tofu first could result in watery sloppy joes.;
, Use a sharp knife to cut the block of tofu, slicing it first into long, narrow strips, then turning the strips and cutting them into pieces of the desired size. For smoother sloppy joes, dice or mince the tofu into pea-sized squares. If you prefer heartier sandwiches, you can leave the cubes slightly bigger.You can also mash the tofu or crumble the tofu by breaking it apart with a fork.Cutting the tofu into smaller pieces increases its surface area, which will help it cook faster.

, The onions and any other vegetables you choose to include (green pepper, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, etc.) should be roughly the same size as the tofu. Mince the garlic extra fine to avoid biting into any oversized pieces.In addition to regular white onion, you could use a head of scallions or shallots.
Use a garlic press to grate the cloves into a thick paste.

, Pour 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the pan and turn on the cooktop to medium-high heat. Tilt the pan to spread the oil around. The surface of the pan should be nice and hot before you begin cooking.Butter can be used in place of oil on nonstick pans.

, Toss your aromatic ingredients into the pan and begin searing them. This will unlock their pungent, zesty flavors, which will then be infused into the tofu. Cook the garlic and onions until they turn translucent and begin to brown slightly.Caramelized aromatics will lend a noticeable richness to the mild tofu.
Be careful not to cook the onions and garlic until they burn. This could ruin the flavor of the sloppy joes.

, Add the tofu and scramble it together with the aromatics. Let the tofu cook for about 3-5 minutes before stirring again. As it fries, it will absorb the oil and take on a crisp, golden brown finish.


Dust the tofu with a coating of rice flour or cornstarch before pan frying to give it an extra crunchy texture.Tofu doesn’t change colors dramatically when cooked, so look for the edges to just begin turning golden brown and be careful not to get it too done., Sprinkle the tofu generously with salt, chili powder, onion powder and paprika. If you want, you can also add a pinch of black or white pepper. Sample a piece of the tofu to make sure it’s seasoned just right.


Keep in mind that you’ll be increasing the saltiness later on when you add the canned tomatoes and other condiments.
A couple shakes of an all-purpose spice blend, such as Creole or Greek seasoning, is a good way to enhance the flavor of tofu.

, Open one can of diced tomatoes and stir them in with the tofu. Then, add 1-1½ cups of ketchup and 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard. Stir the ingredients until they’re thoroughly blended.Substitute a can of tomato puree for ketchup if you prefer tangier sloppy joes., At this point, you can incorporate a few other delicious extras to put your own personal stamp on the recipe. Diced green pepper, white mushrooms and chopped nuts are all vegetarian-friendly options that can impart welcome nutrients. You can also tinker with the flavor of the sauce by adding a dash of soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, sugar or fresh parsley.Turn up the heat with half a can of pickled jalapeño or serrano peppers.The ketchup will contribute to the sweetness of the sauce, so don’t overdo it with the sugar.

, Turn the cooktop down to medium heat so that the sauce gently bubbles around the edges of the pan. Leave the pan uncovered, stirring occasionally. This will allow it to thicken as it simmers.For a thicker consistency, let the sloppy joe mix simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes.
The longer you simmer the sloppy joe mix, the more time the flavors will have to set up and the tastier they’ll be., Scoop the sloppy joe mix with a serving spoon or ladle. Pile it onto toasted and buttered whole wheat hamburger buns, or make them the way grandma used to with two slices of plain white sandwich bread. Grab hold with both hands and take a big, messy bite!Wrap hamburger buns in a paper towel and microwave them for a few seconds, or butter them and stick them in the oven until the edges begin to brown.Don’t forget to soak up the mess that’s fallen out onto your plate with your bun!

, Hamburger buns are the traditional vehicle for sloppy joes, but there's no rules for how to eat your messy masterpiece. The tofu mix can make a filling breakfast when piled onto a slice of toast and topped with an egg, and will be positively delicious stuffed inside a warm tortilla with shredded lettuce, cheese, salsa and jalapenos. Just because it's simple doesn't mean it has to be boring!


Try serving your tofu sloppy joes in lettuce wraps to cut down on fat and calories even more.Use leftover mix to make quick and easy vegetarian nachos., No sloppy joe is complete without a heaping mound of mac and cheese or pillowy tater tots. Those seeking a lighter option can go with a steamed seasonal veggies, sweet potato fries or fruit cocktail. When you comes to comfort foods as simple, healthy and delicious as sloppy joes, it’s hard to go wrong.Balance out the hot sloppy joes with a cool pasta salad, mixed green salad or homemade coleslaw.
Pair tofu sloppy joes with your family’s favorite side dishes or companion recipes.

, Uneaten sloppy joe mix can be placed in an airtight container and kept in the refrigerator for up to a week. To reheat, simply pop the cold mix in the microwave for 45 seconds to a minute at a time, stirring between heatings. Sloppy joes are equally good as an afternoon snack for the kids or an easy dinner for one when the pantry is empty.Sloppy joes are often even better a day or two later, after the flavors of the individual ingredients have had more time to mingle.
Heat hamburger buns or bread separately. Microwaving them for too long can make them tough and chewy.

, When the beans are soft, drain the soaking water from them using the strainer or colander. When they are completely drained, empty the beans into a bowl or other container., Use a large stockpot or dutch oven, so you won't risk having the water and beans boil over the rim., Process them in a blender on high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until they are completely pureed., Measure out 8 ounces of the beans and add them to the boiling water.

Serve the tofu immediately.",How to Grill Tofu," Tofu tends to fall apart easily when grilled. The firmer the tofu, the better it will hold together on your grill. Choose firm or extra firm tofu for the best grilling results. After grilling, firm tofu will have a slightly softer texture than the extra firm. Choose firm or extra firm tofu, depending on your personal texture preference.


Make sure you get the non-silken variety. Silken tofu has a softer texture that doesn’t hold up well on the grill.The porousness of the non-silken variety also holds flavor in better.;
, Slice the tofu into fairly thick pieces that are approximately 1/3 inch thick (for best results, don't slice it any more than 1/2 inch thick). Leave the tofu in the largest slabs possible, since those are easiest to work with. The slices will look rectangular. When grilled, a thick slice will result in a dense slab of tofu that is brown and lightly crispy on the outside, with a juicy core., Lay the slices out on several paper towels. Use more paper towels to gently press on top of the tofu, which will push out and soak up the excess moisture inside. Tofu doesn’t grill well if the moisture isn’t removed, resulting in an unappetizing mushy core. Press out as much moisture as you can from the slabs.You can also press the moisture out using a piece of muslin, which is a more traditional way to prep tofu.
However, using paper towels is usually the easiest and most efficient way to get the job done.

, There are many different kinds of marinades out there to choose from. Included here is a very simple marinade recipe you can try out. Whisk together all of the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Place the tofu pieces in one at a time, tossing to coat both sides, then leave the slices in the marinade. Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator for 15 minutes (you can leave it in there for up to 1 day). Reserve the leftover marinade – you will be using it again after the tofu is grilled.


1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil;
¼ cup soy sauce;
2 tablespoons mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine);
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar;
1 tablespoon minced or grated fresh ginger;
1 pound firm non-silken tofu., Before you cook anything on the grill, it must be cleaned. Any leftover food or char on the grate will negatively affect the flavor, since tofu tends to soak up any flavor it comes into contact with. Grills are easiest to clean when the grates are hot, so preheat your grill first. Leave the lid on for about 10 minutes so that it gets nice and hot inside.Use a heavy-duty grill brush to scrub down the grates on both sides, making sure it looks spotless before proceeding.
The hotter and cleaner the grill grate, the nicer the seared grill marks will turn out on the tofu. These marks will also help to hold the tofu together.

, Put a few tablespoons of oil into a bowl. Crumple up several paper towels and drop them in, allowing them to soak up the oil. Use a pair of tongs to grab one of the soaked towels from the bowl and rub it all over the preheated grill grates. The oil will smoke – let it do so for about 40 seconds, then rub the grates with another oil-soaked towel.Repeat this 1 or 2 more times so that the grate has a good coating built up on it.
Another option is to generously coat the grill grate with non-stick cooking spray.If you go this route, both the grill grate and both sides of the tofu need to be coated with the spray.

, Using tongs, place the tofu slices on the edges of the barbecue grill, where it's hot but not directly over flames or heat. Arrange the other slices from the outer edge to the middle, in a single layer. Cooking tofu over low and indirect heat in this manner will result in the best flavor, and the tofu will brown to just the right amount of crispness., Grilling times vary depending on the thickness of your slices and how hot your grill gets. This can range anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes per side, so you’ll need to watch it carefully. After about 2 minutes on the grill, turn the tofu slices 90 degrees (from 12 o’clock to 2 o’clock).This will create nice cross-hatch seared marks on the tofu.
Allow the slices to cook a few more minutes, until you see the sides turning brown.

, Tofu is ready to turn when you can lift up a corner and it doesn’t stick to the grate. If there’s any resistance, the slice isn’t quite ready yet. When ready, carefully flip each slice over using tongs. The cooked surface will look slightly crisp and golden brown.Once turned, repeat the same process that you followed on the first side.
Don't forget to turn the slices 90 degrees about halfway through to get those grill marks.

, Examine the slices to make sure they look evenly cooked on both sides. The outer crust should be crisp and brown. Slide a knife carefully into the center of a slice to see how it looks. It should be tender and slightly juicy, with an almost meaty texture.Use tongs to remove the grilled tofu slices from the grate.
Lay them out side by side on a serving platter.

, Brush the tofu slices with the leftover marinade you reserved during preparation. Flip the slices over and brush marinade on the other side. This will greatly enhance the flavor. If you like, add a small amount of oil to the reserved marinade before applying it to the tofu. The oil will further enhance the surface texture., Tofu cools down relatively quickly, so get the slices on the table as quickly as you can for the tastiest results. If there is any leftover marinade, serve that along with the tofu. Diners who enjoy very flavorful tofu can brush on a little more marinade right before they eat it. Traditionally, grilled tofu is also served with soy sauce."

If not, you can gently squeeze the excess moisture out of the tofu with your hand. You can also blot the tofu with a paper towel.Ideally, all of the water should be drained out of the tofu, giving it a firm, meaty texture.

, You can cut the tofu into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes. It is also an option to cut the tofu into slices or triangles. Cut the tofu into whatever shape you would prefer the nuggets to be., Pour the flour, yeast, garlic powder, salt, paprika, black pepper, and water into a medium-sized bowl. Use the stirring utensil of your choice to stir the ingredients together until the batter becomes smooth., Turn the stove to medium heat. Pour 1/3-inch (0.8 cm) of oil into the pan. You can use vegetable or coconut oil., Coat the tofu completely in the batter you’ve made out of flour, yeast, and seasoning. Make sure each piece of tofu is generously coated. You can coat each piece of tofu individually or work in small batches., Put the tofu into the pan with the heated oil inside of it. Do not overcrowd the pan. Work in batches if you have to. Fry the bottom of the tofu. Fry it until the bottom turns a crispy golden brown., Once the bottom of the tofu has turned golden brown, flip the tofu to fry the rest of the cube. Continue to flip until all of the tofu has turned a crispy golden brown. Work through all of the tofu if you have multiple batches to fry., Line a plate with a paper towel. Place the finished tofu on the lined plate. Allow the tofu to cool for five minutes and then serve warm.You can store the leftover tofu in the refrigerator for no more than a few days in a covered container.

",How to Prepare Tofu," While mass-produced tofu is now available at many supermarkets and grocery stores, it's even better to find your local Asian grocery and buy it fresh there. Packaged tofu will have traveled many miles to reach its destination, and might contain preservatives that reduce both the flavor and nutritional value. In general, the fresher, the better.






;
, Firm tofu is often a bit gritty and is most commonly used in stir fries, or other dishes that cause ""rough handling"". Silken tofu has a much finer, creamier texture but needs to be handled somewhat delicately; it is best used as tofu steaks or for mixing in desserts.








, If you are using water-packed tofu, you want to get the water out. This is done easily by pressing the entire block or cutting into slices. All you need is something absorbent (paper towel or clean lint-free kitchen towel) and some weight. Place tofu in between towel, put a plate on top, and use a soup can. All you are doing is gently pressing the water out.








,, Tofu can be pan-sauteed, fried, toasted, grilled, etc, until it is firm enough that the skin offers a decent amount of resistance when poked with a spatula or a fork.








, A traditional Asian option would be to mix soy sauce with sesame oil. You can also toss in a bit of minced garlic, if you think your taste buds can handle it. A nice, finishing touch is to toast some sesame seeds to sprinkle on top of the sauce right before the tofu is served.

Experiment with different tips.",How to Ice Cookies," Fresh from your oven, your cookies will be too hot to handle, but even warm cookies can cause your icing to melt and ruin your designs. To prevent this from happening, wait until the cookies are cool to the touch before icing., A pastry bag will help you direct the flow of icing, allowing you to more precisely apply it to your cookies. If you don't already have one, you can buy a pastry bag in the baking section of most grocery stores. You could also make your own by:


Making a pastry bag from a plastic baggie. You'll want to wait until after you've added icing to your baggie, but after that you can simply cut off a narrow opening in one end of it and squeeze the frosting through this opening, similar to how you would use a pastry bag.
Making a pastry bag from parchment paper. Cut your parchment paper into a large square. Fold opposite corners of the square to form a crease running corner to corner. Cut along this crease. Then you can funnel your paper into a cone, fasten the cone with tape, insert frosting, and cut the tip off your cone to create a narrow opening., Plastic squeeze bottles, like the ones often used to serve condiments like ketchup, can work well in place of pastry bags. You may be able to find these at your local grocery, at a restaurant supply store, or through an online retailer.


You'll use your squeeze bottles exactly as you would a pastry bag without having to worry about a tip, since squeeze bottles already have a tip. Simply fill your bottles with your icing and you're ready to ice.
If you lack a piping bag or squeeze bottles, you could use a spoon to apply your icing to your cookies. This technique is generally referred to as ""pouring.""

, If you don't have an icing tip for your piping bag, you should be able to make do by cutting a narrow hole in the end of your piping bag with scissors and simply using that to apply your frosting. If you do have an icing tip for your piping bag, this can make the application of your icing easier.


Most icing tips for piping bags are designed to wiggle into place on the cut end of the bag. This way, when the bag is squeezed, icing will flow through the hole in the end and out through the icing tip., You can could use a simple store made brand of icing or you could make homemade icing for your cookies. When making homemade icing, you should consider making two batches, one for border icing and the other for flood icing.


Border icing is often thicker and serves well for providing and outline or a boundary in your cookie decorating designs. Flood icing is thinning and is meant to fill in the spaces between boundary icing.
A simple border icing recipe could be made with: 1 cup of powdered sugar (sifted), ½ teaspoon vanilla extract, 2 tablespoons water or milk combined in a small bowl with a fork or whisk until the mixture is thick, smooth, and consistent. It should, however, still be pourable.
Simple flood icing could be made with: 1 cup powdered sugar (sifted), ½ teaspoon vanilla extract, 3 tablespoons water or milk combined in a small bowl with a fork or whisk until the mixture is thick, smooth, and consistent. Opposite the border icing, this icing should drizzle more easily.
Food coloring can be added and mixed in with your frosting a few drops at a time to change its color. The color will thin a little when spread throughout the icing, but it should be used sparingly, as the dye is highly concentrated., Using a spatula, you should be able to scoop or push the icing over the lip of its bowl and into your piping bag. Your flood icing may be thin enough to pour directly into the piping bag. To prevent wasted icing, you may want to collect icing remnants with the edge of your spatula and add this to the piping bag as well.


If you are filling several piping bags with icing, you should be careful not to leave filled piping bags on warm surfaces or in the sun. This can cause the sugar in your icing to melt and create a thin consistency in your icing.
Any leftover icing that you plan to use on future baking projects should be refrigerated to prevent spoiling., The first spurt of icing from the tip of your icing bag can be uneven, so to prevent this from ruining the design on one of your cookies, you should squeeze the opposite end of the bag from the nozzle until icing comes out. You only need a little bit of icing before the nozzle's ready to ice.Extra icing can be wiped off on the rim of the icing bowl and used as a treat for the kids or yourself. If you're not the biggest fan of sugary treats, you can wipe off the extra icing on a piece of paper to be thrown away.

, If you have shaped cookies, like little Christmas trees or stars, this may be as simple as following the outside edge of your cookie with a line of border frosting. You might also want to use your border icing to fill in details, like dots for eyes.


When icing your cookies with a piping bag, you should use firm, steady force to push the icing down to its cut corner and through the tip/nozzle.
Mistakes with border icing can usually be fixed by dabbing them away with a moistened towel or piece of paper towel., You won't have to be as precise as you were with your border icing. Apply your flood icing to the un-iced parts of the cookie inside your border frosting outline. The frosting should be thinner, and should spread until it is stopped by the border icing.If your flood icing has turned out a little thicker than you intended, then you may need to help it spread out by gently pushing the frosting in place with the tip of your frosting bag.

, It's common for even experienced bakers to sometimes ice something inconsistently or make a small mistake. You can smooth your icing with a spatula or a butter knife, though you should be careful not to blend distinct parts of your icing design together.


If the detailed parts of your icing designs need to be adjusted, you can alter icing with greater precision using toothpicks. However, you should do this soon after applying the icing, while it is still soft and hasn't firmed up., While the icing is still soft, accents and added touches will nest easily in it. You might add chopped nuts, sprinkles, or small candies to your cookies to add a unique flavor or a special treat.


You may be able to use edible accents to create special designs in your cookies. For example, you might use green sprinkles for Christmas trees with shiny edible beads representing ornaments., Depending on the climate of your kitchen, the climate of your region, and other factors, like the kind of icing you used, it may take your icing up to 8 to fully set. Many kinds of icing will be firm after an hour of rest time.Placing a fan to blow over your cookies can help speed up the time it takes your icing to dry.
If you live in an especially hot or humid climate, heat can cause the sugar in your icing to break down and liquefy, ruining your designs. To prevent this, you may want to store your cookies in your refrigerator., You might find it easiest to write messages on your cookies with cursive, as that fluid writing style adapts relatively cleanly to piping bag writing. If cursive isn't your strong suit, you might also try writing in bubble letters, as these will be bigger and allow you more leeway when writing.You can practice your writing on a clean, unused paper plate. Write your message several times until you feel like you've gotten the hang of writing with a piping bag.

, It can be difficult to freehand more complicated and/or layered icing designs. For soft cookies that use single layer designs, you could poke the pattern of your icing design into your cookies with a toothpick. Then follow the holes in the cookie when adding icing to create your design.


For multiple layer designs, first add your base layer of icing to cover the cookie. Then use your toothpick to poke your design into the base layer of icing. Follow this guide while adding icing to the base layer to complete your design.
Try to avoid poking too many holes in your cookie with your toothpick. Doing so could cause your cookie to crumble., There are many different kinds of pastry bag tips, and these will create a different effect in the icing after passing through the tip. As most cookies are relatively small, you may want to prioritize thin tips to keep your designs sharp and well-defined. Some common tips you might use on your cookies include:



Round tips are generally versatile and used for many purposes, like scrollwork, dots, lettering, and little flowers.

Star tips are most often used for top and bottom borders, star piping, and rosettes. Narrow star tips can also create textured lettering on your cookies."

, Dip each choux or cream puff in melted chocolate., Attach each choux or cream puff to the cone using a toothpick. Stick each toothpick in all the way. Sometimes the toothpicks are really hard to push in; don't worry about that because at the very end you will push them all in with a thimble on your finger.

""Flat"" toothpicks are less stiff and pointy than ""round"" toothpicks. They'll be harder to push into the cone, but less annoyingly sharp in the course of eating the croquembouche.

,, Pin the top puff to the cone from the top angle, rather than from the side., You're done; the croquembouche is ready to be served."

Follow this easy recipe to create a sweet, glossy paste.,
Pour the powdered sugar into a large bowl.,
Pour in a small amount of milk or juice.,
Stir thoroughly with a spoon.,
Stir in a little more liquid at a time until there is no dry sugar visible.,
Finish by mixing in a few drops of vanilla or almond extract.",How to Make Cake Icing1," You can make this recipe within ten minutes even if you have no measuring cups; it's that easy. The result is sweeter and more liquid than most frostings, so it is ideal on the top of cakes, or in the center of a cake cut into layers. It pairs especially well with light, fruit-flavored cakes, but might be overpowered by rich, thick cakes such as chocolate.;
, You may measure out 2 cups of powdered sugar, or simply pour the amount you think will suit your needs. It is extremely easy to adjust this recipe or make more, so do not feel pressured to keep your measurements exact.Confectioner's sugar or icing sugar are simply other names for powdered sugar.

, Depending on the flavor you want to add, you may use milk, lemon juice, or any other juice. Measure out 4 tablespoons of the liquid, or simply pour in a small amount, much less than the amount of sugar used. It's better to add too little and add more later than to add too much and have to add a lot more sugar than you intended to use.


If your cake contains fruit, consider adding juice made from that type of fruit.
Consider picking a juice based on the color you want your cake to be.

, Stir gently at first, or the sugar will get knocked over the edge of the bowl and make a mess. Stir until a paste is formed, or until all the liquid has been absorbed by the sugar.

, Keep adding a little milk or juice at a time and stirring it in. When the mixture reaches an even consistency with no dry sugar on top of the paste, it is ready. Optionally, you may add a little more liquid to make the mixture thinner or to add more of the liquid's flavor. If the mixture becomes runny, however, stir in a little more sugar to compensate.

, Carefully add a couple drops to your icing, or measure out 1 teaspoon (5mL). Stir it in thoroughly. You are now ready to spread your icing onto the cake with a knife or spoon!

Whip this up quickly for a rich, sweet spread.,
Soften 1 cup (240mL) butter.,
Mix the butter and sugar together.,
Add additional flavors (optional).,
Mix in the remaining ingredients.",How to Make Cake Icing2," This is the type of icing many people picture when they think of a classic birthday cake or cupcake topping. It can be made in less than twenty minutes, then spread over the top and sides of any cake to create a delicious, beautiful covering.

, The quickest way to soften butter is to place it in a microwave-safe dish and microwave it for 10–30 seconds. If you do not have a microwave, simply cut it into small pieces and leave it out on the counter. Either way, continue on once the butter is at room temperature and slightly soft, but not melted.


If you will be serving the cake to vegans, replace the butter and whipped cream with a vegetable fat with rich flavor, such as cocoa butter or coconut fat. These tend to melt and solidify more quickly, which can make them difficult to work with.An easier alternative is margarine, but consider improving on its flavor by adding a small amount of melted vegan chocolate, maple syrup, or other strong-flavored ingredient.

, Put the softened butter in a large bowl and gradually add 3 cups (720mL) powdered sugar while mixing. This will go faster in an electric mixer, but can be done by hand within a few minutes as long as the butter is soft. If using an electric mixer, start at low speed and increase to medium once there is no dry sugar., You can skip this step entirely and still create a tasty, versatile buttercream icing. However, if you wish, you can alter it by stirring in a small amount of additional flavoring. Consider 1 teaspoon (5mL) lemon zest to pair with angel food cake, 1 ounce (30mL) melted, unsweetened chocolate for an even richer icing, or even a tablespoon (15mL) of instant coffee to give a chocolate cake a mocha flavor.

, Add 2 tablespoons (30mL) whipping cream (or heavy cream) and 1 tsp. (5mL) vanilla or almond extract, then beat with a spoon or mixer until the color and texture are consistent. If it is thick but spreads evenly off a knife, it is ready to be spread onto the cake. Otherwise, troubleshoot with these tips:If the icing is too soft, beat in 2 tbsp. powdered sugar thoroughly. Repeat until the frosting is thick enough to spread.
If the icing is solid in places or cracks when you try to spread it, add 1 tbsp. water at a time, stirring thoroughly, until the frosting becomes soft enough to spread.

Pair this with almost any cake.,
Soften the butter and cream cheese.,
Mix together the cream cheese and butter thoroughly.,
Stir in the powdered sugar.,
Beat until light and fluffy.,
Finish by stirring in the vanilla extract.",How to Make Cake Icing3," Cream cheese icing is especially popular on carrot cakes, but it also works well with chocolate, red velvet, or gingerbread cakes. Less sweet than a plain buttercream icing, it can be used on any cake or cookie to balance out the sugary taste with its own, rich flavor.

, Take 0.5 cups (120mL) butter or margarine and 1 cup (240mL) cream cheese. Soften them in the microwave or simply by cutting them into small chunks and leaving them at room temperature. Continue once the ingredients are soft but not melted.


You may replace half of the cream cheese with an equal amount butter if you prefer a taste closer to a normal buttercream frosting with some cream cheese flavor, rather than a mostly cream cheese taste.
Full fat cream cheese will create a good textured frosting. Low fat cream cheese might make the frosting runny., Use an electric mixer if possible, as this may become tedious and tiring if you do it by hand. Mix until there are no lumps and the entire mixture has the same color and texture.

, After the butter and cream cheese are nicely mixed, gradually add 2 cups (480mL) powdered sugar in 1/2 cup (120mL) increments, mixing thoroughly.

, Continue to mix the icing until it is light and fluffy. If you are not sure whether it's fluffy enough, stop; it's better to end up with slightly thick frosting than to beat it too much and make it runny.


If your frosting became runny, you can make it thicker by adding more cream cheese, mixing in a little more powdered sugar, or by trying out another thickening method.

, Add 1 tsp. (5mL) vanilla extract to the icing and mix it in briefly. It should no longer be visible, but there is no need to beat it for longer than thirty seconds. Your icing is now ready to spread onto your cake.

Buttercream is practically the mother of all frostings.,
In a large bowl, cream the butter and shortening until they are both mixed in thoroughly or until the mixture is very pale.,
Gradually mix in your sugar a cup at a time, remembering to scrape the sides often.,
Add the milk.,
When not using, keep away from heat and direct sunlight.",How to Make Cake Filling1," Firstly, gather your ingredients. You will need:


1/2 cup of white vegetable shortening, softened
1 cup of butter, softened
1 tsp of vanilla extract
2 - 4 cups of powdered sugar (if you like it sweet, use 4 cups, and if you prefer it less sweet, use less sugar)
~ 2 tbsp milk;
, Then, add in vanilla and beat well to combine.

For this decadent icing, you will need:


1 cup of chocolate, roughly chopped
1 cup of heavy cream
2 tbsp of butter

,
Place your chocolate in a heat-proof bowl and set it aside.,
Bring the cream to a simmer.,
After 5 minutes, use either a wooden spoon or spatula to mix the ganache.,

If you want to use your ganache as it is now, feel free to do it.",How to Make Cake Filling2,", Meanwhile, pour your heavy cream into another heat-proof bowl. In a pot, heat some water to just under boiling point. When the water is hot enough, place the bowl of cream on top. Make sure that the bowl is not touching the water.

, Let it simmer there for a few minutes before bringing off the heat. Set it down and pour the chocolate into the cream. The cream will melt the chocolate due to the heat. Leave the cream-chocolate mixture for about 5 minutes.

, Try to stir it together as best as you can.

,


The butter is optional, therefore you do not need to use it. You should add the butter if you are planning to whip the ganache to make it a thicker, more spreadable frosting-like consistency. Of course it will thicken up in the fridge (if you choose to put it in), but this entirely up to you.
If you want to put your ganache in the fridge, do this now. Let it chill for about 4 hours. Then, let it come to room temperature and use for whatever you need it for.

, If you want to go that extra step to make your ganache silky smooth and a perfect frosting consistency, follow through! You will need to use either a hand mixer or some kind of mixer to do this step. Whip it for a few minutes, and you're good to go!

Purchase or make some fondant.,
Decide what colors you will need for your edible makeup.,
Add dye to fondant pieces with a toothpick.,
Mix by kneading the fondant.",How to Make Edible Makeup Cake Decorations1," Fondant is thick sugary dough that is often used for cake decorating. You can color it and shape it into all sorts of designs, so it is perfect for making edible makeup.


Fondant is available in the cake decorating section of craft stores.
You will need one package or one recipe to make your edible makeup.;
, You can purchase pre-dyed fondant or dye fondant to be almost any color, but you should take some time to plan out what colors you will need. For example, if you want to make a lipstick for your cake, then you might need some red or pink fondant. If you want to make an eyeshadow palette, then you might want some green, purple, or blue fondant.


Jot down the makeup items you want to make and what colors you think you will need to make them.
Since most makeup is cased in black plastic, black fondant is essential for making edible makeup.
To dye fondant, you will need to use food safe dye. You can purchase all kinds of different dye colors for cake decorating in craft stores.

, When you are ready, put on a pair of food-safe vinyl gloves and break your fondant into pieces. Then, add dye to the fondant using a toothpick. Stick a clean toothpick into the dye and then stick it into the fondant to transfer the dye.Make sure that you discard toothpicks after they have touched the fondant. Do not dip them into the dye again.
It is almost impossible to dye fondant black, so you will probably need to buy black fondant at a craft store.Other dark colors, such as red, can be difficult to achieve, so you may want to purchase these colors as well.

, When you have added some dye to the fondant, begin mixing it with your gloved hands. Knead the dough to distribute the color evenly. Keep kneading until the color looks uniform.If the color is not as dark as you want it to be, then get a new toothpick, add some more dye, and knead again.
If the color is too dark, then add some white fondant and knead the dyed piece with the white piece to lighten the color.

Add in the vanilla and keep mixing until everything is well-blended and the same color.

, You just want all of the dry ingredients to be even distributed before adding. Use a fork or small whisk to break up any clumps as well, making the dough much more even and easy to work with.

, Add the flour slowly, in 3-4 parts, and mix each part in individually. Don't simply dump all the flour in and turn the mixer on -- far more of it will end up on the countertop than in the cookies. Keep mixing until all of the flour is incorporated into the mixture and there is none along the sides of the bowl.

, Once all the flour is in, stop using the hand mixer. Flour gets tougher the more you beat it, leading to denser, less chewy cookies. Dump in the oats and raisins and mix them in with a spatula, stopping once they evenly distributed.

, For perfect looking cookies, you could roll them into balls, but this is rarely necessary. Just scoop out 1-2 tablespoons of batter and drop it on the cookie sheet. Keep the cookies roughly 2 inches apart.


No matter what size you choose for you cookies, keep it consistent for all of them so that they take the same amount of time to cook., There should be little moist cracks in the tops of the cookies, which will slightly harden over as they cool. If you take them out once they've completely hardened, you'll be left with crunchy cookies., Wire racks will ensure the entire cookie cools at the same pace, leading to far greater texture and chewiness."

1 teaspoon each of cardamom, cinnamon, ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon each of ground ginger, nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper., Both sweet and savory, the addition of vanilla salt, often sold as ""vanilla fleur de sel,"" will bring out a richness and slight saltiness that will elevate the cookies from simple desert to decadent snack., The texture will stay roughly the same, but you'll get the sweet, slightly tropical touch of coconut flavor that will take any guests by welcome surprise.

Select a crumbly cookie.,
Crush up your favorite cookies.,
Blend the cookie crumbs in a food processor.,
Add vegetable oil or butter.,
Sprinkle powdered sugar or sweetened condensed milk into the paste.,
Transfer the cookie butter into a lidded jar.",How to Make Cookie Butters1," Part of the beauty of cookie butter is that you can make it with practically any kind of cookie. That being said, you should think about whether your favorite cookie is ideal for turning into a spreadable substance. You want a variety that crumbles into coarse granules easily, rather than a chewy recipe which will just get mushy or pasty when blended.For example, snickerdoodles, sugar cookies, pecan sandies, and oatmeal cookies all make great selections for cookie butter. Fig newtons, cream pies, and chewy or fudgy cookies are ill-advised.;
, Once you’ve measured out eight ounces (227 g) of cookies from their package, lay them out on a cheesecloth, paper towel, or chopping board. Lay another cloth on top of them and then crush them into coarse chunks. You can use your hands, a potato masher, a meat tenderizer, or any other implement that’s handy.


If you’ve used a cookie with a filling, such as Nutter Butters or Oreos, scrape off the filling before crushing the crunchy wafers., Once your cookies look roughly the size of bread crumbs, you can dump them in your blender to grind them into a fine powder. Use the pulse function and make sure the blender lid is screwed on tightly to avoid a powdery mess in the kitchen.

, Depending on your personal preferences, you can use either ½ cup vegetable oil (170 g) or ½ stick (56 g) in your cookie butter. Just be sure to drizzle the oil in gradually, or if you’re using butter, heat it up and melt it beforehand so that you spoon it in slowly. This will ensure that you distribute the butter or oil evenly throughout the crumbs. You want the finished product to look like a paste.


Many cookbooks and food bloggers recommend using unsalted butter in your confections, but it’s actually a matter of personal preference., Again, you can decide which ingredient you want to use depending on whether you prefer to bake with powdered sugar or condensed milk. Whichever one you use, measure out ½ cup (170 g). If you’re using sugar, scrape it off and down from the sides of the blender to make sure it gets into the mixture at the bottom rather than forming a residue on the walls.


If your mixture still looks dry, add a little water until it reaches the desired consistency. If you’re unsure, try dabbing a bit onto a cracker or piece of bread and see if it spreads easily.

, Using a spatula or large spoon, scrape all of your spread into a glass or plastic jar that can be closed tightly with a lid. Put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving.If you’ve got leftovers, no problem! Just pop your remaining cookie butter back in the fridge and keep it there for up to a week.

Purchase a simple, crumbly cookie like Biscoff or Nilla wafers.,
Crumble the cookies.,
Dump the cookie crumbs and brown sugar into a blender.,
Add whipping cream to the running blender.,
Store in a lidded container in the refrigerator.",How to Make Cookie Butters2," You can use just about any cookie for your cookie butter, but a simple sugar cookie or tea biscuit will produce the perfect crumbs for your purposes.No matter what cookie you end up using, just be sure to try it first! If you’re not crazy about the cookie in its original form, you probably won’t love it as a soft spread.

, Using your hands or a heavy kitchen implement, crush the intact cookies until you have two cups (680 g) of crumbs. You can work with more or less cookies, as long as you adjust the quantity of brown sugar and whipping cream accordingly.


It’s okay if your cookie has some chunks in it—for example, some large oats, raisins, or chocolate chips—as long as you’re okay with the resultant butter having tangible chunks in it too.

, Mix two tablespoons (28 g) brown sugar with the cookie crumbs in an electric food processor until you've achieved a sufficiently fine, powdery mix for your butter. If mixing by hand, your mixture will be chunkier.If you find that your brown sugar has become rock-hard at the back of your cabinet, try tossing a piece of bread in the sugar bag and sealing it back up. In most cases, your brown sugar will break and soften right up., Once you have a fine blend of cookies and sugar, pour ¼ cup (85 g) whipping cream into the still-running mixer. Keep blending until you have a smooth, creamy spread.


Just about any brand of whipping cream should do the trick, but you might want to select a heavy cream—about 39% fat as opposed to the 30% in whipping cream—if you prefer richer confections., If you’re making cookie butter for a party or a family gathering, you might not have to worry about leftovers. If you’re planning to use the cookie butter gradually, though, you’ll want to put it in a lidded plastic or glass container and keep it cool.

In general, however, you'll be asked to melt the candy on medium power at 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval.Do not overcook the chocolate coating, or it will scorch.
You will melt the rest of the chocolate later. This is just to attach the lollipop sticks.

, Be sure that you are poking the stick into the side/longer part of the oval.


You can poke the lollipop sticks deeper into the cake ball if you'd like, but no more than halfway.

, Next, put the baking sheet into the fridge for 30 minutes, so that the candy coating can harden. If you are in a hurry, stick the cake balls into the freezer for 15 minutes.This is very important. If you don't allow the cake balls to set, they will slide off in the next step.

, Poke the lollipop sticks straight down into the Styrofoam block, so that the cake pops are standing upright. Be sure to leave some space between each cake pop.

, Use a small spoon to make two small dots of melted candy coating on top of each cake pop. Press a chocolate chip into the ""glue.""Hello Kitty's ears are rather far apart, so place the chocolate chips on either side of the head.
Match the flavor of the chocolate chip to the flavor of the cake pop. For example, if your made chocolate-flavored cake pops, use milk chocolate chips. If you made vanilla-flavored cake pops, use white chocolate chips.

, Do not take the cake pops off of the Styrofoam block; simply place the entire block in the fridge. If you are in a hurry, you can place it into the freezer for 15 minutes instead. This step may seem redundant, but the trick to getting cake pops just right is to work with cold cake pops. If they are room temperature, they will fall apart!

, Use a deep bowl if you can. This way, the edges of it will be cool enough to handle when you go on to dip the cake balls.


Save a few chips so that you can melt them to glue the decorations on later.

, Hold onto the lollipop stick, then dip the cake ball into the melted chocolate, all the way down to the stick. Do not twirl or swirl the cake pop.Gently lift the cake ball out of the melted chocolate.


Try to get as much of the cake ball covered. You want to avoid double-dipping. If you double-dip, the chocolate coating may slide off.
If the melted chocolate is too thick, stir in some vegetable oil to make it thinner and smoother.

, Hold the cake pop by the stick in one hand, and gently tap your wrist with the other. This will help get rid of any excess chocolate. Next, gently rotate the stick in between your fingers. This will help spread the melted chocolate more evenly across the cake pop.


If there is too much melted candy on the lollipop stick, rotate the cake pop again, but this time, keep your finger on the lollipop stick. This will wipe off the excess candy coating.

, This will allow the candy coating to set and harden., You will need about ¼ cup (45 grams). You will use this to attach the decorations in this section. Simply dip the end of a paintbrush into the melted candy, then use it to make dots where you want the decorations to go.

, Make two dots of melted candy at the base of one of the ears. Press two heart-shaped sprinkles into the candy, with the points touching. Next, make a dot of melted candy between the two hearts, right on top of the points. Press a small confetti dot or mini M&M into the glue.


For a small bow: use two small heart-shaped sprinkles, and a small confetti dot. Be sure to match the colors.For a large bow, use two large, red, heart-shaped sprinkles, and a mini red M&M., Make a dot of melted candy right in the middle of Hello Kitty's face, and press a yellow confetti dot into it.You can also use a small, yellow candy pearl.Alternatively, you can also draw the nose on using a yellow, edible ink pen.

, Dip a thin paintbrush into dark-colored food coloring, and draw two small ovals to either side of the nose.Hello Kitty's eyes are low, so make them just above the nose. They are also wide apart, so leave some space between them!


Alternatively, you can draw the eyes on using a black, edible ink pen., Using a thin paintbrush and dark food coloring, draw three whiskers on each side of Hello Kitty's face.Make them short, and as close to the edge of the face as you can. Don't let them touch the nose or eyes!


You can also draw the whiskers on using a black, edible ink pen., You can keep them on the Styrofoam block, or you can stand them upright in a nice cup.

If you are using a gas oven, set it to mark 4., Take out two 12-hole baking tins, and insert a paper case into each hole. If you do not have any 12-hole baking tin, then you can use 6-hole ones instead.

, Take 110 grams (4 ounces) of softened, unsalted butter and place it into a bowl. Then, using a whisk or electric hand mixer, beat the butter until it is fluffy in texture.


You can cut the butter into smaller pieces to make it easier to beat, but since it should already be softened, and at room-temperature, this may not be necessary.

, Once your butter is light and fluffy, add 110 grams (4 ounces) of caster sugar to the bowl and continue mixing. Set aside your whisk or mixer once both the sugar and butter are combined.

, This will make it easier to pour the eggs into the butter-sugar mixture later in the recipe. You also won't have to keep stopping to break the eggs. Also, adding your two fluid ingredients together will ensure that the vanilla flavour is spread evenly throughout.Consider using a measuring cup instead of a small bowl. The spout will make it even easier to pour the eggs into your butter-sugar mixture., You are not only mixing the two together, but you are also breaking the yolks up. This will make it easier to add them to the butter-sugar mixture, and prevent you from accidentally adding too much at one time.

, Stir the mixture as you add the eggs. Do not add the eggs all at once; you'll risk splitting or curdling the mixture.


If your mixture splits or curdles, don't worry: the mixture will even itself out once you add the flour in the next step.

, Once everything is combined, add 110 grams (4 ounces) of flour and fold it into the mixture with a spoon or spatula. Keep turning and stirring the ingredients until everything is combined.

, Start with one tablespoon of milk, add it to the batter, and mix it. If the texture is still too thick, add a little bit more milk. You want the batter to be thin enough so that you can scoop it up with a spoon, but thick enough so that it slowly drips off the spoon when you turn it upside down.

, Using a spoon or spatula, gently ease the batter into the paper cases. Start by filling each case half-way to ensure that you have enough batter for all of them. Once each paper case is filled, you can add more batter to each one.

, Transfer the tins into the oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown. Once they have finished baking, pull the tins out of the oven and set them aside so that the cakes can cool.


You can test whether or not the cakes are fully baked by poking a toothpick into the center of one. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cakes are done. If the toothpick comes out with gooey batter attached to it, the cakes are not done and need to be baked more., Let the cakes cool in the tins for a few minutes before taking them out and setting them on a rack to finish cooling. If you do not own a cooling rack, you can set the cakes down on a plate or platter instead.

, Using a sifter, sift 300 grams (10½ ounces) of icing sugar into a large bowl. This is to break apart any chunks that might have formed in the container, and prevent the icing from getting clumpy when you add water to it.

, You will need to dissolve your icing sugar with some water so that you can spread it over the fairy cakes. Start by adding two tablespoons of water and mixing it quickly with a fork. You want to end up with a somewhat runny consistency so that you can drizzle it over the fairy cakes. Add more water to make the icing thinner, and more icing sugar to make it thicker.

, You can make the icing flavoured by adding some lemon juice. Use one part lemon juice and one part water. If the icing becomes too thin, then add more of the sugar.

, You can leave the white icing as it is, or you can add colour to it to match the theme of your party. Add a few drops of food colouring to the icing and stir. For darker icing, use more food colouring. If the icing becomes too thin, then add a little bit more of the sugar.

, If you want a richer fairy cake, you can use buttercream icing instead. If you wish to make butterfly cakes, then you will need buttercream icing in order to secure the wings. Refer to the section on making butterfly cakes if you wish to learn how to turn fairy cakes into butterfly cakes.

, Take 125 grams (4½ ounces) of soft, unsalted butter and place it into a bowl. Then, using a whisk or electric hand mixer, beat the butter until it is soft and fluffy.

, Once the butter is soft and fluffy, take 200 grams (7 ounces) of sifted icing sugar and add it to the fluffy butter. Mix it together slowly, then faster and faster until everything is combined.

, You will need one tablespoon of milk and one teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix everything together until everything is combined. You want the final texture to be smooth and creamy. If the buttercream is too stiff, then you can soften it by adding some more milk.


You can make the buttercream more colourful by adding in a few drops of food colouring with your milk and vanilla extract.

, Just because they are called ""fairy cakes"" does not mean that your baked delights must resemble fairies. You can decorate your fairy cakes however you want. You can even make them look like butterflies. Read this section to get some ideas and decorating tips.


If you wish to make your fairy cakes look like butterflies, then refer to the section in this article on making butterfly cakes.

, If you do not let the cakes cool off completely before decorating them, the buttercream or icing will melt and become runny.

, You can create a more unified appearance by tinting the colour of the icing or buttercream to match the colour of the paper cases the cakes are in. For example: a fairy cake in a pink cup will get pink icing, and a fairy cake in a blue cup will get blue icing, while a fairy cake in a green cup will get green icing. If you choose to do this, you will have to make separate batches of icing, one for each colour.

, When you are decorating your fairy cakes, consider using icing colours and sprinkles that match the holiday, season, or theme. Here are some ideas:


If it is around Halloween, tint the icing orange, and decorate with orange and brown sugar strands.
If it is spring, then decorate the cakes using white or pastel-coloured icing and sugar flowers or flower-shaped sprinkles.
If the fairy cakes are for a party, take the party's colours into consideration. For example, if the theme colours of the party are blue and white, then tint the icing blue, and use white hundreds and thousands.

, Using a spoon, scoop up some icing and pour it onto the fairy cakes. You can use just a small amount, or you can cover the entire top of the fairy cake until the icing becomes level with the paper cup.Refer to the section in this article on making icing to learn how to make some.

, If you want your cakes to be less sweet, you can use a small spoon to drizzle the icing onto the top of the cakes. You can create random designs, zigzag patterns, or even swirls.

, If you want just a small amount of icing, you can dip the fairy cakes in the icing instead. Simply turn the cake upside down and dip the top into the icing, then turn it right side up and let the icing drip down the dome.

, If you wish to have a richer fairy cake, then decorate it with buttercream icing instead. You can either spread the icing onto each cake using a knife, or you can pipe the icing on using a decorating bag and a tip of your choice. Refer to the section on making buttercream icing to learn how to make some.


If you do not have a decorating bag, you can make your own by filling a plastic bag with buttercream icing and cutting one of the corners of the bag off. Secure the open part of the bag either by knotting it or by tying a rubber band around it. This is so that the icing doesn't squish out the wrong way while you are using it.

, Cover the tops of the cakes with icing or buttercream first, then add some hundreds and thousands, sugar strands, or sprinkles. You can use as much or as little as you like.


You can also spread buttercream over the domes of each cake, and then dip the frosted part into a bowl of sugar sprinkles.

, After you have covered the top of each fairy cake with icing, you can give your fairy cakes a more dainty, sophisticated touched by adding crystallized violets, tiny edible roses, and wafer flowers., After covering your fairy cake with icing or a swirl of buttercream, top it off with a glacé cherry. You can also add some hundreds and thousands, sugar strands, or sprinkles if you are feeling extra fancy., Before you can serve the fairy cakes, wait for the icing to set and harden.

, If you wish to make butterfly cakes, you will need to prepare some fairy cakes first. You will also need to prepare some buttercream icing. Once the cakes have cooled, you can begin turning your fairy cakes into butterfly cakes.


To make the base cakes, refer to the section on making fairy cakes.
To prepare some buttercream icing, refer to the section on making buttercream icing.

, Using a serrated knife, cut part of the dome off on each cake. You want to angle the knife slightly while you cut, so that you are creating a small groove in each cake. You will be filling this groove with buttercream icing later.

, Your butterfly cakes will need some wings. You can create wings for your cakes by cutting each dome in half, creating little half-domes.

, You will need to fill the grooves you made earlier in your cakes with buttercream icing. Not only does this give the cakes extra flavour, but it also helps secure the wings. You can fill the grooves with icing either by spreading icing into them with a knife, or by piping icing into them using a decorating bag.


If you do not have a decorating bag, you can make your own by filling a plastic bag with buttercream icing and cutting the corner off. To prevent the icing from squishing out the opposite way and getting all over your hands, secure the open part of the bag either by knotting it or by wrapping a rubber band around it.

, At this point, you can add the wings, or you can make the butterfly cakes more colourful and flavourful by dding a dollop of lemon curd or jam. Simply spoon a little bit of lemon curd or jam right right in the centre of each cake. This can be the body of the butterfly., Each butterfly cake gets two half-dome wings. Place the wings on top of the buttercream and to either side of the dollop of curd or jam. Apply gentle pressure. You want them to stick, but you don't want them to be completely submerged in the icing. The parts that were originally the top of the cakes should be facing each other, and the parts that were in the groove should be facing out. The flat edge, created from when you cut the wings in half, should be in the buttercream.

, At this point, you can leave your butterfly cakes as they are, or you can add some variety with icing sugar. To do this, simply dust some sifted icing sugar on top of each cake. Make sure to get the wings!


You can use coloured sugar or hundreds and thousands instead of icing sugar. This will make the butterfly cakes more colourful.

Mud cake is one of the best types of cake for this project, because it’s less delicate than a sponge cake, and will hold its shape better. To make the volcano cake, you'll also need:


Oven preheated to 350 F (177 C)
Small saucepan and a medium glass bowl
Large mixing bowl
Whisk
Electric beaters
Rubber spatula or spoon
Three wire cooling racks
Round cookie cutter, about three inches in diameter
Knife
Frosting knife
Plastic shot glass
Tongs
Dry ice and water;
, Fill the bottom of a saucepan with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the glass bowl on top of the saucepan, making sure the water doesn’t touch. Add the butter and chocolate. Heat the mixture over medium heat.


Whisk the butter and chocolate as they melt, and then whisk vigorously for about 30 seconds until they are completely incorporated., Remove the saucepan from the heat and place the bowl on a heat-proof surface. Add the sugar and cocoa, and whisk the mixture to fully combine all the ingredients.


Make sure there are no lumps in the mixture, and whisk until it’s smooth.

, Add the hot coffee in thirds, whisking in each addition until combined before adding more coffee. When you add the final third of coffee, whisk in the vanilla as well. Finally, add the eggs, beating them in one at a time.


Whisking in the ingredients separately like this will help ensure a smooth and moist cake, because it will help incorporate air into the batter.

, Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk for about 30 seconds to remove lumps and stir air into the ingredients.Adding air to the mixture will help ensure the cake is light and not too dense.

, Place the electric beaters into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Turn the beaters on low, and slowly pour in the chocolate mixture. After a minute, increase the speed to medium-high and beat for one minute.


After a minute, stop the mixer. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with the rubber spatula, and then beat the batter again for another 30 seconds on medium speed.

, Divide the batter among the three greased cake pans, filling each pan about three-quarters full. Mud cake doesn’t rise as much as regular cake batter, so you can fill the pans a little more. Bake the cakes for 35 to 40 minutes.


You know the cakes are ready when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, or with a few fudge-covered crumbs attached., Remove the cakes from the oven and let them rest in the cake pans for 10 minutes. Then turn them out onto wire cooling racks, and allow them to cool completely before assembling and frosting the volcano cake.The cakes should be room temperature before you start frosting them, otherwise the frosting will melt off.

, Combine the butter, vanilla, icing sugar, cocoa powder, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the milk in a medium mixing bowl. Beat everything with electric beaters for three to four minutes, until the frosting is light, creamy, and smooth.If the frosting is too dense and thick, add another tablespoon of milk and beat for another minute. Add the fourth tablespoon if necessary
When ready, the frosting will be light and easily spreadable.

, Take the smallest cake (the six-inch) and position the round cookie cutter in the very center of the cake. Press down as far as you can, and then twist the cookie cutter as you pull upward. This will remove the center of the cake.


The hole in the center of the cake will be used as a reservoir for the lava, and it will also hold the shot glass containing the dry ice.

, Place the large 10-inch cake on a cake plate or serving platter. Use the frosting knife to cover the top with a generous and even layer of buttercream frosting. Place the medium eight-inch cake on top of it, centering it on the larger cake. Spread a layer of frosting on the top of the medium cake.


Finally, place the smallest cake on top of the medium cake, making sure the hole in the middle of the cake is at the center of the volcano.

, Because there's a two-inch difference in the diameter of the cakes, the volcano would be jagged if you frosted it as is. To make the volcano smooth, use a knife to shave the excess off the sides of the cake, making a smooth transition between the layers.When you're done, the cake should look like a smooth cone without the pointed top.

, Piping gel is often used as an edible glue for baking, but in this recipe, it will be used to create the lava for the volcano. In a small saucepan, whisk together the cornstarch and water until there are no lumps. When the mixture is smooth, whisk in the corn syrup. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring regularly. Boil the gel for two to three minutes, and the mixture will take on the consistency of gel.Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in 10 drops of red gel food coloring. If necessary, whisk in another 10 drops, until the gel is a deep and bright red.
Set the gel aside to cool.

, Use the frosting knife to cover the entire outside of the cake with a generous layer of frosting. Spread the frosting in an even layer, and smooth it down with the knife.


Place the cake in the fridge for about an hour to let the frosting set. This crumb coat will trap any crumbs, and make the final layer of frosting smooth and even., When the crumb coat has had time to set, remove the cake from the fridge. Apply a second layer of frosting to the cake, making sure it’s evenly distributed over the whole cake. Because it’s a volcano cake, you don’t actually have to worry about the frosting being smooth.To give the volcano some definition, use the butt end of a knife to carve some vertical curved lines into the frosting. This will replicate the jagged and uneven lines of rocks.

, Pour the red piping gel into the hole in the center of the top cake. If the reservoir fills up, let the excess run down over the outside of the volcano like lava.If there isn't enough gel to fill the reservoir, use a spoon to drizzle extra lava over the sides.

, Just before serving the cake, use tongs to fill the shot glass half full with dry ice. Place the shot glass into the center of the lava reservoir.Pour in enough hot water to make the dry ice create smoke.For an extra fiery effect, use sparklers instead of candles on the volcano cake.

Look at the total number of servings indicated by the recipe instructions. Compare that amount to the estimated number of servings indicated for each topsy turvy cake pan you plan to use. If the recipe makes less than you need, increase the recipe. If it makes more, cut the recipe down.;
, The exact temperature can vary based on the cake batter you prepare, but usually, you will need to preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius).


If you are only baking in pans that are 10 inches (25 cm) or smaller, preheat the oven to 315 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius). If you're also including a 12-inch (30-cm) or 14-inch (36-cm) layer, however, you should stick with 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius).
These temperature guidelines should apply to nearly all boxed cake batters and most homemade batters. If a cake has to bake at an abnormally high or low temperature, however, you should consult the instructions and preheat the oven according to the guidelines they provide.

, Spray each of the topsy turvy cake pans with nonstick cooking spray. Make sure that the bottom and sides are thoroughly coated to prevent the finished cake from sticking.


Shortening or butter can be used to grease the pans if nonstick cooking spray is unavailable.
To provide an extra layer of protection, you can also dust the inside of each pan lightly with flour after greasing it.

, Pour your prepared batter into each of the cake pans. Only fill the pans roughly three-quarters high with batter.Do not fill the pans to the top. Leave one-quarter of the pan (measured from the shallowest end) empty to allow the cake room to expand as it bakes. Otherwise, you will be left with layers that have a rounded top, and that rounded top will need to be trimmed off if you want the layers to stack well.

, Insert two to four flower nails into the batter at the deep end of each cake pan. The head of each nail should rest on the batter and the rest of the nail should point down.A flower nail is a metal tool typically used for holding flower decorations on cakes. Note that a heating core can be used instead of a flower nail.
Use two or three nails for a 10-inch (25-cm) layer and three or four nails for larger sizes.
Grease the inside and outside of the heat conductor before inserting it into the deep side of the batter.
If you are using a heating core, make sure that batter gets inside the core.
The metal of the nail or core conducts heat, thereby providing more concentrated heat to the portion of batter it's in. By placing the conductors in the deep side of the pan, you can help the deep side cook evenly with the shallow end.

, The exact amount of time can vary depending on the size of the pan and the cake batter. For most cakes, you should start checking the cake for doneness after 25 minutes pass.


To check for doneness, stick a knife or toothpick into the thickest end of each cake layer. The tool should come out dry and clean. If you drag batter out of the cake, continue cooking for another 5 to 10 minutes and check again.
Get a more accurate estimate of how long to cook the cake by referring to the recipe instructions.

, Once the cake has finished cooking, immediately remove the flower nails from the finished cake.


If you used heating cores instead of flower nails, you will need to remove the core and carefully remove the cake from inside the core after it has cooled. Use this small cylinder of cake to fill the hole in your cake layer left by the core.

, Let the layers cool in their pans for 10 to 15 minutes before carefully removing each one.


Place the pans on wire racks as the cake cools inside.
After 10 to 15 minutes, slide a butter knife around the edges of the pan to help separate the cake from the pan. Carefully tip the pan upside-down and tap on the bottom with your fingers. The cake should fall out.
If the cake does not fall out on its own, you might need to carefully glide a knife or spatula beneath the cake while it is still in the pan to help loosen it.

, Gently each layer of cake in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for two to three hours, or until it has completely cooled.


You can let the cakes cool at room temperature, but refrigerated cooling is more thorough.
Cooled cakes are easier to work with than warm cakes, and you'll likely end up with less mess if you handle the cake once it has cooled instead of handling it while it is warm and soft.

, A topsy turvy cake must be assembled in a way that keeps the center of gravity positioned above the cake's base of support. Regardless of how you stack the tiers, this physics principle must be kept in mind.


Topsy turvy cakes use a principle known as counterbalance to keep the center of gravity properly positioned. Each wedge of the cake should counter its neighboring wedge so that the weight is distributed evenly throughout the structure.In other words, the slant of one layer must run at an angle opposite the slant of the second layer. The slant of the third layer should run in the same angle as the first and opposite the second.
Don't be afraid to turn your layers upside-down as you stack them, if necessary. As long as each layer is aligned to the center of gravity of the bottom layer, and the weight of each layer balances out the weight of the layers around it, the cake should remain stable and upright.

, Set the bottom layer down on a large cake board. Spoon a large glob of frosting onto the layer and spread it evenly over the top.


The cake board should be slightly larger than the bottom of the cake. You'll need to be able to lift this board to move the cake around.
It is strongly recommended that you ""glue"" the bottom of the cake to the cake board by spooning 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of frosting on the center of the cake board before resting this bottom layer on top.
You will need to spoon anywhere from 1 to 1.5 cups (250 to 375 ml) of frosting on top of this bottom layer. You should have a layer of frosting at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) once you smooth it out.

, Position the second layer on top of the bottom layer, following the design scheme you decided on earlier.


Step back and look at the cake after positioning this second layer. If the upper layer appears to be sliding or slipping from its place, you may need to alter the way it is positioned to keep the cake more balanced and aligned to its center of gravity.

, Slide two to four wooden dowels into the top of your second cake layer. These dowels should be long enough to go through the second layer and into the bottom layer.


Make sure that the dowels are flush with the top-most layer they'll be in.Push the dowel through both layers of cake.
Mark around the part of the dowel just above the surface of the cake with a pencil, then pull it back out.
Trim the dowel at your mark. Make sure that you cut the dowel at the appropriate angle so that it slants along with the tilt of your cake layers.
Re-insert the dowel back into both layers.



, Continue stacking the topsy turvy tiers on top of one another using the same general pattern. Cover the top of the last layer with frosting, then set the next layer on top of it. Insert more wooden dowels to keep the structure steady.


For the dowels leading into the top layer of cake, cut each one so that it is just shy of the combined height of the top and second-from-top layers. Insert the dowels into the second-from-top layer, then put the top layer in place. The dowels should not pierce through the top of the final layer.
Once all of your cake layers are in place, you should insert one large dowel through the center of the entire structure., When you want to frost the sides of the cake, you'll need to apply a thin crumb coat to the exposed cake, trapping any loose crumbs inside.


Note that the cake will show through the crumb coating. You only want to use a thin layer of frosting to trap the loose crumbs. This layer will not be visible once the cake is complete.

, If your refrigerator is large enough, place the cake inside for roughly 30 minutes to help the crumb coat set.


If you cannot chill the cake in your refrigerator, you should at least let it rest in a cool room for several minutes before handling it again. Consider placing a small fan in front of it to help the frosting cool.
Ideally, the frosting should become so cool that it no longer feels sticky.

, Apply a thicker layer of frosting over the crumb coat of the cake. Continue until all sides are thoroughly coated and smooth.


Before frosting the cake, slide strips of wax paper underneath the bottom of the cake, forming a square frame. Excess frosting will get on the wax paper instead of the cake board or platter. When you finish frosting the cake, you can remove the wax paper strips and the mess all at once.

, From this point on, you can apply any decorations you want using additional icing, candies, or non-edible embellishments.


Once you've added the finishing touches to your decorations, the cake will be complete and ready to serve.

, Make them look like stacking blocks that have been dropped on the tray; they don't have to line up perfectly!

, Choose a different color for each cake block. Use a frosting knife to spread a thin layer of frosting to cover each block. Place the tray of blocks in the refrigerator while you prepare the marshmallows.

, The marshmallow halves will make up the nodes on the blocks. Make enough marshmallow halves so that the square cake pieces each get 4 halves, the big rectangles get 6, and the small rectangles get 2., Remove the cake blocks from the refrigerator. Take a marshmallow half and spread a thin layer of icing coordinated with the frosting color of the cake block you're decorating. For example, if you're working with a cake block you frosted in blue, use blue frosting on the marshmallow half. Continuing in this way, place the marshmallow halves in even rows on the cake blocks so that each block has the correct number of halves.

, Use the rest of the frosting to spread another layer over the cake blocks, this time covering the marshmallows as well. Continue until all of the cake blocks have been neatly frosted.,,"

Carefully cut out the rounds, following the outline as closely as possible., After the cake finishes baking and has cooled slightly, remove the cake layers from their pans and allow them to finish cooling on a wire rack. Once the cakes have completely cooled, place each one right side up on its respective foam board round. Wrap the layers in plastic and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or freeze up to 7 days.


If you freeze the cake, make sure to thaw it out so that it is cool but not frozen as you begin to work. You should thaw the cake out at least one day ahead of time.

, Steady the layer by placing your hand on the top and cut through it evenly, using your light outline as a guide. Remove the top half of each layer and leave the bottom half on the foam board.

, Use a cake decorating bag to pipe the filling onto each cut side or spread the whipped cream on thick using a knife. Re-join the cut halves by sandwiching the frosted sides together.

You then layer the cakes to create the main shape, and use fondant to decorate the cake and make the defining SpongeBob characteristics. To make the cakes, you'll need your ingredients and some kitchen supplies, including:

An oven preheated to 350 F (177 C)
Large and small bowl
Hand mixer
Sifter
3 rectangular cake pans, 7 by 11 inches (18 by 28 cm) each, greased
3 wire cooling racks;
, Place the butter in a large mixing bowl and beat it on medium speed with the hand mixer for one to two minutes. Add the sugar and continue beating for another seven minutes.You can use a stand mixer if you don’t have a hand mixer, or a whisk.

, Crack one egg into a small bowl, and remove any pieces of shell if they fall in. Then add the egg to the butter and sugar mixture. Beat the mixture on medium speed until fully incorporated. Repeat for the remaining eggs, adding each individually.It’s always a good idea to crack eggs into a separate bowl first, because that way pieces of shell don’t get lost in your batter.

, Sift half the flour into the bowl with the eggs, butter, and sugar. Beat the mixture on medium speed until all the ingredients are just incorporated. Then add half the milk, and continue beating to bring the ingredients together. Sift and beat in the remaining flour, followed by the rest of the milk.

To make your own self-rising flour, add 1½ teaspoons (6 g) of baking powder and ¼ teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt per cup of all-purpose flour., Beat the mixture for one more minute, or until all the ingredients are combined. Stop as soon as all the lumps are gone and everything is fully mixed.Overmixing the batter will develop the gluten in the flour, and this will result in a cake that’s tough and dense.

, Divide the batter equally among the three greased cake pans. Tap the cake pans against a flat surface to level the batter. Transfer the cakes to the preheated oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. The cake is ready when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.If you only have one rectangular cake pan, cook the three cakes in separate batches.
You can also use 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-cm) cake pans if that’s the size you have. The cake will be slightly larger and a little shorter.

, When the cakes are ready, remove them from the oven and set them aside to cool for 10 minutes. Then turn the cakes out onto the wire cooling racks, and let them cool to room temperature, about one to two hours.While you're waiting for the cakes to cool, you can make your frosting and fondant. If you try to frost the cake when it’s still hot, the frosting will melt.

, Make a double boiler by setting a large glass bowl into a medium saucepan filled with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Add the marshmallows and water to the bowl and heat the double boiler over medium heat. Stir regularly as the marshmallows melt, continuing until they're fully melted and smooth.

You can also use a proper double boiler if you have one.
Make sure the water isn't touching the bottom of the glass bowl. If an inch of water is too much, pour out some water, otherwise the marshmallows may burn.

, Once the marshmallows are fully melted, remove the double boiler from the heat. Place the bowl onto a heat-proof surface or mat. Pour in the candy melts while the marshmallow is still warm, and stir until they're completely melted and incorporated.The candy melts will make the fondant firmer and more elastic, and will prevent it from drying out too quickly.

, Combine the sugar and marshmallow mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until all the sugar has been incorporated. Then turn the dough out onto a flat surface dusted with powdered sugar. Knead the mixture until it comes together as a soft, sticky dough.

When you're first mixing the sugar and marshmallows, you can use a stand or hand mixer fitted with a dough hook instead of stirring it by hand.

, Cover the dough in a thin layer of vegetable shortening. Wrap the dough tightly in a layer of plastic wrap. Place the dough into a sealable plastic bag, push out all the air, and seal the bag. Then transfer the dough to the fridge and let it rest for at least four hours.Let the dough rest for as long as possible, ideally overnight.

, After the dough has had time to relax, remove it from the fridge and allow it to warm to room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour. Then, with a sharp knife, divide the fondant into five sections:

Cut the fondant in half and set one half aside for the yellow body.
Divide the other half of the dough into three equal portions. Set two of those aside for the brown and white accents.
With the remaining portion of dough, divide that in half again. This will be for the red and blue accents.

, Place the largest portion of fondant onto a flat surface dusted with powdered sugar. Add 10 drops of yellow gel food coloring and knead the color into the dough to distribute it evenly. Add more color as necessary to achieve the desired shade of yellow.

Repeat with the smaller sections of dough and the remaining colors, adding food coloring in five-drop increments. Be sure to wipe down the counter between colors to avoid cross-contamination.
For the white portion of dough, simply leave it the color of the original fondant.

, Place the butter into a medium mixing bowl and beat for one to two minutes with a hand mixer on medium speed. Add half the sugar and cocoa and beat to incorporate. Add half the milk and beat, followed by the remaining sugar and cocoa. Pour in the last of the milk and beat for three to four minutes on medium speed.

Finally, add the vanilla and beat for one more minute., Most of the frosting will be used to layer the cakes and to act as a glue for the fondant, but you also need some black frosting for different accents on the cake. Remove one-quarter of the frosting and place it into a separate bowl.

Add five drops of black food coloring to the small portion of frosting, and beat to distribute the color. Add more color as necessary to achieve a black frosting.

, With a long cake or bread knife, cut off a thin layer from the top of each cake to level the surface. Place one cake on a cake platter or serving plate. Spread a layer of brown frosting on top of the cake. Place a second cake on top of the first cake.

Spread a layer of frosting on top of the second cake. Place the third cake on top of the second cake.

, When you’ve assembled the three layers of cake, spread a layer of frosting over the top and sides of the cake. Smooth out the surface of the frosting so the fondant will have an even surface to stick to.

Place the cake into the fridge and let the frosting rest for about 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, remove the cake from the fridge and orient it so the rectangle is lengthwise (vertical) in front of you on your work surface.

, Turn the yellow fondant out onto a flat surface dusted with powdered sugar. Use a rolling pin to roll the fondant out into a rectangle that’s one-eighth inch (0.3 cm) thick.

Carefully pick up the fondant and lay it over the top three-quarters of the cake. Starting at the center of the cake, gently press the fondant down, molding it to the top and sides of the cake.
When you get to the base of the cake, use a pizza cutter to trim off the excess. Then press the edges of the fondant into the base of the cake.
Set the remaining yellow fondant aside for the nose and cheeks.

, Roll out the brown fondant in the same way that you did the yellow. Use a pizza cutter to trim the top edge off the fondant in a straight line. This will be the waistline on SpongeBob’s pants.


Pick up the fondant and lay it over the bottom 2 inches (5 cm) of the cake.
Gently press the fondant down, molding it to the top and sides of the cake. Trim the excess from around the base and set it aside.

, Roll the white fondant out into a rectangle like you did with the yellow and brown. Make sure the rectangle is at least 10 inches (25 cm) long by two inches (5 cm) wide. Use a pizza cutter to cut a 2-inch (5-cm) lengthwise strip from the white fondant. Leave the rest of the fondant rolled out.

Lay the white strip onto the cake in between the brown and yellow fondant. Don’t worry if the white overlaps the yellow.
Press the white fondant down into the cake gently, and press it into either side of the cake. Trim off the excess and set it aside.

, Using a round cake tool, a large marble, or a golf ball, punch some dimples all over the top and sides of the cake. These are meant to replicate the holes in the sponge.Make the impressions about a half-inch (1.3 cm) deep into the fondant.

, Use a round cookie cutter with a 2-inch (5-cm) diameter and cut out two circles of white fondant. Then roll out the blue fondant into a circle (one-eighth inch thick) and cut out two 1-inch circles.Place one blue circle into the center of each white circle, and press the blue down gently to secure it in place.
Position the eyes about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the top of the cake. Place them on top of the yellow fondant, side by side in the center of the cake.
To make the pupil, place a pea-sized dab of black icing at the center of each blue circle.

, Break off enough yellow fondant to make three balls with half-inch diameters. Take one ball and roll it in your hands to elongate it into a 1-inch (2.5-cm) tube for the nose. Place the tube below and in between the two eyes.To make the cheeks, place a ball of yellow fondant at the bottom outer corner of each eye.

, With a sharp knife, carefully make a slit in the fondant to create the mouth. The slit should be a concave semicircle at the center of the cake that connects the two cheeks.

To make the teeth, slide two candy-coated chewing gums into the slit that you made for the mouth. Position the candy-coated chewing gums near the center of the mouth, about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) apart.

, Roll out the red fondant into a square. With a pizza cutter or knife, cut out a diamond shape with an elongated top that’s about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) long. Lay the tie down lengthwise on top of the white and brown fondant, in the center of the shirt, with the elongated section at the top.Cut off any excess from the top so the tie doesn’t overhang the white fondant.

, Place the black frosting into a pastry bag, and fit the bag with a small round tip. Use the pastry bag to pipe black lines to outline SpongeBob’s eyes, waistband, tie, and teeth.

You can also use the black frosting to create additional features, including the belt and the collar. To make the collar, pipe one upside down triangle on either side of the tie.

Insert the skewers into the ship.,
Chill until ready to serve.",How to Make a Pirate Ship Cake," Meanwhile, prepare two 8-inch (20-cm) square baking pans by greasing them and dusting them with a light coating of all-purpose flour.

Cover a clean, dry paper towel with a generous dab of shortening, then wipe the shortening over the bottoms and sides of both pans. You could also grease the pans using butter or nonstick cooking spray.
Sprinkle about 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of flour into each pan. Carefully shift and rock the pans from side to side, continuing until the entire bottoms are coated with flour. Dump the excess flour out of the pans.;
, Combine the cake mix, eggs, water, and melted butter in a large mixing bowl. Beat the ingredients together using an electric mixer set to medium or high speed, and continue for several minutes, or until evenly combined.

While these ingredients are standard for boxed cake mixes, consult the instructions on the back of the box for more precise amounts; follow the brand instructions for best results. Some cakes may call for more eggs, water, or fat.
Note that most boxed mixes will instruct you to use vegetable oil instead of butter, but using equal amounts of melted butter will give the cake a much richer flavor., Evenly split the cake batter into your two prepared baking pans. Gently shift the pans from side to side, making the batter level., Place both pans onto the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake the cake for about 30 minuets, or until a toothpick inserted into the centers of both portions comes out clean.

Exact baking times may vary depending on the cake mix you use; consult the box for more precise instructions, when possible.
If you're uncertain about how fast the cake will bake, it's best to start checking it after the first 20 minutes of baking time. Continue checking every 2 to 5 minutes until the cake is ready.

, Remove both pans of the finished cake out of the oven. Allow the cake to cool to room temperature inside the pans, then carefully tip both portions out onto a clean work surface.

Afterward, wrap both portions with plastic wrap, then place them into a freezer for about 15 minutes. While this part of the process isn't strictly necessary, it may make the cake easier to cut and manipulate while minimizing the amount of crumbs left behind.

, Each half should measure about 4 inches (10 cm) wide by 8 inches (20 cm) long.

This step should result in four evenly sized rectangles of cake. You'll need to trim and stack these rectangles in various ways to create the body of the ship.
After dividing the cake into these four rectangles, center one rectangle over a cake board or piece of parchment paper. This rectangle will be the bottom layer of cake.

, Pipe this frosting on top of the bottom cake layer, creating the outline of the hull.

Create a rectangle measuring about 4 inches (10 cm) wide by inches (15 cm) long, starting at one end of the cake.
Just beyond the first rectangle, draw a curved triangle over the remaining cake that meets at a point in the center of the untouched end.
Fill in both outlines with about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of buttercream to help define the shape and hold the layers together.

, Stack another rectangle of cake directly on top of the first layer. Draw the shape of the hull on top of this layer, as well, using piped buttercream.

Note that the shape of the hull should be about the same for both layer.

, Using a sharp knife, cut the third portion of cake into three separate pieces, working along the length of the rectangle.

One piece should measure about 4 inches (10 cm) long, and the other two should each measure about 2 inches (5 cm) long.
Set the middle section aside for now. Use the longest portion and opposite end for the next step.

, Position the long section of cake over the triangular portion of icing, matching the layer end-to-end. Place the short section of cake over the rectangular portion of icing, matching it end-to-end with that side.

Using icing, pipe the same triangular outline over the front end of the hull, matching it as closely as possible to the previous two layers.
Cover the tops of both pieces with buttercream to help the final layer stick.

, Using a sharp, serrated knife, carve the front hull out of all three layers. Follow the buttercream outlines previously created, using them as a guide to shape the hull.

You can round off the corners of the rectangular end, if desired, but doing so is not strictly necessary.

, Slice the final rectangle into two 4-inch (10-cm) square pieces of cake.

Using the serrated knife, carve one of these pieces into the same triangular shape currently featured at the front of the hull.
If you rounded the back corners of the main body, you should round off those corners on the other piece of cake, as well.
Since the cake becomes less stable as you stack the layers, it's best to carve these portions of cake before stacking them onto your previous layer.

, Stack the triangular front hull piece on top of the matching front hull of the main cake. Stack the 4-inch (10-cm) wide rectangle on top of the back end, cover it with buttercream, and stack the final 2-inch (5-cm) rectangle on top of that.

Position the two back pieces so that the back ends lie flush against the back of the overall cake.

, Using the other half of the open can of frosting, spread a thin layer of buttercream over all exposed sides of the cake.

Don't worry if crumbs dislodge and get caught in the frosting; the point of a crumb coat is to catch these crumbs and prevent them from sneaking into the final, visible layer of icing.

,

Alternatively, you can refrigerate the cake 8 hours to overnight instead of freezing it.
It might be tempting to skip this step, but doing so would be highly discouraged. Room temperature cake will be difficult to frost and decorate in an elaborate manner.

,

It may take some practice before you'll be able to make the frosting smooth, especially around the awkward inner corners of the cake.
To make the process as easy as possible, spoon generous portions of frosting over all areas and patiently glide it over the flat surfaces using an icing spatula. Work carefully and slowly; do not attempt to rush through this part of the process.

, Cut four to eight square pretzel snaps in half. Line them up side by side along the front edge and back edge of the ship, creating railings.

Place the pretzels cut-side down into the icing, pressing just firmly enough to hold them in place.
If desired, consider using chocolate-covered pretzel snaps or covering the pretzels in milk chocolate on your own before using them to decorate the ship.

, Use mini peanut butter cups to add a few round windows to both sides of the ship. Place two windows on either side of the pointed hull, and three windows on either side of the rectangular back. You can add a final window at the very back of the ship, as well.

Press the wider end of the peanut butter cups into the icing, using just enough pressure to help them stick.
If you're allergic to peanut butter, consider using round pretzels or other small cup-shaped candies instead.

, Trim to size, if necessary.

If you are unable to find chocolate sticks, consider using a shortened pretzel stick. You can even use a trimmed straw or the mouthpiece of a party horn if you don't mind this part being inedible.

,

These two pieces of construction paper will become the sails.

, Poke one wooden skewer through one sail in two places, threading it all the way through until the flat end of the skewer rests at the top of the sail. Repeat with the other skewer and other sail.

For cleaner holes, consider punching the holes with a hole punch instead of poking them out with the skewer itself.
Note that the skewer should enter and exit the sail from the same side of the paper. Place the enter and exist holes about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) away from the top and bottom of the paper, and keep the holes centered long the long side of the sail.
When finished, you'll have two masts to add to your ships.

, Carefully insert one mast through the front center of the ship. Insert the other mast through the back center.

In addition to adding further decoration to the cake, these skewers should help hold the layers steady, making it more difficult for the cake to fall apart on accident., The pirate ship cake is now fully decorated and ready to show off. Keep it in the refrigerator until you're ready to bring it to your guests."

Be sure you have all the necessary ingredients that the recipe calls for. Both boxes of cake batter can be made at the same time, but don’t increase the beating time.Don’t make more than two boxes of cake batter together. If you plan to make more cake batter, prepare them in separate batches.;
, Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease your three, round, 8-inch wide cake pans and one, 8-inch wide, 1½ quart ovenproof glass bowl, by rubbing the inside of the pans and bowl with approximately ½ tablespoon of vegetable shortening.Sprinkle flour over the coated pans and bowl, and tap out any extra flour.The bowl will function as a cake pan for the top portion of the cake, which will be rounded, and serve as the top of the princess’ dress.
The width of the bowl should relatively match the width of your cake pans. A same sized bowl will make the cake alignments a lot more uniform.
Don’t use cooking spray to grease the pans.When the cake batter is mixed and the pans and bowl are ready, pour 3¼ cups of batter into the ovenproof bowl, and split the remaining cake batter amongst the three remaining cake pans.There will be a little less than 2 cups for each remaining cake pan., Bake the pans together in the oven for about 23 – 30 minutes and bake the bowl separately for about 47 – 53 minutes.The bowl cake will be completely baked when you can insert a toothpick into the cake, and it comes out clean.Allow the cakes to cool for about 10 minutes before you turn them over and remove them from their baking containers. Let the cakes cool completely for about 45 minutes – 1 hour before you start working with them.Allowing the cakes sufficient enough time to cool will help them crumble less as you cut and frost them.

, Use a large, serrated knife to slice off the very top portion of the various cake layers. You should only be slicing off about ¼ inch of cake from the different cake layers. This leveling off of the cake layers will help the cakes stick together when you frost and stack them. Cut the bowl cake layer in half, horizontally to make two even portions.Consider using a spinning pedestal to rotate the bowl cake as you cut through the middle of the cake., You can decorate your cake with colored, commercial frosting, white, commercial frosting dyed with food coloring to the color of your choice, or you can make your own frosting. Buttercream frosting is a very popular and common frosting choice for homemade cakes.Whichever you prefer, have approximately 4 – 5 cups of frosting mixed and ready to be used in a separate bowl.

The frosting amount really depends on how much frosting you plan to use on your cake, but it also allows for enough extra frosting to decorate and pipe the rest of the cake. For a typical frosting formula, consider doubling the recipe.If you plan to purchase white, commercial frosting and dye it with food coloring, you will only need a couple drops of food coloring to change the color of the frosting. For example, if you want to dye white frosting green, consider adding one drop of blue dye, and two drops of yellow dye.
Start will less dye, and build upon it. You can always add more dye to darken the shade of the frosting.

, Use a pastry cutter to cut a 1¾ diameter hole into the center of all the different cake layers.Simply place a round, 1¾ diameter pastry cutter on the center of a cake layer, and push the cutter down through the cake. Gently pull the pastry cutter up from the cake, and remove the cake portion in the center of the cutter. Continue to cut a hole in the center of all the cake layers.

These center holes are where the princess doll’s legs will fit into the cake.

, Place a cardboard round (the same size as your cake) underneath your cake before you start frosting and decorating it. That way, the cardboard can easily be moved when you’re ready to present your cake.Also, consider placing the cardboard round and the cake on a spinning pedestal, so it’s easier to manipulate as you decorate and frost the cake. When you’re ready to frost, scoop a dollop of cake frosting (about 1/3 cup), and use a knife or an offset spatula to evenly spread out the frosting on top of the cake.Place another cake layer on top of the frosting, with the cut off, leveled surface of the cake layer facing down. Again, use your spatula to spread out a thin layer of frosting on top of the cake.

Keep stacking the layers of your cake until you place the final, rounded bowl cake layer on top. Once all the cake layers are “glued” together with the frosting, cover the entire cake with a preliminary crumb coat layer of frosting.

, Scoop up dollops of frosting, and spread them out all over the entire cake. Use your offset spatula to smooth out the frosting around the cake.You could also try using a piece of paper to smooth out the crumb coat.

Curve a piece of paper cut into an approximately 2-inch wide strip, and curve the paper to follow the shape of the cake.
Place the piece of paper at the bottom of the cake, and tilt and draw the paper up the side of the cake to the top, so the paper drags along the cake frosting.Wipe off any excess frosting on the side of the frosting bowl, and continue to smooth out the frosting around the rest of the cake.

, Place the frosted cake in the freezer for about 45 minutes to harden the crumb coat, and make it easier to add the final frosting layer on top of the crumb coat., After the cake has had time to set in the freezer, continue to add frosting (one large dollop at a time) to the cake.Use your offset spatula to evenly spread out the frosting all over the cake. Use gentle, steady, even strokes to distribute the frosting all around the cake with your offset spatula. Try to make sure there are no thin areas of the frosting that expose any cake base.


You can use the same paper dragging method suggested to even out the crumb coat, to even out the final layer of cake. Simply curve a piece of paper at the base of the cake to match the cake curvature, hold the paper from the two bottom corners, and softly drag the edge of the paper over the frosting as you pull the paper up toward the top of the cake.
Having the cake on a spinning pedestal as you add your final layer of frosting can really help make the application process easier. You can spin the pedestal as you keep your offset spatula still to create an even spread of frosting.

, Along with the paper technique to smooth out the frosting, you can also use your spatula to create patterns in the frosting. Consider using the tip of your spatula to gently press into the frosting and create vertical lines along the cake or little swirl marks, mimicking dress fabric detailing., Undress the princess doll, or use plastic wrap to cover and protect the princess’ clothing. Lift up the doll’s arms so they don’t poke into the cake, and place the doll into the center of the cake.Be careful not to let the princess’ hair touch the rest of the cake frosting. If her hair is too long, consider also wrapping her hair in plastic wrap.Use a little bit more frosting to fill in and cover the center hole of the cake., If you have a couple of pastry bags and different shaped frosting tips, you can add and pipe frosting designs around the cake (which is now the dress of the princess) with different colored frosting.

Consider adding frosting detail around the princess’ waist to cover up any imperfections.
Always squeeze out a bit of frosting from your pastry bag to clear out any air pockets., If you don’t have different colored frosting or pastry piping materials, you can simply use edible cake decorations and candy pieces to design and embellish the princess cake.Consider using colored sugar sprinkles, jellybeans, or other small, decorative candies to accent the princess’ dress.

, Use your cleaned offset spatula to slide underneath the cardboard round, and transfer the princess cake onto to a clean serving platter a little larger than the size of the cake.

Be very careful not to knock off or smear any frosting or decorations when transferring the cake.

The base cake can be any flavor you want. Chocolate, yellow, and white cakes make good basic cakes that go well with icing. You can bake a cake from scratch or from a box. This is entirely up to you.
Make sure to let the cake completely cool before continuing.;
, To cut your cake into the shape of Peppa Pig, you need to make a stencil. Cut the paper stencil out and place it on top of the cake. This will be used to shape the cake. There are two ways you can make a stencil:


If you have access to a printer, search the internet to find a Peppa Pig coloring template. There are many available that are large pictures of the character on a white background. Make sure the picture you print out is large enough to fit most of the cake.If you can't print out a stencil, take a plain sheet of paper and trace the picture of Peppa Pig from your computer screen. Or, if you can hand draw, draw the outline of Peppa as you look at the image on the computer screen.You can make a cake from any character from Peppa Pig, including George Pig and Mr. Dinosaur.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the cake around your paper stencil. Try to get the edges as close to the stencil as possible, but it doesn't have to be perfect. You will place icing around the edges.Use toothpicks to secure the stencil if it won't stay.You can cut Peppa's ears separately from the extra cake you cut away if you are having trouble cutting around the ears at the top., If you are using regular icing, either buy icing in two different pink colors, or buy white icing for food coloring. If you buy white icing, you will need to get Peppa's skin a light pink and the dress darker pink. You can also make the dress red. Strawberry icing may work really well for Peppa's skin.


When using white icing, put a small amount of pink gel food coloring into the icing and mix together. Make sure you have two separate bowls for the two different pinks. For Peppa's skin, you need a light pink color. For her dress, you need a darker pink color.
Spread the light pink on the head section of the cake, and then spread the darker pink on the dress. Try to get the icing as smooth as possible.

, Place the light pink icing in a plastic bag. Cut off the tip or use a decorating tip. Carefully draw a curly tail, two arms, and two legs on the cake plate.

, Mix a small amount of icing that is a shade darker than Peppa's skin. Place the icing in a bag, and either cut the top off or use a drawing tip. Outline the edge of Peppa's face, ears, eyes, and nose. Make two nostrils and a circle for her cheek.


Use a picture to guide you on Peppa's facial features if you need.

, To make the eyes, fill the inside of the pink eye outlines with white icing. Then use a black icing pen to make a blob in the middle of the eyeball.For the mouth, use the same icing you did for the dress. Place it in a bag, cut off the tip or use a decorating tip, and draw a smile on Peppa's face.

, If you are using fondant icing, start off by kneading the icing until it's soft. Then add a few drops of red food coloring or pink gel food coloring. Knead the icing until you have a pale pink color for the head. Then do the same thing to a section of the icing for the dress, making sure it is a darker pink.


Place icing sugar on the counter or cutting board. Put the icing on there and use a rolling pin to roll the icing out into a flat disc.
Carefully place the light pink icing over the head. Cut the excess off, leaving enough so it covers the sides. Then place the dark pink fondant over the dress part. Cut the excess off that edge. Make a cut along the neckline so the two icing layers match.
Before you place the icing on the cake, brush a light layer of jam on the surface of the cake to keep the icing from slipping.You can also buy precolored fondant, which may be easier than coloring it yourself., Use the light pink icing to make the arms, legs, and tail. Use your hands to roll out tubes of fondant icing that will be the tail, legs, and arms.


Use water to attach the fondant tail, arms, and legs to the dress.

, For the outline of Peppa's face, make a small amount of pink icing that is just a shade darker than her skin. Then, roll the icing into long, thin tubes. Use these long tubes to outline Peppa's face, ears, eyes, and nose. You also want to make two nostrils and one cheek., To make the eyes, make two circles with white fondant. Place them on Peppa's face, then outline them with the eye outlines you just made. Use a black icing pen to make a blob in the middle of the eyeball.For the mouth, use the same icing you did for the dress. Roll it into a tube that you can shape into a smile.


Use a picture to guide you on Peppa's facial features if you need.

, You can finish by adding the age of your child if this is a birthday cake, decorating the cake plate, or anything else.

Look for a mix or recipe that makes enough batter for two 8 inch (20.3 cm) cake rounds, or a 2 layer cake. 1 box of cake mix is usually enough.Most box cake mixes require only a few fresh ingredients--usually eggs, oil, and water.;
, Follow the instructions closely, and make sure you are following the steps in order. Because baking is more of a science, things like adding the dry ingredients to the wet (and not vice versa) can make a difference in how your cake turns out.Mix the batter thoroughly--no lumps or bumps, or you will find clumps in your finished cake.

, The majority of your ladybug will be red, so you'll need most of the frosting to be this color. Add the dye several drops at a time, mixing thoroughly until you have the desired color.


Be wary of using too much red dye. Sometimes the amount of dye needed to achieve a bright red can affect the flavor of the frosting. Look for a no-taste red dye or a highly concentrated red to avoid a bitter aftertaste.Some grocery stores carry pre-dyed frosting in cans with an easy to use nozzle, as with a can of cheese wiz or whipped cream. You can use this if it is easier for you to decorate, just make sure you have enough.
Refrigerate dye until you are ready to decorate.

, You can buy a black dye or use equal parts red, blue, and yellow food coloring.


Never use squid ink for black dye. This works for savory dishes only!
Refrigerate dye until you are ready to decorate.

,


If you want your filling to be colored, you'll only need about 1/2 cup of white frosting and can dye the rest the desired color., Use a paper towel or silicone brush to cover the inside of the pan with a thin layer of butter or shortening. Add about a teaspoon of flour and shake the pan so the flour begins to stick to the grease. Tilt the pan on its side and tap the pan. Turn and tap until the entire bowl is evenly coated with flour.Greasing the pan not only ensures your cake will pop out easily, it helps the cake climb the sides of the pan and gives your it more volume.Turn the pan over and tap gently to remove any excess flour.
If you are baking a chocolate cake, you may want to use cocoa powder to prevent a white film that may be left by the flour., By radiating heat from the center of the cake and not just the sides of the pan, the heating core ensures your cake bakes evenly and the middle, sides, and top of the are all done at the same time.


You can use a core shaped like a nail, placing the ""head"" of the nail on the bottom with the spike pointing upward, or one that is shaped like a long, narrow plug, with the opening pointing up.You can bake this cake without a heating core, but the depth of the pan means you may over-brown the exposed top and sides of your cake.A heating core may also prevent your cake from deflating or sagging in the middle.

, Use a spatula to make sure the batter is even, but be careful not to touch the sides and scrape the grease off the side of the pan.


If you use a plug-shaped heating core, don't forget to fill the core with cake batter, too. Fill it a little higher than the level of batter outside the core. The plug-shaped bit of cake will fit into the hole created by the core once it's removed., Bake on the middle rack.You may want to place the round bowl in a standard 8 inch (20.3 cm) cake round pan to make sure it stays level in the oven.Test the cake by skewering near the center (but not inside the heating core) with a toothpick or kebab stick. If the stick comes out clean (a few crumbs is ok), then the cake is ready.If the cake is done, the sides should be just starting to pull away from the pan and the center should feel springy when you press it with your finger., Removing the heating core (if you use the core shaped like a plug) can speed up the cooling process.If the top of the cake is raised above the pan, use a knife to carefully trim it flat., Give the pan a little shake to feel if the cake has released the pan and is moving easily. If it seems to be sticking, stick it in the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes.Otherwise, place the cooling rack on top of the pan. Holding the rack against the pan, carefully turn them upside-down, together, so the rack is on the bottom you can lift the pan off the cake.


You can loosen the sides by gently running a knife around the edges.Allow the cake to cool for at least an hour. Frosting or slicing a cake before it has cooled can ruin your cake and will cause your icing to melt.

, The best way to do this is by placing the cake on a cake wheel or turn table first. Hold the top part of the cake with one hand and a long, serrated knife in the other. While continuously turning the cake, push the knife toward the center of the cake.Make sure you hold the knife straight and steady. It should slide easily and cleanly through the soft cake.You may want to trace the cut first. Before you cut all the way through, hold the knife beside the cake so the teeth will just cut into the side and turn the cake on the table. This can guide your knife better when you cut your layers.Be conscious of where the knife is going in relation to the hand on top of the cake. Don't accidentally slice into your hand., To get an even filling, first line the baking pan you just used with plastic wrap, making sure some of the wrap hangs over the sides. Place the top of your cake (the top of the hemisphere, or bottom part of the bowl) back into the pan. Spread a thick layer of icing on the cake, then place the larger, bottom part of your cake on top.You are building your cake upside-down in the pan.


Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes.
You may choose not to layer and fill your cake, but because the cake is so tall your guests may find they have big mouthfuls of cake with no frosting.

, There are several ways to do this if the cake doesn't pop out right away (the plastic wrap should help it come out easily). Try placing the pan in a hot water bath for about three minutes and then turn it over onto the platter. Unwrap the saran wrap. Your cake should be a nice, seamless hemisphere, or bowl shape.You can also heat the pan with a hairdryer or blowtorch to help force the bowl to release the cake.Place the plattered cake on your cake wheel or turn table. You can use a bit of sticky fabric, like a mesh shelf liner, to keep the platter from slipping while you decorate.

, Use an open star tip, placing the stars close together so no cake shows through.


Use an even amount of pressure for each star to keep a uniform size.Constantly refill your piping bag with frosting, especially when it starts to get soft. Your stars will lose their shape and definition if the icing is not stiff., This is the line between the two wings.Use the round decorating tip for the straight line.
You can smooth the line using a finger dipped in corn starch., It is up to you how large or small the spots are, but try to keep them all about the same size.


Remember to use consistent pressure and keep the stars close together., Use the star tip to cover the rest of the cake, creating the ladybug's bright red wings.

, Use the reserved white frosting to make eyes or a smiling mouth. If you want antennas, use the round tip to draw them coming out of the head and back onto the wings.


Experiment with borders. Try piping big red stars along the bottom edge of the cake for a nice border. Or make some green frosting and use the start tip to pipe it all over the platter to look like grass.

Double boiler (large glass bowl and medium saucepan)
Hand mixer
Plastic wrap
Two large sealable plastic bags;
, Fill the bottom of the saucepan with one inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the glass bowl on top of the saucepan and add the marshmallows and water. Heat the double boiler over medium heat.


Stir the mixture regularly, and keep the marshmallows on the heat until they have completely melted.

, Remove the melted marshmallows from the heat and place the bowl on a heat-proof surface. Add 6¼ cups (750g) of the sugar in 1-cup (125-g) increments and beat the mixture on medium-low speed until the sugar is mostly incorporated. When all the sugar has been added, increase the speed to medium and mix until everything comes together as a sticky dough.While your beating the mixture, you can also add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla or almond extract for added flavor.

, Sprinkle a flat surface with the remaining cup (125 g) of sugar. Turn the dough out onto the sugared surface. Coat your hands in the vegetable shortening and knead the dough until all the sugar has been incorporated.If the dough becomes too sticky, add more vegetable shortening to your hands and the counter.

, Cut off about one-third of the fondant ball and set it aside. With the larger portion of fondant, add 10 drops of pink food coloring and knead the color into the dough.If necessary, add more food coloring in 10-drop increments until you achieve the desired color for the body of the purse. Knead the fondant until the color has been fully incorporated.


Instead of pink, you can use red, blue, brown, green, purple, or any other color you like for the body of the purse.

, With the smaller portion of fondant that you set aside earlier, add 10 drops of black food coloring to make the piping, handles, and decorations for the purse.


Knead the food coloring into the dough. Add another 10 drops of color if necessary. Continue kneading until the color has been completely worked into the dough.
Instead of black for the accents, you can use any color you like, such as brown, a darker shade of the color you used for the purse, or even gray.

, Wrap each ball of fondant tightly in plastic wrap. Then transfer each wrapped ball to a sealable plastic bag. Push out all the air and seal the bag. This will prevent the fondant from drying out.Transfer the fondant to the fridge and let it rest overnight.

, You will need a few tools and pieces of kitchen equipment to make your cakes and frosting. Along with your ingredients, you'll also need:


Small and medium bowl
Whisk
Stand mixer with paddle attachment
Two eight-inch round cake pans, greased
Two wire cooling racks

, In a small bowl, combine the cocoa powder and boiling water. Whisk them together to fully combine. Transfer the bowl to the freezer.Allow the chocolate mixture to chill while you prepare the rest of the batter. You want to bring it down to room temperature, so leave it in the freezer for about half an hour.

, Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and give them a quick whisk. Add the vanilla and vegetable oil and whisk to combine.


Set the mixture aside as you prepare the dry ingredients.

, In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Turn the mixer on low to combine the dry ingredients. Add in the cubes of butter one at a time, until all the butter has been added and the mixture takes on a sandy texture.If you don’t have a stand mixer, combine everything in a large bowl and mix it with a hand mixer.

, Pour the cooled chocolate mixture into the other wet ingredients and whisk to combine. Pour one-third of the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Turn the mixer on low to combine.


When the ingredients start to come together, increase the mixer speed to medium–high and mix for two minutes.
Decrease the speed to low and slowly pour in the remaining wet mixture. When it has all been added, increase the speed to medium–high speed and mix for 30 seconds.

, Divide the batter evenly between the two greased cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 40 minutes. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean but with a few fudgy crumbs.Remove the cakes from the oven when they're done baking and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes.

, Turn the cakes out onto the wire racks and allow them to cool to room temperature, about one to two hours. As you wait for the cakes to cool, prepare your frosting., Add the butter to the bowl of the stand mixer or a medium mixing bowl. Cream it for two minutes with the paddle attachment or a hand mixer. Add the sugar in half-cup (62.5-g) increments, and mix until it’s fully combined with the butter. Add the vanilla and mix to incorporate.Finally, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of milk and mix to combine. If the frosting is too thick, add another tablespoon (15 ml) of milk until the frosting is light, creamy, and easily spreadable.
When you achieve the right consistency, whip the frosting for an additional three to four minutes on medium speed.

, Remove the fondant from the fridge and set it aside to warm to room temperature as you assemble, trim, and frost the cake. The fondant will be easier to work with if it’s warm.

, Spread a generous layer of frosting on top of one of the cakes and use a frosting knife to spread it around evenly. Pick up the second cake with your hands or a spatula, and gently place it on top of the frosted cake.


If you don’t have a frosting knife, you can use a butter knife or a flat knife to spread the frosting.

, Cut a two-inch (5-cm) slice off the bottom of the cake to form the base of the purse. Then cut off a one-inch (2.5-cm) slice from the top. Stand the cake upright on the bottom cut edge and transfer it to a cake plate or serving platter standing up.


Set aside the cake you cut off to use in another recipe, or to make cake pops.

, Use a long knife to shave the edges off the top of the cake. Slice off all four edges from the top of the cake on a 45-degree angle to create the top of the purse where the flap and handle will be., Cover the top and sides of the cake with a generous layer of frosting. Use the frosting knife to spread everything around evenly. You don’t have to worry about it looking pretty, as the fondant will cover the frosting.


The frosting acts like glue for the fondant, and helps it adhere to the cake properly., Sprinkle a flat surface with powdered sugar and turn the pink fondant out onto the sugar. Roll it out with a fondant roller or regular rolling pin sprinkled with powdered sugar.


Roll the fondant out into a circle with a thickness of one-quarter inch (6.4 mm).

, Pick up the fondant and lay it on top of the cake. Starting at the top and moving down, gently mold the fondant around the cake, smoothing it with your hands as you go.


To get the fondant molded to the edges of the cake, pinch the excess fondant together at the edges and trim off the excess. Then use your fingers to smooth the seam and mold the fondant to the shape of the cake.
Mold the fondant to the bottom edge of the cake, allowing the excess to spill out beside the cake. When you’ve covered the cake completely, use a pizza cutter to trim the excess fondant from around the base of the cake.

, Turn the black fondant out onto a sugared surface. Roll it out with the rolling pin into a circle that’s one-quarter inch (6.4 mm) thick. Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut an open-ended rectangle into the fondant that’s six inches (15 cm) long and four inches (10 cm) wide. Leave the fourth widthwise edge uncut.For the fourth edge, instead of cutting a straight edge, use a knife to cut a rounded edge for the front of the flap.
Set the flap aside for now.

, Roll the remaining black fondant into a long cylinder with a half-inch (175 mm) diameter. Use the decorating brush to brush a thin layer of water along the base of the cake at the front, and then up and around the front edge of the cake, back to where you started.Press the piping against the cake where you added the water and gently press it into the cake.

, Use a decorating brush to cover the flap with a thin layer of water. Lay the flap over the top center of the cake. Position the flap over the cake with the squared edges at the back of the cake and the rounded end at the front.


Because the flap went on after, it should be covering the black piping running along the edges on the top of the cake.

, From the remaining black fondant, cut a cylindrical strip that’s about eight inches (20 cm) long. Brush water onto the cut ends of the cylinder and press these into the flap on the top of the cake. Gently press down on the fondant to secure it in place.


If the handle won’t stay up in an arc, you can lay it down flat against the front or back of the cake.

Serve and enjoy!",How to Make a Hello Kitty Cake," Once you make the fondant, it will need to rest for about eight hours. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to make the fondant in advance of making the cake. For the fondant, you will need the following supplies:


Large mixing bowl
Small saucepan
Mixing spoon
Plastic wrap
Large sealable plastic bag;
, Sift the powdered sugar into a large bowl. Sifting will remove lumps and make the job of forming a smooth fondant much easier. Use your finger or a spoon to make a well in the center of the sugar for the wet ingredients.If you don’t have a sifter, put the sugar in the bowl and whisk it to remove lumps.

, Pour the cold water into a small saucepan and sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Set it aside for five minutes to give the gelatin time to soften.After five minutes, heat the gelatin and water over low heat, stirring until the gelatin is fully dissolved.
Once dissolved, remove the gelatin from the heat.

, Add the glucose and glycerine to the gelatin mixture and stir to fully combine. Finally, add the almond extract and stir to incorporate.You can add any extract you like for flavor in place of the almond extract. Be sure to use clear extracts, because colored flavorings (like vanilla) will color the fondant, which needs to be white for Hello Kitty.

, Pour the gelatin mixture into the well in the center of the sugar. Stir to incorporate all the sugar. Turn the dough out onto a flat surface covered with a dusting of powdered sugar.Knead the fondant with your hands until it becomes a stiff dough.
If the fondant becomes too sticky, sprinkle it with a dusting of powdered sugar.

, Roll the fondant into a ball and wrap it tightly in a layer of plastic wrap. Then transfer the wrapped fondant to a sealable plastic bag. Push out all the air and seal the bag.


Set the fondant aside on the counter and let it rest for about eight hours.
The cornstarch called for in this recipe will be used when you roll out the fondant.

, Set your oven to 350ºF (177ºC) and get the tools and equipment to make your Hello Kitty cake. To make the cake and frosting, you'll need:


Sifter
Small, medium, and large mixing bowls
Hand mixer
Two eight-inch round cake pans, greased
Two wire cooling racks
Large knife
Frosting knife
Rolling pin
Piping bag with round tip

, Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl. If you don’t have a sifter, combine the ingredients in the bowl and whisk them together.Incorporating air into the dry ingredients by sifting will help ensure the cake turns out light and fluffy.

, Pour the butter, milk, and vanilla directly into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix the ingredients with the hand mixer until they begin to incorporate, then increase the speed to medium and beat everything for about four minutes.


To turn this vanilla recipe into a chocolate cake, beat in ¼ cup each of cocoa powder (30 g), sugar (56 g), and sour cream (58 g)., Crack the eggs separately into a small mixing bowl. Then add the eggs to the batter and beat all the ingredients on medium speed for another three minutes.


It’s always good to crack eggs into a separate bowl first, because that way you can retrieve any shells that fall in before they get lost in the batter.

, Divide the batter evenly between the two cake pans. Bake the cakes for 30 to 35 minutes. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.Transfer the cakes to the wire cooling racks, letting them cool in the pans for 10 minutes.

, Once the cakes have had time to cool in the pans, they will start to pull away from the sides, making it easier to get them out. After 10 minutes, turn the cakes out onto the cooling racks and let them cool to room temperature, about 1.5 hours.


Once the cakes have cooled fully, you can frost and decorate your Hello Kitty cake.

, In a medium mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, butter, milk, and vanilla. Beat all the ingredients on medium speed for about three to four minutes, until the frosting becomes smooth, fluffy, and light.If the frosting isn't spreadable, add another tablespoon (15 ml) of milk and beat to incorporate.

, Separate about one-quarter of the frosting into a small bowl. Add 10 drops of black food coloring to the small portion and whisk to fully combine. If necessary, add another 10 drops until you have frosting that’s a deep and rich black.


The black frosting will be used to create the outline around Hello Kitty’s face and nose. The white frosting will be used as glue to keep different parts of the cake together.

, To turn your two round cakes into the wide and elongated Hello Kitty face, you need to cut the two cakes and wedge them together. Use your eye to draw an imaginary line down the center of one cake. Now move over by one inch (2.5 cm) and cut the cake in half an inch off center.You should now have two uneven cake halves, with one about five inches wide and the other three inches.
Repeat with the other cake. Set aside the two smaller cake wedges.

, Use a frosting knife to coat the cut edge of one of the large cake wedges. Orient the other large cake wedge so the cut edges are facing each other. Gently press the two cake wedges together, using the frosting to hold them together.


Use a knife to cut and smooth the face if there are any areas where the cakes are joined unevenly. You want a nice, smooth, rounded rectangular shape for the Hello Kitty cake.
Orient the cake so the rounded rectangle is widthwise in front of you.

, Use the two smaller wedges of cake to create the ears. With a knife cut out two equilateral triangles from the leftover cake, each with a two-inch (5-cm) base, and a height of two inches (5 cm).Round out the bases of the triangles in an inward direction so the ears will join with the face smoothly.
Reserve the leftover cake for cake pops or some other recipe

, Cover the rounded base of each ear with a layer of frosting. Attach one ear to the top left corner of the cake, and the second ear to the top right corner.


Once the ears are attached, you have the basic Hello Kitty face shape in place, and can move on to decorating.

, Use a frosting knife to cover the entire top and sides of the cake with a generous layer of frosting.Frost the ears gently so they don’t get knocked out of place.


The frosting should be smooth and even, but it doesn’t have to be perfect, as it will be covered in fondant.

, Dust a flat work surface and your rolling pin with cornstarch. Turn the fondant out onto the covered surface and roll it out in a rectangular shape. Continue rolling until the fondant is flat and even, and about one-quarter inch (6.4 mm) thick.Dust your work surface and rolling pin with more cornstarch as necessary if the fondant sticks while you're rolling it.

, Gently peel the fondant off the work surface and center it over the cake. Place the fondant down on top of the cake, letting the excess spill over the sides. Dust your hands with some cornstarch, and gently mold the fondant to the cake.Start at the top center of the cake, and slowly work your way outward, molding the fondant to the cake as you go. Be careful when molding the fondant around the ears, as they may get knocked out of place.
Last, gently press the fondant around the base of the cake. Use a knife or pizza cutter to trim off the excess fondant, following the shape of the cake.

, Because Hello Kitty is a cartoon character, her face is always outlined in black. Take the black frosting and transfer it to your piping bag. Fit the bag with a round tip. Starting at the out corner of the left ear, pipe a continuous line of frosting all the way around the edge of the cake to outline the face.When you get back to the corner of the ear where you started, continue the rounded outline of the face for a half-inch (1.3 cm) past the starting point.

, Use your eye to locate the center of the cake. Orient the yellow jelly bean so it’s horizontal, and dip one side into the leftover white frosting. Press the jelly bean into the fondant, an inch (2.5 cm) below the center point of the cake.


With your piping bag, pipe a thin line of black frosting around the yellow jelly bean to outline the nose.

, To create the eyes, dip one side of each black jelly bean into the white frosting. Position the jelly beans vertically. Place one jelly bean on either side of the nose, in between the nose and the outer edge of the cheek, and with the bottom tip of the jelly bean at the height of the top of the nose.


Gently press the jelly beans into the fondant to secure the eyes in place.

, Cut six three-inch strips of black rope licorice. Place three whiskers on either side of the face. Use your finger or a knife to paint a small amount of white frosting onto the bottom quarter of each strip. Position the whiskers so they're half on the cake and half hanging off.


On either side of the face, there should be one whisker at the height of the top of the eye, one at the height of the bottom of the eye, and one at the height of the bottom of the nose.

, Cut a three-inch (7.6-cm) strip off the fruit tape. Wrap the remaining tape into a loop that’s about five inches (12.7 cm) long. Use the three-inch strip to wrap the center of the bow and hold the loops together. Use your finger to spread some frosting on the inside edge of the center wrap so it will stick to itself.Spread a layer of frosting on one side of the bow and gently press it into place on the cake. Position the bow on a diagonal below the right ear, following the curve of the face.

, Once you add the final touch with the bow, the Hello Kitty cake is ready to serve. Depending on the size of the slices, this cake can serve eight to 12 people.

, Take one egg and crack it against a flat surface to get an even break. Open the egg over a bowl and hold one half in each hand. Let the yolk fall into one of the halves, and then transfer the yolk back and forth between the halves until all the white has fallen into the bowl below and you're left with just the yolk in the shell.Repeat with all four eggs.
To prevent egg shells from getting into your baking, separate the eggs into a separate bowl before adding them to your baking.
Reserve the egg whites for later use. You can freeze the whites in a sealable freezer bag until you have a recipe that requires them.

, Combine the butter and sugar in a large bowl and cream them together with a whisk or electric beaters. After about three minutes, beat in the eggs, one at a time. When they are fully incorporated, beat in the egg yolks one at a time.Beating in the ingredients in stages will help ensure a light and fluffy cake.

, In a medium bowl, sift together the salt, baking powder, and flour. Sifting will remove lumps and aerate the dry ingredients, making the cake light rather than dense.If you don’t have a sifter, place all the ingredients into the bowl and whisk them together.

, Pour half the dry ingredients into the creamed butter, sugar, and egg mixture. Beat or whisk until everything is combined. Add half the buttermilk and mix to combine. Repeat until you’ve added all the dry ingredients and buttermilk.Finally, add the vanilla to the batter and beat until everything is fully incorporated.

, Divide the batter between the two cake pans and the bowl. Bake the cakes for about 25 minutes. The cake in the bowl may need up to 30 minutes. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.If you only have one eight-inch cake pan, bake the two cakes in separate batches.

, Remove the cakes from the oven and leave them to cool for 10 minutes. Then, turn them out onto wire cooling racks to cool completely, about one to two hours.You can't assemble the hamburger until the cakes have fully cooled, or the icing and decorations will melt off.
While you're waiting for the cakes to cool, prepare the frosting.

, Fill the bottom of a saucepan with about an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place a large glass or metal bowl on top, and combine the egg whites and sugar in the bowl. Heat the mixture over medium heat, until it reaches 140 F (60 C).Remove the saucepan from the heat. Either transfer the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer, or leave it in the mixing bowl and place it on a heat-proof surface.

, With the whisk attachment on the stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the egg and sugar mixture on high speed for about 10 minutes, until the eggs increase in volume and form stiff peaks.Beating the eggs in this way creates the meringue portion of the buttercream icing.

, Reduce the speed of the mixer to medium–high. Add the butter one cube at a time, and continue mixing until all the butter has been incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat for another minute.The mixture may appear to break down when you first start adding the butter. Continue beating in the butter, and the ingredients will come back together to form a smooth and glossy frosting.

, Portion out half the frosting into a new bowl and set that aside. With the original bowl of frosting, divide it evenly among three separate bowls.

To create the red food frosting for the ketchup, add 10 to 20 drops of red food coloring to one bowl. Whisk to combine, and add more food coloring if necessary until the desired intensity of red is achieved.
Repeat with the green food coloring and another bowl of frosting. This will be used to create the lettuce.
Repeat again with the third bowl of frosting, but color it yellow for the mustard.

, Return to the uncolored portion of frosting. Divide it evenly between two bowls. One will be colored brown for the patty, and the other will be a tan color for the bun.

For the brown frosting, add six drops of red, six drops of yellow, and four drops of blue to one bowl of frosting.Whisk to combine. If necessary, add the same quantity of coloring again to create a more intense brown color.
To create the tan for the bun, add six drops of red, eight drops of yellow, and two drops of blue to the second bowl. Repeat if necessary to achieve a more intense color.

, Place one of the eight-inch cakes onto a clean cake plate or serving platter. Using a frosting or butter knife, apply a layer of tan frosting to the sides of the cake for the bun.

To create the lettuce under the patty, spread a layer of green frosting on the top of the cake.
Transfer the remaining green frosting to the pastry bag, and fit the bag with the petal tip. Use the piping bag to pipe a billowing layer of frosting at the top edge of the cake, so that it will spill out like lettuce underneath the patty., Place the second eight-inch cake on a regular plate or flat surface. Use the frosting knife to cover the top and sides of the cake with a generous layer of brown frosting to make the patty.

To give the cake a meaty texture, gently press a clean paper towel into the frosting on the side of the cake and pull it away to dimple the frosting. Repeat all around the entire cake.When the patty has been frosted, use a spatula to pick up the cake and carefully set it down on top of the first cake (the bottom of the bun with lettuce).

, Transfer the red frosting to a clean pastry bag and fit it with the round piping tip. Start at the center of the cake and pipe a spiral of red frosting to the outside of the cake. On the sides, drizzle some frosting over the sides of the patty to replicate dripping ketchup.

Repeat with the yellow frosting to create the mustard. Start in the center with the yellow frosting and create a spiral that goes in the opposite direction as the ketchup. When you make the additional drips on the side of the cake for the mustard, place them beside the ketchup drippings.

, Take the cake that was baked in the bowl and position it so it’s sitting on the flat end and the semicircle is facing upward. Frost the entire semicircle with tan icing to create the top of the bun.Use a spatula to pick up the top of the bun and place it on top of the patty.

, Right before you're ready to serve the cake, sprinkle the top with the puffed rice cereal to create the sesame seeds on top of the bun.Adding the cereal last will keep it crunchy and prevent it from going soggy in the frosting.

, Stir frequently with a greased spoon. Remove from the heat when the marshmallows are completely melted. Gradually stir in the sugar.

, With a greased knife, cut away a small amount of white fondant and reserve this for the eye. Remove one quarter of the fondant and set it aside in a greased bowl (for the blue fondant).

, Grease your hands and counter space with vegetable shortening. Add several drops of yellow food coloring to the large fondant ball and begin kneading on the greased countertop. Add more food coloring as needed to achieve minion yellow. Knead for about 8 minutes, until you have an elastic ball and the food coloring has been worked through.


Re-grease your hands as needed if they stick to the dough.
Add water by the half tablespoon as necessary if the fondant cracks or tears during kneading.

, Re-grease the countertop and your hands, and repeat the coloring and kneading steps with the quarter ball of fondant using blue food coloring.

, Repeat the greasing and kneading for the smallest ball of fondant, without adding any coloring.

, Cover each fondant ball with a thin layer of shortening, wrap each ball in plastic wrap, and seal them in plastic bags. Refrigerate overnight or longer.


It will keep in the refrigerator for a couple weeks, and can be prepared well in advance.
Fondant can be used immediately if you haven’t prepared it the night before, but it’s best to let it rest.

, Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Grease the cake pans. You will need three 8-inch round cakes and one 8-inch half-sphere cake (made in a hemisphere or ball pan).


You can prepare the round cakes one at a time if you only have one 8-inch round cake pan.

, Mix together the milk and vinegar in a medium bowl. Whisk in the canola oil, water, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and almond extract

, In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Then, pour the liquids into the dry mixture and stir until you have a smooth batter.

, Divide the cake batter evenly into the four cake pans. Bake for about 35 minutes.Allow to cool.


You can tell if cakes are ready if you stick a toothpick into the center of the cake and it comes out clean.

, Start by beating together the shortening and margarine until fluffy. Electric beaters work best.


Use a wooden spoon if you don't have beaters.

, Add in the sugar and continue beating until creamy. Add in the milk and vanilla. Beat the mixture for about 5 minutes.Switch to a whisk at this point if you aren't using electric beaters.

, If the tops of the round cakes are slightly rounded, cut off a thin slice so they are flat on top. Place your first round cake on a flat cake plate or base. Layer the three round cakes by placing them on top of each other with a layer of frosting in between each layer. This will help hold the cake layers in place. Spread a layer of frosting on the top cake, and place the half-sphere cake on top (round side up). Spread a thin layer of frosting over the entire cake. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes. Remove the cakes from the fridge, and place on a flat surface. Cover it with another generous layer of frosting, which will act like glue for the fondant., Generously sprinkle corn starch on a clean countertop and grease a rolling pin. Remove the yellow fondant from the plastic bag and wrap. Roll it out on the corn starched countertop to a thickness of 1/16 inch.

, Without stretching it, lay the fondant over the top of the cake. If any tearing occurs, gently repair it with your fingers by pressing the ripped edges back together. You want to cover the top three quarters of the cake with yellow fondant. Smooth the fondant down around the sides of the cake so it’s flat and wrinkle-free. Press any excess toward the bottom. Use scissors to trim off any excess from the bottom.

, Sprinkle your countertop with a fresh coating of corn starch, and re-grease the rolling pin. Remove the blue fondant from the plastic bag and wrap, and roll it into a rectangle that’s about 1/16-inch thick. Cut off two long strips for straps and set aside. With the remaining fondant, wrap the bottom quarter of the cake with blue fondant, making sure to slightly overlap the bottom portion of the yellow fondant. Smooth it out as you press it to the sides of the cake. Carefully trim the excess from around the base. Roll out a two-inch by two-inch square with the excess to place in the center of the jumpsuit like a kangaroo pocket. Set aside.

, Using the excess yellow fondant from the body, roll out two one-inch thick cylinders that are about 10 inches long. Attach one arm on either side of the body, about one third of the way up from the base. Mold the fondant from the top of the arm into the fondant of the body to attach them.

, Bend the minion arms slightly to make an elbow so that they reach around to the front of the body. Trim off any excess if the arms are too long. Make hand shapes by molding balls on the ends of each arm. Position the hands in the front of the body and press them into place. Mold the kangaroo pocket piece around the hands and wrists so that it looks like the minion’s hands are in the pockets.

, Connect the back and the front of the jumpsuit with the straps, going around the top of the arms. Press the straps into place with gentle pressure, and trim if necessary. Use dots of licorice to make buttons where the straps meet the jumpsuit. Frost the dots of licorice and press them into place.

, With the greased rolling pin, roll out the small ball of white fondant to a thickness of 1/16 inch on a corn starched surface. Cut out a circle using a cup or round cookie cutter. Place the round fondant piece in the center of the top quarter of the minion body and press it into place. Frost one side of a chocolate button. Gently (but with enough pressure to make it stick) press a chocolate button into the center of the eye. Trim a small piece of black rope licorice to make a dot for the pupil. Frost one side and press this into the center of the chocolate button.

, Cut two lengths of black rope licorice long enough to encircle the white eye. Cover one side of each with a thin layer of frosting, and wrap the licorice pieces, side by side, around the eye. Cut two lengths of licorice long enough to wrap around the head like a band. Frost one side of each, and wrap them around the circumference of the head in tandem to create the goggle band.

, Cut a length of licorice to your desired length, and frost one side. Position it in the center of the minion, under the eye and between the arms. Press it into place.

, Cut several two-inch pieces of licorice. Poke the same number of holes into the top of the head, and insert the licorice pieces into the holes.

Preheat your oven to 400° F (204° C). To make the cakes and frosting, you'll need your ingredients for the cake, along with:


One medium and one large mixing bowl
Sifter
Electric beaters
8-inch greased cake pan (round or square)
6-inch greased cake pan (round or square)
Wire cooling rack;
, In a large mixing bowl, sift the ingredients together. Sifting will remove clumps and help the batter come together quicker.


There are several ways you can sift flour without a sifter, including by using a whisk or strainer.
If you don’t have cake flour, you can make some by mixing all-purpose flour with cornstarch. For every cup of flour in the recipe, replace two tablespoons of flour with two tablespoons of cornstarch. For this recipe, replace six tablespoons of all-purpose flour with cornstarch., Add the butter a quarter-cup at a time. Use the electric beaters to beat the mixture until it takes on the texture of coarse sand. Then add the sugar in quarter-cup increments as well.When you’ve finished beating in all the butter and sugar, the mixture will look like wet sand.

, Add the eggs one at a time and beat each one into the mixture before adding the next.When all the eggs have been incorporated, add the milk and vanilla.


Once you add the milk and vanilla, increase the speed of the beaters to medium–high and mix until everything comes together as a smooth batter.

, Pour equal amounts of batter into each prepared cake pan. Bake the cakes for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.Set the cake aside to cool for five to 10 minutes.

, After five minutes, turn the cakes out onto a wire rack and remove the cake pans. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature before assembling and decorating the castle cake.

, Combine the sugar and butter in the medium mixing bowl. Beat with electric beaters on medium speed until smooth. Add the vanilla and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of milk. Beat the mixture and add more milk if necessary to achieve a smooth, light, fluffy, and spreadable frosting.Beat in the food coloring 5 to 10 drops at a time, until you achieve the color you want for the castle. You can use any color food coloring you like.

, Using a pastry knife or cake cutter, slice off the top quarter-inch to half-inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) of the cakes to ensure they both have a smooth, flat top. Then cut each cake in half and separate the tops and bottoms.


Prepare a cake plate that you can assemble and serve the cake on. This will make it easier to move and present the cake once it’s fully assembled and decorated. Wash and dry the cake plate, then set it aside.
Place the cakes on two separate plates to frost them.

, With each cake bottom, spread a thin layer of frosting on the top. Then place the top of each cake back onto the bottom of the cake. Spread a thin layer of frosting over the sides and top of each cake. Use a flat frosting knife to spread the frosting out evenly over the cake, making sure the cake underneath isn't exposed anywhere.


Refrigerate the cakes for 20 minutes to help the icing set.
The crumb coat is a layer of frosting that will trap any crumbs, which will make the final frosting layer look smoother and cleaner., Remove the cakes from the fridge. Place the larger cake on the cake plate. Using a spatula, pick up the smaller cake and carefully center it on top of the larger cake. Apply a generous layer of frosting over all the exposed areas of cake.


Smooth and even the icing out with a flat cake knife. Set aside a few spoonfuls of leftover frosting.
Return the cake to the fridge and let the icing set for 20 to 30 minutes.

, Take eight of the cake cones and stack them in pairs of two. Each stacked pair will be a turret for the castle. Use a cake decorating brush and your edible dust or food coloring to paint the cones in a color that matches or complements the frosting. Affix one turret to each corner of the larger bottom cake.


Gently press the base of the turret into the frosting to secure it in place., Fill the wide top portion of the last cake cone with leftover frosting. Turn the sugar cone upside down (so the tip is pointing up), and gently press the wide opening of the cone into the frosting inside the cake cone.


Paint the tower with the same food coloring or dust as the turrets.
Affix the tower to the very top center of the cake. Gently press it into the frosting to secure it in place.

, Break or cut all of the graham crackers in half lengthwise. Leave one of the halves intact and set it aside for the door. Break the remaining pieces in half again widthwise (along the serrated center of the cracker).


Take the full half and gently press it into the center front of the bottom cake layer. This will be the door of the castle.
For the windows, position the graham cracker quarters around the outer faces of the cake to create windows for the castle.

, Use jelly beans, gum drops, sprinkles, licorice, chocolates, or other candies to decorate the cake if you like. You can create a border around the castle, add candies randomly, create borders for the door and windows, or add other elements to the castle with the candy.You can also lay a full graham cracker in front of the door to replicate a bridge or gate.

, To prevent the icing from warming up and the decorations from sliding off, return the cake to the fridge or a cold cellar until you're ready to serve it.


If you’ve made the cake to replicate a specific castle, position a small toy or figurine on the castle as a cake topper right before serving."

1 rectangular vanilla or chocolate cake (bought or homemade) (around 30cm/1"" in length)
5 x round cookies (biscuits), chocolate coated
Smarties or similar candy-coated round candies
Butter icing/frosting (red and white)
Length of black licorice/liquorice (soft round lengths that are easily bent);
, The cake is the body of the car and you only need to shape it at the ends., This becomes the back end of the car.

Start the slope about 5cm/2.5 inches from the end.

, This should be cut as a slope to halfway of the middle of the cake, then cut straight across (horizontally) to the end of the cake.,, Use the tip of a sharp knife to carve out a window at the front of the cake (an oval is ideal) and small round or square circles, two each per side of the car. Leave the back windowless, as there's a cheat for this one., Pop the whole cake into the freezer. This will freeze the red icing in place., This time, spread it only in the window spaces. Once again, place in the freezer for a few minutes to harden.

Do not mix the white and red together or you'll cause the red to bleed into the white. The gaps between the two will be taken care of by the licorice.

, To attach, add dots of icing to the back parts first and press in place.

Cut two small lengths and attach at even spaces just under the top line of licorice on the front window. These serve as the visors of the car.
Cut two small lengths. Place diagonally across the front window, upwards, to look like windshield or windscreen wipers in use.

, These portions make the car look realistic, so work with care. If you cannot use licorice, use any other sort of bendable candy length. If you can't find candy, use a dark colored icing or frosting, and pipe in place.

Run a length each side of the car from the front the very back of the car. This should be at the edge of the cake on each side and provides the top of the car doors, as well as defining the car.

",How to Make a Candy Filled Pinata Cake," For the best results, choose the same two flavors or flavors that match with each other, such as vanilla and chocolate or yellow and strawberry.;
, Bake the cakes in round pans, rather than square or rectangular pans.


The deeper the pans are, the better results of the ""pinata"" you will have.

, If you have any chocolate or candies that can easily melt, you don't want them to melt inside a warm or hot cake.

, Treat the cakes like as if you are carving pumpkins.


Indent into the cakes with a knife, about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) from the edges.
Slice into the cakes, leaving a 2 to 3 inch (5 to 7.5 cm) height from the bottoms.
Carve out the middle. Use the leftover cake for a side treat, such as cake pops!

The cake should be large enough to handle a decent amount of decorating on top, as well as providing enough slices for the guests you'll have at the party., There are a few ways you can decorate this car cake:

Frosting the shape and design of a car across the top of the cake. Use differently colored frosting to denote the car, its features and the background. Features can also be made using candies, etc.
Use royal icing to cover the cake. Make a road of black royal icing; have it curving across the cake. Add a model car on the road; either made from sugar paste or similar edible modeling food, or chocolate, or a clean plastic model car, which is removed once the cake is cut.
Frost the whole cake. Make a border of clean plastic toy cars or foil-wrapped chocolate cars around the cake. When the cake is cut, each guest also gets to keep the car that came with his or her piece of cake.

, For example, add Smarties in traffic light formation and colors; add road signs and barriers (use clean model toys); and even add some plastic people to the top.

Frost the cake. Make a giant number for the child's age and use this as the road. Add cars to the number road, either edible or plastic ones. Include racing flags for a finish line.

Large mixing bowl, medium bowl, and a small bowl
Sifter
Hand or stand mixer
Two round eight-inch cake pans, greased
An oven preheated to 350ºF (177ºC)
Two wire cooling racks
Whisk
Frosting knife
Spatula
Round two-inch cookie cutter
Cake plate
Piping bag with round tip;
, Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. If you don’t have a sifter, whisk the dry ingredients together in the bowl to remove lumps, mix the ingredients together, and add air.Adding air to the dry ingredients will ensure the cake is light and fluffy.

, Pour the butter, milk, and vanilla right into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a hand mixer or the whisk attachment on a stand mixer to beat the batter on medium speed for about four minutes. Then add the eggs and beat on medium speed for another three minutes, until all the ingredients are fully incorporated into the batter.If necessary, stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure all the ingredients get mixed in.

, Divide the batter evenly between the two greased cake pans. Bake the cake for 30 to 35 minutes.You know the cakes are ready when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, or the cakes spring back when you press them gently.

Allow the cakes to cool in their pans on the wire racks for 10 minutes.

, When the cakes have cooled in their pans for a few minutes, turn them out onto the wire cooling racks. Set them aside to cool completely, to room temperature, for about an hour or hour and a half., Place the butter into a medium bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Cream the butter on medium-high speed for one to two minutes with a hand mixer or a stand mixer’s paddle attachment. Beat in the sugar 1 cup (125 g) at a time, until all the sugar has been incorporated and the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the vanilla and 2 tablespoons (15 ml) of milk and beat for another minute.If the frosting is too thick to spread properly, beat in another tablespoon of milk.

, Spread an even layer of frosting over the top of one of the cakes. Use a spatula to pick up the second cake and carefully place it on top of the frosted cake., With your eyes, draw an imaginary line down the center of the cake. Then move the line over by an inch and cut the cake in half at that spot. This way, you'll end up with one half larger than the other.

The larger half will be the body, and you'll use the smaller portion to create the head and tail.

, With the larger cake portion, take the round cookie cutter and position it in the middle bottom of the cake, where you just cut the cake in two. Punch out an upside-down U-shaped piece from the cake to form the legs.

The cake should now be shaped like a top-heavy upside-down U.Transfer the body to the cake plate and lay it down with the U-shaped cut-out (the legs) facing you.
The scrap cake you punched out can be set aside or frozen for another cake or to make cake pops.

, Take the smaller portion of cake and divide it down the middle to create two smaller wedges. Set one aside for the tail. Cut off an elongated S-shaped slice from the curved side of the wedge to create a head shape.

At the right angle corner of the wedge, cut off the bottom inch of the corner at a 45-degree angle to create a neck shape.
With a knife, carefully round off all the sharp edges and corners to create the head and neck shapes of the dinosaur. Set all the scraps aside for another recipe.
Cover the uncut straight edge of the wedge with a layer of frosting. Position the head on the right side of the dinosaur body, half way between the bottom of the foot and the center of the back.
You can leave the head as is and attach it to the body facing down, or you can flip the wedge over so the head is facing up. Gently press the frosted side of the wedge into the body of the dinosaur to secure it in place.

, Orient the second wedge so that the right angle corner is the bottom right of the wedge, facing you. To make the tail, you're going to cut off the bottom inch of the long flat edge and taper it to a point.

From the corner of the wedge, measure up one inch (2.5 cm) and make a two-inch (5-cm) horizontal cut into the length of the cake. Then follow the outer curve of the wedge and cut to taper the inside edge the same way as the outside, bringing the tail to a point.
Frost the straight end of the tail and lay it down on the left side of the cake, about 1.5 inches (3.75 cm) from the bottom of the foot.
Attach it to the back of the body by gently pressing the frosted side into the body.

, Remove about one-quarter of the frosting and set it aside in a small bowl. To create the yellow-green frosting for the body of the stegosaurus, add 10 drops of yellow and five drops of green food coloring to the large portion of frosting. Whisk in the color until it’s completely incorporated, and then add more food coloring as needed until you achieve the desired color for the body.

For the green accents, add five drops of green food coloring to the smaller portion of frosting and whisk it to combine. Add another five drops if necessary to achieve the desired color.

, With the frosting knife, frost the entire dinosaur with a layer of yellow-green icing. This will trap any fallen crumbs and help make the final layer smooth and even.

Place the cake in the fridge and let the frosting set for 20 to 30 minutes., After about 30 minutes, remove the cake from the fridge and apply a second layer of yellow-green frosting. Use the knife to spread the frosting evenly over the body, head, and tail., Transfer the green frosting to the piping bag and fit it with the round tip. Use the bag to pipe two rows of pea-sized green dots across the top of the body, head, and neck of the dinosaur.You can also pipe one line of green dots down the front of each leg.

, To do this, you'll use the Oreo thin crisps to replicate the plates that stick out of the stegosaurus’ tail, back, and head. Spread the cookies out over the tail (close to where the tail and body meet), body, and head, concentrating the most cookies at the center of the back.

Press the cookies into the cake at a 45-degree angle. Push them in halfway, so only the top half of the cookies are showing.

, Take the three chocolate-covered biscuit sticks and press them into the end of the tail so they stick out of the tail toward the sky like protective barbs.

You can use either Pocky sticks or chocolate-covered pretzel sticks for the barbs."

Before baking your cake, preheat the oven to 350 F (177 C). Along with your ingredients, you'll also need:

Sifter
Large mixing bowl
Medium mixing bowl (for the frosting), plus two small bowls
Two round nine-inch cake pans, greased
Electric beaters and whisk
Two wire cooling racks
Pastry bag (for decorating)
Round frosting tip and grass frosting tip (for decorating)
Frosting knife;
, Sift together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into the large mixing bowl. Sifting the dry ingredients will remove lumps, and help the batter come together more easily.

The less stirring and beating you do with the batter, the lighter and fluffier the cake will be. Over mixing flour develops the gluten, and this can make a cake dense and heavy.

, To the dry ingredients, add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. Beat on medium speed with the electric beaters for about two minutes. Then carefully add the boiling water and whisk everything for an additional minute.You can use a whisk instead of electric beaters to combine all the ingredients, but be sure to whisk vigorously to combine everything properly. If you're using a stand mixer instead, use the paddle attachment to make the batter.

, Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. The batter will be quite thin and runny, so be careful not to pour too quickly., Place the cakes in the oven and bake them for 30 to 35 minutes. They are ready when you insert a toothpick into the center of the cake and it comes out clean.


Set the cakes aside to cool for 10 minutes after they come out of the oven., After 10 minutes, transfer the cakes to the wire cooling racks and remove the cake pans. Let the cakes cool completely before adding frosting or decorations., Add the butter to your medium mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Use electric beaters or the paddle attachment to cream the butter on medium speed for about two minutes.When the butter is ready, it will be smooth, creamy, and free of lumps.

, Turn the mixer to low speed. Gradually add 3 cups (375 g) of the powdered sugar to the butter, adding it 1 cup (125 g) at a time.When the sugar has been incorporated, increase the speed to medium and add the salt, vanilla, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the milk.

Beat the frosting on medium speed for about three minutes. This will ensure all the ingredients are fully incorporated, and make the frosting light and fluffy.

, At this point, the frosting may be too stiff to spread or too runny to stick to cake. You can correct this by adding more milk or sugar:For frosting that’s too thick, beat in more milk. Add it 1 tablespoon (15 ml) at a time, until the frosting is light, airy, and easily spreadable.
For frosting that’s too runny, beat in the remaining cup of sugar in ¼-cup (31-g) increments, until you’ve achieved the right consistency.

, To make this cake, you'll need a small quantity of white frosting, a small quantity of black frosting, and a large portion of blue frosting. Leave 2¼ cups of frosting in the original mixing bowl for the blue frosting.

Measure out 1 cup of frosting for the white filling, and ¾ cup of frosting for the black mouth.

, To make the blue fur frosting, start by adding 10 drops of blue food coloring to the large portion of frosting. Whisk in the color to fully combine. Add another 10 drops of color if necessary. Continue whisking in 10 drops of color at a time, until you achieve the desired intensity of blue.

To the ¾ cup of frosting, add five drops of black food coloring and whisk to combine. Add five more drops if necessary, repeating until you have black frosting.
The white frosting doesn’t have to be colored, but you can add chocolate chip cookies to the mix. Place the three cookies in a sealable bag and break them into pea-sized chunks. Fold the cookie chunks into the white frosting until they are evenly distributed.

, Place one of the cakes onto a cake plate or serving platter so that you don’t have to move it after assembly. Spread a generous layer of white cookie crumble frosting on the top of the cake. Carefully lay the second cake on top to create a double layered cake.

Use a large spatula to move the top cake onto the bottom layer.

, To help make the cookie monster fur fuller and more vibrant, coat the entire outside of the cake with a generous layer of blue frosting. Use an frosting knife or a butter knife to spread the frosting on in an even layer.Turn the cake in a circle to make sure that there isn't any chocolate cake showing through from underneath the frosting.
Leave about half of the blue frosting so that you can make the fur.

, Fill a pastry bag with the black frosting. Fit the bag with the round frosting tip. Pipe the outline of a semicircle on the bottom half of the cake, leaving a one-inch (2.5-cm) border of blue frosting around the edges of the cake. Then use the rest of the black frosting to fill in the outline to make cookie monster’s mouth.

With the frosting knife, smooth out the black frosting so there aren't any piping marks.
Don’t clean the pastry bag with the black frosting until you’ve made the pupils for the eyes.
If you don’t have a pastry bag, use a sealable plastic bag instead. Fill the bag with the frosting, and push all the frosting to the bottom right corner of the bag. With sharp scissors, snip off the corner of the bag so you can pipe out the frosting.

, Fill a clean pastry bag with the remaining blue frosting. Fit the bag with the grass tip. Starting at the center and working your way outward in a spiral motion, use the special tip to apply frosting fur to the top and sides of the cake. Squeeze the pastry bag to release some frosting. Pipe about a half-inch (1.3 cm) of frosting, and then pull the bag up and away to create the fur.Apply frosting fur around the black frosting that you piped for cookie monster’s mouth. Do not cover the mouth with blue fur.

, Position the two white candy melts side by side at the top center of the cake, so that the top half of each candy melt is overhanging the cake. Press the candy melts gently into the icing to secure them in place. To make the pupils, make one dot on each candy melt with the black icing.Cookie monster’s pupils are always lopsided and slightly crossed. For the left eye, position the pupil in the bottom right half of the candy melt. On the right eye, place the pupil in the top left half of the candy melt.

, Break one of the chocolate chip cookies in half and position one of the halves on the cake so it’s sticking out of cookie monster’s mouth.Before serving the cake, break up the remaining chocolate chip cookies and sprinkle the crumbs and chunks around the cake on the serving plate.

At this point, you'll already start to see the formation of a butterfly shape., Pull the top wings up and the bottom wings down and you'll see an ideal butterfly shape, ready for frosting., As with the cake above, the cake needs to be decorated in place, as you won't be able to move it again., This seals in the crumbs that will be starting to fall out after cutting the wing shapes. Frost down all of the sides of the wings, keeping this layer very thin.

To set this layer, place it in the freezer for 15-20 minutes. This will make it much easier to add the whipped frosting.

, Add the layer generously first, then spread neatly with the frosting spatula.,

Place three colors into pastry cones or piping bags; these can be made easily from paper or cellophane if you don't own any. For the colors, choose according to the kind of butterfly you're trying to make or just use colors the cake recipient likes. Pastels are one possibility, neon colors another, and realistic colors too (look online for butterfly images to get the real colors).

If you don't like pistachios, you can replace them with more ground almonds instead.;
, Place a sieve over a large mixing bowl. Pour the mixture through the sieve. Gently tap the sieve to help guide the mixture into the bowl. This will remove any large lumps or coarse pieces. Discard anything that is left in the sieve and set the bowl aside.

If you have lots of chunky pieces in the sieve, you can try grinding them again instead of throwing them out.
If you have just a few chunky pieces left, consider saving them for garnishing the cake with later.

, Save the other egg white for later. If your food processor has a whisk attachment and a bowl insert, you can use that instead. You can also use an electric mixer, but make sure that the bowl is clean and dry.

Don't toss the yolks out! Save them for another recipe, such as scrambled eggs.

, Pour a third of the sugar into the egg whites, then beat the egg whites for 1 minute. Add the rest of the sugar, then beat the egg whites again until they turn stiff and form shiny peaks. This will take a little over a minute., Use a rubber spatula to scrape the nut mixture into the beaten egg whites. Gently fold the egg whites over the nut mixture, again and again, until evenly combined.

Gently fold it into the batter along with a few drops of food coloring. Keep mixing until the color is consistent and the batter is smooth enough to slide from the spatula in a thin ribbon.

Green is a popular choice, especially with pistachios, but you can also try other colors as well, such as pink.
A few drops of food coloring is all you need. The more you add, the brighter the cake will turn out.

, Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper. Draw a 10-inch (25.4-centimeter) circle on each one. This will be your template, so make sure that both circles match up. Use a compass, plate, bowl, or lid if you have to. Set the baking sheets aside when you are done., Cut the top off of a piping bag first, then insert a plain, round, decorating tip down the bag and out through the hole. Fill the bag with the prepared batter. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean so that you don't waste anything., Use the drawn circle as a guide. Do not fill the circle in. This will eventually make the top of the cake., Start by outlining the circle with batter first. Then, working in a spiral from outside in, fill the circle with more batter. This will make the bottom of the cake., This gives the batter time to solidify enough for the baking process. It will also prevent the cakes from turning flat. During this wait time, you can start preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C)., Carefully place the trays into the oven. The ring will be done in 15 minutes. The filled disk will be done in 20 to 25 minutes. The cakes will rise a little bit during baking, just like macarons. They won't rise as much as real cakes., Once the cakes are done baking, take them out of the oven and let them cool while on the baking sheets. Don't remove them from the baking sheets yet, however. If you try to take them off too soon, they will break!, Once the cakes have cooled, peel them away from the parchment paper. Place the disk-shaped cake upside down onto a serving place. The curved side should be facing down. The flat side (that was against the parchment paper) should be facing up., Beat the sugar and cream together until thick. Add the vanilla extract, and continue beating until it thickens and forms soft peaks. Continue whipping the cream at 10-second intervals until it forms stiff peaks.Use a handheld beater if you can. If you have nothing else, then you can use an electric mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks.
If you are out of confectioner's sugar, you can use castor or super-fine sugar instead., Cut the tip off of a clean piping bag. Insert a large, star-shaped piping tip down the bag and out the hole. Use a rubber spatula to fill the bag with frosting and to scrape the bowl clean., Start by piping stars around the outer edge of the disk first, then fill the disk in with more stars. This is your filling, so be generous!, This time, place it right-side-up with the smooth part facing upwards and the flat side (the side that was against the parchment paper) facing against the cream., This part is purely decorative. You can make the piped stars as close together or as far apart as you'd like. If you are not fond of frosting, you can skip this step., For a more artistic touch, slice the strawberries lengthwise, then arrange them in overlapping rings, starting from the outside and working your way inward. This will make them look more like petals on a flower., If you'd like to, you can garnish it with raspberries and a sprinkle of ground pistachios on top."

Make sure the doll and her accessories are clean and spotless.,
Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF.,
If making the cake from scratch, make as follows using the ingredients listed above:

Cream the butter and sugar together.,
Pour the cake mixture into the lined cone cake pan.,
Remove the cake from the oven when baked.,
Prepare the Barbie doll first.,
Make a hole inside the cake.,
When you're happy that the hole is ample enough, push Barbie into the hole.,
Make the icing.,

Add piping to the cake.,
If you like, add fondant flowers at regular intervals around Barbie's ballgown skirt.,
Add Barbie's accessories to her neck, head and hands as needed.,
Done.",How to Make a Barbie Cake1," Sponge clean the doll with mild dish washing detergent and, if necessary, wash the washable accessories in warm, soapy water. Let dry before using.

If her clothing is dirty, wash by hand and let dry before using.
Brush the doll's hair before using the doll; this will avoid getting hair mixed up with the food ingredients. It can help to pull it back while working the doll into the cake, then remove the elastic after.;
, Grease and line the cone cake pan with parchment paper., Make the mixture light and fluffy.
Crack each egg and add one at a time. Beat well.
Sift the flours together. Fold into the mixture and mix through.
Fold in the lemon juice.

, Place in the preheated oven and bake for 40 minutes, or until a skewer pierced into the cake comes out clean.

For a package cake, follow the package instructions.

, Let cool completely before building the Barbie cake.,

Wrap the lower half of the Barbie doll in food grade plastic wrap. Cover everything that will be inserted inside the cake and pay particular attention to ensuring that her clothing is well covered from the waist down, to prevent staining from the food.
Tape the waist end of the plastic wrap in place.

, Place the baked, cooled cake onto a cake board, large base of the cake sitting on the board. Then, using a sharp kitchen knife of a good length and narrow width, carve out a doll-size hole that is deep enough to take Barbie's legs up to her waist area.

It can be helpful to measure Barbie's length before making the hole. You can then slip a ruler inside to gauge the the hole is deep enough before adding the doll into it. The less Barbie has to be stuck in and out of the cake, the better, as this will protect her from staining.

, She should sit in the hole up to the taped waist, with the remainder of her body sitting well above the cake.

Push her arms up into the air to allow you to work on the icing without obstruction.
If you haven't already done so, tie her hair back temporarily with a quality hair elastic, to keep it out of the way while you ice the cake.
Add any Barbie accessories after the icing has been added; the less things in the way, the better.

, You'll need soft icing in two shades, pink and white. For the purposes of this tutorial, it's assumed that pink is the ultimate Barbie color but you don't have to choose pink if you don't want to––vary as needed. To make the icing:

Beat together the butter and water until creamy.
Add the icing sugar/confectioners sugar gradually.
Mix to combine well.
Divide the mixture in a ratio of one third and two thirds. Add a few drops of red food coloring or pink food paste to the two thirds icing, to make pink icing. Leave the one third icing white.
If the icing seems to stiff at any point, add a drop or two more water.

, Cover the entire cone cake with soft pink icing. Let set before adding the piping., This creates the fancy ballgown for Barbie.

Pipe a row of white stars around the base of the cake.
Pipe a row of pink stars above the first white row.
Repeat the rows in alternate colors until you reach Barbie's waist.
Finish with a white row. Add a row of pink candies or dragées/cachous to form the waistline division between Barbie and her ballgown skirt.

, These can be made or purchased ready-made., Take the elastic out of her hair and gently let her hair down. Position her arms elegantly., The Barbie cake is now ready for your little Barbie fan's party."

Sharp knife
Small saucepan and medium glass or metal bowl
Whisk
Two medium bowls, one small bowl, and one large bowl
Sifter
Electric beaters or stand mixer
Wooden spoon or rubber spatula
Two round 9-inch cake pans, greased
Wiring cooling racks
Frosting knife
Cake plate
Piping bag with round tip;
, Cut the chocolate into small pieces and place the pieces into a glass bowl. Fill the bottom of the small saucepan with about an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the bowl on top of the saucepan and heat it over medium heat.

Whisk the chocolate regularly as it melts, and continue heating it until the chocolate is fully melted.
When the chocolate is melted, leave the saucepan and bowl where they are and turn off the heat.

, Sift together the flour, cocoa, 1 cup (225 g) of sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl. This will remove lumps, make the batter easier to combine, and make the cake light and fluffy.If you don’t have a sifter, combine the ingredients in the bowl and whisk them together.

, In a second medium bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat together the eggs, brown sugar, and remaining tablespoon (14 g) of sugar on medium high-speed.

Beat everything for about five minutes, until the eggs and sugar are fully combined and starting to thicken., Reduce the speed of the mixer or beaters to medium and slowly pour in half the oil. Beat for two to three minutes, giving the oil time to incorporate fully. Slowly add the melted chocolate, followed by the remaining oil.

Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour in the buttermilk and vanilla. Beat for one to two minutes, until everything is fully combined., Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. With the rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently mix the batter until all the ingredients are completely incorporated and the batter is smooth.

Stop when the ingredients are combined, as overmixing can develop the gluten in the flour and make the cake too dense and heavy.

, Divide the batter evenly between the two greased cake pans. Bake the cakes for about 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, or with a few fudgy crumbs.Remove the cakes from the oven when they're done and set them aside to cool for 20 minutes.

, After 20 minutes, the cakes will have cooled enough to constrict and pull away from the cake pans. Turn the cakes out onto the cooling racks and allow them to cool to room temperature.

The cakes will likely need about 1.5 hours to cool completely.

, Combine the butter and vanilla in the large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. With electric beaters or the stand mixer’s whisk attachment, cream the butter and vanilla on medium speed until the butter is smooth and light yellow.

With the beaters at the same speed, add the powdered sugar one cup (125 g) at a time until it’s all fully incorporated and creamy.
Add the marshmallow crème (an entire 13-ounce jar) and continue beating until the ingredients come together as a smooth, fluffy, and slightly sticky frosting., Remove about ¼ cup of frosting and place it into a small bowl. Add one or two drops of red food coloring, and whisk the frosting to incorporate the color.

This will be pink frosting to decorate the inside of the bunny’s ears. If the frosting is too pale, whisk in another one to two drops of red.

, The body, face, and legs of the bunny will all be formed with the two cakes, and you have to cut the cakes to make these pieces. Cover the top of one of the cakes with a generous layer of frosting, using a frosting or butter knife to spread the frosting evenly. Place the second cake on top of the frosted cake.With your eye, make an imaginary line down the center of the layered cake. Then move over by an inch (2.5 cm) and cut the cake into two pieces, with one side larger than the other.

, Take the larger half of the cake and stand it upright (cut side down and rounded side up) on a cake plate or serving platter. This will form the body of the bunny.With the remaining section of cake, cut the piece in half down the middle to form two wedges., To make the bunny’s head, take one of the wedges and cut off two inches (5 cm) from the triangular tip. Place the extra cake from the tip into a scrap bowl and set it aside. Place the wedge in front of the body, and butt the trimmed tip against the body so that the rounded edge of the cake is farthest from the body.

Use a knife to round off the pointed edges of the cake to create the head.
When you round off the edges, place the scrap pieces of cake into the scrap bowl.

, With the second wedge of cake, peel apart the two layers and redistribute the frosting so there's an even layer on each piece of the wedge. Place one wedge on either side of the bunny’s body. Attach the first wedge to the right side by pressing the frosted side against the body, lining up the rounded edge of the wedge with the rounded back of the bunny’s body.Repeat with the other wedge on the left side.
Use the knife to round off the sharp edges of the legs, and place the scraps in the scrap bowl.

, Take the cake scraps and use a fork to mash them together in the bowl. Add a dollop of frosting to keep the cake together, and form the cake into a ball with your hands.

Dip the ball into the white frosting and press it onto the back of the bunny’s body to create the tail.

, Use the frosting knife to cover the entire bunny, including the head, body, legs, and tail with a layer of white frosting. Transfer the cake to the fridge and let it set for 20 to 30 minutes.The crumb coat will help to make the final layer of frosting even, smooth, and easier to apply.

, After letting it set for at least 20 minutes, remove the cake from the fridge. Spread a second layer of frosting over the entire cake, smoothing and evening it out with the knife., Sprinkle the coconut evenly over the entire bunny. Go over the entire cake and gently press the coconut into the frosting to create a furry appearance., Cover the top of each piece of biscotti with a layer of white frosting. Transfer the pink frosting into the piping bag and fit it with the round tip. Pipe a straight line of pink frosting down the center of each frosted biscotti top.

Position the ears on the cake by placing the biscotti side by side, and propping the ends up against the head of the bunny. Rest the length of the cookies along the curved body.

, To create the face of the bunny, you'll use black jellybeans for the eyes, a dot of pink frosting for the nose, marshmallow for the cheeks, and black licorice for the whiskers.To make the eyes, place a black jellybean on either side of the bunny’s head. Position the jellybeans at the front of the head, halfway between the top and bottom of the cake. Press the jelly beans gently into the frosting to secure them in place.
For the nose, pipe a jellybean-sized dot of pink frosting onto the front center of the head, on the rounded edge of the cake that’s facing outward and away from the body.
To create the cheeks, cut the marshmallow in half. Position each half of the marshmallow side by side and directly below the nose. Gently press the halves into the frosting to secure them.
For the whiskers, cut four strips of licorice that are each 1.5 inches (3.75 cm) long. Peel each strip apart three-quarters of the way, leaving the two halves attached at one end. Position two pairs of licorice whiskers on either side of the marshmallow cheeks.

, You can either mix them together with a fork or shake them together in a closed container such as a jar or Tupperware. Set aside for now.

, Toss gently with half of the remaining white cookie crumbs and enough chilled pudding to moisten (not soak) the crumbs.

, Add the cake, cookie crumbs, and pudding mixture into a brand new, clean litter box. If you don’t have one, find a large rectangular Tupperware container to act as a stand-in (or sit-in).

, Heat three unwrapped Tootsie rolls in a microwave-safe dish until they're soft and pliable. Pinch off the ends so they are no longer blunt and look convincingly like what cats put in the litter box. Repeat this process with as many Tootsie rolls as you'd like to add, microwaving them in batches of three. Reserve three for the final garnish.

, Sprinkle them with (normal-colored) cookie crumbs to make it look like litter has been kicked onto them.

, This will mimic real litter, where many of the grains are often blue or green.

, Scrape them on top of the cake. One can hang over the side of the litter box. Sprinkle them lightly with cookie crumbs to make them look more recent.

, Place the box on a newspaper and sprinkle a few of the cookie crumbs around. Serve with a brand new, washed litter scooper for that extra touch!

, Follow the package mix instructions and bake the cake in a square cake pan lined with parchment paper.,, Let stand in the pan for 10 minutes after removing from the oven.

Place on a wire cooling rack and let cool completely before icing.

, To do this, draw a butterfly wing template that matches the size of the cake on construction paper or thin card. Cut this out, then place over the square cake. Cut around the template and remove the excess outside pieces, leaving the butterfly shape intact.

Basic butterfly wing shapes can be found by doing a quick online image search.
If you make a sturdy enough template, it can be kept for using another time. Simply brush off crumbs or icing that accumulates over time.

,, Use the same recipe as above. However, there is no need to make two colors; this time simply use pink as the base color (or vary as needed)., Cover all of the sides as well as the top., Alternatively, cut out shapes from fondant and add these in a pattern around the edge of the cake., If you can't find something like this, be creative with any sort of candy that will cover Barbie up modestly., Her head and neck should be located above the cake's middle dip and her legs should come out from the lower dip in the middle of the cake, just above her knees. The wings will fan out from either side of her body.

Barbie should adhere to the existing icing already on the cake but if not, add a few more dabs of icing to help keep her in place.

, If you can find candies shaped like leaves or berries, this will fit the nature/fairy theme. Thick candies can be sliced in half to help them fit better and their sticky insides will make it easier to attach them.

Use icing as the glue to keep the candies stuck to the doll and each other.

Stack the squares on top of each other. This will give you the base of the cake.
Shape the base by shaving gently with the knife down each side of the layered squares. Shape the base as shown in the picture here:

, The cakes need to be the appropriate size to continue creating the narrowing shape that approximates the shape of the real Eiffel Tower.


After you cut the three squares, stack them and then shape them as shown below. Ensure that there is a gradual narrowing to the top layer, using the image as a guide:

, A crumb coat is a light coating of butter cream icing. Do this for both the base and the middle section. Only the base is shown below:

, Color and then roll out the gray fondant. Then cover the entire base of the cake with the fondant.


Cut out the gray fondant to make arches on all four sides as shown below.
Use a red fondant for the middle sections.
Use a model kit knife to slice through the fondant. Do not worry about matching the fondant edges to each other exactly as these will be covered with a border in the next step.

, This covers any gaps you have between the red and gray fondant.


It is important note at this time that you do not need to worry about any small bumps or blunders with the base. As the cake progresses, the small bumps and blunders will be hidden.

, You can use a different pattern and color for the border if you want.

, Using the gray butter cream, start with the base and pipe as shown below. You can use freehand when piping, however, you could also use a guide by using a straight edge pressing in on the fondant and then piping over the creases. Use the image below as a guide:

, Make sure you use dowels and cake pads between the two sections to ensure stability. As you can see now, the cake is starting to take shape:

, You could use Rice Krispie treats covered in fondant as well. Make sure you have a dowel protruding from the top portion so you can attach it to the middle section. After covering the Styrofoam in fondant, continue to pipe it with the gray butter cream as shown in the picture below.

, Finally, you will need to assemble the top section to the base and the middle section. Your final cake should look like the image below:

, If you make a mistake, don't worry - you can cover it with frosting in the next step. (Scroll down to see instructions for smoking nostrils; if you want to add them, preparations must be made before you frost the cake.)

, Use a flat icing tip in your full icing bag on those difficult, moist and crumbly parts. Once the crumbs have been covered up, use your spatula to smooth things over. This method keeps those crumbs from showing up in your icing.

, Make the dragon look scaly by using a child's marker cap to imprint the design onto the creamy frosting. Arrange the cookies along his back and tail; place fruit gems and slices on his toes and head. Press the Hershey's Kisses (pointy side in) onto the end of his snout, and cut the marshmallow in half and place the chocolate chips on top.

, Trim off a corner of the roll-up to keep them from looking too bulky, and after rolling it up the skewer, trim off the edges bat-wing style.

, Make sure not to stick the wings into the cake until right before serving, because they are heavy and will sag over time.

, Cut them into curvy, twisty pieces, and position near mouth.

, In order to ad smoking nostrils to your dragon, you'll first need a base that raises the cake board an inch or two. Cut out the bottom of a cardboard box, or use the bottom of a deep pizza box. Whatever you use, make sure it will accommodate your dry ice chamber, which could be a small, washed-out aspirin container, a small dish with plastic wrap over it, or whatever else you have on-hand. Cover the base in aluminum foil or other thick paper.

, Before you start assembling the dragon on the cake board, guess as closely as you can about where the dragon's head will be. Using a serrated knife, cut a circle abut the size of a nickel under where you plan to have the dragon's nostrils. Then, put the cake board over the base and, using your first hole as a guide, cut a circle in the base.

, After you've cut up the cake and have a head piece, use a straw to poke holes for the nostril. If you've allowed your cake to cool sufficiently, punching it with the straw should remove small amounts of cake without damaging the surrounding area. Be careful that you don't punch too close to the edges, and make holes two to three straws wide.

, You'll be using straws to carry vapor from the dry ice chamber up to the dragon nostrils, but you probably won't need them to be full length. Depending on how deep your base is, trim your straws so that they're an appropriate length.

, Your straws should go through the cake separately, then meet up at the hole in the cake board and the base before going into the dry ice chamber. You don't need the chamber beneath the straws for now.

, Put a few walnut-sized pieces of dry ice in your container, as well as some warm water. Seal the opening as much as you can. For instance, if you're using a washed-out pill bottle, stuff the opening with a few ratted-out cotton balls after you put the straws in. If you're using a small dish cover it in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and slice out two small holes for the straws. Remember, you want the majority of the vapor escaping through the straws.

, Lift the cake, cake board and base up to slide the dry ice chamber underneath and direct the straws in (get a second person to help you do this). You might find as your lifting that you need to trim the straws a bit to fit them in the chamber, so keep a pair of scissors on hand. Once you've settled the cake over the chamber, your fire-breathing dragon should have smoking nostrils.

Using the ingredients list above, combine sugar and butter, then beat in the eggs and vanilla. Mix flour and baking powder together, and then combine the dry ingredients with the sugar-butter-egg mixture. Use the milk to thin out the batter.;
, Separate the batter into two greased 9"" round pans, and put them into a preheated 350 degree oven. They should take 30 to 40 minutes to bake.

, Following the ingredients list above, use a hand-mixer to cream the butter with the vanilla. Slowly add the powdered sugar. Add the meringue powder for hold, and then slowly add the milk until your frosting is the desired consistency.

, 2/4 should be dyed green, ¼ should be white, and ¼ should be dyed blue.

, If you have time, freeze the cakes before assembling the dinosaur. This will help manage the crumbly effect that occurs when you frost it.

, If you have a printer that can print on 11”x17” paper, you can print it large enough for a 9"" cake. Otherwise, take a piece of light construction paper and replicate them by hand. The diameter of the circle should fit a 9"" cake.

, Find the center of one cake. Cut the cake in half with a serrated bread knife. Put the two halves together with cut edges aligned, and place it on your serving plate. This is the body of the dinosaur. Set it aside.

, Cut out the different parts of the paper template along their lines, arrange them on the cake, and carve the cake accordingly.


Before you actually cut the cake, you can arrange the paper pieces to see how they look. If there are any cuts or adjustments you'd like to make, you can plan ahead now.

, Look to the attached photo for help. Use white frosting to join the two body halves together. Add the appendages to the body by stacking them close.


Put the head on the body with some toothpicks (take note of where they are so that you don't accidentally include them in a slice of cake later). Trim the corners and square edges off the feet and shoulders if you like, but the corners will not be a problem once you frost the cake.

, This is called the crumb coat -- and for good reason, as much of the crumbs pull away and get mixed up in the frosting. Use a very light hand on the cut surfaces of cake. This is where having made the cake from scratch will be of most help, as cake mixes are far more crumbly and difficult to work with.

, Use a star tip to pipe on green frosting, then add blue stars for an accents along the back and head.

, Hand cut the fondant with a small knife to create diamond shapes for the plates on the dinosaur's back. Detail the plates with a toothpick to give them a ribbed texture. Make as many or as few as you'd like to put on the dinosaur's back.

, Stick fondant diamond plates into the back. If the frosting does not hold the plates well, stick a toothpick into the plate then stick it into the cake.

, Use candy corn for spikes on the tail, cinnamon candies for the eyes, and chocolate chips for the toes. You can also use any other candy you can think of to accent the tail and head.

, You can use green icing to pipe grass onto the cake board for your herbivore dino to graze on. Or, spread a layer of icing on the board and sprinkle it with toasted coconut flakes to simulate rocky terrain.


Make palm trees with pirouette cookies for the trunk and pieces of parsley for the palms so it looks like your dinosaur is in a forest.

",How to Make an American Flag Cake," Pour the cake mix into a lined 9 x 13"" baking dish. Place in the oven and bake according to the package instructions.;
, Leave to cool for 15 minutes in the baking dish. After 15 minutes, turn the cake out into a cake serving platter and leave to cool completely.


Once cooled, place the cake in the freezer.

, Beat together the cream cheese, whipped topping and powdered sugar. Once smooth, the frosting is ready and it is time to remove the cake from the freezer to add the frosting.

, At this stage, assess whether or not the berries will stay on the frosting, or are at risk of sliding off. If the frosting seems too runny, remove any berries already added, and place the cake back in the freezer for another 15-45 minutes.

, Wash the blueberries and set them aside to dry on a cooling rack or on paper towel. Gently wash the raspberries or strawberries. If using strawberries, hull them after washing. Again, leave to dry - you don't want to add too much moisture to the top of the cake.

, The aim is to make the cake appear like the American flag:


Make the corner ""stars"" from blueberries. Do this by marking the outside of the square first, then infilling with the remaining blueberries. Try to keep this neat and uniform for the best appearance, with even white spaces showing through.
Add the ""stripes"". You can draw a toothpick across the frosting at even intervals to create the rows before adding the berries; the indentation will give the berries something to sit in. If you are using raspberries, simply make 7 rows across the cake, leaving 6 white stripes in between. If you are using strawberries, either cut them in halves, or slice them, depending on what look you are trying to achieve.
If you're short of time and patience, use whipped cream in place of frosting. Fresh cream should only be an at-home option, however, as it needs to stay refrigerated prior to serving, and won't be the best option for picnicking.

Pulse the mixture a few times to combine all the ingredients.You can make this recipe in a bowl if you don’t have a food processor. Whisk together the dry ingredients.;
, Turn the food processor on low. Drop in one cube of chilled butter and wait for it to get incorporated into the dry ingredients. When that happens, add the next cube of butter.


Repeat until you’ve added all the butter. Continue whizzing everything in the food processor until the ingredients come together as a crumbly mixture with the texture of cornmeal.If you don’t have a food processor, use a pastry cutter to gradually cut the butter into the dry ingredients.

, Whisk together the honey, molasses, and water in a separate small bowl. Turn the food processor back on low and pour in the liquid mixture.


Continue processing the ingredients for one to two minutes. Everything will come together as a soft dough.Without a food processor, use a wooden spoon to incorporate the wet and dry ingredients.

, Use your hands to shape the dough into a ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap and transfer it to the fridge. Allow the dough to chill for at least an hour, but you can chill it overnight.


Chilling the dough will get the butter cold again and make the dough easier to work with. It will also let the ingredients relax and come together, enhancing the flavors and ensuring the right texture., When the dough has had time to chill, remove it from the fridge and turn it out onto a flat, floured surface. Preheat your oven to 350 F (177 C).






Knead the dough for a minute or so, until it comes together into a cohesive ball. Add more flour, and use a floured rolling pin to roll out the dough.
Roll the dough out to a thickness of one-eighth of an inch (0.3 cm). Make the thickness of the dough as even as possible to prevent burning and undercooking.Add more flour to the surface and the rolling pin as needed if the dough starts to stick.

, There are a couple ways you can cut the dough, depending on whether you want traditional graham crackers or more unique ones. When the cookies are ready, place them onto greased or parchment-lined baking sheets.


You can use a pizza cutter to cut the cookies into squares or rectangles with straight edges. If you want squares, make them roughly two inches by two inches (5 cm by 5 cm). To make rectangles, cut the dough into cookies that are 2.5 inches by five inches (6.3 cm by 13 cm).Alternatively, you can also use a fluted pastry wheel to cut the graham crackers with rippled edges.For the most traditional graham crackers, use the pizza cutter or pastry wheel to cut the cookies into rectangles.
Another option is to use cookie cutters to cut the dough into shapes of your choice.

, Once the cookies are transferred to the baking sheet, prick each one a few times with the tines of a fork. Then sprinkle a thin layer of sugar over the top of each cookie.


The reason you poke holes in certain baked goods is to allow air flow through and to prevent them from puffing up as they bake.

, Bake the cookies for about 15 minutes. They're ready when they become golden brown around the edges. Leave the cookies on the baking sheet to cool for five minutes.Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and allow to cool to room temperature before serving or using for other treats.


To store, line an air-tight container with parchment paper to help prevent breakage, and store the cookies for about a week., S’mores are traditional campfire fare in many places. You make them by layering chocolate between two graham crackers, and then sticking a hot marshmallow in between to melt the chocolate. Per s’more, you'll need:Two graham crackers
Two squares of chocolate
One marshmallow

, There are a couple ways you can do this, depending on whether you're sitting around the fire or at home wishing you were! To heat the marshmallow on the fire, pierce it through the middle with a roasting stick. Hold it over the flames until it becomes golden brown on the outside.


To make s’mores at home, preheat your oven to 400 F (204 C). Place each marshmallow on top of a graham cracker, and roast them in the oven for up to five minutes., Place one graham cracker on a plate, followed by the two pieces of chocolate. Place the marshmallow on top, and then use the second graham cracker on top to sandwich in the marshmallow. Apply gentle pressure to the top and bottom of the s’more as you pull out the roasting stick.


At home, place the graham cracker and marshmallow on a plate. Arrange the chocolate on top, and then top the whole thing off with a second graham cracker.

, Graham crackers can be crushed to make a delicious crust that can be used for pies, ice cream pies, and other yummy desserts. To make this crust, you will need:1½ cups (128 g) graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons (85 g) unsalted butter, melted
⅓ cup (75 g) sugar
Food processor
Medium bowl
Rubber spatula or wooden spoon
9-inch pie plate

, Break the crackers and put them into a food processor. Pulse a few times to break the crackers up into small crumbs. You'll need about 15 to 18 crackers to get 1½ cups of crumbs.If you don’t have a food processor, transfer the crackers to a freezer bag and roll over them with a rolling pin to crush them to crumbs.

, Transfer the crumbs to a medium bowl and add in the melted butter and sugar. Stir to fully combine all the ingredients. The final mixture should have the texture of course sand.To add some extra spice to your pie crust, add in ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of cinnamon.You don’t want to make the crust in the food processor, because the blades will make the crumbs too fine.

, Transfer the crust mixture to the pie plate. Use the spatula to spread it around. Evenly press the crust into the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate.


To make the pie crust flat and even, gently stamp it down with a glass or measuring cup.

, To use the crust for a pie that requires baking, make your pie filling, fill the crust, and bake as directed. You can also place the crust in a freezer bag (in the plate) and transfer the crust to the freezer and store it for up to three months.To use the crust for a no-bake pie, blind bake the crust first. Preheat the oven to 300 F (149 C). When the oven is ready, bake the crust for seven to eight minutes. Remove from the oven, cool, and chill in the fridge for at least two hours before using.

Use butter.,
Try white sugar or corn syrup.,
Skip the eggs.",How to Make Crispy Cookies1," Flour, eggs and brown sugar all hold on to moisture, leading to fluffy moist cookies. If you are look for a crispier treat, try using less of these three ingredients., All-purpose flour has a higher protein content compared to other flours. Extra protein helps create a browner appearance and crispier texture., This will allow the cookies time to spread before they firm. It will also help dry out your cookies as well., Compared to shortening, butter has a lower melting temperature. This will allow your cookies to spread more during baking. Butter also has protein in it, which helps with browning and crisping., Avoid using brown sugar, which holds on to moisture, and instead use a processed sugar. This will lead to a drier and crispier cookie., Eggs hold a lot of moisture and, when cooked, they release lots of steam. This steam acts as a leavening agent, making cookies moist and fluffy. You will get a flatter, thinner and crispier cookie without eggs.You can substitute applesauce instead of an egg, but applesauce also has a lot of moisture in it.You could also try out vegetable oil.

, Mixing your dry ingredients together separately ensures that everything gets evenly mixed together later on. Set the bowl aside when you are done., You can do this using a whisk or an electric mixer. You can also use a food processor fitted with whisks as well.

If you are vegan, you can use ""vegan butter"" instead.

, You might find it easier to mix if you add the sugar in a little bit at a time. You want the sugars and butter to be evenly combined., Keep whisking until everything is evenly combined. If you are vegan, you can use a non-dairy milk, such as almond or soy., At this point, the mixture will start to stick together to form a ball. If you were using a whisk, you might want to switch to a rubber spatula at some point., You can use more or fewer chocolate chips than what the recipe calls for, depending on your personal tastes. You can also use chocolate chunks for something more rustic instead.

If you are vegan, use either ""vegan"" chocolate chips, or cocoa baking chips; those are typically made from pure cocoa and do not contain any dairy.

, If the dough is too soft and oily, you'll have a hard time with the next step. In this case, wrap the dough up with plastic wrap, and stick it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, or until it hardens back up again., Make sure that the balls are a few inches/centimeters apart, as they will spread while baking., You can do this using the bottom of a cup or your palm. Don't flatten them too much, however; you still want them to be dome-shaped, like mushrooms.

Let the cookies cool.",How to Make Crispy Cookies2," Before you begin baking, you will need to make sure that you have 2 cups of light brown sugar, 1 ¾ cups of unsalted butter, 1 ½ cups of granulated sugar, 3 whole eggs, 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract, 2 ¼ cups of white flour, 1 ½ teaspoons of table salt, ¾ teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 pound of dark or semi-sweet chocolate. Have all of these ingredients on hand before you begin making your cookies.This recipe will make roughly 34 cookies.
Make sure that your butter is at room temperature.

, It is important that the oven has had enough time to reach the appropriate temperature for baking crispy cookies. If you put your dough into an oven that is not warm enough, your cookies will likely melt together into a giant cookie mess.For a thicker, yet still crispy, cookie, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius)., Mix the brown sugar, butter and granulated sugar in a stand mixer until the mixture is pale and fluffy. This should take about five minutes. Once the sugars and butter are creamed, add three eggs one at a time and mix them in completely. Finally, mix in 1/3 cup of water and the vanilla.Fat will help make your cookies crispier. The more butter, the crispier the cookie.Add ¼ cup of vegetable oil to make your cookies a little thicker.If you do not have a standing mixer, you can mix these ingredients together by hand. However, it will take much longer.

, In a separate bowl, mix these ingredients together. Once they are incorporated, add the flour mixture to the butter and mix on low until thoroughly combined. Finally, mix in the chocolate pieces.Be sure to mix slowly. You want to ensure that everything is mixed evenly. You also do not want to make a mess.

, Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Scoop out cookie dough and freeze for an hour. Because they will melt a lot when they cook, try to keep at least four inches between each cookie.If you want more evenly distributed and uniform cookies, use an ice cream scoop.
Using parchment paper will make sure that the cookies do not stick. It also helps your baking sheets last longer.
If you are not going to cook all of the cookies, pop the remainder off of the parchment paper and place them in a freezer bag. You can store your cookies in the freezer for up to two weeks.

, Place the cookies in the oven and bake them for 15 to 20 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through. The longer the cookies bake, the crispier they will get, so try different lengths of time to find the right crispiness for you.Depending on your oven, heating time may vary.

, Once they have baked to the desired crispiness, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool. Because they will be extremely thin, use a spatula to remove the cookies.Let the cookies cool on the sheet for a crispier texture.

Make sure that the butter is room temperature.

, Make sure that the oven is preheated to the right temperature. The correct amount of heat is essential to ensure that you have crispy cookies., In medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside until you have creamed your butter., In a large bowl, mix the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar. If you are using a stand mixer or handheld electric mixer, begin on a low setting for about 30 seconds, to get the mixture started, and then increase the speed to medium and mix for about a minute, or until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla and continue to mix on medium until well incorporated.Remember to mix slowly at first and increase the speed gradually so that you do not create a mess.
You can also mix by hand. However, that will take more time.

, Once your butter mixture is good and whipped, add the flour mixture and stir until well-mixed. After that, gradually add the oats and mix until they are well-combined. Incorporating all of the dry ingredients should take about two minutes.You can also stir the mixture with a wooden spoon to make sure that no flour pockets remain and that the dough is fully incorporated.

, Use a spoon or ice cream scoop to scoop out two tablespoon-sized chunks of dough and form them into balls. Place each ball of dough about 2 ½ inches apart on a baking sheet. If you like a thinner cookie, you can also squish the dough. However, the cookies should melt enough on their own and become rather thin.You should be able to put about 8 dough balls on a baking sheet. However, that number may change depending on the size of your sheet.

, Place the sheet with cookies in the preheated oven and let them bake until golden brown. This should take about 15 minutes. However, it may take longer depending on your taste.

Make sure that the butter is room temperature.

, Turn on the oven and set it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). If the oven is too hot or too cold, you will not get the crispy texture you desire., In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Once the butter is creamed, mix in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla. This should only take a few minutes with a stand mixer or handheld mixer.Make sure that the butter is softened but not melted.

, In small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Once they are thoroughly mixed, add a little of it to the butter mix. Alternate adding the flour mix and the milk until fully incorporated.Remember to mix slowly at first and speed up as the dough constitutes.

, Leave the dough in the mixing bowl and cover it with a cloth or plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes, or until it is easily malleable. The dough should be relatively dense., Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to a 1/8th inch thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out the shapes you want.Getting the right thickness when you roll out the dough will help you get a crispier cookie.

, Grease a baking sheet or cover it in parchment paper. Then place the cut out cookies about two inches apart on the sheets.If the cookies are too close together, they will melt to each other. Plus the edges might not get crispy.

, Place the cookies in the oven for about 10 minutes or until the edges are light brown.Cooking time may vary depending on taste and oven.

, Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and leave them on the sheets to cool. This will ensure that they get nice and crispy.Once they have cooled, you can also ice the sugar cookies. Waiting until the cookies are cool with ensure that your icing does not melt and run.

If you are using a whisk, you might find it helpful to switch to a rubber spatula.

If the flour is too sticky, add up to 3 tablespoons (22.5 grams) of flour.

, All that mixing and whisking likely made the dough very soft and sticky. This will make it hard to work with when you roll it out. Wrap the dough up with plastic wrap, then stick it in the fridge until it hardens by up again, about 30 minutes., You can also use a tablespoon or an ice cream scoop to make the balls.

Place it in the refrigerator and chill it for an hour or until it is easier to handle.If you prefer, you can prepare the dough the day before and chill it overnight. However, let it sit out for 15 to 20 minutes to soften it slightly so it’s easier to roll out.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cookies, set the temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully preheat. Next, grease a large cookie sheet with nonstick cooking spray so the cookies won’t stick.If you prefer, you can line the cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat instead of greasing it.

, When the dough is firm, turn it out on a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll it out to ¼-inch thickness (6-mm) and use Easter-themed cookie cutters to cut out the cookies.If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a wine bottle, thermos, or heavy jar to roll out the dough.
Some Easter-themed cookie cutters that you may want to use include egg, bunny, chick, and flower styles.

, After you’ve cut out the cookies, transfer them to the greased cookie sheet. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until they are a light golden brown., While the cookies are baking, mix 2 cups (250 g) of confectioners’ sugar, 1 tablespoon (10 g) of meringue powder, ¼ cup (59 ml) of warm water, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of almond extract in a medium bowl. Beat the ingredients together on low for 5 minutes, or until a smooth icing forms.You can substitute vanilla extract for the almond extract if you prefer.

, If you’d like to color the icing, divide it between small bowls based on how many different colors you’d like. Add several drops of liquid food coloring in your chosen color to each bowl and stir until the icing is tinted.Pastel colors, such a light pink, blue, yellow, green, and purple, work best for Easter cookies.
Start with just a drop or two of the food coloring and only add more if you want the color to be darker.

, When the cookies are finished baking, cool them for 15 to 20 minutes on a wire rack. Once they are cool, use a piping bag or small offset spatula to decorate the cookies with the frosting. Allow the cookies to dry for at least 1 to 2 hours before serving.When the icing is still wet, you can also add sprinkles, colored sugar, and other cookie decorations to the cookies.
Store any leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature. They should stay fresh for up to a week.

Consider the cooking time.,
Check the baking tray or sheet.,
Review your storage methods.",How to Troubleshoot Failed Biscuits or Cookies1," If not cooked long enough, the biscuits or cookies can remain too soft.;
, The baking tray or sheet is important when baking biscuits or cookies. Too slim a base, and they can burn; sides that are too high, and the biscuits or cookies can cook unevenly, leaving some of them too soft.

, If the biscuits or cookies came out fine but have gone soft since, some of the following might be the cause:


The biscuits or cookies were not allowed to cool on the tray/sheet. Resist moving them too quickly from the tray/sheet - a little of the cooking time continues the tray/sheet. Simply loosen them, leave on the tray/sheet to cool for a short time, then move to the wire cooling rack to cool completely.
The biscuits or cookies were placed in their storage container before they had fully cooled down. Warmth brings moisture with it and if you transfer biscuits or cookies that are even only slightly warm to an airtight container, you effectively trap the moisture in, creating a perfect softening environment. Wait until the biscuits or cookies are cold before storing.
The storage container is not airtight. Any air getting into a container will cause biscuits and cookies to soften. Replace with an airtight container.

Review the raising (rising) agent used.",How to Troubleshoot Failed Biscuits or Cookies3," If butter and sugar are over-creamed, this can cause spreading during baking.

, Lack of adequate dry ingredients can cause spread because the mixture is too soft to begin with.

, If you have overdone the raising agent, this can cause the biscuits or cookies to rise too quickly, with the result of fast spread before enough time has occurred to set them by baking. Always err on the side of less when it comes to raising agents in biscuits and cookies.

Use a hand mixer to cream the ingredients together on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy.You can mix the cookie dough in a stand mixer if you prefer.
You can also mix the dough by hand, but it will take a little longer.;
, Once the butter and sugar mixture is combined, add 1 egg and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract. With the hand mixer on medium, blend until they’re fully incorporated., In a separate bowl, combine 3 cups (375 g) of all-purpose flour and ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of salt. Toss the two together until they’re well mixed.If you’ve used salted butter in the dough, you can omit the salt if you prefer.

, Once the flour and salt are mixed, add it to the butter mixture in increments. Blend with the hand mixer on low until the dry ingredients are fully incorporated.Be careful not to overmix the dough, or you may wind up with tough cookies.

, When the dough is completely mixed, separate it into two bowls. Leave one half as is. Mix ¼ cup (30 g) of baking cocoa into the other bowl until it’s completely blended. You’ll wind up with a bowl of cream colored dough and a bowl of chocolate colored dough.You don’t have to add the cocoa to color the dough if you plan to make the zebra stripes with icing. Instead, leave all of the dough cream colored and decorate the baked cookies with the royal icing as described below.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cookies, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 375 degrees (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully.Pay attention to your oven so you know when it’s ready. It will probably flash an indicator light or beep as an alert.

, Place the cream colored dough between two pieces of wax paper, and place the chocolate colored dough between another two pieces of wax paper. With a rolling pin, roll each piece into a 9-inch (23-cm) square.You can substitute parchment paper for the wax paper.
If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a wine bottle, thermos, or glass.

, After you’ve rolled the dough out into squares, use a knife to slice each one into 3-inch (8-cm) strips. You should have 3 strips for each square for a total of six. Next, slice the strips in half lengthwise to create rectangles.The rectangles should be approximately 4 ½-inch by 3-inch (11-cm by 8-cm). You should have a total of 12 rectangles.

, Set a piece of plastic wrap down, and place a cream square on it. Layer a chocolate rectangle on top, and repeat the process until you’ve used up all of the rectangles.If you’re going to use the royal icing to add zebra stripes, there’s no need to do these layering steps. Simply roll out the dough, and use the cookie cutters to cut the horse shapes.

, Wrap the plastic wrap around the layered dough to cover it completely. Place it the refrigerator to chill for 2 hours., When the dough is properly chilled, remove it from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Use a knife to cut it into slices widthwise that are approximately ¼-inch (6-mm) thick.You should wind up with a total of 18 slices.

, Dip a horse-shaped cookie cutter in flour to coat it. Press it into the dough slice to create a shaped, striped cookie. Repeat the process with all of the slices.Be sure to use a horse cookie cutter that’s 4-inches (10-cm) or smaller.

, After you’ve cut out all of the cookies, place them on an ungreased baking sheet. There should be at least 1-inch (2.5 cm) between them to prevent them from baking together., Place the baking in sheet in the preheated oven. Allow the cookies to bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until their edges become lightly golden.To ensure that the cookies bake evenly, use the center rack in the oven.

, When they’re finished baking, let the cookies sit on the baking sheet for 2 minutes to allow them to set slightly. Next, transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.It should take approximately 15 to 20 minutes for the cookies to cool completely.

, Add 3 pasteurized egg whites and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice to a medium size bowl. Mix until the two are fully combined.If you prefer, you can substitute 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla for the lemon juice., When the egg whites and lemon juice are combined, mix 1 pound (454 g) of confectioners’ sugar into the bowl. Use a hand mixer on low to blend it in until the sugar is fully incorporated. Turn the mixer’s speed up to medium, and mix the icing for approximately 5 minutes or until stiff peaks form.If the icing hasn’t formed stiff peaks, you may need to turn the mixer’s speed up to medium-high.

, Remove half of the icing, and place it in a separate bowl. Add a few drops of black food coloring to the one of the bowls of icing, and stir to blend it in completely.Start with 2 to 3 drops of food coloring. Add more if the icing isn’t as dark as you’d like.
You don’t necessarily have to use black food coloring. Get creative, and make zebra stripes in whatever color you prefer.

, Cover the bowl with the black icing with plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator until you’re ready to use it.Press the plastic wrap down onto the surface of the icing to keep it from forming a crust.

, Use a butter knife to spread the white icing all over the zebra cookies. If you prefer, you can transfer the icing to a piping bag and pipe it all over the cookies to fill them in completely.Make sure the cookies are cooled completely before frosting them. The icing will melt if the cookies are still warm.
If you want to pipe the icing on and it seems too thick, mix a few drops of water into it to thin it out.

, Once all of the zebra cookies are filled in with the white royal icing, it’s important to allow the icing to set completely. Let the cookies sit for 12 to 24 hours so the icing has time to set completely., When the white icing has set and you’re ready to add the zebra stripes, remove the black royal icing from the refrigerator. Allow it to sit out for 1 to 2 hours or until it comes to room temperature. When it’s soft enough, transfer it to a piping bag that’s fitted with a fine tip.Stir the icing as it’s warming to help it along.
If the icing is too thick to pipe when it’s finished warming, add a few drops of water to thin it out.

, With the black icing in the piping bag, carefully pipe the outline of elongated, irregular triangles over the cookie to create the stripes. Fill in the triangles with the icing too.For the best look, alternate the stripes from one side of the cookie to the other as you make them.

, If you plan to serve the cookies, allow the icing to set for 20 to 30 minutes. However, if you plan to package them to distribute as gifts, wait at least 12 hours before placing them in bags or containers."

Place the cookies on a cooling rack.",How to Make Mint Chocolate Chip Cookies," Before you begin to bake the cookies, first preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176.66 C). By the time you finish preparing the dough for the cookies, the oven should be fully preheated., Begin making the cookie dough by turning on an electric standing mixer to medium speed. Add 1 cup (236.59 ml) of room temperature butter to the bowl and pour in the 1 ½ cup (354.89) of sugar gradually while the butter and sugar get beaten together.Try to use an electric mixer. If you mix by hand, the cookies will have a denser texture than if you mix them using a mixer.
You can also use an electric handheld mixer if you don’t have a standing mixer.

, After you have added the last of the sugar, turn off the mixer and scrape the butter and sugar mixture from the sides of the bowl into the middle of the bowl. Then turn the mixer back onto medium speed and beat the butter and sugar for 2 minutes, or until it the mixture is fluffy and lighter in color., After beating the butter and sugar, crack two eggs into the bow of the mixer. In a small separate bowl, crack in another egg. Use a large spoon to remove the yolk from the separate egg and add this to the large bowl of ingredients, disposing of the egg white., Once you add the egg, add the teaspoon (4.93 ml) of peppermint extract to the dough to give the cookies a distinctive mint taste. If you want the cookies to be green, add 10 drops of food coloring. Then beat on high until the egg and other ingredients are incorporated into the dough.10 drops of food coloring will give the cookies a light green color. If you want an intense green, add a few additional drops.

, In a separate large bowl, add together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cream of tartar and salt. Mix with a large spoon until the dry ingredients are mixed together., Mix with the electric mixer until the dough is almost homogeneous and the flour is nearly integrated., Pour in half of the chocolate chips, and place the rest of the chocolate chips on a cutting board. Use a large, sharp knife to coarsely chop the rest of the chocolate chips, then add the chopped chocolate chips into the bowl of dough.Chopping half the chocolate chips will make the chocolate more integrated into the cookie, giving you cookies with some large chunks of chocolate and smaller pieces of chocolate baked into the dough.
If you prefer having only large chunks of chocolate, add all the chocolate chips to the dough whole instead of chopping some of them.

, Once you add the chocolate chips, turn the mixer back on medium speed and mix the dough until all the ingredients are just mixed together. Then turn off the mixer and remove any dough from the blades of the mixer, adding it back to the bowl., Instead of baking the cookies directly after making the dough, you should chill the dough for least an hour to improve the texture of the cookies. Cover the bowl of dough in plastic wrap and place the dough in the fridge for at least an hour and up to 24 hours.Chilling the dough prevents the cookies from spreading out significantly in the oven, and also improves the texture of the cookies, making them chewier and less doughy tasting., While the dough is chilling, you can prepare the cookie sheets for baking by lining two cookie sheets with parchment paper. If you don’t have parchment paper, you can grease the sheets using butter or cooking spray.Try to use parchment paper if you can, as greasing can cause the cookies to spread more than may be desired.

, After the dough has chilled for at least an hour, remove it from the fridge. Use your hands or a 2-inch (5 cm) cookie scoop to form the dough into balls that are roughly 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. Place the dough balls spread out on the baking sheets, with at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space between each dough ball.These cookies will be on the large side. If you want a smaller cookie, make balls that are about 1 ½ inches (3.81 cm) in diameter.
If you are using your hands, try not to over-handle the dough. Make the dough balls quickly instead of continuously rolling and compacting the dough. Over-handling will change the texture of the cookies.

, Once you have prepared the cookies for baking, place the cookie sheets into the preheated oven and bake the cookies for 8 minutes., After the 8 minutes are up, open the oven and check to see if the cookies are beginning to brown. If the edges are slightly browned, remove the cookies from the oven. If not, bake them for another 2 minutes and then take them out of the oven., After taking the cookies out of the oven, let the cookie sheets sit on the stovetop for 5 minutes. This allows the cookies to solidify slightly so that they won’t break when you try to pick them up., Once the cookies have cooled for five minutes, use a spatula to gently scoop up the cookies and place them on a cooling rack. If you don’t have a cooling rack, place them on a plate or clean surface. Let the cookies cool for at least 10 minutes, then serve and enjoy these tasty confections!

Use a cooling rack if you have one, as it will allow your cookies to cool evenly.

",How to Make Slice‐and‐Bake Cookies," Add 1 cup (230 g) of unsalted butter that’s been softened to room temperature to the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Turn the mixer on medium, and beat the butter until it is smooth, which should take approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute.If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can mix the cookie dough with a handheld electric mixer. You can also mix the dough by hand, but it will be a little more time and labor intensive.;
, Once the butter is smooth, mix in ⅔ cup (83 g) of confectioners’ sugar that’s been sifted. Beat the mixture again until it has a silky, smooth texture, which should take approximately 30 seconds.Using confectioners’ sugar instead of granulated sugar helps give the dough a smoother texture.

, When the sugar is blended with the butter, add 2 large egg yolks that are at room temperature, a pinch of salt, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract. Beat the mixture until all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined.You can substitute almond extract for the vanilla if you prefer.
If you want to add dried fruits, such as raisins or cranberries, or whole nuts, such as walnuts or pecans, to the cookies, mix them in with the eggs, vanilla, and salt.

, When the eggs, vanilla, and salt are incorporated, turn the mixer’s speed down to low and slowly add the flour. Blend the mixture until the flour is just incorporated.Be careful not to overmix the flour into the dough. You’re better off under mixing with the stand mixer and using a spatula to fold in any flour that hasn’t been incorporated.

, To make chocolate slice-and-bake cookies, substitute ¼ cup (30 g) of unsweetened cocoa for ¼ cup (35 g) of flour in the base dough recipe. Mix the dough as normal.For even more chocolatey flavor, mix in ½ cup (90 g) of mini chocolate chips after the dough has come together.

, If you prefer a nutty flavor, replace ½ to 1 cup (70 to 140 g) of the flour with the same amount of ground nuts and mix the dough as normal. Walnuts, pecans, almonds, and hazelnuts are all delicious options.You can bump up the flavor of the cookies by mixing chopped nuts into the dough. Add them with the egg yolks, vanilla, and salt.

, Give your cookies a tart flavor by adding ½ cup (60 g) of finely chopped dried cranberries and the zest from 2 oranges to to the dough with the egg yolks, vanilla, and salt. Add the flour as directed above.You can substitute lime or lemon zest for the orange if you prefer.

, Add a spicy flavor to the cookies by mixing in 2 teaspoons (5 g) of cinnamon with the flour. Blend the flour and cinnamon into the dough as normal.After you’ve formed the dough into logs and are getting ready to slice them, roll it through a plate of cinnamon sugar to coat the outside of the cookies.

, For a simple twist on basic slice-and-bake cookies, add ½ cup (90 g) of mini peanut butter or chocolate chips after you’ve mixed in the flour. Fold the chips in with a spatula until they’re fully incorporated.You can try other types of chips as well. Toffee, butterscotch, pumpkin spice, and other flavored chips can make the cookies even tastier.

, When all of the ingredients are mixed, dump the dough out on a counter or cutting board. Use your hands to form a ball, and divide it into two equal parts.If you find that the dough is sticking to the counter or work surface, lightly dust the area with flour.

, Once the dough is divided into two balls, wrap each one in plastic wrap. Place them in the refrigerator, and allow them to chill for 30 minutes., After the dough has chilled, remove it from the fridge. Place it on a flat work surface and carefully roll each piece into a log that is approximately 1 to 1 ¼ inches (2.5 to 3.2 cm) thick.You don’t need to pay much attention to the length of the logs. As long as they’re the right width, you’ll wind up with proper cookies.

, When you’ve shaped the dough into logs, wrap each one in plastic wrap. Return them to the refrigerator, and allow them to chill for 2 hours.If the dough is wrapped up airtight, you can keep it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or 3 months in the freezer.

, After the dough has chilled for a couple of hours, remove it from the refrigerator. Unwrap the dough, and roll the logs through a coating of your choice if desired. Granulated sugar, cinnamon sugar, and chopped nuts are all tasty options.For holidays and special occasions, try rolling the dough in colored sugar or sprinkles to give the cookies a more festive look.

, When you’re ready to bake the cookies, set the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully preheat. Next, line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to keep the cookies from sticking to them.If you don’t have parchment paper or silicone mats, you can grease the cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray or butter.

, To create the cookies, use a sharp knife to slice the dough into ¼-inch (6.3-mm) thick discs. Turn the logs a quarter turn after each slice to help keep the cookies round.If the dough gets soft as you’re slicing, place it back in the refrigerator to firm up. It will cut more easily if it’s cold.

, Once you’ve sliced all of the dough, place the cookies on the lined cookie sheets. Make sure to space them ½ inch (1.5 cm) apart because they will spread during baking.If you would like to add granulated sugar, chopped nuts, sprinkles, or other toppings to cookies, sprinkle them over the dough before the cookies bake.

, Place the cookies in the oven, and allow them to bake until they are set without browning. It should take approximately 12 to 14 minutes.For softer cookies, bake them for 12 minutes.
For crisper cookies, bake them for 14 minutes.

, Once the cookies have finished baking, remove the trays from the oven. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack and allow them to cool completely, which should take 15 to 20 minutes.Cookies that are stored in an airtight container stay fresh for up to 5 days.

Try to use metallic cutters over plastic ones.,
Dip each cookie cutter into very slightly warmed cooking oil before using.,
Ensure that the cookie dough is cold.",How to Prevent Cookie Dough from Sticking when Cutting Cookie Shapes," The coldness of the metal is more likely to glide through the dough while plastic is warmer and tends to get stuck against the dough more easily.;
, The greasing of the cutter will ensure ease of cutting. Repeat as often as needed (it's recommended to keep a small bowl of the warmed cooking oil next to your work area for fast dipping).

, Warm cookie dough is far less responsive to being cut into shapes than colder, firmer dough. If the dough is too warm, place in the refrigerator for 15-30 minutes to allow it to chill and harden a little before cutting out the shapes.

, Measure out 1 cup of powdered sugar and pour it into a large mixing bowl. Then, crack six eggs and add these to the bowl as well. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to combine the eggs and sugar.








Start out by mixing the ingredients on low and then increase the speed after the powdered sugar is mostly incorporated with the eggs. This will help to prevent powdered sugar from flying everywhere.
Mix the sugar and eggs until they reach a fluffy consistency. This will take about 5 to 10 minutes.

, Next, measure out ½ a cup of melted butter. Add the melted butter to the egg and sugar mixture. You can use a hand mixer or stand mixer to combine melted butter with the eggs and sugar.








Mix for about 30 seconds on a medium speed.

If you are not a fan of lemon, then try adding a different flavor to your cookies. Vanilla is a safe alternative that has a mild flavor.You could also try something more adventurous. For example, you could try almond, peppermint, anise, or coconut.

, Flour is the last ingredient that you will add to the mixing bowl. You will need to add 6 cups of flour to the bowl, so use a measuring cup and add the flour to the bowl. After you have added the flour, you can mix it in with the other ingredients using the mixer, a large spatula, or your hands.Keep mixing the ingredients until you form a stiff cookie dough.
Some wedding cookie recipes include ground nuts in the ingredients, such as almonds, pecans, or walnuts.If you would like to include nuts in your cookies, then try replacing 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of finely ground nuts. To grind the nuts, put them into a food processor or blender and grind until they reach a coffee ground like consistency.

, Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or grease a cookie sheet with a bit of non-stick cooking spray. Then, begin rolling out the cookie dough and placing them onto the tray. Make the cookie dough balls so that they are a couple of inches in diameter.








Space the cookie dough balls out so that they are a few inches apart. This will help to prevent the cookies from touching and sticking together as the dough expands.

, Place the cookie sheet in the oven and bake them at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 12 to 15 minutes. Set a timer to ensure that you do not forget about the cookies.








To check the cookies, stick a butter knife into one of them. If it comes out clean, then the cookies are done. If it has cookie dough on it, then allow them to bake for another minute or two.
Remember to use oven mitts when you remove the cookies from the oven or you will burn your hands.
Allow the cookies to cool for about 15 to 30 minutes before you decorate them. If they are too hot, then the frosting will melt.

, Some wedding cookie recipes include a frosting recipe, while others just direct you to roll the cookies in powdered sugar. If you want to make the frosting, then it is quite easy, but keep in mind that you also have the option of just rolling your finished cookies in some powdered sugar.


Some recipes also include a garnish such as sprinkling cinnamon over the cookies after you roll them in powdered sugar., While the cookies are baking, you can work on the frosting. First, add ½ of a cup of powdered sugar to a medium-sized mixing bowl. Next, measure out ¼ teaspoon of lemon extract and add it to the powdered sugar. Then, add ½ of a teaspoon of melted butter as well. Stir these ingredients together.You can use any flavor you like for your wedding cookies frosting. For example, you could substitute ¼ teaspoon of vanilla, almond, coconut, maple, or chocolate flavoring for the lemon extract.

, Slowly begin adding milk to the frosting mixture. Try starting with about a tablespoon and mix that in with a fork. Then, try adding more milk one teaspoon at a time until the frosting has the consistency of gravy.








Use a fork or whisk to mix the frosting.
If you accidentally add too much milk, then you can add more powdered sugar to balance it out. Add a tablespoon of powdered sugar at a time to thicken the frosting.

, After the frosting is at the right consistency, add in a few drops of food coloring in the color of your choice. You can even do multiple colors by dividing the frosting between a few bowls.








Add just a drop or two of food coloring to start and mix it in to check the color before you add any more.
You can also try mixing colors to create new ones, such as combining blue and red food coloring to make purple frosting, or yellow and red to create orange frosting.

, Make sure that your cookies are cool enough to decorate first. It is a good idea to let them cool for about 15 to 30 minutes before you start decorating. If you made frosting for your cookies, then start dipping the tops of the cookies in the frosting.You only have to dip the top of the cookie into the frosting. However, if you want to coat the entire cookie in frosting, then immerse the entire cookie into the frosting. Then, use a fork or a slotted spatula to pull the cookie back out and place it on a parchment lined tray.
Allow the frosting to set before serving the cookies. This may take up to an hour.

, If you prefer to roll your wedding cookies in powdered sugar instead of frosting them, then you can put about a cup of powder sugar onto a large plate or in a bowl. Then, roll each cookie in the powdered sugar to coat the top. You can use a fork to roll the cookies around in the powdered sugar or toss them around in a bowl of powdered sugar.


The cookies should still be a bit warm if you want to coat them in powdered sugar. Let them cool for about 5 minutes on the cookie tray and then roll or gently toss them around in the powdered sugar., If desired, you can also add a garnish to your cookies. You can garnish your cookies with a sprinkle of spice or cocoa powder, or you can garnish them with nuts or a piece of candy. Make sure that you add the garnish while the frosting is still a bit wet or when the powdered sugar is fresh.


Try sprinkling your cookies with ground cinnamon, nutmeg, or cocoa powder.Place a single nut or candy in the center of each cookie, such as an almond or an M&M.
Roll the cookie in ground nuts, shaved chocolate, or crushed toffee.

Then, if you'd like an added punch, add in 1/2 cup of chocolate chips after you've incorporated all of the four. You can either roll the final cookie in cinnamon sugar or a dusting of cocoa powder and white sugar., The sharp, slightly sour hint of citrus goes incredibly with the cinnamon sugar and is easy to add. Simply toss in either of the following ingredients in with the eggs for a wonderfully light cookie:


2 tablespoons orange juice, 1 tablespoon orange zest
1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon lemon zest, If it goes well with cinnamon sugar, it will go well in your snickerdoodles. The choices here are endless, but common add-ins include:


White chocolate chips
Butterscotch morsels
Dried cranberries
Toasted walnuts or pecans.

, Added to the flour, this little burst of cafe will give a light coffee flavoring to the cookies without overpowering them. This little bit of flavoring goes particularly well if you toss in some chocolate chips, as well., You'll want to use 2 tablespoons rum or syrup in place of the single teaspoon of vanilla extract.

, You can do this in a large mixing bowl with a handheld beater, in an electric mixer, or in a food processor fitted with whisks. Beat the two together until the mixture turns pale and fluffy.

, Lightly beat the egg in a separate bowl or cup first, then add it to the creamed sugar-butter. Pour in the vanilla extract, then mix everything together until no streaks remain.

, It would be best to add in the flour in two batches. When the flour soaks up all the liquid, knead it a few times to gather everything into a ball.

, You have enough dough to make two batches of planet cookies. You can make both batches right now, or you can wrap and freeze the other batch for another time.

, Sprinkle your counter or cutting board with flour. Roll one of the batches of dough out until it is about ⅛ inch (3 millimeters) thick.


Save the other batch for later. This method will only use one batch from now on.

, The measurements do not have to be exactly like the ones below, but the proportions and amounts should be similar. The different sizes will represent the different planets. You will need the following:


One extra-large circle, about 3 inches (8 centimeters)
Two large circles, about 2¾ inches (7 centimeters)
Four medium circles, about 2½ inches (6 centimeters)
Two small circles, about 2 inches (5 centimeters)
One extra-small circle, about 1½ inches (3.5 centimeters)

, Transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheet, then tuck them into the oven. Bake them for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they turn a light, golden color.

, Let them cool on the rack for about 5 minutes. Then, use a spatula to transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Let them finish cooling on the rack. They must be completely cool before you ice them.

, Pour the icing sugar into a mixing bowl. Pour in 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of warm water. Stir the two together with a whisk until you get a smooth icing. If you need to, add a little bit more water. It should be fluid enough to spread, but not runny.


If you can't find royal icing mix, beat together 1½ tablespoons of meringue powder, 2 cups (250 grams) of confectioner's sugar, and 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of warm water for about 10 to 12 minutes on high speed.Have lots of small bowls and cups prepared to mix your colors. You will be using this icing base in the next three parts.

, Measure out 1 teaspoon of the white icing into a small bowl. Stir in enough yellow gel food coloring to make it a bright, sunny yellow. Spread this over the 3-inch (8-centimeter) cookie using a mini cake decorating spatula. This will be the sun.

, Measure out another teaspoon of the white icing into a clean bowl. Stir in just enough red gel food coloring to make the icing a bright red. Spread this over a 2-inch (5-centimeter) cookie for Mars. Remember to clean your spatula beforehand so you don't get any yellow in it.

, Use a toothpick to add a few specks of red gel fool coloring onto Mars. Swirl these into the icing with the toothpick. Don't over mix them, or the streaks will go away.

, Pour 2 teaspoons of the white base icing into a small bowl. Stir in enough blue gel food coloring to might it a vibrant, light blue. You will be using this as your base color for the following planets: Uranus, Earth, Neptune, and Pluto.


Clean your spatula from the previous step so you don't get any red or yellow onto your planets.

, This will be Uranus. Do not use all of the blue icing for this. You need enough for the other planets in this set too.

, Stir in a few more drops of blue gel food coloring into your blue base. Spread it over another 2½-inch (6-centimeter) cookie to create Earth. Set Earth aside so that it can dry while you prepare the other planets in this set.


You will add land later, after the icing sets up a little.

, Stir in a few more drops of blue gel food coloring into your blue base. Spread it over another 2½-inch (6-centimeter) cookie.

, Working quickly, use a toothpick to add a little bit of blue gel food coloring and some of your white icing base onto Neptune. Use the toothpick to swirl everything together. Be careful not to over mix; you want it to be streaky.


Don't use the same toothpick you used for Mars.

, Add a tiny amount of black food coloring into your blue icing base. Spread it over the 1½-inch (3.5-centimeter) cookie for Pluto.

, Pour 1 teaspoon of your white icing base into another small cup or bowl. Stir in a few drops of green food coloring. Spoon the green icing onto Earth in blobs to make the continents. You may not need to use all of it.

, Pour 1 tablespoon of the white icing base into a small bowl. Add in enough caramel flavoring or tan gel food coloring to get a beige color. This will be your base for the following planets: Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn.


Clean your spatula from the previous planetary set, otherwise your icing will turn green.

, Take a 2-inch (5-centimeter cookie), and spread enough of the icing over it to coat it. Do not use all of the icing; you need enough for the rest of the planets in the set.

, Add a few drops of caramel flavoring or tan gel food coloring onto Mercury with a clean toothpick. Use the toothpick to swirl them in. Again, do not over stir them, or the details will be lost.


Sprinkle some edible gold glitter or sugar onto Mercury for an extra touch. Do this while the icing is still wet.

, Use one of the 2¾-inch (7-centimeter) cookies for this.

, Start by adding some red gel food coloring and a little bit of your white icing base onto Jupiter. Use a toothpick to spread them into thick, swirly stripes. Next, swirl the toothpick on one of the red stripes to make a Jupiter's famous red spot. Be sure to use a new toothpick for this so the colors don't mix. Use one end for the white swirls, and the other end for the red.

, Use the remaining 2¾-inch (7-centimeter) cookie for this. This time, leave a ½-inch (1-centimeter) boarder around the icing. This will give you room to make Saturn's famous rings.

, Add a few drops of yellow gel food coloring onto Saturn. Lightly swirl them in using a toothpick. Use a new toothpick for this so you don't get any red or white from Jupiter. Be careful not to go outside the border you made.


Don't add the rings just yet. You'll put them on after the icing sets a little.

, Use the remaining 2½-inch (6-centimeter) cookie for this.

, Add a few drops of orange gel food coloring onto Venus. Use a toothpick to swirl them in. Use the other end of the Saturn toothpick or a new one so you don't get any yellow in Venus. Again, avoid over stirring, or the streaks will go away.


Sprinkle some edible gold glitter or sugar onto Venus for an extra touch. Do this while the icing is still wet.

, Fill a piping bag with the rest of the white icing. Cut off the tip, then make two stripes around the center of Saturn. Make sure that these strips go from edge-to-edge of the cookie.


Use a tiny, round decorator's tip for more precision.

, This will take about 24 hours.It would be best to set them in front of a fan, but an air conditioned room will also work. Avoid drying them in a humid setting, or the icing won't dry properly.If you see any air bubbles, pop them immediately with a pin. If you don't they will leave behind a large hole when they pop on their own."

Finished.

",How to Make Pretzel Bites," Pre-measure and work quickly with your ingredients to ensure both dry and wet ingredients are well mixed.


Pour water into the bowl first before adding other ingredients. Adding the water first will reduce the likelihood of having the dry ingredients clump together when adding them.
Gently stir for approximately five to 10 minutes until yeast foams. Using a KitchenAid electric mixer for the job combines the mixture best (on a low setting), however you can use a fork or large spoon for mixing.;
, Melt the butter immediately before adding it to the mixture. Consider dropping the block of butter into a glass bowl and microwaving it for 15 seconds, depending on it’s temperature.


Use your electric mixer’s dough hook attachment and set mixer a medium speed. In order to form the ball of dough, a dough hook attachment works best. However, if you don’t own an electric mixer, use clean hands to mold and sculpt dough.
Mix for approximately four minutes or until the dough becomes smooth and slips down the sides of the bowl.

, Dough should not have lumps and ingredients should be well combined.


Transfer dough to another bowl and lightly cover with vegetable oil. Be sure the dough is well oiled on both sides. Drizzle oil over each side, turning the ball of dough for complete coverage.
Cover bowl with a warm towel or plastic wrap and place bowl in a dry, dark area of your kitchen. You want your dough to rise to approximately twice the size of its original amount and a dark setting is ideal to encourage growth.
Wait for dough to rise completely before going on to the next steps. You will see the dough double in size and form a light, crusty outer shell.

, Lightly coat the sheet with spray as you don’t want to overwhelm the bites with spray while baking.


Consider using butter flavored cooking spray to enhance the buttery goodness of your pretzel bites. Or use a neutral tasting spray such as vegetable oil cooking spray. Any other cooking spray flavors such as olive oil or spray infused with herbs will contribute to the taste of your pretzel bites (which you may or may not want).
Adjust oven racks to the middle of the oven so pretzel bites bake evenly. Too close to the top and your bites will burn, however too low and they may not be cooked evenly.

, Do your prep work while your dough rises.


Scramble one egg in a small bowl and set aside. Find a small egg brush to gently brush a small amount of scrambled raw egg on top of each bite.
Pour the Kosher salt into another small bowl. Each bite will be topped with a sprinkling of Kosher salt.
Fill a pot with water and place on the stove. Turn the heat to a high setting and allow water to come to a boil. Each bite will take a quick bath in boiling water before heading into the oven.
Create pretzel bite balls. Make sure your dough has doubled in size and is of an elastic, stretchy consistency before creating your bites.
Divide dough into eight to 10 small balls. Coat your hands with vegetable oil when handling the dough as it may be sticky.
Roll each dough ball into a rope shape. Grasp each end of the rope and swing it back and forth to elongate the dough. Eventually you want each rope to be approximately seven inches long.
Lay the rope on the kitchen counter and cut it into two pieces. Drop each piece into the boiling water and allow to cook for approximately 30 seconds. Only boil two pieces at one time.
Transfer each boiled pretzel bite to the pre-treated baking sheet. Use a slotted spoon to remove pretzel bites from boiling water and try to remove as much water as possible.
Brush each bite with egg and sprinkle with Kosher salt. Lightly coat with egg and salt so you don’t overwhelm the bite with either ingredient.
Bake pretzel bites at 450 for approximately 15 minutes or until golden brown. Oven heating elements are different so keep an eye on your bites as they bake.

Use an electric mixer to cream the two together on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy.You can mix the cookie dough in a stand mixer if you prefer.
You can mix the cookie dough by hand, but it will take longer.

, Once the butter and sugar mixture is light and fluffy, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to the bowl. Blend it in on medium speed until it is fully incorporated.You can substitute the beans scraped out from half a vanilla bean for the extract if you prefer.

, After you’ve mixed in the vanilla, gradually add 3 ½ cups (438 g) of all-purpose flour to the bowl. Mix the batter on medium until the flour is fully incorporated and a soft dough forms.To make the mixing easier, add about 1 cup (125 g) of the flour at a time. Mix after each addition so the flour is fully incorporated before adding more.

, When all of the flour has been mixed in, add 2 cups (113 g) of crushed potato chips and ¾ cup (95 g) of chopped walnuts to the dough. Use a rubber spatula to stir them in until they are fully incorporated.To avoid strange flavor combinations, use plain potato chips in the cookies.
You can substitute other nuts, such as pecans or almonds, for the walnuts if you prefer.

, Once the potato chips and nuts are mixed in, use a tablespoon (18 g) to drop rounded spoonfuls of the dough onto ungreased baking sheets. Make sure to place the cookies at least 2-inches (5-cm) apart.The cookies will spread during baking, so it’s important not to crowd them on the baking sheets.

, After you’ve placed the cookies on the cookie sheets, set them inside the preheated oven. Allow the cookies to bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until they are golden brown., When the cookies are finished baking, remove the cookie sheets from the oven. Let the cookies cool on the pans for 2 to 3 minutes before transferring them to wire cooling racks to cool completely, which should take about 20 minutes.The recipes makes approximately 4 dozen cookies.
Store any leftover cookies at room temperature in an airtight container. They should stay fresh for 2 to 3 weeks.

",How to Make Polish Kiffles,"  Do not forget to place a bowl underneath the egg separator in order to catch the falling egg whites.  Each time you separate an egg, place the egg yolks in a small mixing bowl.  If you do not have an egg separator, the eggs can still be separated by gently tossing the egg back and forth between the two halves of eggshell until the entire egg white is on one side. 


It is suggested that an egg separator be used to avoid accidentally cracking the yolk and wasting eggs that can no longer be used for the recipe.  Egg separators are fairly inexpensive (To purchase an egg separator, visit amazon.com).;
,  If you are making the walnut filling, they will be used later in the recipe.  Otherwise, you can make a nice omelet out of them in the morning for a healthy breakfast after splurging on this irresistible dessert!

,  Be sure to not beat too aggressively or for an extended period of time; otherwise, air pockets will inflate the egg yolks.  To start, try simply completing 10 full rotations of your wrist with preferred beating utensil or until you can plainly see that the yolks have burst and blended, but still have a thick texture.

,  Combine the egg yolks and sour cream into one mixture by folding and whipping the contents of the bowl with the same fork or whisk with which you began.

,  Make sure that the butter is soft, not melted or frozen.  Soft butter will be easier to combine with the flour than the frozen butter, but it should definitely not be melted.  You will want to use an electric mixer, cleaning out the whisks with a spatula when they get too clogged.  This process will be done when all the butter and flour is combined.


Keep in mind that both flour and butter are solids in this mixture and the end product of this step will be clumpy. See the picture above as a visual guide.

,  To combine these ingredients, it is now time to abandon all the utensils.  DO NOT use a fork, a whisk, or an electric mixer.

,  Using your hands is crucial to increasing the volume of the dough and emulsifying all the ingredients.

,  You are going to wrap the dough in the wax paper, so make sure the sheet is large enough to fold over the dough; you do not want any of the dough to be exposed.

,  There is no special way to do this; just make sure that the entire dough clump is enclosed.  The purpose of the wax paper is to retain the moisture in the dough and assure that it does not get hard as a rock as it is setting in the refrigerator.

,,  The walnuts should not be a powder.  Chopping the walnuts with a Cuisine Art or a Pampered Chef will be easier and faster than using a knife.  If you use a Cuisine Art, make sure you only pulse a couple times; otherwise, the walnuts will be ground too small.

,,,  You can leave the fork you used to mix together the ingredients propped against the side of the bowl.  You will need it later; saving it for later will keep post-clean up to a minimum.

,  Just allow enough time to for the walnuts to absorb the egg whites.


Leaving the walnut filling in the refrigerator for more or less than ten minutes will not jeopardize the end result of the cookie. Ten minutes is recommended, but not necessary.

,,  Do not just start with one.  You will be disappointed when you have to stop rolling dough to prepare another baking sheet.  Kiffles are small, but you might need to bake some of them and come back to baking the rest later; it is highly possible that you will run out of baking sheets, unless you work in an industrial kitchen.

,,  Make sure to cover your entire workspace with a thin film of flour.  You will have to continuously powder the counter during this part of the process to avoid sticky dough.  Sprinkle the rolling pin as well.

,  Between rolling out the wedges, put the wrapped dough wedges back into the refrigerator.

,  Spread the flour around the ball as thin as possible with your hands as needed.  Now, the counter, the rolling pin, and the dough you are working with should all have a thin coat of flour to prevent sticking.

,  Now, the dough is ready to be rolled.

,  There is a strategy to this too:  Try to flatten the dough into a rectangular shape, moving the rolling pin back and forth/side-to-side.

,  Be extremely wary of the thickness of the dough as you roll it out.  It is not necessary to get out your ruler, but getting the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness would be ideal.

,,  Each square should be approximately the same size as a Post It note.

,,,,


Pinch together the two corners to make sure that they will not come apart in the oven.  The walnut filling rises on its own; with the two corners of the dough wrapped around the walnut filling, the walnut filling will not expand upward as much.

,  The kiffles are done when the walnut filling, as well as the dough, starts to harden/brown at the ends.

Preheat the oven and baking sheet.,
Crush the peanuts.,
Heat water in a saucepan and measure the meringue ingredients.,
Whisk and heat the meringue mixture.,
Whisk the meringue and add the vanilla.,
Fold in the peanuts.,
Scoop the meringues onto the baking sheet.,
Bake the peanut meringues.",How to Make Peanut Meringue Cookies1," Turn the oven on to 350 °F (177 °C) (180 C). Get out a rimmed baking sheet and line it with parchment paper. Set the pan aside.The parchment paper will keep the meringues from sticking to the pan and make them easier to remove.;
, Scatter 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (130 g) of roasted peanuts on a rimmed baking sheet. Use a rolling pin or mug to crush the roasted peanuts into large chunks. Set the peanuts aside while you make the meringue.Use peanuts that are unsalted with the skins removed.

, Set a medium saucepan on the stove and pour about 1-inch (2.5 cm) of water in it. Turn the heat to medium, so the water simmers. Measure the meringue ingredients into a mixing bowl. You'll need:2 large egg whites at room temperature
1 cup (125 g) powdered sugar
¼ teaspoon kosher salt

, Set the mixing bowl over the saucepan of simmering water and ensure that the bowl doesn't touch the water. Whisk the meringue mixture constantly for about 5 minutes. The meringue should turn white and become hot.If you want to check the meringue using an instant-read thermometer, the meringue should be 120 degrees F (50 C).

, Remove the bowl and set it into a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Beat the meringue mixture on high speed and stir in ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract. Keep whisking the mixture on high for about 5 minutes.The meringue should become thick and glossy. If you lift the whisk attachment up, it will create stiff peaks in the meringue.
If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer but it may take longer to whisk.

, Pour half of the crushed peanuts into the meringue mixture and use a rubber spatula to gently fold them in. Pour in the remaining crushed peanuts and fold them in a little more.To fold the peanuts, hold the rubber spatula and use a twisting motion with your wrist to incorporate the peanuts into the meringue. The goal is to combine the peanuts without destroying the volume of the meringue.

, Use a large spoon to scoop the meringue onto the parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Each meringue cookie should be about 1 1/2-inches (3.8 cm) in size. Ensure that they're about 1-inch (2.5 cm) apart on the baking sheet.You can keep the meringues in a mound on the sheet. This will give them a classic shape as they bake.

, Put the sheet in the oven and close the door, but leave the handle of a wooden spoon wedged, so the door is propped open. Bake the meringues for 15 to 20 minutes. They should puff a little and become dry around the sides. Don't worry if they crack a little. Let the meringues cool completely on a wire rack before you serve them.If you want crunchier meringues, bake them at 200 °F (93.3 °C) (90 C) for 45 minutes with the door propped open.
You can store the meringues in an airtight container for up to two days.

Use a stand or electric mixer with a whisk attachment to beat the mixture on medium-high speed for several minutes. The eggs should become bright white. If you lift the beater away, the egg whites should form soft peaks.If you use room temperature eggs, you'll get more volume when you whisk them.

, Keep the mixer running on medium-high speed and add a total of 2/3 cup (133 g) of sugar one tablespoon at a time. This should take you several minutes to beat in and you'll notice the egg whites stiffen.The egg whites will also look glossy once you've beaten in the sugar.

, Stir and measure 1/3 cup (85 g) of smooth peanut butter. Drop it by spoonful into the meringue. Take a rubber spatula and gently fold the peanut butter into the meringue mixture. Just fold it enough to get streaks. The meringue and peanut butter shouldn't be completely combined.To fold the peanut butter, hold the rubber spatula and use a twisting motion with your wrist to incorporate it into the meringue.

, Take a cookie scooper or two soup spoons and scoop meringue onto the parchment-lined sheets. Each meringue should be about a tablespoon in size. Ensure that they're about 1 1/2-inches (3.8 cm) apart on the sheets. Sprinkle each meringue with some finely chopped salted peanuts.You'll need a total of 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of finely chopped salted peanuts for garnishing the cookies.

, Put the meringues in the oven and bake them for 90 minutes. Once the meringues have baked, they should appear slightly dry and crackly. Turn off the oven and let the meringues cool completely while they're still in the oven.Store the meringues in an airtight container immediately, since they will begin to absorb moisture. You can store them for up to two weeks.

Tulip cookie cutters are much more common, and their three pointed petals look just like an owl’s head and ear tufts.Look for them at your nearest baking supply store, craft store, or department store.

Heart shaped cutters make a more stylized owl shape.;
, Egg-shaped or oval cookie cutters work best, but you can use an egg ring, biscuit cutter, or round cookie cutter. You can even cut the top off a metal can and clean it thoroughly. Once you’ve picked the tool of your choice, make two owls at once as follows:Press one oval or circle onto the rolled-out dough.
Press a second oval or circle overlapping the first by a small amount. If using an oval or egg-shaped cutter, overlap both smaller ends.
Remove the small piece of dough caused by the overlap. You now have two owls, each with two pointy ears.

, The other methods are fine, but can they capture the essence of the ideal owl? If you have high standards or twitchy craft fingers, make the cookie cutters yourself out of an aluminum lasagna pan. Read the full instructions, or follow the quick version here:

Cut a long strip from the bottom of the pan, at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.

Whisk two medium egg whites until frothy.
Gradually add 3 cups (376 grams) icing sugar and whisk quickly until combined.
Whisk while adding 2 tsp (10 mL) lemon juice and whisk until stiff peaks form.

, You’ll want several colors of icing to decorate your owls. Divide the icing into three or four bowls, or however many different colors you'd like to use.

If you plan on using icing to make the eyes, set aside two additional small cups to make white and black icing.
You'll probably want a small cup of yellow icing to make the beak.

, You can mix in regular food coloring, but it can take a surprising number of drops. Paste or powdered icing color will make a more vivid color, without thinning your icing. Dip a toothpick into the icing color through the foil lid, then stir the pick into the icing. Repeat as necessary, using a fresh toothpick each time.If your icing becomes watery, mix in more icing sugar.

, Piping bags allow for even, controlled decoration. If you don't have one already, make it yourself out of a resealable plastic bag or a square of parchment paper. Spoon two or three spoonfuls of icing into the bag, leaving the rest in the bowl. Squeeze it down to the tip, so you can pipe the icing through the hole in the tip.

Use a clean piping bag for each color of icing.
If you've never piped icing before, practice on a plate first.

, You can make this pattern with just one bag of icing. Pipe a row of dots on the body of the owl, near the edge. Use a butter knife to drag the center of each dot toward the middle of the cookie. Repeat with additional rows of dots, creating a pattern of overlapping ""feathers."", The next few steps show you how to make a solid color cookie. This is easier than the feather decoration, but requires more time and a couple bags of icing. To start with, pipe a complete outline around each cookie, with no gaps. The first border should finish setting by the time the last cookie is piped., Mix in a little water or milk to make the icing thinner. This works best if you use a spray bottle.The icing is ready when it drips in long strings from a fork., Pipe the thinner icing into the center of your cookies. The icing should flow across the cookie and stop at the hard outer border.This technique makes impressively smooth, vivid cookies.

Use icing the same color as the border to make the border invisible.

, Adding candy eyes is the easiest option, but you can use icing instead. Use your thick icing and pipe a dot of white icing, topped with a dot of black icing. To make the beak, draw a short triangle with yellow icing."

Before making the cookies, preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit or 150 degrees Celsius. Preheating the oven will prevent the cookies from collapsing., Place the egg whites in the bowl of a standup mixer, with a whisk attachment in place. If you are using a hand mixer, place the egg whites in a large metal, or glass, mixing bowl. Turn your hand or stand mixer to low and begin whipping the egg whites. Gradually increase the speed to medium until soft peaks begin forming. This process will take about 2-3 minutes., Increase the speed of your hand or stand mixer to medium high. Gradually add the sugar to the mixture, 1-2 teaspoons at a time. Whip the egg whites and sugar together for about 2 minutes., After you’ve mixed the sugar and eggs together for about 2 minutes, add the vinegar to the mixture. Turn the speed of your hand or stand mixer up to the highest setting. Whip the ingredients together on high until the mixture appears glossy. Stiff peaks should form when you lift the whisk attachment from the bowl. This process should take a total of 4-5 minutes., Place the crushed candy canes and chocolate chips in the bowl. Run a rubber spatula around the sides and then along the base of the bowl. Fold the mixture onto itself. Repeat these motions until the candy canes are combined with the egg mixture., Scoop the mixture up in a heaping teaspoon. Drop the cookies on to parchment paper lined baking sheets.

Don't mix the batter on high - do it slowly! This way you can make sure the cookies will come out light and delicious, rather than tough.

, Last but not least, stir in the 1 1/2 cups of raisins - again, make sure not to overmix., Use a cookie scoop, a small measuring cup or a tablespoon to scoop out the cookies onto a nonstick cookie sheet. Space them so that there are 2 inches (5.1 cm) in between each cookie, since they'll spread as they bake. You'll end up with about 2 dozen cookies, so you may need to bake them using two separate sheets or one batch at a time.


If you don't have a nonstick cookie sheet, grease the cookie sheet before scooping. You can also line your cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Make the cookies bigger if you'd like! Use a 1/2 cup measuring cup to scoop out giant oatmeal cookies that will be soft in the middle and crispy around the edges.

Remember to omit the egg if you are using vanilla sugar.

, Make sure you allow air to get into the flour. When sifting, hold the sieve approximately 20cm (8 inches) from the bowl. If you hold it too high, you will end up losing some flour.

, Make sure it is well combined. Avoid stirring the ingredients together too much as the flour may clump up again and the biscuit will not be as light.

, Use a wooden spoon or silicone spatula to fold the mixture together. Continue mixing until everything has completely combined.


At this stage, your mixture may be a bit dry. Add a small amount of milk to help it come together.

, Make sure you're not using greaseproof paper as it's not suitable for baking biscuits—greaseproof paper cannot withstand high heat.

, Ensure that you leave plenty of space between each biscuit as the biscuits will expand. You will not want to have one giant biscuit.

, If possible, place the biscuits on the middle rack of your oven. Remember to watch the biscuits very carefully to ensure that they don't burn.

, Be careful when doing this as the oven will be fairly hot. Use a tea towel or oven mitt to hold the tray while taking it out.

To ensure that you don't get yolks in the whites, crack the eggs into two separate bowls. Use your fingers or the shells of the eggs to scoop out the yolks and place them one bowl. Place the whites in a separate and completely clean large bowl. Beat the egg whites with a hand or stand mixer on high speed until the whites start to look frothy. This should take about one minute.You can discard the egg yolks or save them for another recipe.;
, Turn the mixer down to low speed and gradually stir in powdered sugar. You should plan on adding 8 cups (1 kg) of powdered sugar, although you may need more. Keep adding and beating the sugar until the royal icing becomes thick.Keep the mixer on low until the powdered sugar is incorporated. Then, you can increase the speed to thoroughly mix the icing.

, Pour in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of lemon juice. Use the mixer to beat the juice into the icing. The lemon juice will make the icing thinner and easier to spread. If the icing still seems too stiff, you can add a little more lemon juice.The royal icing should be thin enough that you can spoon it onto a cookie and it will spread a little. This will help to give the appearance of melting snow.

, Once you've made the royal icing and set it aside, you'll need 24 baked and cooled sugar cookies and 24 marshmallows. The cookies can be a traditional circular shape or you can cut them out in unusual shapes to get a puddle effect. It's also fine to purchase the cookies, if you don't feel like baking them.You could also try other flavors of cookies to get some variety. For example, chocolate or peanut butter cookies make delicious melted snowmen cookies.

, Take two cookie sheets and place a sheet of wax paper over each. Set 12 cookies on each sheet so that you leave 1-inch of space between each cookie.The wax paper will make it easier to remove the finished melted snowmen. You could also set down a silicone baking mat.

, Take a spoon or offset spatula and scoop a tablespoon or two of the royal icing onto each cookie. Use the back of the spoon or the offset spatula to spread the icing over the cookie. Push the icing to the edges so it can drip off the sides of the cookie.If you like, you can leave some parts of the cookie exposed so it looks more like snow is melting off of the cookie.

, Spray a microwave-safe plate with baking spray and place 1 marshmallow on it. Microwave the marshmallow for 20 to 30 seconds or until it begins puffing up. Remove it from the microwave and set the marshmallow on the edge of one of your iced cookies. Do this for each marshmallow and cookie.The icing should still be wet when you place the marshmallows. This will help it set better.
Avoid microwaving several marshmallows at once or they may puff into each other.

, You can use the black, green, red, and orange decorating gels to pipe arms, eyes, mouths, and noses on your snowmen cookies. Keep in mind that these won't flavor your cookies and they're fast to use.If you make these cookies a few days in advance, the colors may start to bleed into the royal icing. Consider decorating them with the gel on the day you plan to serve them.

, Instead of piping gel for the coal buttons or scarves, place small nonpareils, red hot candies, or mini chocolate chips. These will give your snowmen cookies a little texture and extra crunch. You can also cut miniature peanut butter cups in half to use as snowmen hats.

It may help to place the small candies with a pair of tweezers.

, Try placing mini pretzel sticks on the sides of the snowmen to look like arms. Arrange them so they look like they're arms that have melted off the snowmen and fallen onto the cookie ground. You can also use small cookies to place on the snowmen's heads to look like hats.

For example, dab a little royal icing on a mini chocolate sandwich cookie and stick it on the marshmallow snowman. This will act as the small hat.

, Use a piece of candy vine or candy ribbon to wrap around each marshmallow snowman instead of piping a gel scarf. You'll need to select a candy that's thin enough to wrap around just the base of the marshmallow.

You can also cut the candy down to size if the vines are too long or thick.

, Once you've finished decorating the snowmen cookies, you'll need to serve them. Cover your serving tray with white flaked coconut and place the cookies on the coconut. This will make it look like the cookies are setting on snow.You can also dust the snowmen cookies on the serving tray with powdered sugar. This will give the appearance of freshly fallen snow.

You could also line the baking sheets with a silicone mat or parchment paper to keep the cookies from sticking.;
, Place 1








It's important to beat the butter and sugars till they're light and fluffy. This will help your cookies rise and give them volume.

, Stop the mixer and add one egg to the creamed butter and sugars. You can also add any flavor extract at this time (1 teaspoon). Turn the mixture back on to medium speed and beat it until the egg is combined.








The egg will help the cookie dough bind together and adds moisture.

, Take 3 or 4 ripe persimmons and cut the tops off of them using a sharp knife. Use a spoon to scoop out the persimmon pulp and place the pulp in a food processor. Blend the pulp until it's completely smooth and pureed.Always use caution when using knives and food processor blades.

, Measure out 1 cup of the pureed persimmon pulp from your food processor. Add the pulp to the bowl with the wet ingredients. Stir or beat the persimmon pulp into the wet ingredients until they're completely combined.You can save any excess persimmon puree for use in another recipe.

, Place a sifter over a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add your dry ingredients and sift them into the bowl. This will break up any lumps in the dry ingredients and help them mix with the wet ingredients more evenly. You'll need:2 cups (240 g) of all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon of ginger
1/8 teaspoon of allspice

, Turn your mixer on to low and gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Turn off the mixer as soon as the dry ingredients are incorporated. If you mix the dough too long, your cookies will be hard and tough.Avoid mixing the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients on a medium or high speed. Mixing on low ensures that you don't over mix the dough and it keeps the dry ingredients from being beaten out of the bowl.

, Add 1/3 cups (30 g) of old-fashioned oats, 1/2 cups (60 g) of dried cranberries, 1/4 cups (45 g) of white chocolate chips, and 1/4 cups (30 g) of roughly chopped almonds. Stir the dough until they're just combined.


Try to ensure that these ingredients are evenly mixed throughout the dough so that each cookie ends up with a little of everything.

, Use a cookie scoop, ice cream scoop or spoon to scoop about 12 cookies onto each baking sheet. Each ball of cookie dough should be about 2 to 3 tablespoons in size. Bake the cookies for 14 to 16 minutes or until they're golden brown and almost firm to the touch. Remove them to a rack to cool.








The cookies should be at least 2 inches apart on your baking sheet.

, Instead of roughly chopped almonds, you could use your favorite baking nut. Just try to keep the amount (1/4 of a cup) the same. You could use chopped:

Pecans
Walnuts
Hazelnuts

, If you don't like the tart flavor of the dried cranberries, you could make this recipe with dried raisins or golden raisins (sultanas) instead. These can make your cookies taste sweeter as well.

You could also experiment with dried fruits like apricots, cherries, or currants.

, White chocolate has a mellow sweetness, but if you want a richer chocolate flavor, try substituting the white chocolate chips with milk or semisweet chocolate chips.

Be aware that a bittersweet chocolate can overwhelm the flavor of the persimmon, so only swap the chocolates if you want less of a persimmon flavor.

, To add depth of flavor to your cookies, you could add 1 teaspoon of a flavor extract when you add the egg to the butter and sugars. Try using vanilla or almond extract.

Don't expect a lot of flavor by adding the extract. It will enhance the flavor of the cookies instead of overwhelming the flavor.
