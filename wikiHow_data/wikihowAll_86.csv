,, Stir with a spoon until the mixture forms a ball with some dry flour on the sides of the bowl. At this point, use your hands to gently mix the dough. You want a smooth dough that is not too wet or sticky and not so dry that it cracks and crumbles when you tear off a piece.

,, Form the dough into one-inch balls. For each one-inch ball, make a 1/4-inch ball -- that's your stamen for the flower shape.

, With your index finger and thumb, pinch and shape each wedge to form clean, crisp edges. Arrange four wedges on the prepared cookie sheet, conjoining and slightly overlapping the tips of the ""petal."" With the tip of your pinkie or the wide end of a chopstick, lightly press the overlapped petal tips to ""glue"" them together and form a well into which the ""stamen"" will go. Lightly press a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm)-ball into the well., You should have about 15 flowers. Be sure to leave about one inch space between them on the cookie sheet.

, The cookies are done even though they're not golden browned.

Scoop out the dough from its container or bowl and set it on top of a cutting board.,
Knead the dough lightly.,
Get your marshmallows.,
Put the marshmallow in the center of the circle.,
Using your thumb and index finger, slide the dough smoothly over the marshmallow, like wrapping a dumpling.,
Roll the dough-wrapped marshmallow between your palm until it's shaped like a plump sausage.,
Continue making, wrapping, and smoothing the cookies until you have about twelve and the mound of dough is gone.,
Bake the cookies at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-12 minutes or until done.,
If you want, you can add sprinkles, chocolate chips, or icing.","How to Make Marshmallow‐Filled ""Pillow"" Cookies","

You might want to cover the surface with a nonstick sheet, so the dough doesn't stick and make a mess.
Make sure your hands are clean. No one likes germs in their cookies!
If the dough is homemade, you can skip this part.;
,

You can grease your hands with a bit of the oil to make life easier.
To knead the dough, use the heel of your hand to push the dough away from you slightly. Then pull the dough back towards you, folding and flipping. Repeat this about eight times.

, The marshmallows should never be too big, or they'll expand and expand, pushing away the cookie layer.

Pinch off a small piece of dough, about the size of a five year-old's palm and flatten it into a small circle. Don't make it too thin, about medium thick.

,

Again, make sure your marshmallow is not too big. If it's bigger than the dough circle, cut it in half. It's still early, so you better make your move now.

, It's important that the dough is evenly smooth on all sides. Nobody wants deformed cookies.

If it's slightly lumpy, slide your fingers across that part until it's smooth.
If one patch is too thin, pinch a small piece of dough from the kneaded part of dough and make the ball even.

,

Do not flatten it until it's cookie-shaped. That will make the finished cookie bigger than your palm, and the marshmallow will melt completely.
Make sure the dough is thick enough for baking. Otherwise too thin cookies with shrivel up until they're as delicate and brittle as fingernails.

, Set the cookies on a baking tray lined with aluminum foil.

Make sure to give them some space.
If your baking tray is too small for twelve cookies, put some of the cookies on another tray.

,

Check the cookies now and then. If the marshmallows are rapidly expanding, stop the oven immediately and take out to cool.
When the cookies are done, take them out and set aside.

, Just don't go overboard! Remember, a cookie and marshmallow combined is enough to make you jittery. One cookie a day keeps the cravings away. Two cookies a day keeps the dieting away!

The cookies are best with a glass of cold milk. If you have a very sweet tooth, spoil yourself and serve with sliced fruit, chocolate milkshakes, buttercream frosting, and vanilla ice cream sundaes with hot fudge or caramel.

Place the bowl on top of the oven so the butter will warm and melt over the heat from the oven.


Use a glass or metal bowl for the butter, as this will conduct heat better and allow the butter to melt. Also, a plastic bowl might melt from the heat of the oven.
Melt the butter in the microwave or in a pot on the stove if your oven top doesn’t get hot enough to melt it.;
, Position a large sifter over a large mixing bowl. Measure the sugar, self-rising flour, and baking powder, and pour them into the large sifter. Tap the side of the sifter with your hand to sift the dry ingredients into the bowl. This will remove lumps and help incorporate the three ingredients.


To make your own self-rising flour, combine 5 cups (625 g) of all-purpose flour, 7½ teaspoons (30 g) of baking powder, and 1¼ teaspoons (7.5 g) of salt., Add the shortening to the bowl with the dry ingredients. With your fingers, rub the shortening into the flour. Continue mixing the ingredients together in this way until the dough takes on the texture of large crumbs.For a richer and flakier biscuit, you can use lard instead of vegetable shortening.

, With your hand, make a well in the center of the dough. Pour the cold buttermilk and water into the well. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to combine the wet and dry ingredients. Stop as soon as the dough starts to come together.


The biscuit dough will be sticky, but resist the urge to keep stirring. Overmixing will develop the gluten and make for dense and chewy biscuits., Turn the dough out onto a floured countertop or flat surface. Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough. Flatten the dough into a circle with your hands. Fold the left side of the dough into the center, and then the right side of the dough on top of that. Starting from the top, roll the dough into a pinwheel and shape it into a ball.


Flatten out the dough with your hands and repeat these same folding steps a second time.Folding the dough in this way will fully incorporate all the ingredients without overmixing the dough.
Avoid kneading, which can also develop the gluten.

, Roll the dough out with the rolling pin. Continue rolling until you have a one-inch (2.5-cm) thick circle. Make sure the dough is an even thickness, otherwise your biscuits will be different sizes.


Add more flour to the rolling pin and counter to prevent sticking.

, Use a floured 2-inch (5-cm) round cookie cutter to punch out as many biscuits as possible.When you can't get any more biscuits, collect the dough scraps. Shape them into a ball and roll out the leftover dough. Cut out as many biscuits as you can.


Repeat until there's no longer enough dough for more biscuits.

, Transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet. Position them side by side so they're all just touching. Take your pastry brush and brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter that’s been warming on the oven.Brushing the tops with butter will add a bit of a salty kick to the biscuits, and help them become a nice golden brown when they bake.

, Transfer the biscuits to the oven and bake them for 10 to 15 minutes. The biscuits are ready when they turn a light golden brown color. When they're done, remove them from the oven.


Set the baking sheet aside and let the biscuits cool for a few minutes.

, When the biscuits are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Set them aside until they're cool enough to eat, about 30 minutes.


Serve the biscuits plain, buttered, with jam or cream, or with cheese, meat, gravy, or any other topping you like.

, Place a large frying pan over low heat and preheat the pan for about five minutes. Place the sausages in the pan and cook them over low heat. Use tongs to turn the sausages every two minutes. Cook the sausages for about 12 minutes, or until no pink remains and they're starting to brown.


When the sausages are done, remove the pan from the heat., With the tongs, take the sausages out of the pan and transfer them to a plate. Set them aside to cool. Leave the grease from the meat in the pan and return the pan to the stove.It’s important to use tongs instead of a fork to cook and move the sausages. A fork will pierce the meat and release the juices, making for drier sausage.

, Add the butter to the frying pan with the sausage grease and heat it over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour to the pan and whisk to combine it with the fat.


Cook the flour for about five minutes, whisking regularly, until it becomes smooth and golden brown., When the flour is smooth and golden, pour the milk into the pan, whisking as you pour to prevent lumps. Bring the gravy to a low boil, and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue simmering for 10 to 12 minutes, until the gravy thickens.Add milk by the tablespoon (15 ml) to the pan if the gravy becomes too thick, or until the desired consistency is achieved.

, Use your fingers to break up each sausage into small chunks. Sprinkle the sausage pieces into the gravy and stir to combine. Taste the gravy and add salt and pepper if necessary.Once the sausages have warmed, remove the pan from the heat.

, Place one or two warm biscuits on a serving plate. Spoon or ladle about a ¼ cup (59 ml) of hot gravy over each biscuit and enjoy!Avoid pouring the gravy on the biscuits until you're ready to serve them, as the gravy can make the biscuits soggy.

, Biscuits can be cut in half, stuffed with various ingredients, and served like sandwiches. These are a popular item on the Hardee’s breakfast menu. A couple of the popular biscuit sandwiches are the plain meat ones, which are served with:


A chicken filet
A smoked sausage
A few slices of country ham

, Another popular breakfast sandwich is the egg, meat, and cheese combination. This usually consists of the biscuit with a layer of meat, followed by a cooked egg and topped with cheese. You can use a variety of meats for this sandwich, including:


Bacon
Steak or chicken fried steak
Sausage

, A monster sandwich at Hardee’s consists of fresh biscuits, ham, cheese, sausage, egg, and bacon. To assemble the sandwich:


Cut the biscuit in half
Place one to two slices of ham on the bottom half of the bun
Place a slice of cheese on top of the ham
Place a cooked sausage patty on top of the cheese, followed by another piece of cheese
Place a cooked egg on top of the cheese, followed by two to three pieces of bacon
Top the sandwich with the top of the biscuit and enjoy

They have a rather solid base that does taste a bit like the unconsecrated wafer you'd taste when going up for Holy Communion (no, they aren't blessed) at a church, that holds the cookie together. (If you take a look at a store-bought one, the wafers that hold it together, traditionally are white, though the coloring doesn't matter).

Leave at least an inch of space between the cookies because they'll spread out when they cook. You can usually fit 6-8 (dependent on their size that you've crafted them to be) cookies on a full-sized cookie sheet at a time.

Use a spoon or hand mixer to cream the butter and brown sugar until they're light and fluffy.If the butter is hard, you can set it on a plate or in a bowl and soften it using the microwave. Just ensure that you don't melt the butter.

, Stir in 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of milk, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix the ingredients until they're completely combined. Check to make sure that the egg has been completely beaten into the other ingredients.If you don't have vanilla extract, consider substituting almond extract or you could just omit it.

, Add 1 1/4 cup of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt to the creamed mixture in the mixing bowl. Use a spoon or the hand mixer to mix in the dry ingredients until they're just combined. Gently stir in just 1/2 a cup of the chocolate chips.Avoid mixing the dough too much or the chocolate chip cookie bars will be tough.

, Grease and flour an 8-inch square baking dish that's safe to use in the microwave. Scoop your dough into the dish and spread it evenly using a rubber spatula or spoon. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over the cookie dough.You can also use cooking or baking spray to prepare the baking dish.

, Cook the chocolate chip cookie bars in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes. Check the bars to see if they're dry and feel firm. If they're still raw, cook them in 20 second increments, checking frequently to see if they're done. Let the bars cool before you cut and serve them.Your microwave should rotate the bars as they cook. If your microwave doesn't have a rotating tray, turn the baking dish a quarter turn after every minute it cooks.

Add molasses or honey to your cookies.,
Substitute brown sugar for white sugar.,
Use recipes that call for shortening instead of butter.,
Substitute an egg yolk for an egg white.,
Opt for recipes with baking powder over baking soda.",How to Make Cookies Chewy1," Adding a tablespoon of molasses (21g) to your cookie dough will increase the cookies’ moisture content, giving them a soft, chewy texture. If you’re not fond of molasses’ deep flavor, try a tablespoon of honey.Don’t add multiple tablespoons of liquid sweetener like the ones listed because they will make your cookies runny and too sweet. One tablespoon is enough to make your cookies softer but not disrupt the integrity of the dough.;
, Brown sugar is more moist than white sugar, so using it gives a chewier result. Replace the white sugar in your recipe 1-1 with brown sugar. This will also give your cookies a deeper, more caramelized flavor., Butter contains fat, milk solids and water, whereas shortening is 100% pure fat. Using butter in cookies (due to the water) actually creates steam during the baking process, drying your cookies slightly. Shortening will create a chewier, more tender result. If you want to replace butter with shortening in a recipe, do so with a 1-1 ratio., This means that for each egg a recipe calls for, you would use two yolks instead. Yolks have more fat than egg whites, increasing the fat content of your cookies and keeping them moist., Baking powder is more acidic than baking soda, which means your cookies will spread less. This will prevent excess moisture loss as the cookie thins."

Turn down the temperature on your oven.,
Bake your cookies for less time.,
Rest your dough in the fridge before baking.",How to Make Cookies Chewy2," Many cookie recipes call for an oven temperature of 350 degrees F (176 degrees C) or higher. These hot temperatures cause your cookies to lose lots of moisture—and chewiness—in the baking process. Seek out recipes that call for an oven of around 325 degrees F (162 degrees C) to keep your cookies moist., If you have a cookie recipe you like but the cookies turn out crunchy, try baking the cookies for slightly less time. If you take your cookies out when the exterior edges are golden brown but the centers are set but not brown, the cookies will be fudgier., Chilling your dough in the fridge for at least an hour makes some water evaporate from your cookies, giving your dough a higher sugar content. This slightly higher sugar content will keep your cookies moist and chewy.The longer you rest your dough, the chewier the cookies. Professional bakers often rest their dough for several days to get the desired chewy texture. Don’t go longer than a week in the fridge though.

Allow cookies to cool completely, but don’t leave them out.,
Store cookies in an airtight container.,
Add a slice of fresh bread to your storage container.",How to Make Cookies Chewy3," Before storing your cookies, allow them to cool completely on the baking sheet. Then, store them promptly once they reach room temperature. Leaving them out will encourage them to dry out., To keep your cookies their most chewy and moist, store them in an airtight container such as a cookie jar with a lid or a Tupperware. If you don’t have either of those, a Ziplock bag will do just fine.


Make sure your cookies are not hot when you store them. Storing hot cookies in an airtight container will cause the cookies to fall apart., To keep your cookies chewy and moist longer, add a slice of fresh sandwich bread to your storage container with the cookies. This will add moisture to the container, which the cookies will absorb. You’ll know the method is working because the next day your slice of bread will be dried out like a piece of toast, and your cookies will be soft and chewy."

Serve.",How to Make Cookie Dough Without Eggs2," To cream butter and sugar, first let the butter sit out of the fridge for about an hour until it has reached room temperature. You want it to be soft, but not completely melted.Cut the butter into cubes and place it in a large bowl, using a wooden spoon to beat it until you've made a soft, even mixture and there are no chunks left. You can also use a mixer if you have one.
Pour the brown sugar into the bowl and use the tines of a fork to press the sugar into the butter.
Use the wooden spoon to mix the ingredients together until the mixture rises and is a light yellow color.

, Now, add the vanilla extract, flour, chocolate chips, and peanut butter to the mixture. Use a wooden spoon or even a mixer for best results. The mixture doesn't have to be perfectly smooth -- since you won't be baking it, it's okay if some parts are a little chunky.

, Each ball should be a bit smaller than a ping pong ball. You should be able to easily enjoy each ball in one or two bites.

, Just place the cookie dough bites on a plate and stick them in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. You can also put them in the freezer for 10 minutes if you have a time constraint or you feel impatient., For an extra decadent flavor, you can dip the balls into chocolate to coat them completely. Alternatively, you can melt some chocolate in a pan or in the microwave and then use a spoon or fork to drizzle the chocolate in a zig-zag pattern over the chocolate balls.


If the balls are for a party, you can place a small fork or toothpick in each ball before dipping it.

, To cream the butter and sugar, make sure the butter is already at room temperature and mix it with a wooden spoon until it's creamy. Then, press the sugar into the butter with a fork and stir the ingredients together until you've made a whipped-like, light yellow mixture.As you cream the ingredients, use a rubber spatula to scrape the extra mixture off of the sides of the bowl, so you make sure you fully mix all of the butter and sugar together.
You can use a stand mixer or beaters if you have them.

, Once the butter and sugar mix is nice and creamy, add the vanilla to the mix before beginning to add the dry ingredients.

, Just hold a sieve or sifter over a different bowl and gently pour in the flour and baking soda, shaking it lightly to allow the ingredients to absorb some air while falling into the bowl. When you're done, mix the ingredients together until they are fully incorporated.

, Once the ingredients are mixed together, roll little balls a bit smaller than a lime, either onto a board or into your hands, until you've used up all of the dough.Alternatively, you can roll the cookie dough out flat between two pieces of wax paper and cut into shapes with a cookie cutter.
Placing the dough in the freezer for 5 minutes may make it easier to cut shapes because it will be less sticky. , Place each cookie on an ungreased cookie sheet or on parchment paper. If you are making round sugar cookies, squish each ball with the bottom of a glass or another handy kitchen item.You may want to sprinkle the top of each cookie with granulated sugar.

, Check up on them periodically to make sure they don't burn. When they're done, remove them from the oven and let them sit for 5 minutes.


Larger cookies will take longer to bake than smaller cookies. If you wish to make mini-cookies, check the time before 10 minutes.

Differentiate between an egg replacement and an egg substitute.,
Replace eggs with other binding agents.,
Substitute other moistening agents.",How to Make Cookie Dough Without Eggs4," If you are making something egg-free due to allergies, you need to be sure you are using a product that replaces eggs (without having any egg ingredients. Most products that are egg substitutes contain some egg., If the egg in the recipe you’re using is functioning as a binder, or an agent that makes other ingredients “stick” together, you will need to replace it with other items that serve the same function.Mashed banana or applesauce are healthy fruit options that can work as binders. Use half of a banana or ¼ of a cup of applesauce for each egg in the recipe.
One tablespoon of cornstarch or soy flour mixed with two tablespoons of water can be used as a replacement for each egg. One tablespoon of ground flax seed mixed with 4 tablespoons of water may also be used as a replacement binding agent.
Products in the baking aisle from the grocery store called “egg replacements” may be used. Follow product packaging instructions for quantity and procedures.

, Eggs often provide moistness to your cookies. To retain the moistness in your recipe, try substituting ¼ cup of vegetable or coconut oil for each egg in your recipe."

Scoop onto lined baking sheet, about 1 tablespoon of dough for each cookie.,
Bake for 8-10 minutes.,
Remove cookies from the oven and allow to cool for about 5 minutes before transferring onto a wire rack.,
Try new combinations of cake mix and add-ins to suit your tastes.",How to Make Cookies out of Cake Mix," Make sure you have a rack in the middle of the oven so the can cookies bake evenly. If the rack is too close to the top or bottom of the oven, you may burn the top or bottom of the cookies.If you are at a high altitude you may need to increase the temperature of the oven by 15-25ºF or adjust the baking time.;
, Lining your pan will keep it clean and prevent the cookies from sticking to the metal. A liner, especially a silicone mat, will also help your cookies bake evenly and prevent the color or material of your baking sheet from affecting how the cookies bake.An unlined dark aluminum sheet or non-stick pan can cause your cookies to brown too quickly. If you don't have a liner, try turning down the temperature in your oven by about 25ºF.An unlined insulated cookie sheets may prevent your cookie from browning and may cause your cookie to spread.Do not grease the pan if you can help it, as this may cause your cookies to spread and become too thin and crispy.If you have nothing to use as a liner, then grease the pan very lightly (unless it's a non-stick pan).

, You may find that the cake mix is clumpy straight out of the box. You should be able to mix out the clumps as you make the dough, but if you want to be extra careful or decrease the time you spend mixing, you can sift the cake mix and baking powder.Many cake mix cookie recipes leave out baking powder. The baking powder causes the cookies to rise, but not spread, so they will be airy and fluffy and hold their shape.You can make the cookies without baking powder in a pinch, but your cookies may be flat and dense or lose their shape and spread on the pan.

, The dough tends to be very sticky and can be a little hard to mix. You will have to stir vigorously to make sure you blend all the dry ingredients with the wet.The dough should be a bit oily and very thick once it is fully mixed.If you don't feel like building up your arm muscles by hand-mixing, you can use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment to combine your ingredients.
If you don't have vegetable oil, try 1/3 cup of melted butter, cooled to room temperature. Your cookies may not be as moist, but they will still taste good.Substituting margarine for vegetable oil may cause your cookies to spread in the oven, because it often contains a lot of water, so try not to use it., You can add just about anything to the cookies at this point. Candies, dried fruit, sprinkles, nuts, peanut butter chips, white chocolate chips--whatever sounds good to you!

, They should be evenly spaced on the baking sheet, with enough room to expand a little as they bake.If you want thick, puffy cookies, try shaping the scoops of dough so that they are taller than they are wide.If the dough is too sticky to work with, try chilling it in the refrigerator for up to 30 minutes., If you are baking a colored dough (like a strawberry pink or light lemon) and don't want any browning, check on the cookies after 8 minutes. If they aren't quite ready, keep a close eye on them to make sure they don't darken while your back is turned., If you plan to make another batch, use a clean baking sheet or allow your baking sheet to cool. If the baking sheet is hot when you scoop the dough, the cookie will immediately lose its shape and begin to spread., Here are some suggestions for you to try:


Strawberry cake mix with white chocolate chips for Valentine's Day.
Chocolate devil's food cake mix with chocolate covered candies.
Lemon cake mix with lemon icing.

Review the ingredients.,
Soften the butter.,
Beat the butter and shortening together.,
Add the sugar, baking powder, and salt.,
Add the eggs and vanilla extract.,
Gradually add the flour.,
Save or bake as directed.",How to Make Cookie Dough1," Every cookie dough recipe is a little different, so you should carefully review the specific recipe before proceeding. That said, most cookie dough recipes share the same basic ingredients in various proportions.


Use the following guidelines to prepare cookie dough if you have a list of ingredients but lost the instructions that go with it.
Most cookie dough recipes use some type of fat, sugar, eggs, and flour. Salt and baking powder are not used as consistently but do appear in many cookie dough recipes as leavening agents.
Butter is the most common fat used, but shortening is also used frequently. Butter creates crisper, thinner cookies, while shortening creates soft, cake-like cookies.
Vanilla extract also appears in most cookie dough recipes.
Note that ready-to-eat or safe-to-eat cookies doughs don't contain eggs.;
, For best results, cut the cold butter into pieces and allow it to sit out at room temperature up to 30 minutes.


The butter should be soft enough for you to leave an indentation with your thumb. Do not let the butter melt, though.
Softened butter and margarine are easier to combine with other ingredients.
If running short on time, you can microwave the cold butter for 10-second intervals until softened.
If using margarine instead of butter, make sure that the margarine contains 80 percent vegetable oil or more.

, If your recipe calls for both butter and shortening, you should cream them together with an electric mixer until smooth.


Even if your recipe only contains one or the other, you should still consider beating the fat with an electric mixture until smooth. Doing so removes any lumps and allows the fat to mix into the dough more effectively.

, Use an electric mixer to beat in the sugar, salt, and baking powder or baking soda. These ingredients should be completely combined with the fat.


Cream these ingredients until the consistency and color both become lighter.
This process creates air bubbles in the dough, thereby creating lighter cookies. Do not overbeat the dough, though, especially at this stage.

, Use an electric mixer to beat the eggs in one at a time on medium speed. Add the vanilla extract simultaneously or immediately after.


Beat until you remove all streaks of egg or extract.
Consider leaving the eggs out at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. This makes it easier for the eggs to incorporate air in the batter, which creates lighter cookies.

, Use an electric mixer to beat in as much flour as possible, adding it slowly to the dough. When the mixer begins to strain, switch to a wooden spoon and stir the remaining flour into the dough that way.


Stand mixers can usually take the strain, so you may not need to do any stirring if using one. Hand-held mixers are less durable, though, and should be swapped out toward the end to prevent the mixer from burning out completely.
Any chocolate chips, nuts, or similar ingredients should be stirred in after the flour.

, Saving instructions and baking instructions vary, so it is best to find instructions that are specific to your recipe.


Generally, you can wrap your dough tightly in plastic wrap and save it in the refrigerator for a week.
Many cookie recipes bake around 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 8 to 15 minutes.

, This is because it is practical to use, and there's no mess, unlike water-based icing, or tubed icing which can be hard to squeeze out, plus you will find it hard getting just the right colors and no colors you don't need for this!, If you're using a knife, don't use a sawing motion, so it's better to use a sharp knife by yourself, but use a blunt one with children. Also, if you have one especially for pumpkin carving, use that. Just make sure it will be able to cut when pressed onto the Rolling Fondant Icing., Then, roll it over your cookie, and cut round the edge and a curve where the black head has to go, and then trim it just under a centimeter so it doesn't reach right to the edge., Roll that out and cut it around the edge, and about 1/2 a centimeter away from the curve of the red body! Again, like with the red, cut just under a centimeter away from the edges so you can see there's a delicious cookie/biscuit/Oreo/whatever you're using underneath it., Splodge it on the red body, and then get some minstrels/choccy buttons, and use the honey as glue for the spots.

The butter must be softened before you combine it with the other ingredients. For a lighter dough, beat the butter on its own until it becomes fluffy before combining it with sugars and vanilla extract.

, Add the egg to the butter mixture and beat at medium speed with an electric mixer.


Continue beating until the egg is fully incorporated.
If doubling or tripling the recipe, add any additional eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.

, In a separate small bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, and salt until thoroughly combined.


Mixing the dry ingredients separately ensures that they are distributed evenly throughout the dough once added to the moist ingredients.

, Use an electric mixture to beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture until completely combined.


If the electric mixer resists toward the end of the mixing process, stir any remaining flour in by hand.

, Use a mixing spoon or spatula to stir the chocolate chips into the dough until evenly distributed.

, If you plan to save the dough for later, wrap it in wax paper or plastic wrap first. Make sure that no portion of the dough is exposed to air.


Consider double-wrapping the dough. Wrap it in wax paper first, then wrap a layer of plastic wrap around the entire thing.
To make the dough easier to manage later on, divide it in half before wrapping it.

, The dough can last in the refrigerator for 1 week. When placed in the freezer, it should last for about 8 weeks.

, The cookies should be baked at 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for 8 to 11 minutes.

If doubling the recipe, add each egg one at a time and beat well after each addition.
Use a medium speed when adding these ingredients.

, Thoroughly mix the flour into the moist ingredients in two or more batches.


Use a low speed to prevent the flour from flying out as you mix it.
Only mix until the flour has been incorporated. Do not overmix.
If the mixer begins to slow and struggle, stir the rest of the flour in using a mixing spoon.

, Each portion should be about equal in size.


It may be easier to work with four portions later on, but two portions will also suffice.

, Place each portion of dough on a sheet of plastic wrap. Flatten the dough into disks before wrapping it completely.


Each portion of dough should be wrapped separately.
Make sure that no air can touch the wrapped dough. If necessary, double-wrap the dough to secure it.

, Refrigerate the dough up to 1 week. If you need the dough to last up to 4 weeks, you should freeze it, instead.


Note that even if you plan to use the dough immediately, it should still be refrigerated 2 hours before baking.

, Bake the cookies an an oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 8 to 10 minutes or until slightly golden.


If using frozen dough, wait until the dough has dropped down to refrigerated temperatures.

Use nuts or oats instead of flour.,
Make an egg white-based cookie.,
Try an alternative flour.",How to Make Cookies Without Flour1," Flour acts as a binder to keep your cookies together. To replace flour as a binding agent, replace flour in your recipe with chopped nuts (like pecans, macadamia nuts, or walnuts) or rolled oats. These will bind your other ingredients together and help the cookies hold their shape as they bake.


Try a no-bake chocolate oatmeal cookie or traditional flourless almond cookies.
You could also try baking cookies using a ground nut flour or wheat germ.;
, Whip egg whites and use them as a binder for your cookies. Egg whites give texture to cookies and can make them chewy and crackly on the outside. Meringues and macarons are good examples of flourless cookies that rely on egg whites for body.You could also make mini-Pavlova cookies that are like little meringues. Fill these with fruit, nuts, or chocolate for a simple flourless dessert.

, There are a lot of alternative flours available if you'd like to swap out traditional all-purpose flour for something that's less processed. To replace 1 cup of all-purpose flour in your cookie recipe, use one of the following:3/4 cup of coarse cornmeal

The dry ingredients will be a uniform pale brown color once they're completely combined.

, Have two small bowls on your work space next to the eggs. Your eggs should be at room temperature. Crack each egg and separate the yolk from the egg white. It's helpful to let the egg white fall into one bowl so you can place the egg yolk in the other bowl. Do this for every egg.








Since you'll only need the egg whites, you can cover and refrigerate the egg yolks for another recipe (like lemon curd, creme brulee or a custard).

, Add the egg whites to your bowl of dry ingredients. Use a firm whisk to stir them completely. The dry ingredients will dissolve in the egg whites to create a dark thick cookie dough. Stir in the chopped nuts and chocolate.








You can use a rubber spatula to stir in the chopped nuts and chocolate if the dough gets too thick. Check the bottom of the mixing bowl to ensure there isn't any flour or cocoa that hasn't been stirred in.

",How to Make Cookies Without Flour3," Turn on your oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Put an oven rack in the center of your oven. Place a piece of parchment paper on each of your baking sheets. This will help the cookies release once they're baked.The oven temperature may seem low, but that's because these cookies bake for a very long time.

, Place 3 large egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large mixing bowl. Beat the egg whites on medium speed for 1 minute, until it starts to foam and then softly peak. If you want, you can add 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar to help stabilize or firm up the egg whites (but this is optional if you don't have cream of tartar).The bowl and beaters need to be completely clean and free of grease. Check the egg whites to ensure that no yolk is in the bowl. These can prevent the egg whites from beating to full volume.
Test for soft peaks by lifting your beater out of the bowl. The egg whites will lift up and droop down if they're at soft peak stage.

, Turn the mixer back on to medium speed and add 3/4 cup (150 grams) of superfine or caster sugar one tablespoon at a time. Beating the egg whites while slowly adding the sugar will allow it to dissolve into the egg whites.Gradually beating in the sugar will prevent the cookies from being gritty.

, Turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and continue to beat the sugar and egg white mixture. Stop the mixture once or twice and scrape down the sides with a clean rubber spatula. Test for stiff peaks by lifting up the beater. The mixture should hold firm shiny peaks.Touch the mixture and rub it between your fingers. If it feels gritty, continue to beat it. When you no longer feel the sugar between your fingers, the meringue batter is ready to use.

, If you want to add a subtle flavor to the meringue cookies, beat in 1/4 teaspoon of extract. Consider what you'll be using the meringues for and what flavors you'll be serving them with. Popular extracts to use in meringues include:


Vanilla
Peppermint
Almond
Lemon

, Take two large spoons and scoop up large dollops of meringue onto your parchment-lined baking sheets. You can scoop them close to each other because they won't spread much during baking. Make the meringue cookies as large or as small as you like, just be aware that larger cookies will take longer to bake.If you want more decorative meringues, pipe the meringues using a pastry bag and 1/2"" tip.

, Place the baking sheets in the oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. The meringues will turn a light pale color and will crisp up as they bake and dry. Turn off the oven and return the meringues to the oven. Leave the door open and let them cool for several hours or overnight.This recipe will make about 9 medium to large size meringues. You can store the meringues in an airtight container for a few days.

Next, invert two muffin tins and spray the underside with nonstick cooking spray to keep the bowls from sticking.If you prefer, you can use softened butter to grease the bottom of the muffin tins.;
, Add 2 cups (220 g) of all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of baking soda, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt to a medium bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are well combined, and set the bowl aside.It’s a good idea to sift the dry ingredients into the bowl so you’ll have an easier time mixing them together.

, Add ¾ cup (170 g) of melted unsalted butter, 1 cup (200 g) of packed brown sugar, and ½ cup (100 g) of white sugar to a separate large bowl. Use an electric mixer to cream the ingredients together on medium until they are well blended.You can mix the chocolate chip cookie dough in a stand mixer if you prefer.
You can also mix the dough together by hand. It will just take a little longer.

, After the butter and sugars are well blended, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vanilla extract, 1 egg, and 1 egg yolk to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium until it is light and creamy, which should take 1 to 2 minutes.To separate the egg yolk from the white, break the egg against a flat surface, such as a tabletop or countertop. Separate it into two halves over a bowl, and allow the yolk to fall into the lower portion. Move the yolk back and forth between the halves, letting the white drip into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolk back and forth until all of the white is removed.

, Once the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla are blended into the butter mixture, stir the flour mixture into the wet ingredients by hand with a wooden spoon. Mix until the ingredients are just combined and a dough forms.Be careful not to overmix the dough. That can lead to cookie bowls with a tough texture.

, When the dough has come together, add 1 ½ cups (265 ml) of mini chocolate chips and stir until they are fully incorporated. Next, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for at least an hour or overnight.You can use your favorite chocolate chips in the cookie bowls. Milk, semisweet, and bittersweet are all delicious options.
If you don’t have time to chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least an hour, you can place it in the freezer for 20 minutes.

, After the dough is properly chilled, use clean hands to gather up approximately 3 tablespoons (62 g) or enough of the cookie dough to fit around the bottom of the inverted muffin cups. Press the dough around the muffin cups to form a bowl shape.You may find it easier to press the dough onto the inverted muffin cups in separate pieces. Roll part of the dough into a ball and press it to the bottom of the cups. Next, roll another piece into a log and wrap it around the sides of the cups to press it in place. Just make sure to seal the seam between the pieces by pressing them together.

, Once you’ve pressed the dough onto the inverted muffin tin, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the bowls to bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the edges become brown., When the cookies are finished baking, remove the muffin tin from the oven. Allow the cookie bowls to cool on the tin for 10 minutes, and then carefully remove them so you can flip them over and fill them.If you’re having trouble removing the bowls from the muffin tin, use a butter knife to gently pry under an edge to loosen them.

Beat them together with an electric mixer on medium until the mixture is light and fluffy.You can use a stand mixer to mix the cookie dough if you prefer.
You can also mix the dough together by hand, but it will require more time and effort.

, After the butter and sugar are combined, add 1 egg, 1 ½ teaspoons (7 ½ ml) of vanilla extract, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of almond extract to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium until the ingredients are fully combined.You can omit the almond extract if you aren’t a fan of the flavor.

, Once the egg and extracts are blended in, gradually mix the flour mixture into to the butter mixture. Stir it in 1 cup (110 g) at a time and mix well after each addition until a dough forms., Once the dough has come together, transfer it to a floured surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out to a ⅛-inch (3-mm) thickness. Next, cut the dough into (12) 4 ½-inch (11-cm) circles using round cookie or dough cutters.If you don’t have round cookie or dough cutters, you can use a glass to cut the dough into circles.

, After you’ve cut the dough into circles, place one of the dough rounds into each muffin cup in the tins. Use clean fingers to gently press the dough into place to form a bowl shape.Make sure that the dough has as smooth a surface as possible when you press it into the pan.

, When the dough is in place in the muffin tins, place them in the preheated oven. Allow the cookie bowls to bake for 11 to 13 minutes, or until they are firm and a light golden brown color.Keep an eye on the cookie bowls, particularly near the end of the baking time, because they can burn quickly.

, Once the cookie bowls are finished baking, remove the muffin tins from the oven. Allow them to cool in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes, and then use a small offset spatula to gently loosen the bowls.

Chocolate sandwich cookies, graham crackers, oatmeal cookies, vanilla wafers, ginger snaps, and peanut butter cookies are all delicious options.
It usually helps to roughly break the cookies into pieces as you add them to the food processor.

, After you’ve mixed up the batter, add approximately 2 tablespoons (42 g) of batter to each cup in the muffin tin. Use clean fingers to gently press the batter into the cup to form a bowl shape.The batter should be packed as firmly into the muffin tin cups as possible.

",How to Make M&M Cookies1," You can also line a couple baking trays with sheets of parchment paper, or wait until later.;
, Mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl until they're well mixed. To make extra-soft cookies, mix in one of the following ingredients as well:


3 Tbsp (45 mL) instant pudding mix makes the cookies soft and keeps them that way for several days.Use vanilla pudding mix for a basic cookie, or a different flavor if you're feeling experimental.






1 tsp (5 mL) cornstarch helps the cookies stay together in the oven, keeping them thick and puffy., Add the room temperature butter to a separate, large bowl. Mix using an electric or handheld mixer, with a paddle attachment if possible, until the butter feels soft. Gradually add both kinds of sugar while you continue to mix, until all the sugar has been added and no more streaks of butter are visible in the mixture.If your butter is still chilled, use a cheese grater to turn it into small flakes that will warm up rapidly.
Don't over-stir the mixture, or your cookies could end up flat.

, Mix the egg and vanilla extract thoroughly into the butter and sugar mixture until you achieve a uniform texture.


To increase the chewiness (without reducing the puffiness), separate the egg and discard half the egg white before adding the remaining white and yolk., Add all the dry ingredients to the larger bowl, and mix them until the batter is smooth.

, Drop the M&M's into the large bowl and stir them into the batter with a spoon.

, Chilling the dough for at least 30 minutes, or even several hours, will help keep the cookies from spreading in the oven.It can affect the texture and flavor as well, but different bakers report very different results, so you'll have to experiment for yourself if you want to find out how your cookies are affected., If you haven't prepared a baking sheet yet, line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Use a large cookie scoop, a tablespoon (15 mL), or your fingers. If you like, press extra M&Ms onto them for decoration.


The cookies will usually spread apart in the oven, so leave space between them.
Large cookies will have a crisp outside and a chewy, or even dough-like inside. Small cookies will be a single texture all the way through.

, Bake the cookies in the oven for 8–12 minutes, or until they're slightly brown on the edges. The centers should stay soft and puffy.


Let cool for about 15 minutes to achieve the final texture before eating.

",How to Make M&M Cookies2," This slightly higher temperature allows you to use a shorter baking time, which keeps the cookies moist and chewy., Mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl, until thoroughly blended. This recipe uses slightly more flour than most cookie recipes, because flour traps more chewy moisture in the cookie., Melt the butter in a light-colored skillet so you can watch the color. Swirl the pan constantly, and transfer the butter to a large, empty bowl as soon as it turns a dark golden brown. Melted butter leads to much chewier cookies, and browning it adds a richer flavor.Melting half the butter at a time may be easier to control.
You can lower the risk of burning by melting most of the butter, then pouring it over the remaining room temperature butter and stirring until fully melted.

, Whisk these ingredients into the butter with a fork or whisk. Add both types of sugar, a little at a time, and whisk until there are no more lumps.


The more brown sugar you use, and the darker the brown sugar is, the chewier the cookie will be, since brown sugar contains more moisture (molasses).






If using light brown sugar, consider using ⅞ cup brown sugar and ⅜ cup white sugar instead.

, Separate one egg, and throw the white away or set it aside for another recipe. Add the yolk to the butter-sugar mixture. Crack a second egg directly into the mixture. Whisk until smooth and shiny.


For better flavor and more consistent texture, instead whisk for 30 seconds, wait for 3 minutes, whisk, wait, whisk, wait, and whisk one final time., Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to stir the wet and dry ingredients together, until the dough is well mixed.


Add the M&Ms and stir briefly to distribute them throughout the dough.







, If you haven't prepared a baking sheet yet, line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Use a large cookie scoop, a tablespoon (15 mL), or your fingers. If you like, press extra M&Ms onto them for decoration.

, When all of the wet ingredients are mixed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until the dry ingredients are just combined.Be careful not to overmix the dough. You can wind up with tough cookies.

, When the dough is fully mixed, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Tear off a small piece of the dough, and roll it out with your hands into a rope that’s approximately 1 ½-inches (4-cm) thick.If you find that the dough is sticking to your hands, rub a small amount of canola or vegetable oil over them before rolling out the dough.

, When you’re shaped the dough into a rope, use your hands to gently press down on it. You want to flatten the rope so it’s approximately 2-inches wide (5-cm)., After you’ve flattened the rope, use a knife to cut it into pieces that are approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide. Slice the cookies on an angle to give them a more decorative look.You can also use a pizza cutter to slice the cookies if you prefer.

, When you’ve finished slicing the first rope into cookies, break off another piece of dough and repeat the entire process. Keep repeating until you’ve used up all of the dough., Once you’ve rolled and sliced all of the dough, line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper. Place the cookies on the sheet so they’re approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart to prevent them from spreading into one another as they bake.You can substitute a silicone baking mat for the parchment paper if you prefer.

, Place the cookies in the preheated oven. Allow them to bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges are firm but the center is still soft.The cookies should have a moist, fudgy center similar to a brownie when they’re finished baking.

, After you take the cookies out of the oven, transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Let the cookies cool for 15 to 20 minutes., Add 4 ounces (115 g) of bittersweet chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon (14 g) of unsalted butter to a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl over a large saucepan with barely simmering water on medium to medium-low heat on the stove. Stir the mixture constantly until the chocolate is completely smooth.Make sure that the bowl doesn’t actually come into contact with the water.
You can also melt the chocolate and butter in a microwave. Place them in a wide, shallow microwave-safe bowl, and heat it on medium-high for 60 seconds. Stir the contents well, and then continue heating them in 15 to 20 second intervals until the chocolate is smooth., Use a whisk to blend 1 ¼ cups (167 g) of powdered sugar and 5 tablespoons (75 ml) of boiling water into the melted chocolate and butter. Continue mixing until the frosting is smooth.Powdered sugar is also known as confectioners’ sugar, icing sugar, or 10x sugar.

, Once the frosting is completely mixed, take the cooled cookies and dip the tops of them into the frosting to coat them. Sprinkle the soft frosting with sprinkles or colored sugar if desired.Make sure that the cookies are cool before dipping them in the frosting. The frosting will melt off if they’re too hot.
If you prefer, you can use a spoon to spread the frosting over the tops of the cookies.

, When the cookies are covered with frosting, place them back on the wire cooling rack. Let them sit for approximately 2 hours or until the frosting has set completely.Store the cookies in an airtight container, and they should stay fresh for 3 to 5 days.

Enjoy your homemade Oreos!",How to Make Homemade Oreo Cookies," Your oven will need to be nice and hot when you put the cookies in, so start heating it up right before you prep your cookie dough. This will help to ensure that it is ready to go when you are ready to bake your cookies.;
, Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and baking powder to one of your large mixing bowls. Then, take a spoon or a whisk and use it to combine the dry ingredients in the bowl until they are all mixed together.







, In a separate bowl, add the three sticks of butter and the two cups of sugar. Then, using your stand mixer or hand mixer, beat the ingredients on medium speed until they are well combined.







, After the butter and sugar are well combined, add in the eggs and mix the eggs with the butter and sugar until they are all well combined. Use your hand mixer or stand mixer to mix everything together.








If you prefer not to use eggs, then you can always substitute the eggs with an egg replacer, such as Ener-G or ground flax seeds. One tablespoon of ground flaxseeds mixed with three tablespoons of water is equal to one egg., Next, you will need to add the dry ingredients to the butter, sugar, and egg mixture while running the hand mixer. Add the dry ingredients slowly, such as a half a cup at a time.








Keep the hand mixer or stand mixer on a low to medium speed as you do this to prevent the dry ingredients from flying out.

, To prevent the cookie dough from sticking to your pan, it is a good idea to line the cookie pan with a sheet of parchment paper, even if the pan is non-stick. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the entire surface of the pan.If you do not have parchment paper, then spray the pan with some non-stick cooking spray.
You can also use a small amount of butter or oil if you do not have non-stick cooking spray.

, Using a small ice cream scoop or melon baller, scoop out about a tablespoon of cookie dough at a time and place it on the pan. Leave about two inches between each ball and make sure that the cookie dough balls are evenly spaced.








If you want to get more uniform cookies, then you can also flatten all of your dough on a clean surface and then cut out disks of dough with a biscuit cutter or cookie cutter. If you do this, then you will need to sprinkle some flour onto the surface and onto the dough to help keep it from sticking., Flattening the cookies will make it easier to use them for sandwiches and it will also give the cookies a more Oreo-like appearance. You will need a clean drinking glass and a small bowl of granulated sugar to do this.








To flatten the cookie dough balls, take a clean drinking glass and press it into one of the cookies to flatten it out.
Then, peel off the cookie and press the stick glass bottom into the dish of granulated sugar.
Press the sugar onto the top of the cookie you just flattened.
Repeat this process for each of the cookies.

, When your cookies are all flat, place the tray into the heated oven and set a timer for 15 or 17 minutes. If you bake the cookies for 15 minutes, then you will end up with some chewy cookies. If you bake them for 17 minutes, then they will be crunchier cookies.







, Butter and powdered sugar are the main ingredients for your frosting. Place the butter and the powdered sugar in a large mixing bowl.Make sure that the butter is at room temperature or the frosting will be hard to mix.
You can also use shortening as a substitute for part or all of the butter if you prefer., Turn on your hand mixer or stand mixer to low speed to begin combining the butter and powdered sugar. If you turn it on a higher speed, some of the sugar may fly out of the bowl, so a low speed is best. Mix the butter and sugar until they are well combined and fluffy.








You can turn the speed up a bit after the ingredients are well combined, but you may still want to keep it on the low side to prevent splattering.

, After the butter and sugar are well combined, you can add in the vanilla extract. Pour the vanilla extract over the butter and sugar and then begin mixing the ingredients with your hand mixer or stand mixer again. Use a low to medium speed to mix in the vanilla.








Keep mixing the ingredients until the frosting is fluffy.
You may want to stop once or twice to scrap down the sides of the bowl.
If you want to add a different flavor to your frosting, just substitute a different extract instead of vanilla. For example, you could use almond extract, chocolate extract, or caramel extract if you prefer.

, After the cookies have finished baking, take them out of the oven and transfer them to a cooling rack. Wait until the cookies are completely cool to do anything with them, otherwise the frosting will melt.









Try making the cookies first, setting them on the rack to cool, and then starting on the frosting. By the time you finish the frosting, the cookies should be cool.

, When the cookies are cool, you can begin to add the frosting filling. Use a small ice cream scoop or melon baller to scoop about a tablespoon of frosting onto the center of half of your cookies.








Don’t worry about spreading out the frosting or patting it down. Just scoop the frosting balls onto the cookies.

, Next, you will need to place another cookie onto the top of the frosting topped cookies and press the two cookies together. This will cause the frosting to spread out and distribute evenly between the cookies.








Do this for all of your cookies until they are all sandwiched together.

, After you have finished sandwiching your cookies, they are ready to eat! Enjoy them alone or with a glass of milk.If you do not plan to serve the cookies right away, then you might want to place them in the fridge to help keep the frosting from melting.

",How to Make Gooey Chocolate Cookies," They need to be at room temperature. If they're not, they'll be very difficult to work with and won't warrant the results you're looking for.;
, Set an ungreased baking sheet aside. A double-thick aluminum half-sheet pan with rolled edges is a good sheet to use. To avoid extra clean up time, line it with parchment paper.

, This isn't part of the dough; it'll be used to form a coating and on top when the cookies are done.

, Beat them together until your mixture is nice and smooth. You may find that the butter isn't absorbing into the cream cheese easily--just keep mixing.


If you use a low-fat version of either, the two may never fully combine. Though it's better for your waistline and health, higher-fat products will yield better looking results.

, When the egg is well mixed in, add 1 tsp (5 g) vanilla. Don't beat any more than you have to or the mixture might grow thin.

, Beat it slowly so that you don't make a mess. You'll know when you're done where there are no more lumps.


If the lumps seem to stay and you don't want to over beat your batter, take the back of the spoon and crush the lumps against the wall of the bowl.

, This will firm up the dough so you can roll it into balls more easily. You may consider putting it in the freezer if your tummy is rumbling, but good (better) things come to those who wait.

, Since the dough is cold, it shouldn't stick to your hands. If you want bite-size cookies or monster cookies, use more or less dough. A tablespoon is good for an average-sized cookie.


If you don't want to go mano-a-mano with the dough, a melon baller is a good tool to utilize in this situation.
If you do make bigger or smaller cookies, adjust the oven times as necessary. Keep an eye on your treats, regardless.

, Once it's coated, shake it a bit so the excess falls off (into the bowl). If you're worried about too much sugar, sprinkle it over all the sides. But really, though, too much sugar? Is there such a thing?

, Leave 2"" (5 cm) between them when you place them on the baking sheet so that they can cook evenly.

, Be careful not to overcook them -- you want them to stay gooey! If you've made smaller or bigger cookies, bake them less or more, respectively.


If your oven bakes unequally, flip the sheet halfway through. This guarantees that half your cookies aren't baked more than the rest.

, Allow the cookies to cool slightly on the baking sheet before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely. Sniff until cooled, then dig in!


If desired, sprinkle the cooled cookies with more confectioners' sugar before serving.

Remove the cups from the tin and allow them to cool.,
Use a piping bag or a small spoon to fill the cups.",How to Make Cookie Cups1," There are two main types of cookie recipes: drop cookies and rolled-out cookies. The best type of cookie recipe to use for this method is the drop cookie, where you roll it out into a ball, then drop it onto a baking sheet. You can also use a refrigerated, store-bought recipe. Most chocolate chip cookies will be drop cookies. Many sugar cookie recipes will also work.
, A single batch of cookie dough will be enough to fill two mini muffin tins. You can cut the dough in half, however, and use it to fill just one mini muffin tin.You should grease the tin even if it says nonstick; this will make the cups easier to remove.

, What temperature you preheat the oven to depends on the recipe that you are using. For most recipes, this will be 350°F (177°C). Follow your recipe closely. When you finish kneading the dough together, stop., Roll the dough into 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) balls, or form them using a cookie scoop. Drop each ball into a well in the muffin tin.Plan on using about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of cookie dough for each well., Press the balls into the bottom of each well. Use a wooden spoon handle or your thumb to make a well in the middle of each ball. Press the dough against the bottom and sides of the cup. Only make them go two-thirds of the way up., Keep in mind that the baking time may vary depending on your recipe. The cookie cups are ready when they are lightly browned on the edges.

, Sometimes, the cookies will puff out while they bake, and the wells will become smaller. If this happens to you, press down onto the center of each cup with the handle of a wooden spoon. You must do this right after you take the cups out of the oven, while they are still warm and in the muffin tin., Let the cups cool for about 5 minutes first. Invert the tin and let the cups fall out. Transfer the cups to a wire cooling rack and allow them to finish cooling.If any cups are stuck in the tin, pry them loose with a paring knife.

, These cups are really small, so you won't be able to fill them with large amounts of dessert or ice cream. You can turn them into mini pies and desserts, however. Ideal fillings include:

Choose a cookie recipe where you roll the dough into balls and drop onto a baking sheet. You can also use a store-bought, refrigerated dough instead.

Try a soft chocolate chip cookie recipe or a soft sugar cookie recipe.

, You can also use two 6-well muffin tins, as long as they are both standard sized., How you prepare the dough depends on the recipe, as each one will be a little different Follow the recipe exactly. Stop when you finish mixing and kneading the dough.

Most recipes will tell you to preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C), but your recipe may be different.

, You can do this with a large cookie scoop or with an ice cream scoop, but make sure that each well has the same amount. The cookie dough will spread out in the wells and fill them. Don't indent anything yet; you'll do that at the end., Keep in mind that the exact baking times may vary depending on the recipe that you used. The cookie cups are ready when the edges start to turn brown.

Have a small spice jar ready for the next step.

, As soon as the cookie cups finish baking, take the muffin tin out of the oven and place it onto a heat-safe surface. Press a small spice jar into the center of each cookie cup to make a well. Do this while the cookie cups are still warm; do not wait for them to cool.If you have another muffin tin, you can use it to indent the cookie cups instead. Simply place it on top of the cups, and press down on it lightly.

, Let the cups cool in the muffin tin for about 10 minutes. Invert the muffin tin, and let them drop out onto the counter. Place the cups onto a wire cooling rack, and let them finish cooling, about 10 minutes more.If a cup gets stuck in the tin, you can twist it loose or pry it out with a paring knife., Use a spoon to fill the cups with your favorite filling.

Roll half of the dough between two sheets of lightly-floured wax paper.,
Cut the dough into six circles.,
Drape the cut dough circles over the prepared muffin tin.,
Chill the tin in the freezer while you prepare the other one.,
Bake the cookies in a preheated oven at for about 12 to 15 minutes.,
Let the cookie cups cool off completely on the tin.,
Fill the cookie cups.",How to Make Cookie Cups3," You can use just about any type of cookie dough recipe for this method, but the kind that works the best is the roll-out-and-cut kind. Avoid using the type of dough where you have to roll onto balls and plop onto a baking sheet; they will spread too much and make a mess.Crunchy, shaped sugar cookie recipes will work especially well for this. Some chocolate chip cookie recipes may also work.
Not all store-bought cookie dough will work for this. Read the baking instructions on the package to ensure that it's the roll-out kind.

, Flip two standard sized muffin tins upside down. Cut some aluminum foil into 12 5-inch (12.7-centimeter) squares. Cover every other cup on each tin with a foil square, making sure that the shiny side is facing up. Spray the foil squares with nonstick cooking spray when you are done. Each muffin tin should have six foil-covered wells.Staggering the cups like this will prevent the cups from fusing together.
Make sure that you are molding the foil squares over the back of each cup, not the inside.

, Do not preheat the oven yet. Most kinds of roll-out cookie dough recipes have a chill period. If yours doesn't, consider wrapping it in plastic wrap and refrigerating it for at least 2 hours. This will make the cookie dough easier to work with.Preheat your oven once the dough finishes chilling. For most recipes, this will be around to 350°F (177°C).

, Spread out a sheet of wax paper on your counter. Lightly coat it with flour, then place the dough on top. Dust a second sheet of wax paper with more flour, then place it on top. Roll the dough out until it is ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) thick.Keep the other half of the dough covered with plastic wrap in the fridge.

, Use a 3½ or 4-inch (8.89 or 10.16-centimeter) cookie cutter for this. You can also use a glass, jar, or small bowl with the same diameter instead., Only drape the dough over the wells that are covered with aluminum foil. Gently press the dough against the sides of each well. It won't reach the bottom of the tray, which is fine; the dough will spread during baking.Again, you are draping the dough over the back of the tin, not the inside.
Keep the cookie cups staggered. You don't want them touching. This will prevent fusing.

, Once you have finished draping the size cookie dough circles over the back of your muffin tin, put the entire tin into the freezer. Leave it there for 10 minutes while you repeat the process on the other muffin tin., If you have not already, preheat your oven to the temperature specified in the recipe. Bake the cookie cups for about 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges turn golden-brown. Resist the urge to remove the cookies from the tin after baking.

Let the second muffin tin chill in the freezer while the first one bakes.

, This will take 10 to 15 minutes. They must be completely cool before you remove them. If you take them off while they are still warm, they will break. Peel the aluminum foil away from the cookies once you remove them from the tin.If the cookie cups fused together during baking, cut them apart while they are still warm., Take them off of the muffin tin first, then peel off the aluminum foil. Fill them with your favorite dessert filling. Great options include:Custard or pudding
Ice cream
Fruits and cream
Mousse

, Next add the flour, baking powder, vanilla extract, and milk to the bowl. Then mix together the ingredients until they form a dough. You can use a fork, a hand mixer or stand mixer, or your hands to mix the dough.Make sure that the ingredients are well combined.
You may even want to sift together the dry ingredients in a separate bowl before adding them to the butter and sugar mixture. Then, mix in the milk and vanilla extract with the butter and sugar before adding the dry ingredients to the butter and sugar.

, Refrigerating the cookie dough before you roll it out may make the dough easier to work with.Try wrapping the dough in plastic wrap and placing it in the refrigerator for an hour.

Before you begin rolling out and cutting your cookie dough, turn on the oven. You will need to heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit to bake the cookies and to toast the coconut.
After the dough is chilled, place it onto a piece of parchment paper. Then, place another equal sized piece of parchment paper over the dough ball.Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough between the two pieces of parchment paper.

, Use a round cookie cutter to cut disc shapes in the dough. Then, use a smaller round cookie cutter or a frosting bag tip to cut a smaller circle out of the center of the dough.You can cut the cookies into any shape you like, but cutting them into rings will help to make the cookies look more like real Samoas.

, Place the cookie dough rings on a baking sheet and bake the cookies at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes. The cookies should look slightly browned when they are ready. After they are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool.You can transfer them to a cooling rack after you remove them from the oven to help them cool faster.

, Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and dump an entire bag of sweetened coconut onto the parchment paper. Bake the coconut at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes. Do not allow the coconut to bake for any longer than this or it will burn.

You can also toast coconut over medium heat in a non-stick skillet if you prefer. To do this, you will need to watch the coconut until it is completely toasted.Remove it from the pan when it is done toasting to prevent it from burning.

, Unwrap the caramels and place them into a microwave safe bowl. Then add 1 teaspoon of milk to the bowl and microwave the milk and caramels for about 15 to 20 seconds.

You can add more milk (one teaspoon at a time) for a thinner caramel sauce if it seems too thick.Remove the bowl from the microwave and stir the milk and caramels together.
Combine the caramel with the toasted coconut.

, After the cookies are done and the topping is done, top each of the cookies with some of the caramel and coconut mixture. Try to place the topping so that it goes around the cookie’s ring, not over the hole in the center.Press the topping gently to make it stay in place.

, Next, place 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips into a microwave safe bowl or in the glass bowl of a double boiler to melt them. Microwave the chocolate for about one minute or heat the water under the glass bowl of the double boiler until the chocolate melts.Stir the chocolate after a minute in the microwave or as it starts to melt in the double boiler.

, Dip the cookies into the melted chocolate so that just the bottoms get coated in the chocolate. If you prefer, you can also spread some chocolate on the bottoms of the cookies using a spoon.Place the cookies onto a tray or plate lined with parchment paper as you finish dipping them in the chocolate.

, Finish the cookies by drizzling them with chocolate syrup. You can do this by filling a pastry bag or a plastic Ziploc bag with some melted chocolate and cutting a small hole in the tip. Then, squeeze the bag over the cookies and move it side to side to add the chocolate drizzle.Make sure that the chocolate is still warm when you do this or it will not drizzle easily.

, Crack one egg and add it to the sugar and butter mixture. Then add 1 and ¼ teaspoons of peppermint extract to the bowl. Use your hand mixer or stand mixer to combine these ingredients.Make sure that you use peppermint extract and not mint extract.

, Next, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Then sift these dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Mix all of the ingredients together until a dough forms.Use your hand mixer or stand mixer to combine the ingredients.

, After you have your cookie dough, wrap it in a piece of plastic wrap or in a plastic Ziploc bag. Then place the dough in the refrigerator and let it sit for at least one hour. This will help the dough to keep its shape when you roll it out and cut out the cookies.Chilling the dough will make it much easier to work with and keep its shape.Otherwise, the dough may slide around and not stay in the shape you cut the cookies into.

, The oven will need to be heated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit to cook the cookies properly. Turn on your oven and set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit just before you begin to roll out the cookie dough., Remove the dough from the refrigerator and remove it from the plastic wrap or bag. Lay the dough on a floured work surface and sprinkle it with some flour as well. This will help to prevent the dough from sticking to the rolling pin.Roll the dough out so that it is about 1/8 of an inch thick.
Keep sprinkling flour onto the dough to prevent it from sticking to the rolling pin.
You can also sprinkle the dough with confectioner’s sugar. This can help to prevent the dough from becoming tough from too much added flour., Use a circular cookie cutter to cut out the cookies. You can use a different shape if you prefer, but using a circular shape will make the cookies look more like real Thin Mints.Make sure that you cut the cookies close together to get as many cookies as you can from the rolled out dough.
After you have cut out as many cookies as you can, you can gather up the excess dough and roll this out again to cut more cookies from it if desired.

, After you cut out the cookies, transfer them to a parchment lined cookie sheet. Bake the cookies at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes. When time is up, remove the cookies from the oven and transfer them to a cooling rack., While the cookies are baking, you can melt the chocolate. Place your bag of chocolate chips or candy melts into a bowl and microwave it for about one minute. Then, remove it from the microwave and stir the chocolate.If necessary, you can microwave the chocolate for longer, but do it in short intervals, such as 5 to 10 seconds at a time.
If the chocolate seems too thick, then you can always add a small amount of shortening to the chocolate to thin it out. Try stirring in 1 teaspoon to the melted chocolate to make it thinner.

, After the cookies have cooled and the chocolate is melted, you can begin dipping the cookies into the chocolate. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper to place the cookies on after you finish dipping each one. Dip each of the cookies into the chocolate using a fork to hold the cookie.Wipe the excess chocolate on the rim of the bowl before you transfer the cookie to the parchment-lined cookie sheet.
Allow the cookies to set before enjoying. This will take about 10 minutes, but you can also pop them in the fridge to set if you like.

Use a whisk to mix the ingredients together until they are fully combined, and set aside., Add 1 cup (226 g) of softened, unsalted butter, ½ cup (105 g) of granulated sugar, and ½ cup (60 g) of powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat the mixture on medium speed until it is light and fluffy.If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can use an electric hand mixer.
You can also mix the cookie dough together by hand, but it will require more time and effort.

, When the butter and sugars mixture is light and fluffy, add 1 large egg,1 ½ teaspoon (7 ½ ml) of vanilla extract, and ¼ teaspoon (1 ml) of almond extract to the bowl. Continue to beat the mixture on medium speed until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.It may be necessary to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula periodically as you’re mixing to ensure that the ingredients are completely blended.

, After the egg, vanilla, and almond extract are mixed in, reduce the speed of the mixer to low. Slowly add the flour mixture to the bowl and blend until it is fully incorporated and a dough forms..It’s a good idea to add a little of the flour mixture at a time and wait for it to be incorporated before adding another batch.

, Once the dough has come together, split it into two even pieces. Use clean hands to smooth each piece into a 6-inch (15-cm) disc.If you find that the dough is sticking to your hands, dust them lightly with flour.

, Take each dough disc, and cover it tightly with plastic wrap. Place them in the refrigerator, and allow them to chill for approximately 1 ½ hours or until the dough is firm.You can chill the dough overnight. However, leave it out on the counter for 5 to 10 minutes before making the cookies to soften it.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cookies, set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat. Next, line a baking sheet with parchment paper so the cookies won’t stick.You can line the baking sheet with a silicone baking mat is you prefer.

, Remove one of the dough discs from the refrigerator and place it on a floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out so it’s between ⅛- and ¼-inch ( 3- and 6-cm) thick.Dust the rolling pin with some flour to ensure that the dough doesn’t stick as you roll it out.

, Once the dough is rolled out to the proper thickness, use mini animal-shaped cookie cutters to cut out the cookies. To mimic the look of store-bought circus animal cookies, it’s best to use approximately 1 ½-inch (4-cm) large cookie cutters.You can also dust the cookie cutters lightly in flour to make sure that it’s easy to remove them from the dough.

, When you’ve cut the dough into the proper shapes, use a spatula to place them on the lined baking sheet. Arrange the cookies so they are approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart., Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Allow the cookies to bake for 7 to 11 minutes, or until they are set and lightly golden.Because the cookies are thin, they can burn easily. Be sure to keep an eye on them, particularly towards the end of the baking time.

, When the cookies are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Let the cookies cool on the sheet for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Next, transfer them to a wire cooling rack to allow them to cool completely.It should take 15 to 20 minutes for the cookies to cool completely.

, When you’ve finished making cookies with the first dough disc, remove the second dough disc from the refrigerator. Repeat the process of rolling out, cutting, and baking the cookies until you’ve used all of the dough.It’s important to keep the dough that you’re not working with in the refrigerator. It’s more difficult to cut and handle if it’s warm and soft.

, To make the icing, add 1 ½ cups (170 g) of powdered sugar, ¼ teaspoon (1 ml) of vanilla extract, and 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of half and half to a medium bowl. Whisk the mixture together until it is smooth and isn’t runny or too thick.If the icing is too thick, you may need to mix in more half and half. Add a little at a time to get the right medium consistency.

, After you’ve mixed up the icing, pour half of it into another bowl so you have two separate bowls. Add several drops of red food coloring to one and mix well to create pink icing.While traditional circus animal cookies are usually covered with pink and white icing, you can use whatever shades of food coloring that you like to tint the icing.

, Use a small offset spatula to spread the white and pink frosting over the cookies as you’d like. While the icing is still wet, add a pinch or two of rainbow nonpareil sprinkles to each cookie.If you prefer to have the cookies covered on both sides with frosting, you can dunk them into the icing and lift them out with a fork, making sure to let the excess drain off into the bowl.

, As soon as you’ve finished icing the cookies, set them down on a wire cooling rack. Allow the cookies to set for 4 to 6 hours so the icing sets completely.If you need the cookies to be ready more quickly, stick them in the freezer for a half hour or so to set.
Make sure that you have the cooling racks set over a baking sheet, parchment paper, or another protective covering in case any excess icing drips off.
Store the cookies in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should keep for 3 to 5 days.

, After the dough is completely mixed together, remove it from the food processor and transfer it to a floured surface. Gather the dough into a compact ball, and then use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 7-by-9-inch (18-by-23-cm) rectangle that’s approximately ¼-inch (6-mm) thick.If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a wine bottle, full water bottle, or thermos to roll out the dough.

, After you’ve rolled out the dough, use a sharp knife to slice it into 12 even squares. Next, use a fork to prick each square 3 times., Once the shortbread is cut into squares, carefully transfer them to the lined cookie sheet, placing them so they’re at least 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart. Cover the cookie sheet with plastic wrap, and chill them for at least 20 minutes.You can make the shortbread dough the day before and chill the cookies overnight. However, you should let them sit out at room temperature for about 20 minutes before baking. Be sure not to preheat the oven until you’re ready to bake them too.

, After the cookies have been chilled, place the cookies sheet in the preheated oven. Let the shortbread bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the cookies are a light golden brown.You don’t want the shortbread to get too brown, so keep a close eye on the cookies near the end of the baking time.

, When the cherry shortbread cookies are finished baking, remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes on the sheet, and then transfer them to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling for another 20 minutes.Store the cherry shortbread in an airtight container. The cookies should stay fresh for 5 to 7 days.

Use a pastry cutter to mix the butter in until the mixture has the texture of coarse crumbs.If you don’t have a pastry cutter, you can use a fork to work the butter into the flour and sugar mixture.

, When the flour mixture resembles coarse crumbs, add ½ cup (50 g) of maraschino cherries that have been drained and finely chopped, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of almond extract, and 4 ounces (112 g) of white chocolate baking squares that have been finely chopped. Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.If you want the shortbread to have a red color, you can mix in a couple of drops of red food coloring with the cherries, almond extract, and white chocolate.

, Once the dough is fully mixed, use clean hands to knead the dough until it is smooth. Next, work the dough into ¾-inch (19-mm) balls, and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet so they are approximately 2-inches (5-cm) apart.If you’re concerned about the shortbread sticking, you can line the cookie sheet with parchment paper.

, When the dough balls are on the cookie sheet, dip a drinking glass in granulated sugar and press it onto the balls to flatten them into 1 ½-inch (4-cm) rounds. Place the cookie sheet in the preheated oven, and allow the cookies to bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the centers are completely set.Adding the sugar to the tops of the cookies is optional. You can omit it, or use a decorative colored sugar if you prefer.

, While the cookies are baking, add the remaining 8 ounces (228 g) of finely chopped white chocolate and 2 teaspoons (9 g) of shortening to a small saucepan. Heat the two ingredients on the stove over low heat until they are completely melted, which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes.Be sure to stir the white chocolate mixture regularly as you heat it to ensure that it melts evenly.

, When the cookies are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Allow the cookies to cool for 1 minute on the sheet, and then transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely, which should take 15 to 20 minutes., When the cookies are cool, dip one half of each into the melted white chocolate. Let the excess drip off, and place the cookies on a piece of parchment or wax paper to allow the chocolate to set completely, which should take 1 to 2 hours.If you like, you can press the dipped end of the cookies in colored sugar, sprinkles, or nonpareils to a more decorative look if you prefer. Make sure to do it before the white chocolate has set, though.
Keep the cookies in an airtight container. They should stay fresh for 3 to 5 days.

If you have a stand mixer with a dough attachment, you can use it to fold the flour into the dough. If not, you will need to use a mixing spoon or your hands. Do not use an electric hand mixer.

, Turn the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface and knead until it becomes smooth an elastic.


This usually takes about 10 minutes.
If the dough sticks to your hands as you knead it, you can apply a light dusting of flour to your hands to help prevent further sticking.

, Place the dough in a greased bowl and let it rise, covered, until it doubles in volume.


The dough will usually need to rise for about 1 hour and 30 minutes.
You can grease the bowl with nonstick cooking spray, butter, or shortening.
Turn the dough after putting it into the greased bowl once in order to grease the top.
Make sure that the dough is placed in a warm area. Otherwise, it may not reach its full rising potential.

Gently pat the dough into a rounded or rectangular shape.
At this point, the dough should be about 3/4 inch (2 cm) thick.
Fold the dough into three sections in order to create biscuits that have multiple, flaky layers. Overlap the ends over the center of the dough, creating a brochure-style fold.After folding the dough, flatten as usual to the specified thickness.

, Use a round, 3-inch (7.5-cm) biscuit cutter with sharp edges to cut out rounds of dough. Place the biscuits onto your prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.


A cookie cutter or the mouth of a glass could be used in the absence of an actual biscuit cutter.
After your first batch of biscuits has been cut out, pat the scraps together again so that you can cut out more biscuits from the remaining dough. Continue until all the dough has been used.
While circular biscuits are the most traditional shape, you could cut your biscuits into any shape desired. Cutting the biscuits into squares will prevent you from having to roll out any excess dough.
Alternatively, create drop biscuits by dropping rounded tablespoons of dough onto your baking sheet. This will create biscuits that are more rustic in appearance.

, The biscuits should be a light, golden brown when done.


Note that if you opted to form drop biscuits instead of cut biscuits, the peaks of dough will be slightly darker and crispy when the biscuits are done.

, The biscuits can be served immediately, or you can let them cool slightly on a wire rack for a few minutes first.

, After you’ve kneaded the dough, use your hands to separate the dough into six equal pieces. With a rolling pin, roll each piece into a 6-inch (15-cm) circle.If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a wine bottle, thermos, glass jar, or other heavy, round object to roll out the dough.

, For the biscuit cups, you’ll need a muffin tin with at least 6 cups. Flip the tin over, and use a vegetable oil cooking spray to grease the underside of the muffin cups.You can use butter to grease the muffin tin if you prefer.

, After you’ve greased the bottom of the muffin tin, place the dough circles on the back of the muffin cups. Press the dough around each cup to form a bowl shape.If you find that the dough is sticking to your hands as you try to shape them on the muffin tin, lightly dust your skin with flour.

, With the dough on the underside of the muffin tin, place the tin in the preheated oven. Allow the biscuit bowls to bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are a light golden brown color.The biscuit bowls can burn fairly easily, so keep a close eye on them as they're baking, particularly toward the end of the baking time.

Preheat the oven.,
Invert several ramekins on a baking sheet and grease.,
Separate the dough into individual biscuits.,
Roll the dough pieces into circles.,
Mold the dough around the ramekins.,
Bake the biscuit bowls until golden.",How to Make Biscuit Bowls2," To ensure that the oven is hot enough when the biscuit bowls are ready, you must preheat the oven. Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and let the oven heat fully., For the biscuit bowls, you’ll need 8 6-ounce (170 g) ramekins. Turn them over on a large baking sheet, and use nonstick cooking spray to grease the backs and sides of the ramekins.If you prefer, you can use butter to grease the ramekins.
If you prefer, you can use a muffin tin and grease the backside of it.

, Open a 16.3 ounce (462 g) can of refrigerated biscuit dough according to the package instructions. Use clean fingers to separate the dough into 8 individual biscuits.If the dough is sticking to your hands, dust them lightly with flour to make it easier to handle the biscuits.

, With the dough separated into 8 pieces, use a rolling pin to roll each one out on a lightly floured surface. Work each piece of dough into a 5-inch (13-cm) circle.It helps to lightly dust your rolling pin with flour before rolling out the dough.

, After you’ve rolled out the biscuit dough, lift each circle and place it on the back of one of the ramekins. Use your fingers to gently press the dough all around the ramekin to create a bowl shape.Be careful not to tear any holes in the dough as you shape it around the ramekins. If any occur, use your fingers to gently seal them closed so the bowl will remain in tact.

, After you’ve molded all of the biscuit dough onto the backs of the ramekins, place the cookie sheet that they’re on in the preheated oven. Allow the biscuits to bake for approximately 14 minutes, or until they are lightly browned.If you’re using frozen biscuit dough, make sure to allow it to thaw for at least 30 minutes at room temperature and bake them for 16 to 18 minutes.

Serve the brandy snaps immediately.",How to Make Brandy Snaps," Let the oven heat while you prepare the baking sheets. Place a single layer of baking paper on each tray.


You will probably need four baking sheets.
Set the four trays aside for now.
Once you’re done with the trays, rub olive oil on the first 2 inches (5 cm) of the wooden-spoon handle. You can rub the olive oil using a paper towel, washcloth, or even your fingers.
You’ll use the oiled handle later to roll the brandy crisps; for now, you can set the spoon aside.;
, Add the corn syrup, brown sugar, and butter to the saucepan.


When you measure the brown sugar, compress it into the measuring cup. If you measure brown sugar without compressing it, you’ll end up with snaps that are not sweet enough.

, You should keep the burner on low heat while you’re waiting for the butter to melt and the ingredients to blend.


Watch the cooking mixture slowly; don’t allow it to burn or crystalize.
To see if all of the brown sugar has fully melted, take the spoon you’re using to stir the mixture, and drag it slowly along the bottom of the saucepan. If you can still see grains of sugar along the bottom of the pan, the sugar hasn’t yet melted sufficiently.

, Once the butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup have blended together, allow the mixture to cool slightly; you can place the saucepan on a cool burner.


It should only cool for about 3 minutes.

, Pour the flour and ground ginger into the saucepan at the same time, and stir to combine with the wet ingredients.


If you have a flour sifter, sift the flour into the saucepan.
Once you have stirred and blended the flour and ginger with the wet ingredients, you can add the lemon juice.
Continue to stir until all of the ingredients are blended and smooth.

, You should have your lined baking sheets ready to put the batter on.


Place four or five spoonfuls per tray—if you place more than four, the mixture will spread and the individual snaps will blend together.
Leave about 4 inches (10 cm) between each of the brandy snaps.

, Leave to bake for 7 minutes, or until they turn golden.


When fully baked, the snaps should appear thin and lacey.
If you do not have room in your oven to fit all four sheets at once, you can cook each baking sheet individually.

, Allow the brandy snaps to cool slightly, but only until they are able to be moved without breaking. The snaps need to remain hot, in order to be malleable.


It should only take about 2 minutes for the snaps to cool. As soon as the brandy snaps are comfortable to touch (don’t burn yourself!), they have cooled enough.

, Lift up each brandy snap by sliding a spatula underneath. Once you have lifted up an edge of a brandy snap, use the oiled handle of the wooden spoon to wrap each snap around to create a roll.


You may want to make a few extra brandy snaps if this is your first time making them, as they can be easy to accidentally rip or tear.
Be gentle when rolling the brandy snaps.
Each brandy snap should make one full rotation around the handle of the wooden spoon; the edges should overlap by about ¼ inch (0.635 cm).

, Once rolled, the brandy snaps should retain their “cigar” shape as long as you do not force them off of the spoon handle.


Repeat this process with each brandy snap.
If any of the snaps have cooled before you have rolled them, place the cool snaps back on the baking sheet and back in the oven for about 30 seconds.

, Each snap will firm up as it cools; they should become hard to the touch.


Since the snaps are thin, they will take only about 5 minutes to cool and harden.

, Add enough whipped cream so that the brandy snaps are completely filled.


If you have a piping bag, use a narrow tip to fill the brandy snaps.
If you do not have a piping bag, you can use the tip of an aerosol whipped-cream can to fill the snaps. Start at the center, then slowly pull the tip of the aerosol can out, until one side of each snap is filled. Repeat this process on both sides.
You can also make your own at-home piping bag by cutting a small bit off one corner of a zip-close storage bag, then partially filling it with whipped cream.

, Once the whipped cream is added, the brandy snaps do not keep well; they can become soggy quickly. If you are planning to make your brandy snaps ahead of time, do not add the whipped cream until right before you plan to serve them.


Make enough to add whipped cream to only as many snaps as you will need; otherwise you may end up throwing several away.

Flaked coconut can also be called desiccated coconut.;
, Place a small sauce pan on the stove over low heat. Next, add ½ cup (4 ounces) of butter and 1 tablespoon of golden syrup. Allow the butter to melt completely. Stir the mixture well to incorporate the syrup into the melted butter.


If you can’t find golden syrup at your local grocery store, consider buying it online. Otherwise, substitute an equal amount of honey., Use a small bowl or cup. Mix together the boiling water and the baking soda to form a paste. Use the back of a metal spoon to crush any lumps in the baking soda. If you leave the lumps, they may not mix into the dough properly.


If you’re worried about lumps in your baking soda, sift the baking soda into the cup or bowl before adding water.

, Immediately spoon the baking soda and water mixture into the melted butter and golden syrup. Use a whisk to completely incorporate the ingredients. Keep stirring until a layer of white foam forms on the surface of the mixture.Turn off the heat.


If the mixture begins boiling, reduce the heat. Otherwise, you may burn the butter.

, Pour the butter mixture directly into the dry ingredients. Use a baking spatula or spoon to scrape the sides of the saucepan clean. Next, use a large spoon to gently mix everything together. Continue to stir until the mixture is uniform.The dough will cling to the spoon and the sides of the bowl but hold its shape.


If your dough is too dry, add a few drops of water.
If your dough is too wet, sprinkle in some flour.

, Many people believe that Anzac biscuits are best when freshly baked. However, if you’re preparing a large batch of biscuits ahead of time, you can freeze the dough for up to three months. To do so, lay out a large sheet of plastic wrap. Next, spoon the dough onto the plastic wrap in a long line. Roll the plastic wrap around the dough to create a log of biscuit dough and place it in the freezerWhen you’re ready to bake the biscuits, simply cut off small disks of frozen biscuit dough from the log with a serrated knife.
Let the log thaw for an hour or two before slicing it.

, Set your oven to 350 Fahrenheit (175 Celsius) for ten to fifteen minutes.If your oven has an automatic “Preheat” function, follow the manufacturer instructions when preheating your oven.

, Choose two large 26 by 18 inch (66 by 46 centimeter) baking trays. Next, grease the pans with a stick of butter and dust them with flour. Alternatively, cover the trays with wax paper or a silicon baking mat.


If you make a smaller batch of biscuits, you can use smaller baking trays.

, Use a spoon to scoop out a small amount of dough into your hands. Next, roll the dough into a walnut-sized ball. Set the ball on the corner of the baking sheet. Leave about two inches (five centimeters) of space around each ball of dough.Dip a fork in a cup of water and press the tines onto the top of the biscuits to create a traditional Anzac biscuit pattern.

, Check on the biscuits periodically. Let them cook for eighteen to twenty minutes or until the top surface of the biscuit is golden brown.If you like crunchy biscuits, allow the biscuits to bake for an extra minute.


If your oven doesn't have a glass panel on it, you will need to open the door to check the color of the cookies. Check quickly and sparingly to avoid letting all the heat out of your oven.
If you used frozen dough, you may need to bake the biscuits for an extra minute or two.

, When the biscuits are done cooking, remove the baking trays from the oven. Next, set out a large wire rack over a dish towel or clean baking pan. Use a spatula to transfer the biscuits to the wire rack to cool completely.Once the biscuits are cool, serve them or store them in an airtight container for up to two weeks., You can enjoy these delicious biscuits even if you aren’t able to enjoy gluten products. To do so, use an equal mixture of brown and white rice flour instead of all-purpose flour.


For example, if your biscuit recipe calls for a cup of all-purpose flour, use half a cup of white rice flour and half a cup of brown rice flour instead.
Rolled oats are naturally gluten free. However, if you’re especially sensitive, buy brands that are processed in gluten-free facilities.

, Many Australasians will frown on any sweet additions to their most patriotic biscuit. However, the crunchy golden notes in Anzac biscuits can be enhanced with a variety of flavors. Blend in any additions last, just before the final mixing of the dough. For example, consider adding:


Chocolate chips
Orange zest and a tablespoon of freshly squeezed orange juice
Maple syrup instead of golden syrup
Raisins

, If you prefer crunchy, toffee-like biscuits, simply add an extra tablespoon of golden syrup to your biscuit recipe. The extra golden syrup will enhance the toasted notes in the biscuit and create a shiny glaze on the outside crust."

While that heats up, let your butter soften to room temperature, or dish 2 tablespoons into a bowl or cup that’s safe to microwave. Nuke it for ten-second bursts and check in between to see how much it has melted. Quit once it has mostly melted, but still retains some of its original shape.Butter that has been thoroughly melted to the point of boiling will melt your chocolate and cook your egg before baking. So make sure not to melt it too thoroughly.
As an alternative to making your own dough, you can also use pre-made store-bought dough. In that case, skip straight to Step 4.;
, Transfer your butter to a small mixing bowl. Stir in 3 tablespoons of light brown sugar, ⅛ teaspoon of salt, ¼ teaspoon of vanilla extract, ⅓ cup (36.33 g) of all-purpose flour, and ⅛ teaspoon baking soda. In a separate dish, crack and whisk an egg until the white and the yolk are evenly combined. Add 1 tablespoon of this to the dough, and then stir until your dough is evenly mixed.If desired, either use the leftover egg for other baking or cooking. If not using it immediately, seal it in an airtight container and use within the next 24 hours.

, First, measure ¼ cup (27.25 g) of chocolate chips, which equals 4 tablespoons. Separate 1 tablespoon of chips from the rest and set this aside for now. Add the remaining chips to the dough and stir them in until they are distributed as evenly as possible., Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then transfer your dough. Sculpt it into a flat disk roughly 3.5 inches wide (9 cm). Sprinkle the tablespoon of chips that you set aside over the cookie., Place the baking sheet in the oven once it reaches 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Set a timer for 12 to 14 minutes. Cooking time may vary depending on your oven, so check your cookie at 12 minutes. Remove once it turns golden.


You can enjoy your cookie now while it’s hot. If you’d rather cool it off, place it on a wire rack. Once it cools down, transfer it to an airtight container if you’re going to save it for later.

Then, in a small mixing bowl, add 2 tablespoons of flour, 1/16 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/16 teaspoon of salt. Since a 1/16 teaspoon isn’t commonly included in most measuring spoon-sets, use a ⅛ teaspoon and only fill it halfway. Then stir your ingredients until they are evenly mixed.When eyeballing your salt measurement in a ⅛ teaspoon, err on the side of too little than too much, since peanut butter is pretty salty on its own.
If you don’t have agave or maple syrup for sweetener, also include ¾ tablespoon of white sugar, plus ¾ tablespoon of brown sugar.

, In a separate bowl, combine ¼ teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1.5 tablespoons of agave or maple syrup, and 1 teaspoon of applesauce. Once they’re mixed, add 1.5 tablespoons of peanut butter. Use your spoon to mash it up so you can stir it evenly into the mixture.If you’re using dry sugar instead of wet sweetener, consider doubling the applesauce (or adding even more, if desired, for a moister cookie) to make up for the difference in moisture.

, Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer your dough and squish it flat, sculpting it into a disk shape (or square, or triangle, or whatever your heart desires).

Next, line a baking sheet with parchment paper so the cookies don’t stick.If you prefer, you can line the baking sheet with a silicone baking mat instead of parchment paper.;
, Add 3 egg whites that are at room temperature to the bowl of a stand mixer that’s fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix the whites on medium until they become foamy, which should take 1 to 2 minutes.To separate the egg whites from the yolks, break the eggs against a flat surface. Over a bowl, separate them into two pieces, with the yolks falling into the lower half. Move the yolks back and forth between the halves, so the whites drip into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolks back and forth until all of the whites are removed.
You can beat the egg whites with an electric hand mixer or by hand, though working by hand will take longer. Make sure to use a non-plastic bowl, though, because plastic can retain residue even after cleaning that makes it difficult for the whites to form peaks.

, After the egg whites have become frothy, add ⅛ teaspoon (1 g) of salt to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium until soft peaks form, which should take 1 to 2 minutes.You’ll know that the mixture has reached the right consistency when the peaks that form after you remove the whisk fall over quickly.

, Once the mixture has formed soft peaks, add ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of cream of tartar and ¾ cup (185 g) of granulated, superfine sugar to the bowl with the mixer on medium-low. Mix in the sugar 1 tablespoon (14 g) at a time, though, and wait until all of it has been incorporated before adding more. Continue beating the egg white mixture until you can no longer feel the sugar granules and firm peaks form.Superfine sugar is also known as caster sugar.
Be careful not to get any of the sugar on the sides of the bowl as you add it the mixture. If it does, stop the stand mixer and use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
You’ll know that the mixture has formed firm peaks when they don’t fall over after you remove the whisk.

, Once the sugar is fully incorporated, turn off the mixer. Pour 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract into the bowl. Turn the mixer back on to medium-low, and blend until the vanilla is fully mixed in., After you’ve mixed in the vanilla, turn the mixer off again. Add 4 tablespoons (30 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder to a sifter, and sift it in an even layer over the meringue. Discard any solid pieces from the sifter.If you don’t have a sifter, use can use a fine mesh sieve to sift the cocoa over the meringue. Use clean hands to gently press the powder through to remove any lumps.

, When the cocoa powder has been sifted over the meringue, turn the mixer back on to low. Beat the mixture until the cocoa is just incorporated, which should take approximately 15 to 30 seconds.If there is any cocoa that isn’t blended in after mixing it, use a rubber spatula to gently fold it in. You don’t want to knock too much air out of the meringue by overmixing.

, After the cocoa is incorporated into the meringue, fit a pastry bag with a star tip. Use a spatula to add the meringue mixture to the bag.If you don’t have a pastry bag, you can transfer the meringue to a large plastic zipper bag. Seal the bag and cut off a corner so you can pipe from it.
You can also make mounds of the meringue for the cookies with two spoons if you don’t want to use any type of piping bag.

, With the meringue in the pastry bag, carefully pipe it into spiral mounds on the lined baking sheet to form the cookies. Make sure that the mounds are about 2-inches (5-cm) apart.For the easiest piping, shake the meringue down to the bottom of the bag and twist it so the meringue comes out in a steady stream when you squeeze.

, After you’ve piped the cookies onto the baking sheet, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the cookies to bake for two hours.Be sure to place the cookies on the center rack of the oven so they bake evenly.
The cookies will puff up slightly as they bake.

, When the two hours are up, turn off the oven without opening the door. Let the cookies sit inside the oven for another two hours or until they are completely dry.You may need to leave the cookies in the oven as long 4 to 6 hours. You can even leave them in the unopened oven overnight to be sure that they’re dry.

, When the meringue cookies are fully dry, use a spatula to gently remove them from the baking sheet. Transfer them to a platter and serve.Store any leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature. They should stay fresh for 3 to 4 days.

",How to Make Chocolate Chip Cookies2,",



Use coarser sugar for thicker, chewier cookies. When sugar dissolves, it acts as a tenderizer that interferes with dough structure. This increases spreading because finer sugar dissolves more easily than coarser sugar. So if you want your cookies to remain thick and chewy, use coarse sugar (or use fine sugar for the opposite effect). If you decide to use powdered sugar for extra crispiness, make sure it doesn't have corn starch in it, or you'll get unexpected results.Mix these ingredients until creamy.

",How to Make Chocolate Chip Snowball Cookies," Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Get out a few baking sheets and set them aside. You'll also need a few wire racks set up so you can cool the baked cookies. Get out mixing bowls and measuring cups. Let 3/4 cup (170 g) of butter come to room temperature.You don't need to grease the baking sheets for this recipe since there's so much butter in the cookie dough. The baked cookies should come off of the pan easily.;
, Set the softened butter in a large mixing bowl and add 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Beat the mixture on medium speed until it turns light and fluffy. This should take several minutes. You may want to stop and scrape the sides of the bowl if your beater doesn't scrape against the sides.Creaming the butter and sugar will create volume. Since these cookies don't have any leaveners (like baking soda or baking powder), it's important to beat the butter and sugar until they're light.

, Stop the mixer and add one large egg and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the mixing bowl. Turn the mixer on to low speed and beat the dough until the wet ingredients are completely combined.Avoid mixing in the egg on high speed. This could cause the egg to fly out of the mixing bowl.

, Keep the mixer on low speed and slowly beat in 2 cups (240 g) of all-purpose flour. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl. Pour in 1 cup (125 g) of chopped pecans or walnuts and 1 cup (6 ounces or 175 g) of mini-chocolate chips. Stir the dough until the nuts and chocolate are incorporated.You can refrigerate the dough at this point or shape it into balls for baking.
If you don't want noticeable chunks of nuts in your cookies, you can grind them in a food processor until they're finely textured., Scoop the cookie dough into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls. Roll them gently between your palms to get a perfectly round shape. Set the balls of dough on the ungreased baking sheets.


Ensure that the cookies are about 2 inches (5 cm) apart on the sheets. This gives them space to expand as they cook.

, Put the cookies in the preheated oven and bake them for 15 to 20 minutes. They won't turn very dark or golden, but the bottoms of the cookies will be lightly browned when they're finished baking. You should smell the cookies once they're done. Remove the sheets from the oven and let the cookies rest for 2 minutes.


Don't worry that the cookies are pale. This will just make them look more like snowballs.

, Once the cookies are cool enough to handle, roll them in a dish of powdered sugar. Each cookie should be completely coated to look like a snowball. Set the cookies on wire racks to finish cooling.


If the powdered sugar isn't visible, you can always roll the cookies in powdered sugar a second time.

Add some extra butter to the recipe.,
Don't let them burn.,
Let the cookies sit for a little while.,
Add some applesauce.,
Store your cookies correctly.,
Add a slice of bread.",How to Keep Homemade Cookies Soft," Consider your sugar to butter amount carefully. If you have more sugar than butter, you will usually have a harder, flatter cookie, but if you have a little extra butter, you will have a softer, more chewy cookie. Even though it's a little more calories to add to your system, they will stay much softer.


If you are worried about calories and whatnot, get unsalted butter or put in a little more oil instead.;
, If cookies burn, they will start off hard, not just turn hard. Take them out a little after they turn golden brown. If you make them perfectly, you can keep them soft for a while.



Make sure they're not raw. Just be sure that you don't leave them in too long. Find the perfect time for you to bake them.

, Allow the cookies to cool for about two or three minutes, and after, transport them to a cooling rack for about ten to twenty minutes. By doing this, they can dry quicker and stay fresh. Make sure that they are totally cooled before you put them away.

, If you use applesauce for about one quarter of the amount of oil called for in the recipe, your cookies will stay a bit softer and give your cookies a little fruity taste.

, Keep your cookies in an air-tight container and shut it tight. If air gets in because it isn't closed correctly, the cookies are more likely to harden. Put the container in the refrigerator (it will keep them cold; just be sure to let them defrost for a few minutes before eating them), but shut the container correctly before placing it in.

, This is a classic trick used for many cookies. Adding half a slice of bread to the cookies' container makes them absorb the moisture of the bread and stay fresh and soft. It will become hard in a few days though, so be sure to change it.


Apple slices work just as well, but they will continue to rot, so you will have to change them every day. However, if you aren't adding applesauce to it, it will give it a bit of a fruity flavor.

Set the dry mixture aside once you've mixed them. You'll need to combine:2 1/3 cups (291 g) of all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon of baking soda
1 teaspoon of salt;
, Place 1 cup (230 g) of softened butter, 2/3 cup (133 g) of granulated sugar, and 3/4 cup (150 g) of packed brown sugar into a large mixing bowl. Beat them together on medium speed using a stand or hand mixer. You'll need to beat the butter and sugars for several minutes so they become light and fluffy.Scrape down the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl at least once while you're creaming the mixture.

, Turn the mixer to low and add 2 eggs one at a time. Beat the mixture well after adding each egg. Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and continue beating the mixture until it's completely incorporated.

Avoid adding the eggs and turning the mixture on to medium or high speed since the eggs could fly out of the mixing bowl., Keep the mixer on low speed and gradually add the dry mixture. Once the dry ingredients have been incorporated into the creamed mixture, stir in 1 1/2 cups (262 g) of mini-chocolate chips. Stir the cookie dough well so that the chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough.Mini-chocolate chips work best for making the cones since regular size chips could make it difficult to roll the baked cones.

, Use a measuring cup to scoop out 1/2 cup (140 g) of chocolate chip cookie dough. Spoon the dough onto a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat or parchment paper. This will keep the cookie from sticking to the pan.If you want to make smaller cones, you can use either 1/3 cup (47 g) or 1/4 cup (70 g) of dough.

, Take an offset spatula or spatula and use it to spread the dough into a 6 inch (15 cm) circle in the center of your sheet. Since you'll be using the parchment or silicone to wrap the cookie cone, you'll only be able to place one cookie circle on the baking sheet at one time. You'll have to bake the cookie cones in batches.If you're using less dough, your circles may only be 4 or 5-inches (10 to 12.5 cm) in size.

, Put the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the cookie circles for 9 minutes. The edges of the cookie circles will turn golden brown and appear dry once they've finished cooking. Carefully take the sheet out of the oven and let the cookies cool for 2 minutes on the sheet.If you're making smaller cones, check to see if the cookies are done after 7 or 8 minutes. Avoid over baking the cookies, or they'll be difficult to roll into cones.

, Lay a sheet of parchment paper over the baked cookie circle. The parchment paper should extend beyond the cookie so you can hold the parchment at the edges of the baking pan. Carefully hold both layers of the parchment (or the parchment and silicone mat). Quickly lift the layers up and over so that the cookie is flipped onto the top layer of parchment paper.You may find it easier to hold onto the cookie with one hand while holding the underside of the baking sheet with the other. Flip both of your hands so that the cookie ends up on the parchment layer in your hand.

, Remove the layer of parchment paper or silicone mat so the bottom of the cookie circle is facing you. Cut a circle of parchment paper to fit the cookie circle and place it on the cookie. Set an ice cream cold mold or purchased sugar cone on one end of the parchment circle and roll the cookie onto the mold or cone. Roll the entire cookie circle into the cone shape.You can use the bottom sheet of parchment paper to help you hold the cookie onto the cone.
Avoid letting the cookie circles cool completely before rolling them. This will make it difficult to roll them without the cookie circles cracking.

, Once you've wrapped all of the cookie cones around their molds, let the cones sit for 15 minutes. It may help to lay the cookie cones on their seams so they seal well. They'll cool during this time and take on the shape of the cone mold so it's important to let them set up for the entire time.If you remove the paper too soon, the cookie cones may collapse or fold in.

, Take your finished chocolate chip cookie cones and fill them with scoops of ice cream. Serve the cones immediately. If you'd like to make the cookie cones in advance, just store them in an airtight container for up to several days.Ensure that the cookie cones are completely cooled before you fill them with ice cream to prevent the ice cream from melting.

Choose the right cookies.,
Plan to mail the cookies as quickly as you can.,
Package the cookies shortly after you bake them.",How to Mail Cookies1," If you want your cookies to stay fresh in the mail, then you should avoid sending soft, buttery, or moist cookies, because their moisture will make them more likely to deteriorate. Instead, opt for cookies that are drier and more crisp, such as shortbreads, sugar cookies, biscotti, or crisp gingerbread cookies. Here are some other types of cookies that you can send:Cookies that have a slightly chewy texture, like chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, snickerdoodle, and white chocolate-cranberry cookies.
Macaroons and Pignoli. Though these cookies are more chewy and moist, their textures actually improve after a few days.;
, If you bake the cookies on a Saturday afternoon, then they won't ship until Monday, which means you've wasted almost two full days of cookie freshness. Try baking the cookies the morning of the day you're going to send them, or at least the night before.If you want to consider a faster shipping method, you can also choose to express-ship the cookies through UPS or FedEx, or to send them as Priority or Express mail through your local post office.
If you're mailing them over the holidays, make sure you send them enough days in advance that they get to their recipient before the holiday and don't end up waiting in a warehouse because the mail will be closed for a day or two during the holiday season.

, Once you've baked your cookies, you should let them cool for a while to get rid of any additional heat or moisture and to let them harden a bit. If you package them immediately after you take them out of the oven, you'll be packing them in with the moisture and heat, which will make them spoil faster. But once they've cooled, you should package them as quickly as you can to maximize their freshness."

Cushion each cookie.,
Separate each cookie by type.,
Choose your container.,
Line the container.,
Place the cookies in a container.,
Place the container in a heavyweight cardboard shipping box.,
Address the box.,
Mail it.",How to Mail Cookies2," Take the time to cushion each individual cookie, or each pair of cookies with the flat bottoms placed together. You should use plastic wrap, cellophane bags, or foil to wrap the cookies without leaving any room for air or moisture. You can even wrap them twice if you're using plastic wrap or foil to maximize their freshness., You should pack the crunchy cookies together, and the softer cookies together, or the crunchy cookies will get soft and the softer cookies will get crunchy. You don't need to place them in separate containers to separate them by type, but you should separate them with resealable bags, or even cellophane goodie bags if you want to be fancy.


If you're only shipping one type of cookie, then you can put sheets of waxed paper between the layers of the cookies.

, Use a Snapware container, tin container, or at least a plastic food storage container to store the cookies. The container will need to be able to be sealed tightly with a lid, so if you use a tin container, you'll need to tape around the lid to make sure that the lid doesn't pop off while the container is in transit.

, Once you've chosen your container, you should line it with cookie-cradling packing materials, such as crumpled waxed or parchment paper, crumbled up newspaper or thick paper, bubble wrap, or foam peanuts. You can also stuff resealable bags with real popcorn and use that as stuffing, so the recipient will receive an extra treat as well as an even more buttery and delicious-smelling package.If you want the cookies to stay fresh, then you'll need to use to package the cookies tightly so that they don't have room to bounce around or fall apart.
On the other hand, make sure you don't pack them too tightly, or they'll get squished and will lose their original texture.

, Once you've individually wrapped the cookies and separated them by type, you should place them in the container, so that they're surrounded by the stuffing. Once you've placed them in the container, you can use stuffing to fill the top of the container and to fill any empty holes, as long as you don't seal the container too tightly. Then, seal the container with tape or tie it tightly with ribbon.

, If the container doesn't fit snugly into the box, then add more bubble wrap, foam peanuts, crumpled newspaper, or any other stuffing material to keep the container from shifting -- try to have at least 2 in. (5 cm) of stuffing around the sides of the container. Try lightly shaking the box once you've filled it with stuffing -- if you hear the container bouncing around, then you'll need to use more stuffing. Write the recipients address inside the box for extra measure, in case the outer address is lost.When you're done, seal the box with packaging tape.
Write ""Perishable"" and ""Fragile"" on all sides of the box.

, Write the recipient's name and address, as well as your own name and address, on the box, and include the correct amount of postage. Most likely, you'll need to take it to the post office to mail it and find out the postage fee, unless you requested a special shipping service.

, Once you've packed the cookies in the box and addressed it, there's nothing left to do but to mail the cookies to your recipient -- whether it's through your local post office, Fed Ex, or UPS, and wait to receive a call about how amazing the cookies were.

Separate your cookies with wax paper if you need to layer them in a container.,
Put different types of cookies in different containers.,
Freeze your cookies if you want them to stay fresh for as long as half a year.",How to Keep Cookies Fresh,"


Tight lids keep moisture out of the container and can keep cookies from becoming too soggy to eat.;
,


The traditional cookie jar is a good example of this type of container. The little ventilation that cookie jars allow can keep the cookies hard and crisp.

,


Keeping wax paper in between cookies prevents cookies from sticking together and crumbling when you try to remove them.

,


Avoid the temptation to store cookies of all types in 1 container. Doing so increases the likelihood that scents and flavors will transfer.

,


Before freezing cookies, be sure to wrap them in freezer-safe plastic and place the cookies in an airtight container. This procedure protects against freezer burn, preserves flavors, and guards against the unwanted absorption of scents of other foods in your freezer.

Eliminate saturated fat from your baked goods by replacing butter or margarine with other ingredients.,
Replace your all-purpose flour.,
Reduce the salt in the recipe.,
Add healthy ingredients to simple cookie recipes.,
Cut down on the granulated or brown sugar in your recipes.,
Use dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet or milk chocolate.",How to Bake Healthy Cookies1," Butter is considered healthier than margarine and most shortenings because it contains fewer trans fats than these other solid fats. You can try the following replacements for healthier cookies:


If a cookie recipe calls for butter or margarine, replace up to half of it with the same number of tbsp. of olive oil, coconut oil or canola oil. Replacing the butter completely is likely to change the taste and texture too much for most palettes.
If a cookie recipe calls for butter, margarine or shortening, replace it with a fruit puree. Applesauce and pureed pumpkin are popular choices. If it is a fruit cookie recipe, try replacing up to half of the butter with fruit puree. If it is another type, replace 1/4 to 1/3 of the amount of butter, margarine or shortening.
Replace 1/4 to 1/3 of the fat with fruit juice, buttermilk or non-fat plain yogurt. Start with low amounts and work your way up, since these no-fat ingredients can make cookies less moist.
Use a mix of different replacements. You will always use some butter in a recipe that calls for it, in order to give it the same taste; however, you may want to experiment with your favorite ingredients. Perhaps you will use 1/2 the quantity of butter and replace the other half with equal parts coconut oil and applesauce.;
, Bleached, refined white flour has almost no nutritional value, while adding a lot of calories. Consider using 1 or a few of the following high-fiber items instead:


Replace a portion of your all-purpose flour with oats. If you like chewy oatmeal cookies and you don't mind varying their texture, the added fiber will increase the nutritional value and benefit to your digestive system.
Grind oats into flour and use them as a replacement. This method will allow you to replace the all-purpose flour with high-fiber oats, but it will not change the texture quite as much.
Replace all or some of the flour with whole wheat flour. Make sure it is 100 percent whole wheat. If you don't mind a slight change in flavor, consider replacing all-purpose flour completely with this healthier flour in your cookie recipes.
Add 2 to 4 tbsp. (15 to 30 g) of ground flax seeds to your flour mixture. They contain omega-3 fatty acids and high fiber content, making your cookies more nutritional.
Replace up to 1/2 cup (63 g) of flour with almond meal. This will increase the protein content, as well as the fiber content, of your cookies.

, You can still maintain the flavor of your cookies with no more than 1/2 tsp. (6 g) of salt in the recipe. Experiment with using 1/4 tsp. (3 g) for extra healthy cookies.

, Using seeds, nuts, dried fruit and unsweetened coconut in the place of chocolate chips or sprinkles will improve the healthfulness of the cookie. Keep in mind that it is may not decrease the calories, although it will add nutritional value.

, The best way to go about making cookie recipes better is to train your palette to eat something that is slightly less sweet. Yet, there are also some replacement options if you like your cookies sweet.


Cut some sugar and add more spices. This is not a simple replacement; however, you can increase the flavor by adding cinnamon, nutmeg or ginger. Then, reduce your granulated sugar amount by a fourth.
Replace granulated sugar with very ripe fruits. Try overripe apples and bananas, which become very sweet near the end of their shelf life. Try creating a puree and adding it to your wet ingredients.
Replace the sugar with agave nectar or honey. Agave nectar is sweeter than honey, so you may want to reduce the amount you replace slightly when using this ingredient.

, Look for bars or chips with at least 70 percent cacao. This chocolate is filled with antioxidants and often contains fewer calories.


You can also substitute carob chips in place of chocolate chips. This legume is often used because it has a mild chocolaty flavor. Using it will increase fiber and reduce calories. You can order these from natural food stores online, if you cannot find them in your town.
If you cannot find dark chocolate chips at your supermarket, buy bars of chocolate and chop them up.

Serve your cookies.",How to Bake Oatmeal Cookies," It’s key that the butter has been softened to room temperature first so that it is easy to mix in.You can combine the ingredients by hand, or use a mixing bowl to blend them all together more quickly (and without the elbow grease). Continue blending the ingredients together until they are thoroughly blended into a creamy texture.






;
, Crack and add one egg into the mixture, and stir it thoroughly. Then, add your second. Once both eggs are blended into the mixture, add a teaspoon (4.93 mL) of vanilla extract. Continue mixing.







, You can use a fork to mix all of these dry ingredients together easily. Once they’re thoroughly blended, add them to the creamy mixture.








The easiest way to do this is to add a bit of the dry mixture, mix it all together, add a bit more of the dry mixture, mix it again, and so on. It’s a slow and steady process!

, If you want to add a little something extra to your oatmeal cookies – and if your arm isn’t completely exhausted at this point – then add in some delicious mix-ins. Common additions are raisins and chocolate chips. You can also add things like cranberries, coconut flakes, chopped nuts, or anything else that sounds good to you.Don’t be afraid to get creative.









If you want to try several variations, feel free to split up the dough into chunks and try all different mix-ins!

, After you’ve created your dough, cover it and pop it in the refrigerator for at least an hour before baking.By chilling the dough, it’ll thicken up a bit before baking and you’ll create really chewy, thick cookies.You’ll have to be patient, but the finished product will be worth it.

, Once you’re almost ready to take the cookie dough out of the fridge, preheat your oven so it will be hot by the time you’re ready to bake. Set your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, or 190 degrees Celsius.It will probably take your oven anywhere from ten to twenty minutes to get hot enough.








, Once your cookie dough has chilled for an hour or so, it’s time to form them into balls. You can use your hands to create the balls, or you can use a tablespoon or an ice cream scoop to do this. Create rows of the cookie dough balls on baking sheets, leaving about two inches of space between them.








If you’d rather have thicker, chewier cookies, leave the dough as is. If you’d prefer thinner, crunchier cookies, flatten out the balls slightly with your fingers or by pressing down on them with a fork coated in sugar.This recipe makes about 24 cookies, although you may make a bit more or less, depending on how big you make the dough balls.

, The exact cooking time is a matter of personal preference, but the general range is about eight to ten minutes.If you like chewier, softer cookies, take them out earlier. If you like your cookies crispier, leave them in for the full time.








, It’s important to remember that while the cookies are still hot, they will continue to bake even out of the oven, especially while on the hot cookie sheet. If they seem a little bit soft or undercooked when you first pull them out, they will likely firm up while they sit. After cooling on the baking sheets for about five minutes, you can transfer them to another surface, or a wire rack if you have one.








If you do not have a cooling rack, you can place your cookies on another sheet of wax paper or parchment paper on your kitchen counter.

, Once they’re fully cooled, you can put your cookies into cookie tins or boxes to give to friends or bring to parties. If you’ve created several different variations using mix-ins, it’s helpful to label what each kind is. Don’t feel obligated to share the deliciousness though!

Use coarser sugar for thicker, chewier cookies. When sugar dissolves, it acts as a tenderizer that interferes with dough structure. This increases spreading in much the same way as baking soda does as described in the previous step because finer sugar dissolves more easily than coarser sugar. So if you want your cookies to remain thick and chewy, use coarse sugar (or use fine sugar for the opposite effect). If you decide to use powdered sugar for extra crispiness, make sure it doesn't have corn starch in it, or you'll get unexpected results.Mix these ingredients until creamy.

This will make your cookies much more firm and keep them from spreading out in the oven.


This means that you'll have to warm up the butter enough to work with it by placing it on the counter, rather than in the microwave. Absolutely never melt it in order to mix it into the dough.
A great practice is to cool your dough in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out.;
, If your recipe calls for butter and doesn't specifically prohibit this practice, you should always ""cream"" the butter and the sugar first. This is a process by which you mix the two until a sort of paste is formed.

, Sweet cream butter tends to make cookies taste too sweet. The salt will balance out the sweetness of the cookie just enough to make it taste much better over all. You won't be able to properly taste the salt, but believe us, you'll notice the difference.

, If you find a recipe that you love the taste of but what a different texture, it is totally possible to alter the recipe just a bit in order to get exactly what you want! Experiment, or try these tricks:


Use cake flour, shortening instead of butter (or switch for part of the butter), or ~2 teaspoons of cornstarch with 4 teaspoons LESS flour in order to get fluffy, cakey, soft cookies.
Use 2 tablespoons of milk, an extra tablespoon or two of butter, or switch your white sugar for brown to get a crispy cookie.
Use melted butter to mix dough and then chill it before baking (undercook a minute or two) to get a chewy cookie. You can also use only yolks, instead of whites.
Using a rubber spatula often helps speed up the mixing process if you are not using a machine.

, If you find that you still struggle with getting your recipe to turn out right, bake like the pros (and Europeans!) do and weigh your ingredients. Get a good electronic kitchen scale and do your recipe based on weight. This will help ensure the perfect cookie.

, If you want to make sure that every cookie in a batch turns out looking the same, use an ice cream scoop to get perfectly equal balls of dough.

, Skip the Silpat in favor of parchment paper. Silpat can make it difficult for cookies to cook evenly and it also keeps the bottoms from developing that perfect crispness. Parchment paper turns out a much better cookie.

, If you notice that the cookies at the edge of your sheet are prone to getting over cooked, use an Round or oval pan. If you don't have one, improvise and flip the pan over to use the bottom!

, Every oven is different and it is important for you to know how yours behaves. If you know what to expect, then you can find ways to work around the expected problems.


For example, if you notice that cookies on one corner or side bake faster than in another, make sure you turn the pan part-way through the baking process.

, Put your baking sheet in the fridge to cool before you put each set of cookies on. If you want to save time, you can scoop the dough onto parchment paper and store them in the fridge until they are ready to go out on a cooled pan.


This means cooling the pan between each set of 12 too!

, If anything it's better to under-bake them. For the first batch carefully watch them and time for when they get the first hint of brown at the edges. Edge browning usually means you've gone too far, though these cookies are still perfectly good (especially if you like yours crispy!). Once you know how long it takes to reach that point, pull them out maybe 30 seconds before they brown for perfectly soft cookies.


If you are using white chocolate chips in your cookies, be careful, as they can burn particularly easily.

, Let your cookies sit on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. This will let them firm up on the bottom, making them much easier to eat.

, To convert almost any cookie recipe for a vegan diet, the main ingredients you'll have to worry about are the butter and the eggs. The butter is easily replaced with shortening (this often makes a better cookie anyway!) but if you want to avoid the awful egg substitute, try this instead:


Add 1 tbs of oil, 1 tbs of cornstarch, 2 tbs of soymilk and 1 tbs of ground flax seed in place of each egg called for in the recipe. If it calls for only yolks, go easy on the milk and oil.

, If someone has a bad lactose intolerance, you can easily replace the butter with shortening. Any milk called for can be replaced with lactose-free milk, soy milk or more exciting options like hazelnut milk!

, If someone has a peanut allergy, you can replace ingredients like peanut butter with almond butter or Nutella (yum!). Just make sure that no other ingredients have had contact with the peanut butter.


Make sure, for example, no one has EVER used a knife to get some peanut butter out of a jar and then used that same knife to get some Nutella without cleaning in between. To be safe, get a new jar.

, Replacing flour in recipes is easy, but you have to keep a few things in mind. For things like cookies, you'll want to err on the low-protein side, since you want them to be soft. You also want to mix different types of wheat flour substitutes. When using these substitutes, it is also necessary to add a slightly larger amount of liquid.

, This is tricky, since it's the carbs as much as the sugar which causes the problem for diabetics. Try to make protein heavy cookies (like peanut butter cookies with high-protein alternative flours instead of normal flour) and switch the sugar with some Splenda or other sugar alternative (honey is good!).

, To make your recipes even more inventive, try different varieties of chocolate chips, like white, milk or bittersweet.

, Whole grain oats add a heart-healthy element to this popular treat. To make them gluten-free, substitute oat flour for the all-purpose flour and make sure that your oats are labeled gluten free. You can also add raisins, walnuts or butterscotch chips to your oatmeal cookie recipe.

, For a nutty treat, make peanut butter cookies. These make a great breakfast snack, with the extra protein boost!

, These sugar cookies get a wonderful crunch and sweetness from being rolled in cinnamon and sugar before they are baked. The secret to great snickerdoodles is to hand-mix the ingredients instead of using a mechanical mixer.

, Ginger snaps get their flavor from molasses and ground ginger. To dress these cookies up, drizzle them with a lemon glaze.

, These light and fluffy coconut cookies are free of both flour and egg yolks. You can also use food coloring in these cookies to customize the macaroons for a variety of occasions.

, Decorating gingerbread people is a favorite holiday tradition in many households. These cookies make a delicious blank palette for a variety of candies, colored glazes and frostings.

, Basic sugar cookies are delicious on their own and form the basis for many more complex cookie recipes. You can either cut sugar cookies out with a cookie cutter and frost them for the holidays or make drop sugar cookies.

, These German Christmas cookies incorporate the flavors of an herby gingerbread and lemon. For a different flavor profile, try chocolate Lebkuchen.

, These cookies are shaped using a cookie press, which is an easy-to-find and affordable investment. Decorate the cookies with colored sugar or sprinkles to make them more festive.

, For a Scandinavian Christmas, try using marzipan in your cookies. This gives the cookies an intense almond flavor.

, A combination of chocolate sugar cookie dough and regular sugar cookie dough, stacked and rolled together, creates these delicious and colorful pinwheels. You can customize the color of the plain dough for any special occasion.

, Vary this recipe by using different colors and flavors of Jell-O. These cookies are a great way to welcome kids into the kitchen.

, If you’re a bacon lover, make these chocolate chip cookies that incorporate bits of bacon into the dough.

, Adding green food coloring to your chocolate chip cookie dough gives these cookies a delightful green tint. You can serve these cookies on St. Patrick’s Day, Easter, Christmas or any day.

, Oreo cookies rolled in batter and deep-fried make a sinful treat. You can serve a plate of these cookies with either ice cream or a big dollop of whipped cream.

, Cocoa powder, melted chocolate and chocolate chips make these no-bake cookies irresistible. You will need to set aside some time to chill these cookies, but the results will be worth the wait.

, Chocolate and marshmallows are always a winning combination, particularly for moon pie lovers. These delectable cookies are filled with marshmallow filling and then dipped in melted chocolate.

Check on the cookies to make sure they have been adequately baked at the higher temperature.

",How to Adjust a Cookie Recipe for High Altitude," This will add too much air to the cookies. With high altitude baking, the low air pressure causes the air bubbles to expand faster. The cookies will rise quickly and then collapse, making them dry and brittle.


If your cookie recipe calls for egg whites, only beat them to a soft-peak.;
, (12 to 36 g) for each cup (191.6g) used. Reduce the sugar by 1 tbsp. (12 g) at 3,000 feet (914.4 m), 2 tbsp. (24 g) at 5,000 feet (1,524 m) and 3 tbsp.(36 g) at 7,000 feet (2,133.6 m).

, (0.47 g) to 1/4 tsp. (0.94 g). Reduce baking powder by 1/8 tsp. (0.47 g) at 3,000 feet (914.4 m), 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. (0.47 to 0.94 g) at 5,000 feet (1,524 m) and a full 1/4 tsp. (0.94 g) at 7,000 feet (2,133.6 m). Metric reductions for baking soda are 0.54 to 1.07 g.

, Add 2 to 3 tbsp. (29.6 to 44.4 ml) of water for every cup (99.4 g) of flour used at 5,000 feet (1,524 m). Increase it a further 1 to 2 tbsp. (14.8 to 29.6 ml) at 7,000 feet (2,133.6 m).


If you are cooking at 3,000 feet (914.4 m), it is not necessary to increase the liquid unless your recipe calls for a large amount of flour.

, The batter will set faster in a higher temperature and retain a moist center. This step will also save the cookies from being too dry because they aren't under the hot element for very long.

, This will depend upon how long the cookies are supposed to bake as cookie recipes can call for cook times ranging from 5 to 20 minutes.

If the recipe calls for 1 cup of butter, margarine or shortening, use equal portions of margarine and shortening.,

,
For perfectly sized cookies, roll into balls and flatten slightly right before baking.,
Use Air-Bake pans or stoneware, which bake the cookies best.,
Remove the cookies from the sheet very soon after baking and add new ones right away.",How to Bake Chewy Cookies," For instance, if it calls for a cup of butter, use 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup margarine.;
,, Equally sized cookies will cook the most evenly. I make my balls about 1 1/2-2 inches in diameter for most drop cookies. For peanut butter kiss cookies (the ones with Hershey Kisses in the center) make them much smaller and cook them for a much shorter time.

, Cheap cookie sheets (and even some of the Wilton expensive ones or my mother-in-law's stainless steel) seem to burn the edges for me. I find too that with each new oven I prepare cookies in, I have to play with the temperature and perhaps in some very poor ovens, rotate the pan to prevent unequal cooking. The goal is to get a golden crust on the outside and a soft middle. Not so doughy that it falls apart when you take it off the sheet, just doughy enough to stay soft. This optimum can be reached by playing with the temperature. (keep in mind most ovens don't change instantly to setting changes) I find 375 works better then 350, but this might be a variable you have to play with. The margarine helps with this too; I find butter makes the cookies sometimes too runny, which could likely be resolved with additional flour if your heart is set on butter.

, With the ball method, you can roll them all at once and it makes this step very fast. I cool the cookies for about 10 minutes on cooling trays or aluminum foil. Wax paper tends to leave wax on my counters, so I wouldn't suggest that.

",How to Bake a Successful Batch of Cookies or Biscuits," This will omit any surprises about ingredients or methodology. Don't assume that because it seems like another recipe you've used that it will be! You should also be aware of any items that need to thaw or reach room temperature before use and plan accordingly.;
, The oven must be at the correct temperature before placing the cookies or biscuits into it. Know how long your oven takes to reach the temperature advised and plan accordingly.

, Doing so can cause the mixture to turn too greasy and this makes it very hard to work with.

, Too much additional flour added to the biscuit or cookie dough will unbalance the recipe, possibly making the cookies or biscuits tougher. Better yet, use a rolling pin that doesn't stick.

, This means that both size and thickness should be the same for the entire batch to ensure even cooking.

, The best for cookies are the trays which have air pockets between them or flat, heavy ones. Visit a good kitchenware store for advice and choice.

, Otherwise, use sunflower oil as this won't burn while they bake.


Many cookies or biscuits will be oily enough to not need greasing of the sheet or tray.

, The ideal space between each cookie or biscuit is 2 inches/5cm.

, This isn't essential for all ovens (again, know your oven) but it helps the air to circulate more freely for the cookies or biscuits as they're baking. If you're using more than one sheet or tray at a time, divide the oven into thirds.


Move the cookies and biscuits to the top shelf if they're not browning within the time required. They can be left there for up to 5 minutes of the remaining baking time but keep a good eye on them to ensure they don't over-brown.

, See How to Cool Cookies and Biscuits for more information.

You can make a basic sugar cookie cutout dough from scratch, buy a sugar cookie cutout dough mix, or buy some premade sugar cookie cutout dough in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.Prepare the dough according to the recipe or package instructions before you get started.
It is best to use cold dough because it will hold its shape better when you cut it out. Make sure that you refrigerate your dough for at least an hour before you use it.
You will probably need to preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a common temperature for many cookie recipes. However, it is important to check the cookie recipe or cookie dough package before you set the temperature on your oven.;
, Use a rolling pin to roll out the cookie dough on a floured surface. Sprinkle the cookie dough with a bit of flour as well before you begin rolling it out. Add more flour as your roll out the cookie dough to prevent the rolling pin from sticking to the dough.








Roll the dough so that it is between 3/8” to ½” thick., When you finish rolling out the dough, use your cookie cutter to cut out the cookies. You can cut the cookies into circles or use different cookie cutter shapes. To get as many cookies as possible from the dough, cut the cookies close together.








When you can’t cut out any more cookies from the rolled out dough, roll the dough scraps back into a ball and then roll it out flat again. Keep doing this until the dough is gone or you can’t cut any more cookies from the remaining dough scraps.

, Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or grease it with non-stick cooking spray. This will help to prevent the cookies from sticking to the tray. Arrange the cookies so that they are about an inch or two apart., After you have arranged the cookies, insert the sticks into the cookies from the side. Push the sticks in far enough so that they reach the centers of the cookies. This will help to ensure that the cookies will stay on the sticks after you bake them.








You can use some plain flat sticks, or try using colorful cookie pop sticks to make your cookies on a stick look a little more interesting.
If the cookies are too thin to insert your sticks into, then you can also press the stick halfway into one side of your cookie and then use a bit of extra dough to cover the stick., Follow your recipe’s instructions for baking the cookies. A common baking time for cookies is about 10 minutes. However, your recipe may call for a longer baking time. Check the recipe or cookie dough package to be sure.Set a time so that you will know when to take the cookies out of the oven.
Don’t forget to use oven mitts when you place the cookies in the oven and when you remove the tray from the oven.

, After the cookies have finished baking, wait for them to cool. You can place them on a cooling rack or leave them on the cookie tray. However, it is important to wait until the cookies are completely cool before you start decorating them or the frosting may melt.


While you wait for the cookies to cool. You can mix the frosting or prepare the other toppings.

, You can use store bought frosting or make a simple buttercream frosting to frost the cookies. Open your frosting package or mix up your frosting. You can also add food coloring to your frosting if you want it to be colorful.








Try adding a couple of drops of blue food coloring to a batch of buttercream frosting for a light blue frosting, or add a drop or two of red for a pale pink frosting.
Use a spatula to spread frosting over your cookies. Cover all of the cookies in a ¼” to ½” layer of frosting, depending on how much frosting you want to have on them.
Frosting is easier to work with when it is at room temperature. Do not put your frosting in the refrigerator. If the frosting is cold, then you can let it sit at room temperature for about an hour to warm up.

, After you have frosted your cookies, you can add sprinkles and candies to decorate them. Try using candies and sprinkles to make designs on the cookies and to add color to them.








For example, you could use candies to make faces on your cookies, or arrange the sprinkles in the shape of a flag or another symbol.

, Wrap your cookies if desired. If you plan to give these out as favors at a party or as gifts, then you can wrap each cookie individually with a food-safe cellophane bag or with some plastic wrap. You can also tie a small ribbon around the stick near the base of the cookie for a little extra flair."
"
Measure carefully.,
Mix the wet and dry ingredients as little as possible.,
Check the baking soda or baking powder carefully.,
Mix the dry ingredients first.",How to Make Cookies1," This is the golden rule of cookie baking. Follow the recipe to the tee (you can always experiment with later batches, testing how alterations affect the final product) and take the time to learn how to use measuring spoons and cups properly.;
, You only want to mix the ingredients just enough so that the ingredients are moistened. Over-mixing will allow too many of the gas bubbles from the baking soda or powder reactions to escape, while also developing the gluten in the flour, resulting in dense, tough cookies.>

, Using inactive baking soda or powder can ruin a batch of cookies. Test baking soda by adding a little bit of vinegar, or baking powder by adding it to hot water. If the mixture doesn't bubble, throw it out and purchase a fresh box or bag., This is especially important with the baking soda or baking powder to ensure that it's evenly distributed and make sure that you don't end up with big holes in your cookies.Also, since baking powder is activated by water, you would want to wait until the last minute before mixing the wet ingredients so that the baking powder doesn't ""run out of juice"" too early on in the process.This is why recipes will generally have you mix the ingredients separately in two different bowls first.

"
"
Add a little extra baking soda for thinner, crisper cookies.,
Use coarser sugar for thicker, chewier cookies.,
Use butter that's at room temperature.,
Use shortening or corn starch to get a fluffier cookie.",How to Make Cookies2," Adding .25 to .5 ounce (5 to 15 grams) per 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of cookie dough will increase the pH of the dough, which weakens the structure and lets the dough spread more easily while it's baking. But be careful because adding too much baking soda can increase browning, leaving a salty-chemical off flavor, and make the eggs in the mixture turn grayish-green!, When sugar dissolves, it acts as a tenderizer that interferes with dough structure. This increases spreading in much the same way as baking soda does as described in the previous step because finer sugar dissolves more easily than coarser sugar. So if you want your cookies to remain thick and chewy, use coarse sugar (or use fine sugar for the opposite effect). If you decide to use powdered sugar for extra crispiness, make sure it doesn't have corn starch in it, or you'll get unexpected results. Not pretty!, You want to keep your butter as cold as possible at all times. Put it make in the fridge after mixing all of your wet ingredients and then in the fridge again before putting on the baking sheet. Butter that is too soft will make for flat, melty cookies., If you want a cookie that's a bit fluffier and cake-like, use one of these two ingredients. Switching the butter out for shortening will give cookies a better texture, and make them a little healthier. You can also add 2 teaspoons of corn starch in place of 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of the flour to get fantastically fluffy cookies.

"
"
Put the cookies on a room temperature or cool cookie sheet.,
Use a liner.,
Make evenly sized cookies.,
Check the cookies.,
Allow cookies to cool after removing from the oven.",How to Make Cookies3," Using a hot baking sheet will cause the dough to start to melt prematurely. Grease the cookie sheet with vegetable shortening or unsalted butter -- don't use vegetable oil because it'll burn between the cookies, and that's not a pleasure to clean. Some cookie dough recipes, however, have a lot of shortening or butter in it already and may not need to have the cookie sheet greased at all., Use a parchment paper or Silipat lined baking sheet for ease of cookie baking. The baking sheet is easier to clean and will not suffer from greasy build up, if either is used while baking. Another plus is the cookies can be carefully removed from the baking sheet by pulling the parchment paper carefully from the cookie sheet and placing it on a cooling rack. The cookie sheet can be lined again with parchment paper and another batch of cookies can be baked.

, Use a cookie scoop or measuring spoon to make sure drop or shaped cookies are all the same size. The cookies will bake evenly and taste better.

, A time range is often given in a recipe, so once you reach the short end of the range, stick a toothpick right in the center of a cookie, and pull it out quickly. If little or no cookie sticks to the toothpick, they are done. Depending on amount of cookie left on toothpick, adjust cooking time accordingly.

, It is best to either let the cookies cool on the sheet, or to move them to a cooling rack. If you do not have a cooling rack, just turn a large plate upside down, and place the rack on top until it cools. Once the cookies have cooled slightly, remove them from cookie sheet to prevent them from sticking and breaking later.

;
, Pour the egg whites into a dry metal mixing bowl. Use a hand mixer or a whisk to rapidly beat the egg whites and salt together until the egg whites become frothy.








Make sure the bowl you use is clean and dry. Even a drop of water or another substance in the mixing bowl can prevent the egg whites from achieving the right texture.
Don't beat the egg whites too long before adding the sugar. Beat with the salt just until they become frothy, then move on to the next step.

, A teaspoon at a time, add the sugar as you continue beating the egg whites. The whites should begin to stiffen and form soft peaks. Keep beating them continuously.








, Incorporate the cream of tartar and vanilla. Continue whipping the mixture until the egg whites become glossy and stiff.









When you can tip the bowl upside down without anything coming out, your meringue has reached the right consistency.
At this stage you may gently fold in some chocolate chips, cocoa nibs, fruit bits, or another mix-in if you desire.

, Place each individual meringue an inch or so apart. Repeat until you've used the entire mixing bowl full of meringue.









For pretty meringues, fill an icing bag fitted with a star-shaped tip with the meringue mixture. Pipe individual meringues onto the baking sheet.
Sprinkle the meringues with sugar, cocoa powder, or another topping if you desire.

, The tray should be placed in the center of the oven to ensure the meringues cook evenly.








, Letting them cool in the oven preserves their delicate texture. Wait 1 - 2 hours, or until they are completely cool, before removing them from the oven. Remove them from the oven when they are cool.








, They are ready to eat as soon as they have cooled. Serve them immediately or store them in an airtight food storage container for up to 4 days.








, Spread your favorite filling on the flat side of a meringue, and press a second meringue on top to create a delicious sandwich cookie. The following fillings are popular choices to serve with meringues:









Chocolate ganache. The rich, dark chocolate flavor is an excellent contrast to fluffy sweet meringues.
Whipped cream. Keep the dessert light with a sweetened whipped cream filling.
Fruit jam or fresh fruit. Fresh strawberries or raspberries, or strawberry or raspberry jam, make delicious meringue fillings.

, The meringue mixture itself can be flavored with extract and brightened with food coloring for a unique dessert. Mixing in bits of fruit or chocolate is another way to add some character. Consider these combinations:









Flavor the meringues with orange extract, add a few drops of orange food coloring, and mix in some candied orange bits.
Mix some cocoa powder into the meringue batter and fold in mini chocolate chips.
Flavor the meringues with pistachio extract and top with crushed roasted pistachios.

, Create candy cane stripes by painting the meringues with strips of food coloring after you pipe them onto the baking sheet.

Add ground oatmeal to your cookie recipe.",How to Add Oatmeal to Chocolate Chip Cookies1,"


One way to enjoy all the flavor and nutritional benefits of adding oatmeal to a chocolate chip cookie recipe is by adding ground oatmeal. Ground oatmeal will act much like flour, so it is important to substitute the amount of flour with ground oatmeal. Every cookie recipe is different, but swapping out 1/4 of the flour for an equal amount of ground oatmeal will not change the texture of the cookie. Add the ground oatmeal to the flour and prepare the recipe as directed.;
"
"
Add the correct kind of oatmeal to your recipe.,
Exchange nuts for oatmeal.,
Add oatmeal to the cookie dough.,
Cook as directed.",How to Add Oatmeal to Chocolate Chip Cookies2,"


All oatmeal is not created equal. There are varieties of different cuts of oats, but for cookies you want to use rolled oats. A rolled oat is an oat that has been flattened into a flake, and then lightly steamed and toasted. It will retain its texture and shape through the cooking process. Do not add instant cooking rolled oats; they will just turn to mush. Any other form of oat will be hard and very difficult to chew.

,


Adding too many rolled oats to the recipe will result in a cookie that is dense and dry. Adding too few to the recipe and you'll barely know they are there. The key to adding oatmeal to the recipe is balance. Every recipe is different; if your recipe calls for nuts, then you can simply exchange the measurement of nuts for oatmeal. The same can be done for dried fruit or any other addition.

,


Every cookie recipe is different; therefore it is important to slowly integrate the oats so as to not overwhelm the recipe. At the same time that you add the chocolate chips to the recipe, add 1/4 cup (2 oz.) of rolled oats. Thoroughly combine and look at the dough. If the oats are hard to find and there seems to be very few of them distributed throughout the dough, add 1 additional quarter cup (2 oz.) and remix. Unless your cookie dough recipe makes more than 3 dozen cookies, 1/2 cup (4 oz.) of oatmeal should be plenty. Add more oats if the batch of cookies is doubled or produces a higher yield.

,


Continue to portion out the dough and cook the cookies as your recipe directs. Check the cookies 3 to 5 minutes prior to the estimated cook time as the rolled oats may expedite the cooking process.

, Pour the chocolate chips into the bowl. Heat until melted, stirring occasionally. Stir in peppermint oil to taste, typically about ¼ tsp (1.25mL). Remove from heat.


You can use any type of chocolate, but larger chunks may require special tempering.
Alternatively, replace both ingredients with mint-flavored chocolate chips, ""bits,"" or ""melts.""
You can replace the oil with 1 tsp (5mL) peppermint extract, but this tends to have a weaker flavor.

, You can bake your own thin, crisp chocolate cookies, using the recipe below. For a quicker thin mint, just use one of these storebought options:


Graham crackers (chocolate graham crackers match the color of thin mints)
Unsalted snack crackers (Ritz crackers)
Chocolate sandwich cookies (Oreos) with the filling removed

, Ideally, use a pair of kitchen tongs to avoid breaking the cookies. Gently dip the cookie or cracker into the melted chocolate, submerge it, and pull it out again.


If you don't have any tongs, you can spoon the chocolate directly onto the cookies.

",How to Make Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies,";
,


Use coarser sugar for thicker, chewier cookies. When sugar dissolves, it acts as a tenderizer that interferes with dough structure. This increases spreading because finer sugar dissolves more easily than coarser sugar. So if you want your cookies to remain thick and chewy, use coarse sugar (or use fine sugar for the opposite effect). If you decide to use powdered sugar for extra crispiness, make sure it doesn't have corn starch in it, or you'll get unexpected results.Mix these ingredients together until creamy.

,, Add the milk to achieve a smoothly blended dough. There shouldn't be any clumps of flour or lumps of butter. Make sure all the ingredients are evenly distributed through your dough. After blending the mixture, add the chocolate chips. Mix them in.

, Alternatively, line the pan with wax paper.

, The ball will flatten when cooked so try to visualise the size of your finished cookie when you form the balls of dough. Make 24 balls of dough.

,, This will leave distinct ridges and flatten the cookie neatly.

, Don't overdo the cooking, as they'll continue to cook for a short while after you remove them from the oven.

, Be careful not to burn yourself on the melted chips when transferring the cookies to the rack - use a spatula. The cookies are ready to eat when the chocolate chips solidify again.

",How to Bake Cookies on Your Car Dashboard," For best results, park your car in a sunny spot.;
, You will have to keep your car doors and windows closed throughout the baking process. Ensure that the car is parked somewhere clean and away from the exhaust of other cars that are running.


Take your air freshener out of the car first. It might contaminate the cookies, and you won't need one afterwards when your car smells like fresh baked cookies.

,


You could use a sprayed surface but beware that this could cause the cookies to spread.

, Do either of the following:


Cut a log of pre-made cookie dough into even rounds. Place the rounds onto the cookie sheet, leaving about 1½"" (4cm) of space around each cookie.
If you haven't purchased pre-made cookie dough, make the dough from this recipe (as was done for this article) or use your own cookie recipe (preferably egg-free, to avoid any potential for problems of not baking the egg sufficiently). Arrange each cookie on the baking sheet, adding blobs about tablespoon wide and leaving some space around the cookies to allow for spread.

,


Use a spatula or a fork to flatten the cookies, if needed. They may be fine without this.
Cover the cookies with plastic-wrap if not baking immediately and keep in the refrigerator until needed. Don't make the dough too far ahead of use though, use within a few hours.

, Gently push into place on the dashboard.


Place a thermometer next to the cookie sheet on the dashboard. You want to make sure that your car temperature reaches at least 165 °F (70 °C) to kill any germs that were present in any raw ingredients., You can expect the cookies to begin baking immediately but unlike baking in oven, it's advised to hang around and keep an eye on things as this is far more experimental than standard baking.

, The cooking time will vary depending on the temperature inside your car. Your cookies will set, but they won't brown much because the car isn't hot enough to caramelize the sugars in the cookies.

, Open the car door to check your cookies when they begin to look set. Touch the edges and the centers. The edges should be firm, and the centers should be set but not gooey.


Try to slide a cookie from the parchment paper. If the cookie is done, it will come off of the paper easily. If the cookie is not done, it will stick to the paper.
Close the car door if not done yet. Continue to check on the cookies every 15 to 30 minutes until they are done.

, Remove the cookies from the sheet with a spatula and place them on a wire rack to cool completely, although they won't be as hot as when they're removed from the oven.

,


Combine these dry ingredients quickly and loosely in a large bowl — make sure there's a little extra space for the wet ingredients you're about to add.

,


For ideal texture, use a technique called ""cutting in"" to add the butter to the mixture. While the butter is still cold, chop it into small pieces and toss each piece separately into the mixture. Coat each piece with the dry ingredients, then use a pastry mixer, two knives, or your fingers to break the butter pieces up.

,


Stop stirring when the dry ingredients are well-combined — it's possible to over-stir, giving the biscuits a tough, crumbly quality.,


Turn the dough onto surface sprinkled with Bisquick or flour.
Knead the dough about 10 times. Don't knead excessively — as with stirring, this can affect the texture of the biscuits.
Roll the dough about 1/2 inch thick. To prevent the dough from sticking to the roller, you can sprinkle it with flour or bisquick.
For a crunchier crust, skip the kneading and rolling and simply drop biscuit-sized spoonfuls directly onto the baking sheet.

,


If you don't have a biscuit cutter, either use a knife to cut squares or cut rounds with an upside-down drinking glass.
A little flour or extra Bisquick on the knife or glass will help keep things from sticking.

,


Leave about an inch or two of space around each biscuit on the cookie sheet. This ensures the biscuits will heat from all sides evenly.

,


Check on your biscuits while they cook — cooking times may vary slightly based on the oven being used.
Note that cooking times increase slightly at high altitudes.,


After removing the biscuits from the oven, loosen them from the tray with a spatula so they don't stick.
After about a minute, transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack. The biscuits are ready to eat when they are cool enough to handle.

Mix the ingredients loosely in a large bowl — you're looking for a roughly uniform mixture, but it's not necessary to spend lots of time mixing here.

,


To get an even mixture without having to combine the ingredients too thoroughly, first make a ""well"" in the middle of the bowl by pushing the dry ingredients to the sides.
Pour the milk into the ""well."" Fold the dry ingredients into the well several times to mix well.

,


As mentioned above, it's a good idea to avoid stirring more than necessary to preserve the light, fluffy texture of the biscuits.

,


Unlike the biscuits above, here, we're going for a slightly crispier, denser product. Instead of rolling the dough thin, use a spoon to grab balls of dough and drop them onto the sheet a few inches apart from each other.
Though the balls of the dough can vary slightly in size, you're aiming for each ball to use about a tablespoon of dough for each.

,,


To save time, combine these ingredients while the biscuits are baking.

,


Take the biscuits out of the oven when done and transfer to cooling rack. Before eating, use a brush or paper towel to give each a thin coat of the butter/garlic mixture.
Sprinkle biscuits with parsley flakes before serving.

As noted above, you're looking to simply combine these ingredients loosely in a large bowl — lots of stirring isn't necessary.

,


Make a ""well"" with your dry ingredients in the center of your bowl and pour the cider in. Fold the dry ingredients over the wet center portion just until the entire mixture is moist.
Add the apple pieces all at once and fold the dough several times to incorporate.

,


If you'd like walnuts in your biscuits, add them now, folding the dough several times to incorporate just as you did with the apple pieces.

,


As above, each spoonful should use about one well-rounded tablespoon of dough, though there is no ""correct"" size.

,


Keep a close eye on your biscuits and be willing to adjust your baking time as needed until you get a crisp texture — these will usually take slightly longer to cook than the other recipes in this article.

,


Transfer baked biscuits from cookie sheet to a cooling rack. Biscuits should be ready to eat after about five minutes or when they are cool enough to handle.
For an extra hint of sweetness, sprinkle your biscuits with a pinch or two of sugar before serving.

,
Allow to cool and serve.",How to Make Bisquick Biscuits4,",


This recipe is designed to be quick to prepare, to use just a few ingredients, and to be deliciously light and fluffy. Though the addition of soda may seem odd, the light texture it creates makes these biscuits a favorite for many.
Start by incorporating the Bisquick and sour cream loosely in a bowl. Stop when you produce a smooth, uniformly moist mixture.

,


At this point, the dough will be quite soft — much more so than it would be in the recipes above. This is normal for this recipe.

,


Note that this step is virtually identical to the equivalent step in the Basic Biscuit recipe above except that the dough is rolled to a slightly greater thickness.
Turn the dough onto surface sprinkled with Bisquick or flour.
Knead the dough about 10 times. Don't knead excessively — as with stirring, this can affect the texture of the biscuits.
Roll the dough about one inch thick. To prevent the dough from sticking to the roller, you can sprinkle it with flour or Bisquick.

,


As above, you may use the rim of a glass or jar to get perfect circles if you don't have a cookie cutter.

,


Spread evenly along the bottom and sides. Having a little extra butter is OK.


,


The biscuits may touch each other in the pan. For this recipe, this is OK — the biscuits will be especially soft and fluffy at the points where they touch.

,,


Allow the biscuits to cool in the pan (you may set the pan on a cooling rack if desired.) After about 5-10 minutes, use a metal spatula to separate the biscuits along their edges and serve.

Stir well.,
Reheat as needed.,
Coat the molds with cooking spray.,
Transfer the syrup into a pastry bag, if desired.Only add about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of melted isomalt to the pastry bag.,
Pour or squeeze the syrup into the molds.,
Let the syrup set.,
Use as desired.",How to Use Isomalt," Fill a large bowl or shallow baking dish with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of water and a handful of ice.


Note that the bowl needs to be wide enough to fit the bottom of the saucepan you'll be using.
You can also use this ice water in case you accidentally burn yourself during the cooking process. If you burn yourself with the metal saucepan or the hot syrup, simply dunk the burned area into the bowl of ice water to immediately stop the damage.;
, Place the isomalt crystals in a small to medium saucepan. Pour the water into the saucepan, as well, and stir the two ingredients together with a metal spoon to combine.


You only need enough water to wet the isomalt. When combined at this stage, the contents of the saucepan should look like wet sand.
If you need to alter the amount of isomalt, make sure that you change the amount of water, too. Typically, you need three to four parts isomalt for every one part water.Use distilled or filtered water. Tap water contains minerals that can cause the syrup to turn yellow or brown.
The saucepan and spoon should be made of stainless steel. Avoid using a wooden spoon since previously absorbed material can seep into the syrup and give it a yellow tint., Set the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. The contents should reach a steady boil; do not stir or disturb them until they do.


Once the contents reach a boil, use a nylon pastry brush to scrape excess off the sides of the pan and back into the main mixture. Do not use a natural bristle brush for this.
After cleaning the side of the saucepan, attach a candy thermometer to the side. Make sure that the ball of the thermometer touches the hot syrup, not the bottom of the pan.

, If you want to add food coloring to the isomalt syrup, this is the ideal temperature to do so. Add the number of drops needed to achieve your desired color depth, then stir the food coloring into the boiling syrup using a metal mixing spoon or skewer.


Don't worry if the mixture gets stuck at around 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius) for a little while. At this temperature, the excess water is boiling out. The temperature will not climb further until this water boils out.
Expect the mixture to bubble rapidly when you add the food coloring in.

, In order to create isomalt glass or similar isomalt decorations, the liquified syrup must be allowed to reach this temperature. If it does not, the structure of the isomalt may not be altered enough to allow the decoration to set properly.


You should actually remove the saucepan from the heat when the thermometer reads 333 degrees Fahrenheit (167 degrees Celsius). The temperature will continue to climb after that, even if you try to quickly stop the melting process.

, Once the isomalt reaches the correct temperature, quickly transfer the saucepan to your prepared dish of ice water. Stick the bottom of the pan inside the water for 5 to 10 seconds or so to stop the temperature from climbing further.


Do not let any of the ice water get inside the saucepan.
Remove the saucepan from the water as soon as the hissing sounds stop.

, Isomalt pours best at about 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius), so you should keep it warm in the oven until you are ready to use it to prevent the syrup from cooling too much.


The oven should be set to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius).
Keeping the isomalt syrup in the oven for 15 minutes will usually help it achieve its ideal pouring temperature. During this time, the bubbles will also have time to escape from the syrup.
You can keep isomalt in the oven for up to three hours. If you store it longer, the mixture can begin to yellow.

, Make sure that they are evenly spread out to promote even melting.


If using isomalt sticks instead of nibs, break the sticks in halves or thirds before placing them in the dish.
Isomalt nibs and sticks come in clear forms and pre-colored forms. If you want to create a colored creation, use pre-colored nibs.
Since melted isomalt can get very hot, using a dish with a handle may make it easier and safer to handle the melted syrup. You could also use silicone baking dishes or bowls since silicone is fairly heat resistant. If you use something without a handle, however, consider placing the dish on a microwave-safe plate to limit the amount of contact you'll need to have with the dish itself.

, Continue microwaving them in this manner until the entire batch has been melted down.


Note that air bubbles will naturally form as the isomalt melts.
Use oven mitts to protect your hands while handling a dish of hot isomalt.
Stir the melting isomalt with a metal skewer or similar utensil. Avoid wooden utensils.
It takes an average of one minute to melt roughly five nibs. This amount of time can vary depending on the strength of your microwave and the size of the nibs, however.

, Stir the melted isomalt one last time to remove as many air bubbles as possible.


You must make sure that all of the bubbles are out of the melted isomalt before you try to use it. If there are bubbles in the syrup, there will be bubbles in the finished decoration.

, If the isomalt begins to harden or set before you have a chance to use it, you can simply reheat it in the microwave by putting the dish in and reheating it in additional intervals of 15 to 20 seconds.


You should be able to let the melted isomalt sit out for up to 5 or 10 minutes before it starts cooling.
If additional bubbles begin to form, stir the isomalt to help release them.

, Spray an even layer of nonstick cooking spray into each mold, giving each one a thorough, even coat.Use a dry paper towel to clean off excess cooking spray from the top of the molds.
Make sure that the molds you use are labeled for use with isomalt or sugar-based hard candy. The high temperatures you'll be working with could melt molds that are not durable enough.

,


Adding more could cause the bag to weaken or melt. Adding too much can also cause burns.
Using pastry may can make it easier for you to work with the melted isomalt, but many find the step to be an unnecessary one.
Do not cut off the tip of the pastry bag before adding the isomalt. Leave the tip intact for now.
Make sure that you still continue to wear oven mitts while handling the pastry bag. The heat of the melted isomalt can still burn you through the bag.

, Place just enough melted isomalt into each mold compartment to fill it.


Only cut the tip of the pastry bag when you are ready to fill the molds. The isomalt will pour out quickly, so you'll need to be careful.
Regardless of how you pour the melted isomalt, you should let it pour out in a thin stream. Doing so will minimize the number of bubbles that form.
Lightly tap the bottom of the mold on a counter, table, or other hard surface to release any bubbles from the syrup after you fill the molds.

, Depending on the size of your molds, the isomalt should harden into a stiff decoration within 5 to 15 minutes.


Once the isomalt cools, it should naturally pull away from the sides of the mold. You should be able to simply tip the mold on its side and watch the pieces tumble out.

, The isomalt decorations can be stored in airtight containers or used immediately.


If you plan on sticking the decorations to something like a cake, apply a little corn syrup or melted isomalt to the back of the decoration using a toothpick, then stick the decoration onto the cake. It should remain in place without any difficulty.

Take a repair kit with you.,
Have someone care for the cake during its transportation.,
Avoid refrigerating a cake.",How to Transport a Decorated Cake," Most cakes are fairly solid and strong, so the cake itself will be fine provided it's well packed and not able to slide about on its journey.;
, Avoid anything too large, as the cake might slight and hit the sides. By the same token, don't squish the cake in unless you don't mind the frosting rubbing off.

, That way, you can transport them separately and be assured that they'll arrive intact.

, Bring along icing/frosting tubes, additional decorative elements and anything else needed to effect good touch-ups.


This kit could contain such items as a royal icing bag, extra sugar paste, extra decorations such as additional fondant figurines, etc.

, This is a great job to assign to your kids who are old enough to be responsible. Have them sit in the backseat with the cake alongside them. They can keep an eye out for sliding, bumps and any hairy corners.


If the cake is extra large, it's helpful to have another pair of hands to help you carry it safely.

, You might think it's a great idea to toss a cake into the car refrigerator but cakes need to remain at room temperature and in as dry conditions as possible. By all means put on the air conditioner if you, your occupants and the cake are melting but mostly try to keep the air temperature even.

",How to Make a Cookie Bouquet," If you want a literal “bouquet” of flowers, for example, then you will need to purchase flower-shaped cookie cutters. You will also need to purchase appropriate colors of food coloring for your cookie designs.;
, You can choose, for instance, a coffee mug, a small basket, a small bucket or a small plant pot. In addition to the container, you will need to purchase florist foam. You’ll insert your favors and cookie sticks into the foam to hold them into place.

, If you want to paint it, or if you want to purchase items to glue onto the container, then you will need to purchase those items in advance from a craft store or discount store. Alternatively, you can choose to leave the container “as-is.”

, Choose a larger size as opposed to a smaller size because this will work better in the bouquet. Alternatively, you can choose a variety of sizes to create additional detail.

, This will give you a point of reference to use while you decorate your cookies with glaze.

, For instance, you may want to place Easter grass or confetti at the base of the bouquet or insert additional favors into the bouquet.

, You can use either a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment.

,,,,, Continue adding the dry ingredients, 1 cup at a time, until they are all incorporated into the mixture.

, You can sprinkle some flour on a cutting board, a piece of wax paper or a clean countertop.

,,,,, These will guarantee that your dough has the right thickness.

, When your rolling pin pushes the dough down enough so that the pin is directly on top of the paint stirrers, you will know that your dough is 1/2” thick.

,, This will keep it from adhering to the dough as you cut out your cookies.

, Cut out as many shapes as you can from the dough, dipping the cutter in flour as needed to prevent sticking.

, You can always use the paint stirrers as a guide.

,,, Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and then line it with parchment paper. The spray will help the parchment paper to adhere to the baking sheet because the paper tends to curl up during longer baking times.

, Try to keep the sticks parallel to the work surface so that they don’t poke through the back of the cookie.

, With your reserved dough, make small patches. You may need to lightly moisten your dough with water so that the patches will stick. Gently press the edges of the patch down so that it blends with the surface of the cookie.

, Create an alternating pattern with the remaining sticks. For instance, the top cookie should be in the right hand corner of the baking sheet with the stick pointing to the left. Place the next cookie on the left side of the baking sheet, parallel to the first cookie, with the stick pointing right.

, Leave about 1” (2.5 centimeters) of space between each cookie stick.

, Watch them carefully throughout the process; the thicker cookies make the baking time a little trickier. You should remove them from the oven when the edges of the cookies begin to darken.

,, Transfer the cookie sticks to wire racks to cool. You will be able to fit more cookies onto the rack if you lay them out in the same alternating pattern that you used on the baking sheet.

,,, Add just a small amount of food coloring to each bowl. If you want a deeper shade of color, then continue adding food coloring a few drops at a time. Stir the glaze, check the color, and add more food coloring if needed.

, You want the glaze to have the consistency of cold honey so that it is easy to spread over the surface of the cookies. If any of the glazes are too thick, then add a teaspoon of milk and whisk it into the glaze.

, Pipe some glaze around the edge of the cookie, leaving a small border between your glaze line and the edge of the cookie. This step creates a border for your background color. In a sense, this is like tracing a picture before coloring it with crayons. The border will ensure that the rest of your glaze doesn’t go “outside the lines.”

, If you need to spread it out a bit, then use a butter knife or a cheese spreader but be careful not to spread it beyond the piped border that you created earlier.

,,


For straight lines, circles or other solid shapes, continue to use the plain tip.
To make stars, attach a star tip to the pastry bag. The tip should have a slightly smaller opening than your plain 3/4"" tip. Place the tip perpendicular to the surface of the cookie. Squeeze the bag from the top, releasing some glaze, and then pull the bag upward to create the star.
To create a fluted ribbon or border, use the star tip. Hold the pastry bag at a 45-degree angle to the surface of the cookie. Steadily release the filling as you pull the bag along the surface of the cookie to create the fluted design.

,,,, This row will be the tallest row.

, Push the sticks down into the foam so that the decorations and cookies are slightly lower than the back row.

,, Either attach the card to the container or attach the card to the stick and insert the stick into the florist’s foam.

,,,,"
"
Prepare the piping bag.,
Unscrew the two parts in the coupler.

,
Push the large part of the coupler as far down as it will go into the narrow end of the bag.

,
Pick up the chosen size of tip.,
Finally, to secure the tip, push the smaller part of the coupler down the tip to the tip's wide end and firmly twist the small part of the coupler onto the bigger part through the plastic.

,
Fill the bag.,
Start frosting.",How to Pipe Decorations on Cake," Hold the bag up so that the wide end is pointing up toward you.;
,,, Push it onto the end, narrow end pointing down.

,, If you're using multiple colors of food coloring, which you probably are, you can separate your frosting into bowls and add the food coloring. Remember only to put in two or three drops of coloring, depending on how dark you want your color. Always try to make a little more frosting than you think you'll need, for each color. It's also a good idea to leave a little frosting white too, just in case.

, There are a couple different ways to do this:


To make peaks, use an open-star tip. Fill the bag and gently press the end of the tip against the cake. Lift the bag up, squeezing the middle of it moderately hard. When you reach halfway up the peak, release your grip on the bag. This will take a couple practice tries but you'll get the hang of it soon, so don't be discouraged.
Making straight lines is completely easy. Just drag the bag gently across the surface of the cake, remembering to keep squeezing the bag. Keep your hand as steady as possible so as to not make the line shaky. Spread a thick layer of light colored icing, preferably white, across your cupcake. Now fit the bag with a #2 tip and a coupler.

Carefully pipe several thin lines in parallel to each other across the surface of the cupcake.
Drag a toothpick perpendicularly to the drawn lines across the toothpick. Don't let the toothpick touch the actual cupcake, just halfway down into the icing. Also, if you want a very swirly effect, you can do the first couple steps up to the drawn lines and then instead of dragging the toothpick across in straight lines, do it in circles or some other crazy pattern.

Knead the sugar paste.,
If the kneading doesn't work out, try adding a tiny bit of vegetable fat.,
If the kneading and the little addition of vegetable fat hasn't helped, get your dough hook into action.,
When rolling sugar paste out, run a palette knife under it every few rolls to help stop it from sticking.,
Always leave extra room when covering a cake.",How to Make Sugar Paste More Pliable," Before trying to add anything, give the sugar paste a good knead. It may be all that is needed.;
, Use white vegetable fat, as this will match the color of the sugar paste. As with any cooking, add only a very small amount first; you can always increase but not reduce additions.

, Add the paste to the bowl and let the dough hook process it briefly.

, It can even stick to a dusted surface, so use this trick often.

, Aim to have more sugar paste than the cake size when covering the cake. This means that you will have room for error, as extra length can be trimmed off."

Practice the strokes and learn the correct amount of pressure to use.,
Use a toothpick to map out a specific design on your base coat of icing.,
Imprint a reference design using a cookie cutter.,
Chill the frosting in between applications of different designs or different colors.",How to Pipe Frosting Neatly," Too thick, and the icing and piping will be too hard to spread and can rip the surface of the cake. Too thin, and the results will be too runny and hard to control. Also chocolate and other ingredients used in the icing can affect how it behaves, as well.
, These gel paste coloring kits are thicker than the liquid colorings which can make your original icing thinner, which can cause problems., Couplings are the hard plastic ""caps"" on the pastry bag that hold the tip to the bag. The tip is the thing that makes the icing come out in different shapes, thicknesses, etc. Having these allow you to change different tips without having to transport icing from one pastry bag to another., It's tempting to want to start frosting but putting icing on a warm cake or cookie will cause the icing to melt and start oozing all over the place. Also, applying icing or frosting on a warm cake will result in visible cake crumbs or the iced surface., Every icing job requires a smooth base for the other icing to stick on to. This is a slightly chilled buttercream that is applied with a straight icing spatula. Warm buttercream slips and slides off the sides of the cake and cold buttercream cracks and can be hard as a rock making it difficult to lay on correctly., Skipping this step will result in ""peeling icing,"" which reveals the cake beneath., Different tips will result in different shapes and thickness of the icing., Hold the bag tip down. Cuff (bring the bag top over your hand). Use the other hand to fill the bag with a spatula scraping the edges of the spatula against the bag to release the icing. If your prefer, you can also cuff the bag top over a tall glass or plastic container and fill the pastry bag with icing using the spatula. Do not fill the bag more than half way., With thumb and index finger of the other hand press the bag tightly to remove air pockets, forcing the icing into the bag and decorating tip. Much like squeezing toothpaste out of the tube., Hold the bag properly. For right handers, place your right hand on top. The right hand is your squeezer and your left hand is the steerer. Left handers, place the left hand on top and right hand on the bottom. For lines and writing hold the bag straight up. For the other designs hold the bag at an angle., This varies among individuals and is like squeezing the correct amount of glue on paper for a project. You can practice using parchment paper. Write letters on a piece of paper and use that under the parchment paper as guide., Poke holes in the icing to create a reference for a design. If you make a mistake, just take a spatula and swipe the holes away and start again., Gently press the cookie cutter into the base icing and follow the design lines as you pipe on the icing., This ensures less damage to designs on the cake or cookie already on and also helps to avoid bleeding of colors from one color to the next."

Cover the petals with sugar.,
Place the petals on the cooling rack to dry completely.",How to Make Sugared Rose Petals," For the sugared rose petals, you’ll need 2 to 4 organic roses. Carefully pull the petals from the flower, working slowly so you don’t tear them. Collect the petals on a plate or in a bowl.Be sure to use pesticide-free roses so they are edible.
If there is a white area at the base of the petals, you should cut it way. It usually has a bitter taste that makes it unpleasant to eat.;
, After you’ve removed the petals from the roses, fill a large bowl with cool water. Gently rinse the petals in the water to remove any dirt or debris that may be lingering on the surface.It’s best to rinse the petals only a few at a time.
Handle the petals gently as you wash them because they may bruise if you are too rough.

, Once the petals are clean, set them out on a kitchen towel. Let them sit for 20 to 30 minutes so they dry completely.If you’re short on time, you can dab the petals with a towel to help them dry more quickly. Be gentle, though.

, To set up an area for the sugared rose petals to set, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Next, place a cooling rack on the baking sheet and set it aside for the moment.You can line the baking sheet with wax paper or foil if you prefer. The liner just makes cleanup easier in case any sugar or liquid drips off the petals as they set.

, Add the egg white from a large egg to a small bowl. Use a whisk to beat the egg white lightly and set it aside for the moment.To separate the egg white from the yolk, break the egg against a flat surface. Separate it into two halves over a bowl, allowing the yolk to fall into the lower half. Move the yolk back and forth between the haves so the white drips out into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolk until all of the white has dripped out.

, After you’ve beaten the egg white, place a shallow dish beside it. Add ½ cup (100 g) superfine sugar to the dish, spreading it out into an even layer.Superfine sugar is also known as caster sugar.
If you don’t have superfine sugar, you can place regular granulated sugar in a food processor or blender, and pulse it until it is finely ground but not powdered.

, When the egg white and sugar are ready, lift the petals one by one with a pair of tweezers. Next, use a small, soft bristled paint brush to carefully coat both sides of the petals with the egg white.If you prefer, you use the tweezers to dip the petals in the egg white directly.

, After the petals are coated with the egg white, place them in the bowl with the sugar. Turn them over with the tweezers to ensure that the sugar coats both sides.If the petals aren’t fully covered, you can sprinkle a little sugar directly on them so they’re evenly coated.
Be sure to shake off any excess sugar before leaving the petals to dry.

, When the petals are completely covered with sugar, place them on the wire cooling rack on the baking sheet. Let them sit for at least 8 hours so they have time to dry and harden.It’s best to leave the sugared petals in a cool spot to dry.

, Add ½ cup (118 ml) of water and ½ cup (100 g) of fine sugar to a small saucepan. Heat the mixture on medium and stir it until the sugar dissolves.You can make more simple syrup if you have to extra to use for cocktails and other recipes. Use a 1:1 ratio of water and sugar.

, Once the sugar has dissolved, turn the heat up to high. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes., After the syrup has come to a boil, lower the heat back to medium. Allow it to simmer for another 3 minutes so it has time to thicken up.Stir the syrup periodically as it simmers to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, When the syrup is finished simmering, remove the pan from the heat. Carefully transfer it to a bowl and let it cool completely, which may take up to an hour.It’s important to ensure that the syrup is cooled completely because it can wilt the petals if it’s too hot.

, While the simple syrup cools, add ½ cup (100 g) of superfine sugar to a shallow dish. Use a spoon to spread the sugar out in an even layer., Once the syrup has cooled completely, dip a pastry brush into it. Carefully brush both sides of the petals one at a time with the syrup to coat them fully.You can also use a small paintbrush to coat the petals with the syrup.

, When the petals are coated with the syrup, place them one at a time in the dish with the sugar. Turn the petals over in the sugar to ensure that they’re covered on both sides., After you’ve coated the petals in the sugar, set them down on the cooling rack on the baking sheet. Let the petals dry for 6 to 8 hours or until they harden completely.Store the sugared rose petals in an airtight container. They are best used within 7 to 10 days.

Mix the royal icing.,
Assemble a piping bag and fill it with royal icing.,
Arrange snowflake patterns under waxed paper.,
Pipe the icing snowflakes.,
Sprinkle the snowflakes with glitter and let them dry.",How to Make Edible Snowflakes1," Put 4 cups (500 g) of powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons of meringue powder, and 6 tablespoons (88 ml) of warm water into a large mixing bowl. Use an electric hand or stand mixer to combine the ingredients on low speed. Once the powdered sugar is wet, you can turn the speed up to high. Beat the royal icing for 5 to 7 minutes. The icing should be stiff and glossy.Royal icing keeps its bright white color and doesn't require any additional cooking to hold its shape.;
, Get out a piping bag and attach a #10 tip. Set the bag into a large bowl so the tip points down. Scoop the royal icing into the piping bag. Place a moistened paper towel over the tip when you're not piping the snowflakes. This will keep the icing from hardening in the tip.If you don't have a piping bag, you can use a plastic food storage bag. Just fill the bag with the royal icing and snip off a bottom corner. Keep in mind that you won't have as much control over piping the snowflakes.

, Lay a sheet of waxed paper or parchment paper on a baking sheet. Print off a page of snowflake designs that you like and slide the print underneath the waxed paper or parchment paper. You should be able to see the snowflake designs through the paper.If you're comfortable with piping, you could pipe the snowflakes without using printed designs. Just pipe the snowflakes directly onto the parchment or waxed paper.

, Remove the moist paper towel from the tip of the pastry bag and pipe over the snowflake designs. Pipe the longest lines of the snowflake before moving on to the smaller lines of the snowflake. If you make a mistake, dip a small paintbrush in water and smooth out any mistakes.Although you're tracing the snowflake designs, the snowflakes will be on the parchment or waxed paper.

, Once you've piped all of your royal icing snowflakes, use a small paintbrush to brush each snowflake with water. They should be completely coated with the water. Sprinkle the snowflakes with edible glitter before the water has a chance to dry. Let the glittered snowflakes dry completely before you remove them from the paper. Use your snowflakes once they've hardened.If you don't have edible glitter, you can use granulated or decorative sugar.

Use multiple bags of icing to create multicolor swirls.",How to Pipe a Cupcake," Frosting will dry out and harden if exposed to air, so don't let it sit around while you wait for your cupcakes to finish. A thick buttercream frosting will be best for creating your decorations. Frosting or icing recipes which only use powdered sugar and liquid are more difficult to pipe due to their thinner consistency.


If you need to store your frosting, or you have a lengthy decorating session planned, keep any frosting you're not using in an airtight container.
If your frosting develops hardened lumps, add a few drops of milk or water at a time, stirring them in to see if the hardened lumps mix into the rest of the frosting.;
, Piping bags, also called pastry bags, are canvas or plastic cones with a hole at the tip to squeeze the frosting out of. If you don't own one, you can easily make your own following the instructions in this linked article. You can use a rectangular plastic bag (such as a ziploc bag) and cut a hole in one corner, or cut out a large, long triangle of parchment paper and wrap it in a circle to make a cone.


If you use parchment paper, make sure to fold the corners down or tape the outside layers together to prevent the bag from falling apart.

, You'll need one of these metal decorating tips or nozzles so the frosting comes out evenly. Make sure to use large or jumbo nozzles if you want to create a typical cupcake swirl. Regular sized nozzles, or a tiny hole in the bag with no nozzle at all, can create intricate designs but not the thick, decorative swirls used for most cupcakes.


You might be able to find the most common large piping tips, the Wilton brand 1M and Wilton 2D, at craft shops.If you want to try different types of swirls, you may need to find other tip designs in online stores.
Tips with round holes produce a design that looks like smooth soft-serve ice cream. Star-shaped holes make rippled or ruffled swirls, and you can buy them in many designs depending on which pattern you like best.

, Tip couplers are screwed around the bag so you can easily remove one tip and switch to a different tip design. First drop the smaller ring section into the bag, then screw the larger ring onto it from the outside of the bag, holding the bag in place. A piping tip can slot into the outer ring and easily removed when it is time to switch









Use a large-sized tip coupler to match the large piping tip. The tip should slot easily and firmly into the coupler.

, Point the decorating tip nozzle downward and push it to the narrow end of the bag. The nozzle should poke through the hole in the end but be held in place by the walls of the bag. Cut a larger hole if necessary, but don't worry if it's not a perfect fit; the icing should hold the tip in place.







, Put the bag nozzle-side down into a tall cylindrical container. This will steady the bag while you fill it with frosting. If you're using a plastic or canvas bag, you can fold down the edges outward for easier access to the base of the bag.









See the Tips section for a less messy method of filling your pastry bag using plastic wrap.

, Frosting is the right thick consistency for a pastry bag, whereas icing is thin and liquid based, and might run through the nozzle before you squeeze. Either way, filling the bag is likely to create mess, so go slowly.









If the spoon is making a mess or the frosting keeps sticking to it, try using a spatula instead., Continue to fill up the bag, pressing the frosting lightly against the bottom of the bag to remove air bubbles. If you don't pack the frosting firmly enough, you will have gaps and unsightly air bubbles in your frosting.









Roll up the folded edges of the bag bit by bit whenever you need more room for frosting.
Do not fill the bag too full, especially if it's a delicate parchment paper bag.You'll need some room to tie it off and squeeze. An overfilled bag is difficult to control., Twist and hold the top end of the bag so you can squeeze it without frosting flying out the top. Try to twist right above the frosting to minimize the amount of air that might get mixed into it. You're now ready to move on to the decorating.









For greater convenience, use a rubber band to tie it shut., If you've never used a piping bag before, you might want to begin with something less important than your beautiful cupcakes. First practice by following these instructions over a plate or piece of parchment paper. If you'd rather get started sooner, you might still want to squeeze a short line of frosting out on a plate so you can get past any air bubbles trapped at the bottom.









The instructions below remain the same whether you're decorating a cupcake or just practicing on another rounded or flat surface.

, Make sure the top of your bag is tied or twisted as described in the last section. Push most of the frosting up to the top of the bag until you're left holding a small handful of frosting at the base of the bag. Twist the bag above this amount so the rest of the frosting doesn't fall through.Now you only need to squeeze a much smaller, more manageable amount of frosting. You'll be able to decorate for longer without your arms tiring, and you'll have more control over your decoration.










Warning: Do not attempt this with a parchment paper bag. It will fall apart or break. If you find the parchment paper bag tiring to use, try filling it only half full of frosting or less.
Untwist the bag and push additional frosting to the lower area whenever you start running out of frosting. You should have enough frosting in that handful to decorate at least one cupcake.

, You will be using one hand to hold the bag upright and squeeze out the frosting, placing it around the handful of frosting you just separated from the rest. Use your other hand to guide the bag. You can guide the bag by grasping the top of the nozzle and pushing it like a pencil, or by holding your first hand and helping it to move steadily and evenly.


Some people find it easier to hold the bag with the dominant hand, while others prefer to use the non-dominant hand. Try out both methods to see which one feels more precise., The nozzle of the decorating tip should be between 1/4 inch (1.25 cm) and 1/2 inch (2.5 cm) above the surface you're decorating.You can try lifting or lowering it by tiny amounts to see which distance creates the most attractive design, but don't push it against the cupcake's surface. That will most likely create a smeared or sloppy looking design.


If you are decorating a cupcake with a special shape, or the side of a cupcake, keep the bag at a 90º angle to the side it is decorating. The bag should be horizontal when decorating a vertical surface.

, An even squeeze with the hand around the bag should produce a dot or star on the cupcake's surface, depending on which design of piping tip you are using. The squeeze should be slow and even, but hard enough to produce a steady flow of frosting.









Read the next few steps before you begin so you know where to move the piping bag. Piping in one motion will make your design even and attractive.

, Maintain the same pressure on the bag to deploy the frosting at an even rate. Without lifting the bag, circle tightly around the central frosting dot until it is completely surrounded.Don't leave any space between the circle and the central dot.









If your cupcakes are large or your piping tip is small, you can spiral outward to create a second circle around the first. It's easier to make a stable swirl if you don't go too near the edge, however.

, When your circle is finished, move the piping tip higher up and slightly inward. Spiral inward to create a smaller circle on top of the first. Complete the spiral by moving the piping tip inward to the center.








Again, maintain a steady pressure on the bag and guide the piping tip at the same, steady rate.

, It's important to release all pressure from the bag before lifting it from the cupcake. If you stop squeezing, then lift the bag in a vertical line, your swirl will end with an attractive decoration.This will be a star shape of some kind for most piping tips, or a small point for simple, round piping tips.








, There are several variations of the basic cupcake swirl described in the Piping the Cupcake section. They have slightly different appearances and use different amounts of frosting, but don't require any additional techniques.









Start near the outside edge instead of at the center, and spiral inward and upward. This looks almost identical to the basic swirl, but is easier to pipe on a small cupcake.
Start at the center and spiral outward. Stop when you complete a circle near the outside edge. This uses less frosting and creates a flat rosette design., A French or French swirl piping tip design deploys the frosting in high, thin ridges. You can hold the bag still above the center of the cupcake, then squeeze as you watch the frosting spread evenly outward on top of the cupcake.








This technique works best on small cupcakes, since the frosting won't spread out evenly past a certain distance.

, A petal piping tip has a thin, teardrop shaped nozzle. This is more difficult than the standard cupcake swirl method, and works best if you hold the bag at a 45º angle from the cupcake's surface. Keep the nozzle vertical with the wider end nearest the cupcake. Spreading a small amount of frosting over the cake with a knife might help keep your petals from falling over.








First squeeze while moving in a tiny circle a the center of the cupcake to create a cylinder of frosting. Stop squeezing, then move the bag away.
Squeeze the bag just long enough to deploy frosting in a small U shape, with the bend of the U resting against the cylinder. Move the bag up as you reach the bend of the U and down again as you move to the other leg of the U.
Continue making U shaped petals outward in a spiral pattern until you cover the cupcake in petals. Remember to stop squeezing before you move the bag between making petals.

, You can use this trick with any piping design to create a swirl of two or more colors. You'll need three or more plastic or canvas pastry bags, not temporary parchment paper ones. A large tip and tip coupler (see Preparing to Pipe) will make this much easier. For best results, use different colored frosting of the same type, not completely different recipes that may squeeze out at different speeds.








Put each color frosting into its own bag. Only put a small amount of frosting in each, no more than 1/2 the usual amount at most. Tie or twist each bag as usual.
Flatten each bag of frosting and stack them on top of each other. Press down to get a triangle shape and place each bag on top of the last.
Cut off the bottom 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of each bag. If there's already a hole large enough to squeeze a line of frosting through, you can skip this step.
Place the stack of bags inside a larger bag with a piping tip attached. Push the stack of bags evenly to the bottom. Now, when you squeeze the larger bag, each bag inside will squeeze out a different colored line of frosting through the piping tip.

Arrange snowflake patterns under waxed paper.,
Chop and melt the white chocolate.,
Fill a piping bag with the melted chocolate.,
Pipe the white chocolate over the snowflake designs.,
Decorate the snowflakes and let them harden.",How to Make Edible Snowflakes2," Lay a sheet of waxed paper or parchment paper on a baking sheet. Print off a page of snowflake designs or a single large snowflake that you like and slide the print underneath the waxed paper or parchment paper. You should be able to see the snowflake designs through the paper.If you're comfortable with piping, you could pipe the snowflakes without using printed designs. Just pipe the snowflakes directly onto the parchment or waxed paper.

, Get out a 7 ounce (200 g) block of high-quality white chocolate.Chop the chocolate into small chunks. Place the chunks or chips in a small saucepan and that can fit on top of a larger saucepan. Pour an inch of water in the larger saucepan and heat it until it simmers. Set the smaller saucepan with chocolate over the water and stir it until the chocolate melts.If you don't want to chop the chocolate, you can use white chocolate chips instead of the block.
Choose a high-quality white chocolate that lists cocoa butter in the ingredients.

, Use a rubber spatula to scoop the melted chocolate into a piping bag. You can use any tip you like although the melted chocolate won't show great detail once it's piped. If you don't have a piping bag, you can use a plastic food storage bag. Just snip one corner of the bag so you can squeeze the chocolate out.It may help to place the bag inside a large bowl or tall glass while you fill it with chocolate. Tuck the edges of the bag over the sides of the bowl or glass so they don't fall down with the weight of the chocolate.

, Gently squeeze the piping bag or plastic bag so that the white chocolate slowly comes out of the tip or corner of the bag. Use the melted chocolate to trace along the snowflake designs.If too much melted chocolate comes out of the bag, you may need to use a smaller tip or make larger snowflakes.

, You can set a silver cachou in the middle of each snowflake or use them to decorate each tip of the snowflake. You could also sprinkle the snowflakes with edible glitter for extra shine. Decorate the snowflakes while the chocolate is still soft. Set the snowflakes aside to harden.You can refrigerate the white chocolate snowflakes in an airtight container until you're ready to use them.

Fold each circle in half.,
Fold each circle in half once more.,
Assemble four of the circle quarters so that they touch in the center.,
Form a paste from equal parts water and meringue powder.,
Attach the final piece.",How to Make Fondant Flowers1," Use a rolling pin to flatten a portion of fondant so that it is roughly 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) thick.


The fondant needs to be approximately as thin as a nickel or dime.
Since this is a generic flower shape, you can use any color fondant you want.
To prevent the fondant from sticking to the rolling pin or the surface, dust both the rolling pin and the surface of your counter or mat with cornstarch before working with the fondant.;
, Use a fondant cutter or cookie cutter to cut out five 2-inch (5-cm) circles from the flattened fondant.For a less uniform look, you could also cut circles out freehand using a butter knife.
This size will create a fondant flower that is roughly 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. Adjust the size of your circles accordingly to create a larger or smaller flower.

, Dust the top surface of one circle with cornstarch before gently folding it in half.


Pinch the fold in the center. The fondant should stick to itself at this point, but it should not stick together at the edges.
Work with one circle at a time.

, Dust the surface facing you with additional cornstarch and fold the circle in half once more, forming a quarter of a circle.


Pinch the fondant together enough so that the center of the fold sticks together. The edges should just barely touch near the center of the fold.
Work with one circle at a time.
Let each piece dry for a few minutes before continuing on.

, The pointed corners should all touch and the open edge of the fold should face in the same direction for each petal.


You should be left with a shape that is fairly circular in nature.

, Mix a small amount of each in a little dish until a paste forms.


This paste will be what holds your petals together.
Alternatively, you could also use a little melted white chocolate as a paste.

, Brush the paste onto the corners of the four flat pieces and the corner tip of the remaining fifth piece. Press the remaining piece upright and into the center.


Let dry. Once it rests, it can be used as a decoration.

One round cake, any flavor or texture of choice
Four cupcakes, same flavor and texture as the main cake, for the legs
One cupcake for cutting into a tail shape
One cupcake (same flavor and texture), baked in a much larger container, such as a large muffin container, for the head

Buttercream frosting, in the color of the turtle––usually green is best but you can use the child's favorite color if preferred
Candies for decorating the turtle.;
, Allow them to cool down before adding the frosting.

Cut the tail shape out of one of the cupcakes. A simple triangle will do, or a curve. Cut the cupcake in half first and use the bottom half to create this tailpiece.

, This could be a large platter or a cake board. It is important to use the presentation base now, as you won't be able to move the cake again after you start frosting it.

Place the large round cake in the center.
Place the four cupcakes at suitable intervals for the turtle's legs.
Place the head at the front part of the cake.
Place the tail at the back of the cake.

, The frosting will cover the joins of the cake.

Using a butter knife or a frosting spatula, cover all of the cakes with frosting, including the legs, tail and head. When you reach the joins, be generous with the frosting and smooth it over to cover any dips.

Slide the flower off the skewer.,
Fold the center petal in place using the veining tool.",How to Make Fondant Flowers2," Use a rolling pin to flatten a portion of fondant out until it is about 1/16 inch (1.5875 mm) thick.


You can use nearly any color fondant you want for your carnation.
To prevent the fondant from sticking to the rolling pin or work surface, dust both the surface and the rolling pin with a little cornstarch before you begin.
Alternatively, you could also spread a thin film of shortening on the work surface instead of using cornstarch.

, Use a fondant cutter or cookie cutter to cut out five to six 2-inch (5-cm) circles from the flattened fondant.


This size will create a flower suitable for decorating a cupcake or other small treat. Adjust the size of the circles as needed to create a smaller or larger flower.

, Press the heel of the veining tool down on the edge of the circle. Quickly pull it out to form a ruffle, and move all the way around the edge of the circle in this manner.


Do this with each of the circles you cut out.
Hold the small end of the veining tool like a pencil to make the pressing action easier.
If you do not have a veining tool, use a toothpick. Gently roll a toothpick over the outer perimeter of each petal, causing it to curl around the toothpick and ruffle the edge.

, Carefully slide the circle onto the sharp end of the skewer and push it upward along the skewer until it nearly reaches the blunt end.


The circle should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the end of the skewer. The distance should roughly equal the radius of the circle.
Dust the skewer with cornstarch to prevent it from sticking to the fondant.

, Bring the edges together so that they crumple loosely over the blunt end of the skewer.


This will serve as the center of your carnation.

, Gently push the remaining four or five circles onto the skewer in a similar manner, carefully crumpling each circle over the one that came before it.


The petals should not be crumpled together uniformly or tightly. Crumple them together in a loose, asymmetrical manner for a more natural look.

, Carefully pull the flower off the skewer by sliding it off the blunt end.


Do this very slowly and cautiously so that you do not accidentally crush the petals you formed.

, Use the veining tool or a toothpick to gently fold the center petal over so that it masks the hold left by the skewer.


Let dry. After it dries, the carnation is ready to use.

You could also use shortening to grease the dish.
If making more than one fondant tulip, consider using a cupcake pan with multiple slots.

, Use a rolling pin to flatten a portion of fondant so that it is roughly 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) thick.


The fondant should be about as thin as a nickel or dime.
Use any color fondant you want.
To prevent the fondant from sticking to the rolling pin or the surface, dust both the rolling pin and the working surface with cornstarch before you begin.

, Use a cookie cutter or fondant cutter to cut out five ovals with a height of 3 inches (7.6 cm) and a width of 2 inches (5 cm).


You could also cut the ovals out freehand if you do not have an oval cutter. Use a butter knife dusted with cornstarch to do this.
If the cutter threatens to stick to the cutter, dust it with cornstarch or apply shortening or nonstick cooking spray.

, Thin it out just enough to cause the petal to curl a bit.


If you do not have a round ball tool, you could do this with a spoon or your hands.
Do this with each petal.

, Melt a few chocolate chips or wafers that match the color of your tulip. Apply a small dot of this chocolate in the bottom of your prepared dish.


The circle should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.
You could also form a paste with meringue powder and water instead of using chocolate. The choice is yours.

, Slightly bend one short edge of the petal inward and stick it into the melted chocolate.


The center of the petal should hit the center of the custard cup, but the top part of the petal should rest against the side of the cup.

, Bend one short edge of each petal inward and stick it into the center of the melted chocolate, as you did with the first petal. Each petal should slightly overlap the one before it.


All the thin edges should face the same direction.

, Let the tulip dry in its custard cup for a few minutes. Once it feels somewhat hard and set, you can safely remove it.


Use the tulip to decorate as desired.

Add your dye a little at a time.",How to Make Brown Food Coloring1," Red and green, orange and blue, or yellow and purple can all be combined to make brown.You can use liquid or gel food dye. Gel food dye is usually preferred because you don't need very much to get vivid colors.;
, So for every 1 drop of red, add 1 drop of green.Mix your colors in a glass or stainless steel bowl. The dye can stain plastic bowls.

,


Mix red and yellow in a 1:10 ratio (1 drop red to 10 drops yellow) for tan.

, You may think you have the perfect shade of espresso brown and then find the next day that is has deepened to almost black. Mix your dye lighter than you think you want so it has room to develop.If you are dying frosting, consider making it 1-2 days ahead of time so you know the true shade you are working with.If your frosting still isn't dark enough, add a drop of black dye or more of your brown.
If your frosting is too dark, add a little of the white frosting to dilute the color.

Choose your colorant.,
Steep colorants in water to make liquid dye.,
Grind colorants in a coffee or spice grinder to make a powder dye.,
Add your dye a little at a time.",How to Make Brown Food Coloring2," The colorant is what will provide the brown coloring for the dye. You can use ground espresso, instant coffee, cocoa powder, cinnamon, or black tea achieve brown.Remember that you may need a lot of dye to get a very dark brown, which means you will also get a stronger taste of the colorant. Cinnamon is great for light brown, but the taste might be overwhelming if you make a dark brown.Used in small amounts, you should not taste the colorant. It's ok to use a dill seed-based colorant for your buttercream if you use it very sparingly.You may not be able to get the same vivid colors with natural dye as you would with store-bought colors. Petroleum-based colors need only a few drops to add color, whereas you might need a lot of natural dye to add color. Most recipes will be ruined by the addition of too much coloring--they will taste weird or become too watery to use., For every 1 cup of water, add 1 cup coffee, 1/2 cup cocoa, 10 tea bags, or 4 tablespoons of spice.Bring the water and colorant mixture to a boil.
Boil gently or simmer between 15-30 minutes.
Allow mixture to cool to room temperature.
Pour mixture through a fine mesh strainer to catch any unabsorbed granules. Store in a glass or stainless steel bowl, as the dye will not stain these materials.

, The key to a powder dye is that it must be extremely fine. If any of your colorants are coarse (like crystals of instant coffee), grind them further until they are a powdery consistency.Powder dyes are more concentrated, so you may be able to get a darker color using less of the powder dye. Keep in mind that too much can change the flavor of whatever you are dyeing., Remember that too much liquid dye can ruin the texture and structure of whatever you are dyeing, especially frosting. Too much liquid or powder dye can affect the flavor, so be sure to taste as you go.


Make peace with the idea that you may not get the dark, vivid color you want from natural dye. Flavor and consistency is ultimately more important than getting that perfect shade.

Hold the right corner and the apex together with your left hand.,
Hold both of the corners together at top back of the cone.,
Fold the tip of the cone at the very end, if you do not plan to use a metal or plastic decorating tip.,
Use a spoon or spatula to scoop up frosting or chocolate.,
Fold the sides at the top of the icing bag toward the center.,
Snip the bottom of the bag evenly with kitchen shears, if you are not using a cake decorating tip.,
Press on the top fold of the icing bag to dispense the frosting from the bottom.,
Practice piping the icing onto a plate or another piece of parchment paper.",How to Make a Cake Decorating Bag," You can use the decorating bag immediately after making it, so keep your frosting nearby.;
, There is no specific size that it must be, but you should aim to have a piece that is approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) high by 14 to 18 inches (35.6 to 45.7 cm) long.

, Take an end of the parchment paper in each hand, with the outside of the roll down. Roll it back and forth against the edge of a clean counter, to make it as flat as possible.

, Place your hand down on the straight edge to steady it.

, You should have 2 obtuse triangles when you are finished. Place 1 triangle aside, to make another cake decorating bag in the future.


You can also fold the parchment paper down from a rectangle into a square by moving the upper left corner to the bottom right portion of the paper. Cut off the excess paper at the right end and then cut at the fold. Although this may feel more exact, it can cause slight problems and gaping in the decorating bag, where the fold was pressed and cut.

, Take the right corner of the triangle and curve it up to meet the top, or apex, of the triangle. You will need to make a cone shape, with the tip pointing toward you.

, Take the left corner and wrap it over the cone to the right, until it reaches the back and top of the triangle.


Make sure the cone forms a closed tip at the end.

, Fold them down toward the inside of the bag. Staple it in place, if it does not seem to be holding together on its own.

, If you do want to use a scalloped, flower or other decorating tip, snip the end of the bag very slightly and push a decorating tip into the bottom of the cone.

, Allow the frosting to drip into the center of the cone. Fill the bag a third full with icing.

, Begin to fold the top down like a toothpaste tube. This will push the icing down into the bottom of the tube.

, Make sure to start small. You can always take off more, if you want a larger icing stream.

, Continue to fold the pastry bag down as the bag starts to empty. It will ensure extra icing doesn't come out of the top.

, You can create shapes, writing and intricate decorations with practice.

Learn about the technique of airbrushing.,
Learn about adding a border.,
Know your buttercream.,
Understand the use of decorating bags.,
Purchase as many decorating tips as your budget permits.,
Consider getting a flower nail.,
Learn about the different types of frosting.",How to Learn About Common Cake Decorating Terms," Cake airbrushing is a high-speed way to add a picture or setting onto a cake's surface using food coloring. Airbrushing uses an artist's paint gun that uses a compression air pump.
, The border of a cake is a continuous thread of icing that embellishes the top, sides, and/or bottom edges of a cake.

, Buttercream is a rich icing that is made by mixing either butter or shortening (or both) together with icing sugar, and beaten until smooth. Buttercream is an all-purpose icing, easily made, that can be used to both cover and embellish a cake

, Decorating bags are also known as icing bags, frosting bags, or pastry bags. Decorating bags are small, triangular shaped bags that are made from cloth, plastic, or parchment paper. The bags are equipped with embellishing tips and filled with icing and used to pipe ornamental items such as icing flowers, borders, scrollwork, and lacework patterns.

, Decorating tips are often called decorating nozzles. Decorating tips are used to create decorative details such as basket-weave patterns, icing roses, and shell borders. Tips come in different shapes, and are applied with an icing or pastry bag full of icing. When the bag is pressed, the icing or cream is piped out in the shape of the tip. Drop flowers are produced with a single squeeze of the frosting bag, while rose petals are produced with practiced maneuvering of the tip and icing.

, A flower nail is shaped like a nail with a large, oversized head. A flower head is used for piping royal icing and buttercream flowers that are transferred to a cake after drying.

, Frosting and icing are often switched for each other. Americans tend to use the term ""frosting"" to mean the creamy, sugary substance that covers a cake, while individuals in other English speaking areas tend to use the term ""icing"". In the U.S.A., ""frosting"" commonly refers to the icing that is spread over the cake, while ""icing"" usually refers to decorative icing, such as piped borders and icing roses. There is different types of frosting (which can also double as filling where needed):

Fondant - Fondant is also called sugar paste. Fondant is an icing sugar dough that can be worked in much the same way as pie dough. Fondant can be rolled into smooth sheets and draped over cakes, making a smooth, flawless finish.
Ganache - Ganache is a velvety smooth frosting. It is prepared by melting either dark or white chocolate, then mixing it with heavy cream.






Gumpaste - Gumpaste is an edible, clay-like dough. It is prepared by combining glycerin, gum Arabic, and icing sugar. Gumpaste is used to mold edible flowers and designs. Gum paste can also be rolled exceedingly thin and used to make intricate ribbons and lacework, as well as delicate flower petals.






Marzipan - Marzipan is a doughy almond substance. It is made from the identical ingredients as almond paste, though marzipan has more sugar, fewer almonds, and has a smoother consistency. Marzipan is often used for modeling cake decorations, and as a base covering underneath fondant.
Piping - Piping is a decorating method where a decorating bag or tube is filled with icing and fitted with a decorating tip. Piping takes place when the bag is gently squeezed to make shaped dots and ribbons of icing to adorn cakes and other baked goods.






Royal Icing - Royal icing is a sweet white icing that is prepared by whipping icing sugar with either fresh egg whites or dried egg whites and meringue powder. Royal icing makes crisp icing borders. It is perfect for piping intricate writing, borders, scrollwork, and lacework on cakes. Royal icing dries very hard and preserves indefinitely if stored in a cool, dry place, but is vulnerable to softening and drooping in high humidity.

, The following are a few things you will want to have to get started:


You will need featherweight piping bags . Get at least 3 washable bags or a larger package of disposable bags, so that you can use different colors. Make sure to get couplers for changing the tips on the piping bags.
Decorating tips are important for using pastry bags. You will need a leaf tip, writing tips, border tips. Get approximately 5 tips to practice on, unless you find a good deal on a large set. You will also want to buy a rose tip, in order to learn how to make frosting roses.
Find a lazy Susan. A turning base is necessary to create an even look on a round cake. You will learn the art of turning the lazy Susan as you apply frosting.
Buy several stainless steel spatulas for spreading frosting. Find a medium and large spatula, because they will be useful with different sized cakes.
Buy gel food coloring. Although liquid food coloring will also work, the pros prefer gels for their intense colors and ease of use.
Make sure your kitchen has a balloon whisk, a pastry scraper and tweezers. These will help you make whipped toppings, transfer frosting and set small details, respectively.

Add your cake embellishments.",How to Decorate Engagement Cakes," You will want to specify the colors and textures of the frosting as well as additional embellishments. Once you are happy with your design, buy all the ingredients for the cake, frosting and decoration ahead of time.;
, Once you choose how many tiers you would like for your engagement cake, bake them ahead of time. You will want to have the cake at room temperature before you start to frost it.


Place your cake on a base. You will want to decorate the cake in a kitchen, but move it to a location later. This will be difficult to do without a very thick cardboard or plastic base.
If you want to layer your cakes with a filling, do this now, before you start to decorate it. You may need to cut your cake horizontally, spread filling on and place the second half of the cake back on the top.
Choose butter cream frosting if you are new to cake decorating and you want excellent flavor. Butter cream frosting recipes can be found easily in cookbooks, online and in magazines. You can flavor the butter cream with extracts and color it with food coloring. For a cake that will be standing out at room temperature for a while, substitute vegetable shortening for animal fat.

,


Choose whipped cream frosting if you want it to be lighter. You can also find many versions of this recipe that use whipped cream, powdered sugar and flavor extract. However, do not choose this type if your engagement cake will be sitting out for a long time, because it does not last long outside of the refrigerator.
Choose to make rolled fondant if you have some experience with cake baking and decorating. This frosting creates a smooth, even coating and is mostly used for professional cakes. However, most people find the taste bland and it can be difficult to handle.
Use ganache if you have a chocolate cake and want a glaze. This rich combination of chocolate and heavy cream creates a harder and smoother surface than butter cream, so the decorating style will be slightly different.

, The Food Network has instructions on using food coloring to achieve almost every color in the spectrum. Visit foodnetwork.com/recipes-and-cooking/frost-by-numbers-how-to-make-frosting-colors/index.html to choose the shade you want.

, If you are using butter cream or whipped cream, you will want to create a base layer of frosting. Once it has a layer, place it in the refrigerator to cool for 2 to 3 hours, or until it is firm.


If you are using fondant, you may also want to make a layer of butter cream frosting in a masking layer. This will help the fondant stick to the cake and it will also add to the flavor.

, You will need to use an icing spatula to make a smooth surface, on which your decorations will be placed.


If you are using fondant, you lay the layer on top of the cake at this point. Smooth it until there are no seems. Cut off any excess fondant with a knife.

, You will want to use vertical dowels to ensure the layers are firmly attached and supported.

, You will need to add more butter cream or whipped cream frosting into a pastry bag, with a pastry tip and a coupling. If you want to use different colors, you will want to separate the frosting into different bags for each color you use.


You will want to pick your pastry tips ahead of time and practice on a smooth surface. You may want to make leaves, flowers, beads, lines, ruffles, writing or basket weaves with your pastry tips.

, Apply the dust with a pastry brush over the surface of the cake or the decorations themselves.

,


If you plan to use royal icing, place the icing inside a pastry bag and pipe it onto a piece of parchment paper in the shapes you desire. Make sure you make enough to complete your design.
If you plan to use fondant, make sheets of fondant in several different colors. Use knives and a pastry cutter to cut your shapes. You may also want to cut long horizontal pieces of fondant in different colors to wrap around your cake tiers. Place the fondant adornments aside until you are ready to use them on the cake.

, There is a long list of edible and non-edible things you can use to decorate a cake. You will want to add these either before or after you pipe frosting shapes onto the cake, depending upon what will keep the frosting from being smeared.


Create a multi-colored engagement cake by using milk chocolate lentils in a design. You can order these candies in the colors you desire and then place them on the top and sides of the cake in a geometric pattern.
Print out a fancy label with the couple's name on it. Place paper in the printer that is the same color as the frosting. Stick the label to the top or side of the cake, where everyone can see.
Use faux pearls to give an elegant touch to your cake. Press them into the frosting in a straight line or in loops and swirls.
Hand-paint the engagement cake. If you are artistic, buy brushes and edible paint. Paint on top of white fondant for a beautiful contrast. If you choose to do this, you can customize your artistic cake in any way you see fit.
Wrap pre-made leis around your engagement cake tiers. You can choose these floral garlands in the engagement party or reception colors and simply lay them down around each layer of cake. If leis are not available, use fresh flowers with the stems removed for a classic look.
Wrap ribbons around your cakes. Choose 1 ribbon type or many complimentary designs. Wrap them carefully around the sides until they stick into the icing. Make sure you take extra time to put them on straight.
Use paper embellishments to decorate the cake. Visit a scrapbooking or stationary store to find metallic or brightly-colored paper leaves, vines, garlands and shapes. Use pins to affix paper that does not stay very easily.
Pre-order sugar craft flowers from websites like DecoBake.com. They can be placed on the cake just before the ceremony.

Select a suitable syrup.,
Drizzle the syrup across the base half as evenly as possible.,
Place the top layer on.",How to Fill a Cake3," When using syrup, the expectation is that it will cover the base half but it will also seep into the cake, so it must be a flavor that matches well with the cake and the cake texture must be such that it will take well to being soaked, such as a sponge cake or a cake with a slightly dry texture that could do with having moisture added.


Syrups to use might include: chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup, maple syrup, golden syrup, buttery syrup, etc.

, Cover as much of the base half as possible but don't go right to the edge in case the syrup spills over the side and looks unsightly.


It is also okay to poke a hole in the top half of the cake and to drizzle some syrup into the top half via the hole (or holes). This would be done where you want both halves of the cake to be well infused with the flavor or where you're trying to rescue an overly dry cake.

You might use that person's favorite color to as the color scheme of your cake, but you should also think about favorite activities, like sports, or characters, like those from favorite books and TV shows.


When basing your cake around a favorite book, TV show, or character, try to pick out iconic features that will be easy to recreate on your cake. For example, if making a Harry Potter themed cake, you might use Lego Harry Potter figurines to decorate.;
, Writing with icing can be difficult. Letters that are too small will turn out squashed and can be easily missed. On the other hand, writing that is too big can leave your message incomplete, or throw off the balance of your cake. Use a pencil and a piece of scrap paper to get a feel for the spacing and size of the letters in your message before you attempt icing.


You might want to practice your writing by using your pencil copy as a stencil. Mix up some extra frosting, and use a piping bag to follow the letters of your message accustom yourself to cake writing.
You might also want to check out how to write with frosting.

, Write out your message in the fashion you desire and then cut out a stencil of your message with scissors. Once you have cut the shape of the letters of your message into your paper, you can set your stencil off to the side to use later.


When you're ready to write your message, you should place your stencil close to the surface of the icing where you will be writing, and dust it with powdered sugar. This way you have a powdered sugar guide for your cake writing.

, A flat top will be best for your decorating endeavors, as you won't have to worry about decorations sliding down a sloped or domed portion of your cake. If your cake has a slight crown, you can correct this by putting a plate on top of your cake after you take it from the oven and press down gently.


Check the levelness of your cake by lying a piece of clean cardboard atop it. If the cardboard lies flat, your cake is level. Using a small carpenter's level will ensure the flattest possible cake.
Your oven temperature might be the cause of your uneven cake. Temperatures that are too high can cause this to occur; avoid this by double checking your oven temperature with an oven thermometer., Applying frosting while your cake is still warm can result in a melty mess. Beyond that, while your cake is still cooling it will be less structurally sound. Cool your cake by:


Removing your cake from the oven and placing it on a cooling rack or your counter for about 5 - 10 minutes.
Moving your cake to the refrigerator to aid cooling while locking in moisture.
Sealing your cake inside its mold with two layers plastic wrap will prevent it from drying out.
Returning your cake to the refrigerator for another one to two hours., There are many different kinds of decoration you might use for the birthday cake you are making. Some of these may be edible, like fondant decorations and candy accents, while others may be inedible, like figurines and models. Some supplies you'll likely want to have on hand include:


Chocolate chips (optional)
Edible glitter (optional)
Fondant (optional)
Food coloring (optional)
Frosting
Fruit (optional)
Mixing bowls (for frosting)
Nuts (optional)
Piping bag (or plastic baggie)
Scissors (for homemade piping bag)
Sprinkles (optional)
Stencils (optional)
Toothpicks (optional)

, Even expert cake decorators sometimes have dribbles of icing puddle or pool around the base of the cake. To create a clean edge between your cake and the surface it rests on, place the corners of four pieces of wax or parchment paper under your cake so the paper skirts the bottom edges of the cake.


You should be able to easily remove any drips or messy frosting around the cake's base by pulling free the paper from underneath it.

, A crumb coat is a thin layer of frosting that you put on your cake before the main layer of frosting. When frosting your cake, crumbs can get stuck in your frosting, making it look less than great. Your crumb coat will trap these crumbs and keep your main layer of frosting looking clean and professional.Use a knife or offset spatula to apply your frosting, spreading it until you can see the cake underneath.


Give your crumb coat a few minutes to set before you move on to your main layer of frosting., Vanilla buttercream frosting, as delicious as it may be, is fairly simple to make. For more complicated versions of icing or frosting, you may want to check out how to make icing or frosting. The following recipe only needs to be beaten together to a regular consistency in a mixing bowl:

Softened butter (½ cup)
Confectioners' sugar (4½ cups)
Vanilla extract (1½ teaspoons)
2% milk (5 to 6 tablespoons)A few drops of food coloring in your icing can change plain white buttercream into whatever color best suits your cake design!

, To keep your frosting equally distributed, you should start from the top and spread small amounts frosting across your cake with your knife or offset spatula. As the frosting thins, you should scoop more of it from its container or mixing bowl with your knife of spatula, and continue to spread the frosting on you cake little by little until it is completely frosted.


Try not to apply too much frosting at once. This can sometimes make it difficult to achieve an even look.
Wait until the top of your cake is done before frosting the sides. This way you'll have a more consistent look for your entire cake., A piping bag is flexible plastic container that you can fill with frosting. After loading the bag with frosting, you should cut the end of the bag that comes to a point to create a nozzle. Then all you need to do is squeeze the bag to force your icing out in a controlled stream.If you have trouble finding a suitable piping bag at your local grocery, you can make a homemade piping bag with a zippered plastic bag. Put icing in your baggie and seal the top firmly. Cut off the tip of one corner of the baggie and voila! Your homemade piping bag is finished., Beginning pipers might not yet feel confident piping a message freehand onto a cake. If you're one such person, you may want to sketch out the message in your frosting with a toothpick. This way you can follow your sketch with your piping bag and limit mistakes., You can use the end of your piping bag to direct your stream of frosting, or you can buy special tips to create special effects with your frosting. Some special effect tips you can use with your piping bag include:


Round tips, which are suited for lines, dots, and writing messages.
Star tips, which are mostly used to create stars shapes, decorative shells, flowers, borders, and rosettes.
Basket-weave tips, which are fitting for making lattices and lines that mimic ribbons, and other borders., You may need to wait until you graduate from beginner before you tackle any designs that are too complex, but with your piping bag you can create all sorts of shapes and designs. You can also make clever designs from a special, hardened sugar substance called fondant. You might even try:


Icing flowers
Icing roses

, In the baking section of most grocers, there will be decorative candies that you can use to dress up your cake. Candy beads, sprinkles, and other special edible confectioner ornaments can change your cake from simple delicious to dazzling.

, Edible glitter is a great way of giving your cake a magical touch, and can also be used to hide small inconsistencies in your frosting. Simply dust the surface of your cake in a thin layer of glitter for an effect that will impress all who see.


You can also drizzle your glitter through stencils to create special shapes and patterns on the surface of your cake., Pieces of Kit-Kat can be used to create a border around your cake. Stick the wafers of the candy one or two at a time to the frosting on the side of your cake until it is completely bordered. M&M are another popular addition to birthday cakes. You might even use these to spell out a message or create a special design., Especially for themed cakes, this is an easier way to indicate a favorite character or series than drawing an elaborate picture freehand. Consider using Lego models. These are small enough that they can easily nested in the icing of your cake.

, There's nothing better than the look of pure gratitude you'll get when the recipient sees the beautiful cake you've crafted. Place candles in the cake, sing happy birthday, and share your handiwork with all your guests!

Invest in some nice decorating tips.,
Choose your piping bags.,
Stock your cupcake tool drawer.",How to Decorate Cupcakes1," If you want professional looking cupcakes, there's really no way around this. The four most common shapes (openings) are the large round tip, Open star (Wilton 1M), Closed star (Wilton 2D), and the French tip. Rose petal tips (Wilton 123) are useful, too.


You may also want a coupler to hold your tips in place, but it's not necessary. They'll stay in the bag if you do it right. However, having one lets you interchange several decorating tips without changing the bag.;
, There are several varieties and all will get the job done. If you're thinking about seriously getting into cupcake decorating, go for the sturdy, reusable ones. If not, the disposable kind work just as well.Featherweight bags are reusable, made of flexible, coated polyester. They are strong, lightweight and dishwasher safe, in sizes from 8 in. to 18 in.
Disposable bags are made to use and toss—no fuss, no muss. Made of strong, flexible plastic, they're easy to handle. Available in 12, 24, 50 and 100 count boxes.
Parchment Triangles are also disposable, but you have to fold them into shape. They're made of vegetable parchment paper (grease resistant, too!) and they come in 12"" and 15"" sizes.

, While piping bags and tips are enough, sometimes you want a little more variety. If you want to work with fondant or ganache, you'll need a few more materials.


A palette knife is handy for spreading and evening out pretty much any type of icing or frosting.
A spatula is especially useful for working with fondant.
A cooking grid almost goes without saying!

"
"
Place the nozzle inside the piping bag and snip the end of the bag off.,
Twist the end of the piping bag.,
Fill the piping bag with the frosting you prepared earlier.,
Tie an elastic band on the end of the bag.",How to Decorate Cupcakes2," Make sure the bag is cut far enough back that the end of the nozzle is clear of the piping bag. It needs to fit in the end, nice and snug and going nowhere.

, The part near the tip, that is. This will prevent any of the frosting coming out until you are ready. Place the piping bag into a glass and fold the top of the bag over the edge of the glass.


Don't question it. Just do. This will make everything much, much easier.

, Using the glass will allow you to fill the piping bag without needing two pairs of hands. If you don't, frosting will inevitably get everywhere (a delicious problem, but a problem nonetheless).


Note: Don't overfill the bag! About halfway is sufficient. If you do, extra frosting may start coming out the wrong end.

, This is just to make it easier --it stops all the frosting coming out of the top of the bag. You are now ready to start piping!


""Burp"" the bag before you begin. That is, squeeze out some icing from the tip into a bowl -- you'll also get out the extra air that gets trapped in the end. If you don't, your first puff of icing will burst out like Ricky Martin in March of 2010."

Make swirl top cupcakes.,
Use the same tip but go in reverse.,
Make rosettes.,
Try out the round and French tips.,
Make a giant rose.",How to Decorate Cupcakes3," Place a 1M icing tip in a decorator's bag. Fill the bag with your desired icing. Holding the bag at a 90-degree angle to the top of the cupcake, pipe a swirl around the outside edge. Lift the tip and begin piping a second swirl inside the first swirl, lifting up in the center.


Be careful not to drag on the surface! When you hit the end of the line, lift up and quickly cease pressure on the bag. This will create a peak in the center. If you desire, add a dash of sprinkles to the top as a finishing touch.
The Wilton 2D will give you almost the same look but with a few more ridges and a little more jazz.

, And this time, go a bit slower. If you start in the center and slowly move in a spiral toward the outside, you'll create a rose shape.


Make sure not to move the angle of the tip; to get the rose shape, the lines need to stay uniform.

, There's one more method you can try with the 1M tip. Make little rosettes by making tiny swirls all over the cupcake. Start on the side and work your way to the center.


Draw a teeny circle with your tip very quickly. With the tip you're using, this should create a fancy rose-like shape. A normal-sized cupcake will have around 12 rosettes on the outside rim, to give you an idea.

, Using the same method as described in the first step, start on the outside and work your way in, holding the bag at a 90-degree angle. Lift up a bit as you go -- this will give your cupcake volume and keep you from dragging on the surface.


The large round tip will a cute, classic, basic swirl. Especially adorable with sprinkles.
The French tip looks like a firework and the result is similar -- like a firework frozen in stop-motion.







, If you have a Wilton 123, this'll be easy. First, make a bud in the center. Basically, put on a small glob of frosting. What you're going to do is make small arches all the way around this center -- like petals. The thin line of the 123 makes this simple. They should overlap a little bit and get bigger as you go out. This takes a bit of skill, so set aside a few cupcakes for trial and error that will wind up not so pretty.


Once you've covered the rose in petals, take your Wilton 123 and squeeze out a line of frosting all the way around. This covers the odds and ends of each petal, making the rose come to life.

Ice cupcakes the traditional way.,
Pour ganache or candy melts over cupcakes.,
Create a smooth canvas with fondant.,
Invest in some cupcake add-ons.",How to Decorate Cupcakes4," Place a spoonful of icing on the center of the cupcake. Use an icing spatula (or palette knife) to spread the icing around the top of the cupcake, out to the edges. Smooth the top with the spatula as desired.


For a smooth look, run the spatula edge across the top. For a fluffier look, lightly touch the iced surface with the spatula blade and lift up.

, For a twist to your ordinary frosted cupcake, pour ganache, melted chocolate, or icing over the tops of your cupcakes. To do this, let the cupcakes cool completely. Begin pouring over the center of the cupcake. You can totally cover the cupcake or cover just the top and let the topping drip over the sides.


Set them on a cooling rack positioned over top a cookie sheet. The cookie sheet will catch any drippings. Let the cupcakes cool to allow the topping to set.
The same method can be used with warmed icing.

, The bottom sides of cupcakes are easiest to cover with fondant. Use a spatula to spread a thin layer of buttercream frosting over the surface. Roll out the fondant to the desired size to cover the cupcake, keeping the thickness to about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm). Lay the fondant over the cupcake and smooth it out.


Cut off any excess frosting at the bottom. It's easiest to trim with a spatula. Use your hands to continue to smooth the surface of the fondant.

, Now that cupcake baking is such a trend, you can find just about anything. You can find any image in the form of buttercream, fondant, gum paste, royal icing, or candy. Any. Just go online and take a look! (Grab your credit card.)Want to put a teeny sugary baby on top of your cupcake? No problem. How about a television? Can do. A harvest of cornstalks? Yep. Seriously. The cupcake world has accepted every challenge and delivered.

Enjoy!",How to Decorate a Minecraft Creeper Cake," You need to have a cake that has good consistency and can be cut easily. A pound cake may be the best to use. But a yellow, or chocolate cake, from a mix should work fine as well.  Bake your cake according to directions; let it cool 15 minutes after removal from oven, then remove the cake from the pan(s) and let them cool completely before messing with them.;
, This is the step where you use a cake leveler (or a knife if you don't have one), and so that the cake doesn't have that ""bump"" in the middle. If you have to level the cake, you can flip the side you cut upside down and use the bottom of your cake as your top; it doesn't get as many crumbs and is less messy that way.

, Some people use store bought icing, but it is highly recommended making your own.  Store-bought tends to be too gooey to work with.  


Icing is made by mixing 3/4 cup of shortening and 3/4 cup (one and 1/2 sticks) of butter or margarine that has warmed to room temperature.  
Mix with an electric mixer, then add approximately 6 cups of powdered sugar, 1 and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, and approximately 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml) of milk.  
If it's too thick, let it warm up a bit.  If it's too gooey, cool it a bit in the fridge.

,  Add green food coloring as needed to get the color you like. In a separate bowl, put the rest of the icing, and add black food coloring to get the color you like.  


Note that it takes a lot of black coloring to get a black color. If you only add a little bit, it'll be grey.

, If you are stacking layers, apply a layer between them as ""glue"". The crumb coat will look ugly, but it's only job is to seal in crumbs so you don't have crumbs all over your cake icing's finished product.  

,,  Icing spreaders are especially nice for this job, but you can use a butter knife if you don't have one.

, Make sure you are drawing (or printing off the internet) the size you want for your cake. Then, cut out the creeper's face from the paper. Place the creeper paper onto the top of your cake and, using a toothpick, trace the outline of the paper into the icing.

, Load your black icing into the bag. Draw lines along your creeper outline using your black icing.

, Practice making a few stars on a piece of paper with your icing bag by squirting out small amounts of icing holding the bag straight up and down over the paper.  Can you make the stars?  Great.  Now you just start filling in the creeper's face with black icing stars.  Go in lines, and try to get every bit of green covered with a black star.

, Once your design is finished, snap a picture before you tuck in.

You might dye your cake batter green to match a Christmas tree theme, or you could dye it red and green if your color scheme were Christmas themed.

A few drops of food coloring should be enough to thoroughly dye your batter, though you may want to use more or less to intensify or lighten the color.;
, A quick trip the baking section of your local grocery might reveal to you a whole slew of festive baking molds that you can use. You might bake your cake in the shape of a tree, snowman, or Christmas present!, A warm cake will not be a structurally sound as one that has cooled, and your decorating efforts might have an unintended impact. Also, the heat from a warm cake can make frosting melt, which will negatively effect your decorations., If you plan on writing a message in your cake, you should map out where you plan on writing the letters and practice the style in which you plan on writing. Letter spacing can be particularly difficult. You may want to make some extra icing and practice writing you message on a scrap piece of paper.If you're a beginner when it comes to cake decorating, you should make a fair amount of extra icing.If you find that writing with icing is too frustrating, consider using chocolate chips dabbed with frosting or nested in frosting to spell out your message.

, A sloping or domed top to your cake can be difficult to work with.One smoothing measure you can take is to put the bottom layer upside down and use it as the top of your cake. This way its top surface is extra flat. If your cake is very domed, you can try cutting off the top with a bread knife., If you don't feel confident in your ability to freehand a drawing, consider using stencils. Place your stencil over the area you want to draw your design and sprinkle cocoa powder or powdered sugar to create an outline. You can use this outline to guide your decorating attempts. Some other decorating aids might include:

Chocolate chips (optional)
Edible glitter (optional)
Fondant (optional)

Toothpicks (optional)

, Unless you are a steady hand at cake decorating, it's likely there will be some frosting drips while you put icing on your cake. To clean unsightly drips easily, place the corners of four pieces of parchment paper or wax paper under the edges of your cake. Since only a small amount of the paper is under your cake, when the time comes you should be able to pull each free from the cake along with any frosting that has dripped on it., It will keep any crumbs on the surface of your cake from mixing with the final layer of frosting.Once your crumb coat has firmed, your final layer of frosting should glide on smoothly., You can make homemade frosting or icing, or you can purchase some from the baking section of your local grocery store. At some stores, you may be able to purchase piping bags prepared with frosting, which can be dyed by adding a few drops of food coloring and mixed well. A simple frosting recipe might include:

Softened butter (½ cup)
Confectioners' sugar (4½ cups )
Vanilla extract (1½ teaspoons)
2% milk (5 to 6 tablespoons), If this is your first time frosting a cake, you may be a little anxious. Take a few breaths and put a little frosting on top of the cake. Start with small portions and spread it slowly with a knife or thin spatula. As the frosting thins, take more from your frosting bowl, applying it little by little until your cake has a smooth layer frosting.You should avoid applying too much frosting at any given time during the process. If you put on too much, it can sometimes be difficult to spread out the frosting evenly.
You should frost the sides of your cake after doing the top, but before you add decorations and embellishments. This will help you achieve a more consistent look with your frosting., Then, you can cut off the very tip of the bag and apply pressure to the plastic to make the icing come out in a steady stream.You can use a ziplock bag to make a simple piping bag. Make sure it has a strong top seal and put some icing in the bag. Seal the bag and cut off the tip of one of its bottom corners to make your own piping bag., Separate your icing into different piping bags and use food coloring to change the color to fit your design. If you have your heart set on making a Christmas tree, you should dye some frosting brown for the trunk, green for the ornaments, and maybe red to give the tree ornaments., If you cut off too little from the end of your piping bag, the frosting may come out in too narrow a stream or not at all.

You might consider testing your piping bag on a plate or piece of scrap paper before applying any to your cake.

, Beginners who are still mastering the art of cake writing might want to lightly draw the message beforehand in the cake with a toothpick.This guide will help you limit mistakes while applying frosting with your piping bag., Though cursive looks great when written with a piping bag, it might be a little difficult for you to attempt a full message your first try, but you may have better luck printing your message in dots.You might also find that block letter or bubble letters are easier for you to draw with your piping bag. Try various styles on scrap paper before moving to the real thing., You can bring out the border of your cake or highlight your main design with Kit-Kat segments or a trail of M&Ms. If you want to create a straight line of colored sprinkles, red and green as an example, first pour your sprinkles onto a clean piece of paper. Then:

Pick up the piece of paper in a way that cups the sprinkles in it.
Round the far edge of the paper.
Angle rounded mouth of the paper just above the area of the cake where you want your sprinkle design.
Tap the paper lightly with your fingers to jostle the sprinkles toward the rounded end of the paper.
Move your paper along the line you want the sprinkles, tapping your finger to slowly jostle more sprinkles off the rounded edge.
Discard your paper and any excess sprinkles when finished.

, It has long been a holiday tradition to make gingerbread houses with the family, so why not add some gingerbread to your cake as a border decoration?You could include some fruit flavored candy canes in your border to give a sweet edge to your cake., The sparkle of glitter can give your Christmas tree design the impression of snow on its branches. Red and green glitter on your rich, luxurious chocolate frosting might tempt Santa away from his cookies!, Fondant is a decorative icing that can be molded into many different shapes and designs.Mix up a batch of fondant and use it to make designs that match your cake's theme. Fondant can also be purchased in the baking section of most general retailers.

If you made a square shaped cake, you could frost it in a solid color and make a fondant ribbon to give your cake the appearance of a present.

, The white buttercream frosting of your cake can quickly transform into a winter scene with a few additions.

Cap the cake with a wedding topper.",How to Decorate a Wedding Cake," The lucky couple may have some very specific features they expect in their wedding cake, so you should ask about color preferences, wedding theme, floral arrangements, and venue. All of these tidbits can help you imagine the ideal cake for their wedding and decorate it to perfection.


Consider including flowers the bride and groom plan on using in their floral arrangements as decorations for your cake.Remember to ask how many guests will be attending the wedding; this will influence many of your cake decorating decisions, including the number and size of its layers.;
, This is especially important if the bride and groom are paying you for your services. Investigate the cost of the kind of decorations and ingredients you plan on using and then convey this information to the bride and groom, or ask them directly what your budget is and plan on staying under that limit.


If money's tight, you might suggest a square design for the wedding cake, which generally feed more guests., This will give you a sense for the kind of wedding that will be held, along with other important information, like whether the location will be temperature controlled. Summer weddings that are held outdoors are not the ideal place for cream based frosting, like buttercream, which can spoil easily in the sun.


You might try coating your buttercream frosting with a layer of fondant to help preserve it from spoiling.Buttercream under your fondant has the added bonus of providing a buffer layer between any bumps in your cake and the outer frosting. This means your frosting will look smooth and even., Take into account the time of year the wedding will be held. From your interview with the bride and groom, you should know roughly the features that will be on display at the wedding. If these coordinate with the season, your cake might benefit from matching that motif.


For example, if the wedding will be held in winter and the bride desires a ""Winter Wonderland"" theme, you might include glitter and snowflake patters in blue and white icing on your cake.

, An uneven cake will become obvious when on display in the center of attention. Many cake experts keep a small carpenter's level in their cake-making kit for just this purpose.When your cake is firm and cooled:


Lay a clean piece of cardboard atop the cake and check its flatness with your level.

, This also might depend on the bride and groom's preference, but if you are planning on a multi-tier cake you'll need to support the tires somehow. Typically, this is either done either with dowels/drinking straws that have been cut to size as supports, or on a tiered cake stand.


A cake stand might be the best option for beginning decorators, as it will be more stable and not in danger of collapsing on itself., When frosting your cake, even experts lose drips here and there. To keep these drips from making it to the main stage, professionals tear four square of parchment paper and then place the corners of these under the cake.


When finished icing, pull the corners of your frosting drop cloth free to remove unsightly drips.

, As aforementioned, you might want to avoid buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or any frosting that might spoil easily if the venue cannot ensure temperature control. Fondant and marzipan are excellent options, though you should inform the bride and groom whenever you use nut products, like marzipan, as this is a common allergy.


A simple vanilla buttercream frosting recipe could be made by beating together in a mixing bowl:Softened butter (½ cup)Confectioners' sugar (4½ cups)Vanilla extract (1½ teaspoons)2% milk (5 to 6 tablespoons), The base of your cake should be supported by a clean cakeboard that is cut to fit the size of your cake. Glue your cakeboards into place underneath each level of your tiered cake by spreading a thing layer of your frosting between cake and cakeboard., A crumb coat is the first layer of icing that you apply to a cake to lock in any crumbs that might ruin the finished design. Take your offset spatula or frosting tool and glob a reasonable amount of frosting to the top of the tier you are applying the coat to. Then smooth it down to a thin layer, applying more frosting as necessary.


You should always apply icing when the cake is cool. Otherwise, the heat form the cake may cause melting.
To test your frosting for consistency, scoop some up with a spoon/spatula and hold it upside down. If it stays on the utensil without sliding or falling, it is the correct consistency.
Refrigerate your crumb coat for 20 - 30 minutes to firm up the crumb coat and prepare it for the actual outer layer of frosting., Your external layer doesn't need to be thick and pillowy, but it should be even and smooth. Begin at the top and using small applications of frosting, smooth your frosting over your crumb coat evenly.Allow your frosting to rest and firm up after you have finishing by putting it in a refrigerator for about 20 - 30 minutes.

, Now that your cakeboards are in place and your frosting application completed, you can move on to stacking your cake. If you are using a cake stand, all the easier - simply put each tier in place on the stand and your cake is stacked. If using supports, you'll need to:


Cut clean wooden dowels to the same length for your supports.
Arrange your dowels in each layer of your cake excluding the top layer.
Leave an inch between the border of each cakeboard and your supports.
Stack one layer atop the next.
Consider running a long, thin, sharpened dowel through the center of each tier to stabilize your cake., Fondant is a sugar based paste that can be compared to play dough in consistency. Due to its pliability, its uniform texture, and its ability to be dyed any color, fondant is frequently used by cake masters to finish cakes or fashion decorative shapes, like flowers, figures, and ruffles.You can mix your own fondant, though it may be easier for you to buy a pre-made batch. Then you can drape it over your cake or shape it into designs.

, If you're new to using a pastry bag, you should practice writing your message several times on a scrap piece of paper or a plate first. You might also simulate the contour of a cake by practicing writing with your pastry bag on a piece of fruit, like an apple. Once you're comfortable, distribute your message across the surface of your cake.A fine tip on your pastry bag is ideal for writing messages.
You might plot out your message or the letter of your monogram with toothpicks first. Then you can trace the holes left by the toothpicks with your icing., This can be difficult for beginners, but using your pastry bag you can create borders, pearls, or flowers out of the frosting. You may even want to try a Cornelli pattern, which is where a very thin layer of frosting is applied to the surface of the frosting in squiggly lines that thread throughout the exterior without touching or crossing any lines. You might try:Making roses with icing

Decorating with fondant

, To protect your decorations from damage during transport or from causing unnecessary strain on your frosting/fondant, you should wait to place the most of your decorations until the morning the wedding. Don't forget all of your cake decorating tools; you may have to touch up some spots in addition to adding finishing touches., Edible glitter is relatively inexpensive and can create a magical glow in your cake. This glow can camouflage small imperfections, like bumps that may have formed in your icing.

, A good example of this would be flowers, which can wilt if left out for too long. Place the clean, fresh flowers in a nice arrangement on the cake right before it is displayed to guests. This touch creates a simple but elegant wedding cake decoration., You'll want to be sure that the flowers you use for decorating your cake are pesticide-free and non-toxic flower. You can find these at a local florist or an organic garden, though you may want to inform the florist your purposes for the flowers.Inspect your flowers carefully before adding any to your cake. Small bugs will likely be attracted to the sugar in your frosting and can ruin its appearance., A barren platter can leave your cake looking unfinished. You might scatter flower petals at its base, or lace an elaborate ribbon around it. Fruit that matches the color theme of the wedding can also be heaped delicately around the bottom to good effect., This will depend on the bride and groom. They may want a traditional miniature man and woman in formal wear atop their cake, or they might want Han Solo and princess Leia. Place your cake topper and your cake is ready to be admired!"

Make a cake.,
Make the head and body.,
Make the legs for your cat cake.,
Make the face, ears, tail and patchwork details.,
Make the paw prints for your cat cake.,
Place a fondant ball of wool on your cat cake to really add character and bring it to life.,
Place your cats and balls of wool on and even around your cat cake.

",How to Decorate a Cat Cake," You will need a round 8 inch (20.3 cm) cake, double depth and covered in a base color fondant.


Cut the cake in half before covering it with fondant, fill with frosting and then crumb coat the cake.
Place it on your serving plate, platter or cake board of choice after the cake is crumb coated and chilled.
Cover the cake in the main fondant color using about 1kg of fondant icing. Roll out, cover, and trim, then smooth out the fondant on the top and around the sides either by using the palm of your hand or a fondant smoother. Set aside until later.;
,


Massage the fondant until soft and then cut pieces for the main body, head, back legs, front legs (which are a little smaller), ears and tail.
Roll the main body piece into and round pear shape, narrower at the top than at the bottom but not to much, flatten slightly on the top. Sit it on a piece of grease proof paper.
Roll the head into an oval a little like a football but with the top of the head being a little more pointed. When you are happy with the shape of the head you need to secure it to the body.
Using a cocktail stick (you may need to make it shorter) push it into the body from the neck downwards, ensuring there is still some showing out of the top. Using a small paint brush, brush either a little water or sugar paste glue around the area where the head will sit. Now sick the head on to the top end of the cocktail stick. This will secure the head to the body.

,


Roll the rear leg pieces into a ball and then lengthen into a sausage shape narrowing at one end so it is kind of shaped like a mini caveman’s club.
Take the thicker end which will be the feet and tap on the table to flatten, squeeze in on one side to get the impression of the feet. You may need to play with it for a while.
Mark the feet with 3 little lines with a cocktail stick to mimic claws. At the narrow end of the leg curve the piece around so that it can curve around the cat’s body.
Keep placing it around the body until you’re happy with the shape. When you are, use a little water or glue and stick to the main body.
Shape the shorter fore legs in the same way but they should sit a little further back and rest on the back legs.

,


Roll the pieces for the ears until smooth and then squeeze and flatten between your fingers until you get a triangle shape, cut until you get the right size for the head. When you are happy take a small amount of contrasting coloured fondant, perhaps the one you used on the main cake, and roll out until quite thin.
Cut a small triangle slightly smaller than the ear, dab on a little water or glue and place on to the ear. You can do this to just one ear or both.
Using a cocktail stick, dip into a dark blue liquid fondant colour and apply small polka dots on the ear patch, (test this out on a spare piece so you know how much to apply and how big a dot you want).
Try the ears against the cats head, shape the edge a little, apply water/glue and affix to the head.
Using the same piece of rolled contrasting fondant cut a couple of small squares for patches, either leave plain or decorate with dots like the ear. Apply these with water or glue to the legs and arms of the cat.
For the face/mouth area roll a small ball of fondant in your hand and then flatten slightly with your fingers and shape in to an oval, then use a rolling pin to flatten until quite thin. When you have the desired shape and size, glue to the face. Using a fine paint brush and liquid fondant colour paint on the cat’s nose and mouth and whiskers as shown in the photograph.
For the eyes simply poke small holes close together above the nose area.
For the tail, roll a ball then work into a sausage shape, keep rolling until you have a long worm shape. Work the fondant until you reach the thickness and length you require. Narrow the tail at the end to be able to glue it to the back of the cat, curve the tail around the cat to the front of the body.
Do not glue the tail on until you have positioned the cat on the cake or it make break off when you lift it off the grease proof paper. Keep the fondant cat on grease proof paper until you are ready to transfer to the cake.

,


Take a good sized piece of contrasting color fondant; more is always better than not enough. Roll into a sausage shape about 2 fingers thick and then flatten slightly so that the sausage is now oval in shape. Now take a sharp knife and cut 2 slices about 1.5 to 2 millimetres in thickness.
Test the first one for size, flatten a little using your fingers and then gently roll until you get the shape and size of paw print you want (this is just the main paw pad, not the little finger spots). The shape should be oval but slightly flatter on one long side than the other.
If you’re happy with the size then as a guide using the second slice cut out as many as you think you require. If it’s too big or too small, increase or decrease the size using the 2nd slice as a guide. Flatten and shape all the pieces and then place them around the cake at intervals pointing in different directions.
For the small finger spots, roll a long thin worm and then slice with a sharp knife and flatten with your finger. Stick to the cake; four spots per paw.

, Making them is a little fiddly but easy.


Roll a ball of fondant to the approximate size you want, (the end ball will be slightly bigger). Now take your fondant and roll until about 3mm think and in an oval shape rather than circular.
Using a sharp knife or, even better, a pizza cutter, cut long thin strips about 2-3 mm width, use a rule as a guide if that helps. Take a long stringy piece and roll gently between your palms until you have made the pieces round and lengthened a little.
Take the ball you made and wet with water or fondant glue. Take the strip and place over the top of the ball and wrap round both sides but do not wrap underneath yet. Continue doing this laying each string snugly next to the one another until you start getting to the edge of the ball. Now lift up the ball carefully, tip over and wrap the loose ends of each string on both sides underneath the ball, trim and stick down.
Now turn the ball around and repeat the process in the other direction just like a ball of wool. If you check the photo you will see what I mean. Again when this side is done, lift the ball, wrap the loose piece underneath, trim and stick.
Before placing the ball of wool on the cat cake, select it position and then place a single long piece of fondant wool in a nice loop on the cake and then place the wool ball on top.

, The paste is more stable than liquid food coloring, making it easier to work into the paste.

, Don't put too much on the end of the skewer, just a little dab. Remember that it's always best to only add a little, as you can always add more but you can't remove once it has been added (with the exception of adding more sugar paste).

, Place the colored skewer end onto the sugar paste, then drag it across the surface to leave a trail of color.

, These will protect your hands from the color dye.

, Keep kneading until the color is even. If you need more color, add in the same manner and knead some more until the color you want is achieved.


If the tone is too dark, add more white sugar paste to even it out.

, After this rest, it should mold and shape as needed, and the color will remain stable.

Find out where your flowers came from.,
Look for flowers grown organically.,
Choose flowers that complement your cake.,
Use edible flowers.,
Wash the flowers thoroughly.",How to Add Fresh Flowers to a Cake1," Not all types of flowers are safe to eat. Don’t buy flowers that have been treated with pesticides, insecticides, growth agents or other toxic chemicals. These can make you very sick.In general, it may be best to find a source other than supermarket florists for fresh flowers. Most of the flowers sold in these places are grown in highly-controlled conditions using various chemicals.;
, Check with the florist to see if the flowers they sell are grown organically. Flowers grown naturally are generally the best to use for culinary purposes, as they don’t contain chemical additives that can leach into your cake. In most cases, vendors are required to disclose whether or not their flowers are organic.Visit a local farm, greenhouse or flower nursery to find flowers that have been cultivated using safe, organic growing practices.Even organic flowers may not be suitable for human consumption. Certain species contain saps and microbes that may cause irritation to the eyes, skin or digestive tract if they come into contact with food., Think about the kind of cake you’re making when you pick out flowers to decorate it. Try to match colors and textures, or create a tasteful contrast. For instance, white flowers such as will look subtle and elegant on a white cake, whereas bright red roses might be used to offset softer pastel colored cakes.Take a look at which types of flowers are safe to consume or use in foods and which are harmful., Certain species of flowering plants can be safely consumed. These flowers offer unique, perfumed flavor notes and make an effortless addition to floral cakes because they don't need to be removed prior to serving. Some of the most common types of edible flowers include roses, begonias, chrysanthemums, daisies, dandelions and hibiscus. Each of these edibles can be distinguished by their subtle flavors, which should be used to enhance the flavor of the cake they're to be added to.Flowers like dandelion, chicory and calendula feature bright, zesty notes that can be used to offset the sweetness of a frosted cake, while mild herbal flowers like hibiscus and lavender work well with naked cakes and those garnished with fresh fruit.Though they are technically edible, it is not advisable to use more fragrant types of flowers like roses, carnations and jasmine as food additives, as the chemicals that lend them their characteristic scents can easily overpower the flavors of the confection.

, Before you begin decorating, rinse the flower from petal to stem under a light stream of cool water. Just like with produce, you should wash flowers before putting them to culinary use to remove any traces of soil, bacteria or insects. Even if the flowers you’ve bought are organically grown, they should be rinsed to avoid contaminated food items.Be careful not to damage the delicate flower blossoms by rinsing them under too high a water pressure or scrubbing them by hand.

,
Knead the color through the coconut.,
Use the colored coconut as needed.",How to Color Coconut1," If you're using the coconut for a meal or dessert, check the recipe for the suggested amount. If there is no amount specified, do a good estimate by guessing.;
,, You only need to add one to two drops of the food dye for it to spread its color quickly through the coconut. Add more food coloring for a darker color only once you know what the first few drops have achieved color-wise.

,, Place the bag down on a flat work surface and press and push the coconut inside the bag. This will distribute the color through the coconut. Keep kneading until the color is evenly distributed.

, This can be used immediately or it can be left to use later. To store the colored coconut, place the sealed bag into the refrigerator until needed (check that the the seal is airtight, to keep it from drying out and to prevent bad odors from crossing into the coconut). Use within a few days of creating it.

Cut the stems short.,
Wrap the stems to protect the cake.,
Insert the flowers into the top of the cake.,
Create custom arrangements.",How to Add Fresh Flowers to a Cake2," Use a pair of scissors to snip the stems off about an inch below the blossom. This will leave you with a nub just the right length to insert into the cake. Soak the stems of the cut flowers in water for several minutes before decorating to wash away any remaining bacteria or juices.You should soak the stem even if you’ve already rinsed the flower. Flowers stems contain copious amounts of water mingled with botanical elements. These can seep into the cake if you’re not careful.
Fresh flowers don't last long after they're cut, especially in hot temperatures. If possible, add the flowers to the cake right before you serve it. Consider using water tubes to protect the stems (and the cake) after cutting them and allow them to soak up some much-needed moisture.

, If you’ve shopped around for non-toxic organically grown flowers, there should be no problem with pressing the flower directly into the cake. However, if you’re still uncomfortable with the idea, go around the stems a couple of times with plastic wrap or aluminum foil before adding the flowers. This way, the stem never has to come into contact with the cake at all.You may also be able to find some long, cylindrical water tubes to use to cover the flower stems. These will keep the flowers fresh for longer, as well.As a possible alternative, roll fondant into thick shapes, place them on top of the cake and press the flowers into these rather than the cake itself., Decide where you want each flower to go on top of the cake. Push the flower stem down through the cake’s surface, stopping just beneath the blossom so that none of the stem is visible. It will look like the blossom itself is resting gently on the cake. The flowers can be removed prior to serving or eating the cake.Snipping the stems at a sharp angle can help you penetrate the top layer of the cake without making a mess.

, Group the flowers in clusters, or combine different types to create a cake bouquet. Take the same care you would in designing a flower arrangement for a table centerpiece. Once again, consider the occasion, as well as the kinds of flowers that are in season and will provide a pleasant aesthetic with the cake you’ve prepared.Roses and carnations make ideal floral decorations for a traditional wedding cake.
Play around with different sizes of flowers as well as different colors.

"
"
Use whole flowers.,
Place flowers between the cake layers.,
Sprinkle flower petals around the base.,
Mix edible flowers with fresh fruit.",How to Add Fresh Flowers to a Cake3," For a simpler method of presentation, lay uncut flowers with long stems across the top of the cake, or on the platter around the based. Cut wax paper or roll a thin layer of fondant to cover the part of the cake that touches the flower. One or two whole flowers will make for a modestly beautiful look.Be sure to trim away any thorns, leaves or visible imperfections from the flower stems before situating them on the cake.
Whole flowers can be used to spruce up naked or smaller cakes in a breeze.

, Rather than inserting flowers into the top of the cake, stick them between the layers on the outer edges of larger cakes. This will create the effect that the flowers are blooming out of the cake. Use foam dividers if you’re worried about damaging the layers or contaminating the cake.Place fresh flowers in a ring around the base, middle layers and top of the cake to create a festive border.

, Gently remove the petals from your flowers of choice. Be careful not to mash or tear them. Use a loose hand to sprinkle them around the base of the cake, or sparingly on top. Flower petals can give your cake an infusion of color and bohemian grace without the need to mess with soaking, cutting and arranging whole blossoms.Loose flowers petals can be picked off before serving, or eaten, provided that they belong to an edible species.

, Some types of flowers are safe to be actually eaten. Mix in a small amount of these flowers with fruit, candies and other confections for a dessert with bright, floral notes. Clover, marjoram and hibiscus are all common flower varieties that can make a great cake topper.It may be better to avoid decorating with especially fragrant types of edible flowers such as roses and jasmine, as the chemicals that produce their trademark scents can easily overpower the flavors of a cake.Use a light hand when finishing cakes with flowers that are meant to be eaten. Their petals can sometimes be dry, waxy and hard to chew and swallow in great quantities.

Pour the tablespoon of water into a suitably sized jar with a wide mouth (if you have a mason jar, that will do nicely).,
Shake the jar to distribute the color through the water.,
Add the coconut to the colored water.,
Dry the coconut.,
Repeat for each of the remaining colors.,
Store each color separately.,
Mix the colors just before use.,
Use the colored coconut.",How to Color Coconut2," You'll only need a small amount of water, about a tablespoon, although the precise amount can vary with the amount of coconut you use. Add 1 to 2 drops of a single color of food coloring. The more you add, the darker the color, so do this with care. Put the lid or cover on the jar.

, Check that you're happy with the color that results. If the color is too light, add more food coloring; if it's too dark, add water to thin it, then dispose of any excess water before adding the coconut.

, Place the lid back on the jar and shake to color all of the coconut. As the coconut soaks up the water, it will also soak up the color and absorb the dye.

, If there is any liquid left in the jar, strain the coconut out using a tea strainer or other wire mesh strainer, and dispose of the excess water. Then arrange the wet coconut on a paper towel or sheet of parchment or wax paper, to dry.


Once dry, it is ready to use.

, Be sure to wash the jar out thoroughly between color changes to avoid mixing colors accidentally, and dry each color of coconut separately.

, After all the coconut has dried, place each new color into its own bowl or resealable plastic bag. Storing each color separately will keep the different colors bright and fresh, whereas storing all the colors together in one container could allow them to blend and turn into an unappealing brownish color.

, When you're ready to use the rainbow coconut, add equal amounts of each of the colors to one bowl. Mix with your hands or a spoon to distribute the colors evenly. You will now have a rainbow-colored mixture of coconut.

, The bright, appealing colors make rainbow coconut a great topping for cakes, cookies, or other food. Add it to cake frosting or use in whatever way strikes your fancy.


If not using immediately, place inside a resealable bag and store in the refrigerator.

",How to Decorate a Casual Cake in 20 Minutes," Don't just start decorating straight away, taking a few minutes to decide on a colour scheme and design can be the difference between a masterpiece and a disaster.
, Make sure you have everything you're going to need to decorate your cake somewhere you can get to easily and check that you have enough of it, you don't want to be running to the shops halfway through decorating because you've run out of icing.

, Choose a type of icing which is suitable for your design. You can either ice the whole cake (top and sides) or just the top, either method can look good if done tidily.


Add food dye or cocoa to your icing before putting it on your cake if you wish to change the colour.
Adding lemon juice or flavouring to your icing won't change how it looks, but can make the cake taste much nicer.

, You may choose to pipe icing around the bottom, or maybe just tie a ribbon around it. A border makes your cake look more professional and tidies up the bottom.

, Depending on the occasion you may wish to write a message for the receiver of the cake. Try to keep your message fairly sure, as writing on cake will be much larger than normal handwriting and is time consuming. You can use either writing icing or cake markers to write your message on the cake.

A ribbon that is broad enough to cover the entire side of the cake can alleviate the need to add icing or frosting to the cake sides, thereby cutting down on an additional source of sugar and perhaps fat if you're using buttercream. It looks elegant and is a great way to dress up a tall cake.

, Leave a small amount extra on the length to allow for neatly tucking under when encircling the cake., Avoid getting icing or frosting on the front, as it will show., This piece should have a dab of icing or frosting behind it. Then take the ribbon all the way around the cake, with a dab at even intervals to ensure that it stays on., Cut off any excess ribbon sticking out.,, If you'd like to make your own, see How to make bows. The bow needs to be tight and not likely to come loose; this may necessitate stitching it into shape before using.,, Either use one large bow once in a strategic position, or use several smaller bows spaced around the ribbon at even intervals., These can be attached either straight to the cake or on the ribbon, using the icing or frosting dabs."

;
, You could head to a bakery, or just go on google images. The internet can definitely give you ideas and inspiration.

, Decorating a cake requires additional effort; hence, it makes sense for the reason to decorate it to be a good one. It wouldn't be worth trying to decorate cakes that are to be eaten warm from the oven, such as a cake topped in syrup or sauce. The point of such cakes is that they're already as good as they need to be. And some cakes are fine without decoration or with decoration, such as fruit cakes, and it is really the occasion that helps you to decide whether or not to decorate. Cakes that are suitable for decorating include:









Cupcakes
Christmas cakes
Wedding cakes
Children's party cakes
Special age birthday party cakes
A doll cake (known in the cake decorating world as a ""Dolly Varden"" cake)
Farewell cakes
Novelty ""geek"" cakes, often based on a computer, electronic, science fiction, etc., theme; often very fiddly work!
Gift cakes
Cakes for fundraising at bazaars, fairs, galas, etc.
Photo op cakes – cakes being photographed for a special occasion, a blog, a Flickr photostream, an instructional article, etc.
Cakes being entered into competitions.

, It's important to feel comfortable with the frosting or icing techniques required for decorating cakes; some are more complicated than others and if you're just starting out, it's recommended that you don't take on difficult decoration projects until your confidence increases. Typical frosting or icing styles include:










Buttercream or Vienna cream – this is an easy-to-use frosting that fills gaps and covers up all sorts of unsightly cake bumps and dips! It produces a whipped cream style of appearance and can be smoothed down or allowed to settle in peaks. Buttercream frosting is easy to color and flavor, with typical flavors including chocolate, vanilla, lemon, coffee, and strawberry.
Fluffy frosting – this uses a frosting created by beating in an electric mixer. This must be applied on the day it is to be served; it has a marshmallow type consistency. In storage, the frosting becomes a little crisp and loses its gloss.
Sugar paste – sugar paste is rolled fondant. It's usually easiest to purchase it ready-made from cake decorating suppliers.
Royal icing – this is similar to sugar paste and is often available ready-made.
Pastillage – this icing comes from the cake decorating supplier in powder form and is very useful for intricate decorating work that you need to keep in shape. It's a sugar paste dough or gum and can also be made from scratch. The icing dries very quickly, and once dry, it is so hard it will ""snap"" if bent. It has a high ability to resist breaking down in the presence of moisture. The downside to this icing is that you'll need to work with it very fast, before it dries. If you want to use pastillage for modeling, you'll need to mix it 50/50 with sugar paste.
Petal paste – this icing is ideal for making flowers, as it produces extremely fine detail. It's a good idea to slightly dampen your fingers when working with this paste.
Sugar glue – this isn't icing but a ""glue"" that allows you to stick together pieces modeled from icing.
Modeling paste – this is a combination of sugar paste mixed with tragacanth gum to make an edible modeling paste.
Pre-made icing sheets with printed designs – these are popular for children's cakes and feature such designs as movie, cartoon, and TV show characters. Follow the instructions provided on how to apply these to the cake's surface.
Dusted icing sugar – while very simple, this can be very effective on the right type of cake, especially where the cake's constitution is already sufficiently rich without adding icing or frosting (such as flourless cakes and dessert cakes).

, There are many other means for decorating a cake besides icing or frosting. You can use such items in combination with icing, or add them direct to the cake. These include:










Fruit – fresh fruit pieces, dried fruit, fruit arranged into shapes such as flowers or animals, glazed fruit (with jam, etc.), toffee-dipped, crystallized rind, etc.
Flowers – edible flowers can make a cake appear very elegant
Cream – thickened cream can be shaped into quenelles, spread over a cake, used for filling or piped on
Candies – all sorts of candies can make excellent cake designs
Drizzled chocolate – either randomly drizzled, or in a pre-determined pattern
Dusted cocoa or other chocolate – chocolate curls, sprinkles, pieces, shapes, etc.
Nuts – especially halved, slivered, or shaved nuts
Streusel topping – baked on, no need to decorate other than a quenelle of cream next to each serve
Toffee strands, shards, or shapes – you'll need to practice making these until you get the knack of it but toffee can work well as a decorative element on a cake

Coconut (shredded or desiccated) – coconut can be colored using food coloring (use wet hands or wet gloved hands to rub the coloring through); it can also be toasted
Jam or preserves.

, There are a number of helpful techniques that can help your cake decorating experience:









Painting on sugar – use food coloring and a small, fine paintbrush for painting color on sugar paste, petal paste, pastillage, and royal icing. The paintbrush must be barely dampened, in order to avoid causing color run on the icing or sugar model.
Stippling – use a medium sized brush with a firm head to dot paint across a smooth icing surface.
Piping on icing or frosting – piping is an excellent way to create designs on the surface of a cake. Designs can include flowers, hearts, writing, borders, patterns, etc. Piping equipment can be purchased commercially, or you can make piping bags using paper or plastic at home.
Shaping cakes – the ability to create amazing shapes in cakes is about breaking down square, rectangle or circular cakes through ""sculpting"" and reassembling them into the desired shape. Use a sharp, serrated knife to cut a basic butter cake or madeira cake into the appropriate shapes, following the instructions of a recipe. If you accidentally cut off more than you wished, ""glue"" it back on using buttercream.
Always decorate the rim of the cake unless this would detract from your design. Take a piping bag and make draping designs around the cake. In general, leaving the rims and sides un-iced makes the cake look ""unfinished"".

, When choosing the color themes for your decorated cake, consider the following things to help you choose the right colors:









Is the cake for someone who adores a particular color?
Is the cake a character cake that needs to be colored in a particular way? Many children's cakes will be like this, and you can use photos online to guide your coloring choices.
Is the cake for a special occasion, such as a graduation party? In this instance, you might like to use the person's future college colors!
Use sprinkles, other frosting colors, or different types of chocolate for extra color.

, There isn't enough space to explain the art of making decorations out of candies, dried fruit, vegetables, other baked goods, etc., but it's important to be creative when you're trying to make features for a cake. For example, you can make a perfectly acceptable mouse by using a date with two small candies tucked in for ears and a long rope of licorice sticking out as a tail. When placed on a cake, it makes for a realistic mouse. Or, use round candies as porthole windows in a ship, sliced marshmallows as flower petals, button candies as keys on a keyboard or phone pad, form a white ball of frosting as a golf ball, etc., and many candies can be put to imaginative use as eyes, whiskers, ears, noses, tails, etc.









Use online searches for cake decorations (photos, blogs, etc.), to inspire new ideas for using food items creatively on your cakes.

, While there is no need to over-complicate a cake with anything inedible, sometimes adding plastic or paper decorations can add special touches that none of the previously discussed methods can achieve. Some examples include:










Wedding cake toppers such as depictions of the bride and groom, bells, doves, or an archway.
Animals for a farm, theme park, or zoo scene. Where making all these animals in modeling paste might be too time-consuming or frustrating, turning to the plastic equivalent is a cinch. Just be sure that they're thoroughly washed first.

, Ensuring that the cake plate is suited to the overall design will ensure the cake's final decorative touch.









Plates with patterns should not clash with the decorative design. Yet, with a cake that is more plainly decorated, a patterned plate can set it off perfectly.
Basic white plates are elegant and easy to match to all decorative styles.
Bold colors on plates can work well provided it doesn't clash with the cake's main color.
Glass plates are lovely with decorated cakes; there is an old world effect brought about by a cake on glass.
Cake stands are perfect for many decorated cakes; they lift the cake up for ease of viewing and make it the centerpiece of the table.
If you don't want to use a plate or a cake stand, consider using a cake board. Cake boards make it easy to handle the cake for transportation, whether it be from your kitchen to the dining room, or from your kitchen via the car to somewhere else completely! These can be made at home using cardboard or thin wooden board covered with foil, or they can be purchased ready-made from a cake decorating supplier.

Display Your Cupcakes on a Cupcake Tower.",How to Choose the Best Decorations for Cupcakes," You are probably saying to yourself, “I already know this”. Well, the cheapest way to decorate your cupcake is to use a decorative cupcake liner. When cupcake liners first appeared, they only came in a white paper color. Through the years, cupcake liners have evolved and now you can get them in almost any size and design. Polka dot cupcake liners and gingham cupcake liners are among some of the most popular liners that there are. Want a cheap and easy way to decorate your cupcake? Throw away those white cupcake liners and get some pizzazz going with decorative cupcake liners.

, After you find that perfect cupcake liner for your cupcakes, you need to find the perfect cupcake wrap to match your design objective. Cupcake wraps have become the biggest cupcake trend to-date. Instead of presenting your cupcakes in those plain cupcake liners, use a cupcake wrap the next time you want to dress up your cupcake. Cupcake wraps are like clothing for your cupcake. You don’t want your cupcake to be naked now, do you? Cupcake wraps are pieces of paper that are cut, usually by a paper laser cutter, to fit around each one of your cupcakes. Cupcake wrappers come in many different designs and sizes. They are available in mini, standard and jumbo cupcake sizes. You can find a design perfect for any party theme or event. Cupcake wrappers are placed around the outside of the cupcake liner after the cupcake has baked and is cooled. You do not want to bake the cupcake wraps as they will catch on fire and burn your house down. After the cupcake wrap is placed around the cupcake, then you will apply your frosting., The typical edible cupcake decoration is usually the cupcake sprinkles. Sprinkles are fine, if you want the regular run-of-the-mill cupcake, but there are so many more options for edible cupcake decorations in order to bedazzle your cupcake. Today, they have edible decorations like colored sanding sugar, edible glitter, edible confetti and even edible spray paint. One example of using an edible decoration would be to top your cupcake with brown sanding sugar. This would make the cupcake’s top look like a sandy ground. Purchase some edible candy seashells and put on top of the brown sugar. Now you have a sandy beach theme going and would be perfect for the beachcomber’s birthday party.

, Cupcake toppers are very popular. If the cupcake liner, cupcake wrapper and the edible decorations just aren’t cutting it for you, then move on up and add a cupcake topper. To conclude the decorating idea from the edible cupcake decorations section, you could purchase a cupcake topper like a surfboard and use the sandy ground and seashells as a backdrop for your cupcake toppers. What do you end up with? A beach themed cupcake decorated just like the professionals. The sky is the limit with these easy and affordable cupcake decorations. Don’t forget the sea blue cupcake wrapper to complete the look.

, After you have decorated your cupcake with your decorative liner, cupcake wrap, edible decorations and cupcake topper, make sure your don’t leave the most important piece of the decoration process…the cupcake tower, also known as a cupcake stand or cupcake tree. The cupcake tower has become the new trend in cupcake displays. Cupcakes are displayed on cupcake towers and stands and provide an attractive and finished look to your cupcake decoration endeavors. Cupcake stands have become very popular in modern day weddings. Many brides-to-be are opting to have a cupcake wedding cake instead of the traditional wedding cake. Cupcake stands also make a great centerpiece for the table at any party or event. Display and serve your decorated cupcakes in style with a cupcake tower, cupcake stand or cupcake tree.

",How to Make Lemon Bars,", The simplest way to prepare one is to lightly grease it. If you plan on taking the bars out of the pan, line the pan with parchment paper instead Be sure to leave some paper hanging over the sides. This way, you can use the excess paper like handles and lift the pastry out before you cut it., Both methods will work just fine, but the food processor will save you lots of time.

, You can do this with some pastry knives, or by rubbing the mixture between your fingers.If you are using a food processor, pulse everything for a few seconds until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

, Scoop the mixture out of the bowl or food processor, and start patting it into the bottom of the pan. It will be crumbly, but it will hold together once you bake it.


To keep your fingers clean, place a sheet of parchment paper over the crust once you have it in the pan, and smooth it down. Remove the sheet when you are done.

, How long you bake it for will depend on your baking pan and oven.

, You will be using the oven again shortly to bake the filling.

, If you accidentally turned your oven off, turn it back on and let it reach the right temperature.

, Crack open the eggs, and add them into a large mixing bowl. Beat them with a whisk until they are smooth., It might help if you sift in the flour instead. This will lessen the chances of any lumps forming.

, The lemon zest is not necessary, but it will make your lemon bars a little more tart. Make sure that you zest the lemons before you cut and juice them; it'll be easier and less messy this way. Once you have the lemon zest, add it to the mixture, and stir it in well., You may have to use a spatula to help spread it around. There should be no crust visible when you are done.

, The edges will turn golden brown, and the top will set, sort of like custard. Don't worry if the lemon bars look lumpy or custard-y. They will solidify once they cool down., The lemon bars must reach room temperature before you refrigerate them. Depending on how warm or cool it is in your kitchen, this will take about 1 hour.If you put warm food into the fridge, you risk spoiling the surrounding food.

, Keep in mind that your lemon bars may need more time to cool/set, depending on the temperature of your fridge.


You can leave the lemon bars in the fridge overnight as well.

, For a standard-sized portion, aim for something that is about 2 inches (5.08) wide. You can cut the bars directly in the pan.


If you left the bars in the fridge overnight, let them reach room temperature (about 15 minutes) first, before you cut them.If you lined the pan with parchment paper, lift the pastry out of the pan first, then cut it on the counter., This is not necessary, but it will make them look pretty. You can use as much or as little powdered sugar as you'd like.

Know what a good muffin looks like.",How to Troubleshoot Muffins," If the muffins had peaks like Everest with too much color, this is known as ""peaked"". It usually means that the muffins have been baked in an oven that is too hot, or the muffin mixture was over-mixed.;
, This usually means that the muffin cavities in the pan were overfilled. Don't fill the holes more than two-thirds full.

, An undercooked muffin will have a center that is too moist and it doesn't peak enough. Usually this is caused by the oven not being hot enough or the cooking time was too short.

, Poorly risen muffins with a heavy, dense texture usually means that the raising agent was insufficient or ineffective (stale) or that the muffins were missing an ingredient or two. If you've made substitutions to the muffin, this may also be another reason for poor rising.

, Usually this means that either the oven temperature was too high or you left them in for too long. Use a timer if you're forgetful.

, When a muffin has baked properly, it will have an even texture and will have risen evenly in the centre. Overall the colour will appear golden. When looked at in the pan, the muffins will be starting to come away from the sides of the pan holes of their own accord.

Bake the muffins for 18 to 20 minutes.",How to Make Raspberry Muffins," Before you heat the oven, check that the rack is set up in the middle of the oven. That will help ensure that the muffins bake evenly because the hot air can circulate around the pan from both directions.Adjust your rack before you begin preheating or the rack may be too hot to handle.;
, Your oven needs be hot enough to bake the muffins when the batter is ready, so make sure you preheat it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).Watch your oven carefully so you know when it’s reached the right temperature before you put the muffins in. It will probably beep or flash a light when it’s at the designated temperature.

, To bake the muffins, you’ll need 1 to 2 muffin pans. The recipe makes approximately 20 muffins, so line your pan(s) with 20 paper muffin liners. That will keep the muffins from sticking to the pan and allow you to remove them easily.If you don’t have any liners on hand, you can grease the muffin pan with butter, margarine, or non-stick cooking spray instead.

, In a medium bowl, combine 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (5 g) baking powder, ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) baking soda, and ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) salt. Mix well so the ingredients are completely blended, and then set the bowl aside.Stir the dry ingredients together slowly to avoid sending the powder flying all over the kitchen.

, In a separate, large bowl, use an electric mixer on medium high to beat ½ cup (approximately 113 g) softened butter or margarine for 30 seconds. Next, add in 1 ¼ cup (approximately 296 g) sugar and beat with the butter until the two are thoroughly combined.If you don’t have an electric mixer, you can beat the butter and sugar together by hand. It just may take a little longer to combine the two.
Softened butter should feel cool to the touch, but your finger should leave an indentation if you apply slight pressure to it. To soften it, cut it into pieces and leave it out on the counter for approximately a half hour. You can also put in a microwave-safe bowl and heat it in the microwave at 10% power for 20 seconds. After the 20 seconds, check the butter to see if it needs additional time, and work in 5 second intervals., After the butter and sugar are combined, add in 2 eggs, 1 8-ounce (approximately 227 g) carton of sour cream, and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of vanilla. Beat on medium high speed with your electric mixer until all of the ingredients are thoroughly mixed together.If you don’t have any sour cream in your refrigerator, you can replace it with an equal amount of whole milk Greek yogurt., When all of your wet ingredients have been mixed, it’s time to start working in the flour mixture. Add the dry ingredients in small batches, and then use a spoon to to stir until they’re fully incorporated. Repeat until all of the flour mixture has been mixed in.Don’t worry if your batter isn’t entirely smooth after you mix in the flour and other dry ingredients. It should be slightly lumpy.

, When the batter is completely mixed, you should add in raspberries. With a spatula, gently fold in 1 cup (125 g) of fresh raspberries. Make sure that you’ve washed the berries well before mixing them into the muffin batter.Don’t use too much water when you’re washing your raspberries or they may become soggy. Give them a quick rinse while in a colander to remove any debris. If you have a salad spinner, give them a few spins in it to dry them thoroughly before adding them to the batter.
You can use 1 cup of frozen raspberries in place of fresh. Just make sure to thaw and drain them if you’re using frozen fruit.

, In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons (24 g) sugar, ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) ground cinnamon, and ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) ground nutmeg. Mix together with a spoon until thoroughly combined, and set aside.You don’t necessarily have to add the topping. Feel free to leave the muffins plain if you prefer.

, Take your lined or greased muffin pan, and begin filling the individual cups. Spoon enough batter to fill the cups approximately ¾’s of the way full. Next, sprinkle a pinch of the topping over the batter in the cups.Using a kitchen scoop is the easiest way to fill the muffin tins. A large or medium scoop should work well to fill the cups.

, Once you’ve filled the muffin tin with batter, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the muffins to bake for approximately 18 to 20 minutes or until the muffins become a golden brown color.You can also tell if the muffins are done by touching them. If the tops spring back when you touch them lightly, the muffins are finished.
The muffins are best served warm, but you should allow the muffins to cool on a wire rack for approximately 10 minutes so they’re not too hot.

Serve them now or wrap cooled muffins individually in plastic wrap and freeze.",How to Make Simple Muffins1,";
, Place paper liners in the cups of a regular-sized muffin pan, or spray each cup with non-stick vegetable oil and set aside. Liners will make clean-up quick and efficient.You can also spray the inside of the liners to make removing the muffins easier.
If you prefer your muffins to have a bit of a crust use a spray instead of liners., Use a spoon to fluff up the flour in the bag and then scoop it into a 1 cup (240 ml) dry measuring cup, but don’t pack it down. When it’s just overflowing, take the straight-edged side of a knife and smooth it across the measuring cup.You’ll end up using far more flour than a recipe calls for if you scoop flour from the bag with the measuring cup or if you pack it down, which will make muffins dry and hard.

, Use a wooden spoon to mix them together well, and then spin the spoon to create a well in the center where you will pour the wet ingredients.


Making bread-like muffins that are light and crumble easily utilize what’s called the muffin method, in which you mix the dry and wet ingredients separately and then barely stir – never use an electric mixer – the two together so the gluten in the flour isn’t over-activated.The well will help ensure you don’t over-mix the two, the chief mistake to avoid when making muffins. Over-mixing will make muffins dense and tough.

, First crack the egg on the edge of a small bowl, empty it into the bowl and check for eggshells. If you see any, use a fork to dig them out. Then use a whisk, electric mixer or fork to combine the oil, milk and egg in a medium-sized mixing bowl.

, As soon as you pour the wet ingredients into the well of the dry, use a wooden spoon to mix them, but only until the dry ingredients are just barely moistened.


The rule of thumb is to use between 10-15 strokes. The batter will be lumpy, and you may even see traces of flour. This is what you want.
Over-mixing causes long strands of gluten in the flour to develop, creating not only the toughness you want to avoid but also tunnels in muffins.

, Never let muffin batter rest because the baking powder will lose its leavening power, which is what makes baked goods rise. Use either a spoon or an ice scream scooper and fill each cup 2/3 full.


If you fill each cup all the way, the muffins will end up flat, not domed.
If you’re using a muffin pan that has more than 12 cups, spread out the batter so it’s not concentrated in one area. Then fill the empty cups halfway full with water., Place the muffin pan in the center rack of the oven for even heating and bake for 20-25 minutes. Rotate the pan about halfway through the baking time., Stick a toothpick in the center of a few muffins to see if the muffins are fully baked. If the toothpick is clean when you remove it, your muffins are ready. If not, continue cooking another five minutes and check again.


When bread-like muffins have fully baked, they should be golden brown and have a rounded, pebbly top.

, Take the pan from the oven, put it on a cooling rack and let the muffins cool so they won’t break when you remove them from the pan.


Then use a butter knife to lift the muffins from the cups and place them on the cooling rack.
Make sure you use oven mitts or gloves, or folded towels, to protect your hands from being burned when you remove the pan.

, You can also top them with yogurt, cream cheese, butter, a drizzle of white chocolate or whipped cream!


Thaw them at room temperature before eating if you decide to freeze them."

,
Prep the muffin pan.,
Mix the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until it’s light and fluffy.,
Add the egg to the sugar and butter mixture.,
Stir together the remaining dry ingredients.,
Combine the milk with both wet and dry mixtures alternately.,
Spoon the batter into muffin cups.,
Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes.,
Check to see if they’re done after 25 minutes.,
Remove the pan from the oven and let the muffins cool.,
Eat them while they're nice and warm or freeze for later!

",How to Make Simple Muffins2,", Either spray a regular-sized, 12-cup muffin pan with non-stick vegetable spray or put muffin or cupcake liners, which can also be sprayed, in each cup.

, Beat them together in a large mixing bowl on a medium speed for several minutes. You shouldn’t be able to see any sugar granules once done.


Cake-like muffins use what’s called the creaming method, in which you mix the butter and sugar before adding the egg(s), mix the remaining dry ingredients separately and then combine the two alternately with the milk.These recipes always call for more butter and sugar to act as tenderizers and minimize gluten development in the flour so muffins don’t become tough.This, along with how the sugar creates small air holes in the butter when creamed, makes the muffins moist and light.

, After you’ve cracked the egg in a separate bowl and removed any stray pieces of eggshell, use an electric mixer on a medium speed to beat the egg into the butter and sugar mixture. Then set it aside.

, Because you've already used the sugar, now mix the flour, baking soda and salt with a wooden spoon in a medium-sized bowl.

, First add some of the dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir with a wooden spoon just until the dry ingredients are coated. Then add about half of the milk and stir until the batter becomes slightly moist. Repeat until everything is mixed and smooth.


As with bread-like muffins, you don’t want to over-mix, but you will have to use more than 10-15 strokes to combine the ingredients in this last stage of mixing.

, Use either a spoon or an ice cream scooper and immediately fill the cups 2/3 full so the leavening agent – the baking powder – still has enough “kick” to make the muffins rise.


Don’t fully fill the cups so the muffins have a nice domed shape.

, Place the pan in the center rack of the oven for consistent and even heat distribution.


Some muffin pans have a very dark pre-coating. If yours does, reduce the oven temperature by 25˚F as darker-colored pans absorb more heat, therefore becoming hotter and transmitting more heat to what’s baking inside.Rotate the pan midway through baking to ensure they’re baking evenly and to adjust the oven temperature if needed.

, Stick a toothpick in the center of a few muffins. The muffins are ready if nothing is sticking to the toothpick when you remove it. Put them back in and bake another five minutes if they're not quite done.


Cake-like muffins should be golden brown with smooth tops.

, Place the pan on a cooling rack for 10-15 minutes before gently removing each muffin with a butter knife and placing it on the cooling rack.

",How to Make Simple Muffins3,", You can either spray the cups of a 12-cup, regular-sized muffin or cupcake pan with non-stick vegetable oil, or you can put paper liners in each of the cups.


If the muffin pan has more than 12 cups, fill those you won’t use halfway with water. Choose cups in different spots so the muffins will bake evenly.
You can also use foil liners; however, they tend to retain heat, so you may need to adjust your oven temperature or cooking time.

, Use a wooden spoon to mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a medium-sized mixing bowl.


Ensure you scoop flour into the measuring cup without packing it down before leveling if off with a knife.
You can also use a sifter or strainer before measuring the flour if it has become packed down in the bag., In a separate, medium-sized mixing bowl, use a whisk, electric mixer or a fork to mix everything until it's well blended. You shouldn’t be able to see any streaks of egg.

, Use the wooden spoon to mix the two, using only 10-15 strokes, so you don’t over-mix and end up with tough muffins with tunnels from over-activating the flour’s gluten.

, Pour the blueberries into the center of the batter. Take a large, soft spatula and gently go along the side of the bowl to the bottom and bring the batter to the top, covering the blueberries.


Do this 3-4 times so the blueberries don’t crush and bleed into the batter.
You can also dust the blueberries in flour before adding them to help prevent bleeding.
Blueberries are just one of many things you can add to your muffins to change or add flavor. You can also easily make muffins with a variety of spices, fruits, nuts, oats, creams and glazes.

, Using a spoon or ice cream scooper, fill each cup only 2/3 full with batter so they will have nicely domed tops.


You can also wait until the last 10 minutes before sprinkling on the turbinado sugar.

, Rotate the pan halfway through backing, particularly if one side seems to be getting done faster than another.

, Insert a toothpick in the center of several muffins and, if it’s clean when you remove it, they’re done. Otherwise continue baking another 5 minutes.

, Let the muffins cool for 5-10 minutes in the pan before using a butter knife to carefully remove them from the pan and transfer them to the cooling rack.

Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the proper temperature. It will likely beep or flash an indicator light as an alert.;
, For the hermit slices, you’ll need two baking sheets. Line each one with a sheet of parchment paper to keep the cookies from sticking to the them.You can substitute silicone baking mats for the parchment paper if you prefer.

, Add 1 ½ cups (360 g) of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon, ¾ teaspoon (4 g) of salt, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking soda, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground ginger, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of nutmeg to a medium size bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully mixed, and set aside.If you want even spicier hermit slices, you can also add ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground cloves.

, Add ¾ cup (150 g) of light brown sugar and 10 tablespoons (156 g) of unsalted butter that’s been softened to room temperature to a large bowl. Use a hand mixer on medium-high speed to beat the two until the mixture is light and fluffy, which should take approximately 4 minutes.As you’re beating the brown sugar and butter together, be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl periodically to ensure that they’re fully combined.

, Once the brown sugar and butter mixture is light and fluffy, add 1 large egg to the bowl. Continue beating the mixture on medium-high until the egg is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth, which should take approximately 2 minutes.Once again, be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally as you beat the egg into the brown sugar and butter so the mixture is fully blended.

, When the egg is completely mixed in, add ¼ cup (85 g) of molasses and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium-high speed until it’s combined, which should take approximately 2 minutes.For the best results, use light molasses.

, Once all of the wet ingredients are combined, turn the hand mixer speed down to low and gradually begin adding the dry ingredients. Blend the dough until the dry ingredients are just incorporated.Be careful not to overmix the dough. If you do, you may end up with tough cookies.

, When the dough is fully combined, add 1 cup (125 g) of coarsely chopped walnuts and ⅓ cup (50 g) of raisins. Use a wooden spoon to gently fold the nuts and fruit into the dough.If you prefer, you can substitute pecans for the walnuts.
You can substitute dates for the raisins or use a combination of the two if you prefer.

, When the dough is fully mixed, separate it into two equal pieces. Place them on a floured surface, and roll them each into a log that’s approximately 14-inches by 2-inches (36-cm by 5-cm).You can also shape the dough into two 12-inch by 2-inch (30-cm by 5-cm) rectangles if you prefer., When you’ve formed the dough into logs, carefully transfer them to the lined baking sheets. Use your hands to gently square off the ends of the logs., Place the baking sheets with the logs in the preheated oven. Allow them to bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the edges are firm.To ensure that the logs bake evenly, rotate the cookie sheets halfway through the baking process.

, While the dough is baking, place 1 tablespoon (14 g) of unsalted butter in a small saucepan and melt it over medium heat. Allow the butter to cook until it starts to foam and then browns, which should take approximately 4 minutes.Swirl the butter in the pan as it’s heating to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, Once the butter has browned, add ¼ cup (31 g) of powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water to the pan. Whisk the mixture until it has a smooth, glaze-like consistency., When the logs come out of the oven, use a pastry brush to apply it all over them. Once the glaze is applied, let the logs cool for at least 20 minutes.Applying the glaze while the logs are still warm allows them to absorb the glaze more easily.

, When the logs are fully cooled, use a sharp knife to cut them into slices on an angle. The slices should be approximately 1- to 2-inches (2.5- to 5-cm) large.Store the sliced cookies in an airtight container at room temperature. They should stay fresh for up to 5 days.

Allow them to cool for about 30 minutes, and then chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours until fully set.Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap before placing it in the refrigerator.

, To prepare the bars’ topping, add 2 ounces (57 g) of semi-sweet chocolate that’s been broken into pieces and 1 cup (60 g) of whipped topping to a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the mixture on high for 1 minute or until the chocolate is mostly melted.If you prefer, you can substitute milk or bittersweet chocolate for the semi-sweet.

, After you’ve heated the chocolate and whipped topping, use a whisk to blend the two together completely. Next, pour it over the cheesecake bars in an even layer., When the topping is on the cheesecake bars, sprinkle 1 cup (60 g) sweetened, flaked coconut and ¼ cup (26 g) of toasted, sliced almonds over the top. Use a sharp knife to cut the cheesecake into bars and serve.Store any leftover cheesecake bars in the refrigerator. They should keep for 5 to 7 days.

In the absence of a hand mixer, use a wooden spoon to beat the butter and sugar together., Crack it into the mixing bowl and fully incorporate it with the creamed butter and sugar. Stir in the lemon zest to evenly distribute it into the wet batter.


Lemon zest is easiest to make using a microplane or zester. Simply run the tool over the skin of a freshly-washed lemon. Try not to press so hard that you pick up the bitter white pith underneath the skin. The flavor lies in the yellow surface skin.
If you don't have a microplane or zester, try a cheese grater or a sharp paring knife. Place the larger strips of lemon zest in a food processor to chop them into tiny shreds.

, Place the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients together.

, Add the flour mixture to the wet batter. Mix it until the batter is just combined, and you can no longer see white spots of flour. Do not overmix. If you mix the dough for too long, the flour will change consistency and result in tougher cookies.

, Form the dough into the shape of a ball and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least one hour or overnight. Refrigerating the dough will allow you to roll it out and cut it into proper biscuits. If you neglect this step, the biscuits will melt in the oven and come out flat.,, Remove it from the refrigerator and take off the plastic wrap. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough into a disc that is 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) in thickness.


If you prefer thicker biscuits, roll the dough to 1/3 inch.
For very thin, crispy biscuits, roll to 1/8 inch.

, Use a biscuit cutter to cut biscuits from the dough. Any cutter shape will do. Try a round cutter, one with scalloped edges, or a holiday-themed cutter.


If the cutter sticks to the dough as you cut, dip it in flour before cutting. Wipe it off and re-dip between cuts.If you don't have a biscuit cutter, use the rim of a cup to cut out circle shapes. Alternatively, use a knife to cut the dough into squares or rectangles.

, Carefully slide a spatula under the cut-outs and transfer them to a baking sheet. If any of the biscuits break, lightly press the edges back together.

, Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the biscuits for 10 to 12 minutes, depending on their thickness. The biscuits are ready when they turn golden and crisp, Remove them from the oven before they brown.

, Transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack and allow them to cool completely before serving. These biscuits are on the crumbly side, so take care when you transfer them to a serving plate.

, If you're serving these biscuits at a party, it's festive to create tiny sandwiches with them. Choose your favorite sweet filling. Dab 1/2 teaspoon of filling in the center of one of the biscuits. Place another biscuit on top, lining up the edges to create a sandwich. Try these delicious fillings:


Lemon curd
Raspberry jam

Chocolate ganache or melted white chocolate

, For Christmas and other winter holidays, try changing out the lemon zest for the same amount of orange zest. To boost the orange flavor, you can also add 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract to the wet batter.


For a spicy twist, add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves.
Or try using the zest of a different citrus fruit, like grapefruit or lime.

, Lemon and lavender pair beautifully together. This fragrant twist is the perfect addition if you're serving lemon biscuits for tea or an afternoon party. To add lavender, mix 1/2 teaspoon ground lavender flowers with the flour before you incorporate it with the wet batter.


Be sure you use food-grade lavender. Look for edible lavender flowers in gourmet grocery stores.
Ground edible roses make a fine substitution.

Mix the two together on the lowest speed until they’re fully combined.You can also use a hand mixer or work by hand with a spoon to mix up the cookie batter. It will just take a little more time and effort.
The butter and sugar mixture should be light and fluffy when you’re done mixing it.;
, Once the butter and sugar are creamed together, you need to add 3 eggs to the batter. However, you should add the eggs one at a time, and beat them into the batter for 30 seconds on low for each egg.For the best results, bring the eggs to room temperature before adding them to the batter.

, After you’ve beaten all of the eggs into the cookie batter, add 1 teaspoon (15 ml) of vanilla. Mix it into the rest of the ingredients on low until it’s fully incorporated.It’s normal for the batter to have a slightly broken appearance at this point. It will come together when you add the dry ingredients.

, Add 3 cups (360 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon (5 g) of kosher salt to a large bowl. Mix the ingredients together until they’re well combined.If you want your cookies to have a spicier taste, you can also mix in ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of ground cinnamon and/or ¼ teaspoon of ground clove to the flour mixture.

, When the flour, baking soda, and salt are fully mixed together, gradually add it to the batter, mixing on the lowest speed to avoid making a mess. Continue stirring the batter until the flour mixture is fully absorbed by the liquid ingredients., Once the dry ingredients are fully combined with the rest of the batter, remove the bowl from the stand mixer. Add 2 cups (250 g) of chopped nuts and 1 ½ cups (265 g) of dates that have been chopped and pitted, and use a spoon to stir them in by hand.Pecans are the nut traditionally used in date cookies, but you can also use walnuts or whatever nut you prefer.

, After you’ve mixed the nuts and dates into the cookie batter, cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the refrigerator, and allow the cookie dough to chill for at least two hours.You can refrigerate the date cookie dough as long as overnight.

, While you’re waiting for the cookie dough to finish chilling, it’s important to warm the oven so it’s ready for baking. Set the oven temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully preheat.Pay attention to your oven so you know when it’s preheated. It will likely beep or flash a light to let you know.

, To ensure that the cookies don’t stick while they’re baking, you must prepare the baking sheets properly. Use parchment paper to line two cookie sheets. You can also use silicone baking mats to the line the baking sheets.If you don’t have parchment paper or silicone baking mats, you can grease the cookie sheets with non-stick cooking spray or butter.

, When your cookie dough is properly chilled, remove it from the fridge. Drop the dough onto the baking sheets by rounded tablespoons.Make sure to space the cookies at least 2-inches (5-cm) apart because they will spread as they bake.

, After you’ve filled the baking sheets, place them in the preheated oven. Allow the cookies to bake for approximately 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown along the edges.The cookies should also have a puffed, dry appearance when they’re finished baking.

, When the cookies are finished baking, allow them to cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets. Next, transfer them to a wire cooling rack and let them cool completely, which should take approximately 15 to 20 minutes."

The cutting board and rolling pin should be chilled in the fridge if possible so that when you form the cookie tray, the dough stays cool for as long as possible., Take your refrigerated dough out of the fridge and remove the plastic wrap. Cut the dough into two pieces, one roughly being 60% of the total dough for the top, and the other being 40% of the dough for the bottom.

, Remove the cutting board and rolling pin from their chilling location and put a generous layer of flour over your cutting board, making sure to cover the whole board. Place the bottom chunk of dough onto the cutting board and completely cover all sides of the dough in a light layer of flour. Use the palms of your hands to press down on the dough and spread it out into a large rectangular shape, being careful not to create any tears in the dough. While you're pressing the dough down, flip it over 3 times and continue flouring the board and both sides of the dough as you do this. Then cover your rolling pin in a layer of flour and roll the dough until about 1/4"" thick, creating a rectangle as close to the size of your cookie sheet as you can.


Throughout this step, remember to continue to add flour as the dough spreads out to keep it from sticking - if you forget to add flour the dough will become too sticky and be ruined.

, Flip your cookie sheet upside down and place it over your dough, then hold on to both your cutting board and the cookie sheet and flip them over, causing the dough to fall into the sheet. Put the cutting board back in the fridge so it will be chilled when you need to use it again later on. Use your hands to press into the middle of the dough and slightly push it out, causing the edges to run up the sides of the cookie sheet a little and create a crust. Tear off any dough that has been pushed up too far and put it aside to fix any mistakes later on.

, Take the 18 oz. of raspberry jam (or 18 oz. of another jam/jelly) and scoop dollops of it on top of the dough. Use a spreading knife to work the jam back and forth and make it more pliable, and then spread it out in a thin layer across the dough.

, Take the remaining piece of dough and cut it in half. Separately, roll out the first piece of dough like you did with the bottom layer of dough (remember to use lots of flour), then cut it into long strips that are 3/4"" wide. Take the sides of the dough that cannot be cut nicely into strips and set aside with your other dough scraps.


Cut at a steep angle and in a very slight jerking motion to keep the dough from sticking to the knife.
The longer the dough sits out the harder it will be to use, so working at a fast pace is recommended.

, Take the longest strip and lay it diagonally across the middle of the cookie sheet. Then continue to take strips and lay them over the rest of the cookie sheet following the same diagonal direction until you have completed the first layer. Then take the second half of the dough or the remaining strips and lay them the other way to complete the lattice.


Try using part of the knife to hold and guide part of each strip while you lay it, and be careful to fully support it or else it will tear into pieces and become much harder to use.
This is the hardest part as the strips will begin to break once the dough becomes warm. If this happens, roll out some of the extra dough you set aside earlier to create new strips.

, Once the dough lattice is laid out, take one raw egg and beat it until you have a solid yellow color. Brush the top of the lattice with the beaten egg using a food brush.

, Place the dough on the cookie sheet into the oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes or until the top is a dark golden brown.


Do not remove the cookies from the oven early even if they look done - be sure to wait at least 40 minutes.
If you end up over-cooking by 5-10 minutes it should not be an issue - they should still turn out great.

, These are best served warm and as dessert with things such as ice cream.

Next, peel, core, and chop enough apples to fill 1 cup (120 grams). Add the apple chunks to the mixture, then stir everything together with a spatula.

Use plain, unsweetened applesauce instead of butter.,
Try whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose white flour.,
Use less sugar.,
Add fiber with some fruit.,
Add protein with nuts.,
Add some extra egg white for protein.,
Don't use full-fat dairy products.,
Control portion sizes by making smaller muffins.",How to Make Healthy Muffins3," Start with using half of the butter your recipe calls for, and substitute applesauce for the rest. The more applesauce/less butter you use, the denser your muffin will be. If you don't mind an extra-dense muffin, then feel free to switch over completely to applesauce.Don't have any applesauce? Try using a plant-based oil, such as canola, corn, sunflower, or extra-virgin olive, instead. Use 25% less oil than you would butter., Much like with applesauce, the more whole wheat flour you use, the denser your muffin will be. If you are just starting out, try using half white flour and half whole wheat flour.If you use all whole wheat flour, and cut the all-purpose flour entirely, you will need to add 1 to 2 tablespoons of liquid, such as: buttermilk, fruit juice, or vegetable oil.Don't want to use whole wheat flour? Try rolled oats, cornmeal, or buckwheat flour instead!ref>https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/muffin-makeover/</ref>

, You decrease the sugar by however much you want, but keep in mind that the muffins will be very bland if you use no sugar whatsoever. Try starting out with 1 teaspoon of sugar per muffin. This means that, if your recipe yields 12 muffins, you should only use ¼ cup (55 grams) of sugar. Remember, you can always sweeten the muffins back up after baking with a little bit of honey or jam.Cutting the sugar by 25% won't affect the flavor or texture by a noticeable amount.Can't bare to part with the sugar, or want an even healthier option? Try brown sugar or agave nectar instead. You might want to use less brown sugar and agave nectar than the recipe calls for due to the intense flavor.Adding some spices, such as cardamom, ground cinnamon, and vanilla, can work wonders without adding unhealthy sugars and calories., Most health-hacks focus on taking away ingredients, but they rarely focus on adding ingredients. Fresh fruit (as opposed to dried) is a great option because of the fiber! Try adding ½ to 1 cup (50 to 100 grams) of some fresh, chopped fruit to your next muffin recipe. Keep in mind that you may need to bake your muffins longer, however.Don't have any fresh fruit? Try dried fruit or fruit puree instead.Raw vegetables can also add a dose of fiber to muffins, such as zucchini or carrot. Be sure to shred them well in a food processor first, however!

, You can use chopped nuts, a spoonful of nut butter, or a splash of nut-based milk. You can even replace 25% of your flour with a nut-based flour instead. You can buy nut flours in specialty supermarkets. If you can't get any, ground your choice of nuts into a fine meal using a food processor.Using nut flours and nut-based milks won't affect the texture too much, but they may give the muffins a slight nutty flavor.

, Eggs get a bad rep because of their high cholesterol levels, but they are also full of protein--and are very low on the calories. Folding an extra whipped egg whit or two into your batter will not only give you some more protein, but it will also make the muffins less dense—which can be helpful, especially if you are using applesauce or whole wheat flour., Try using low-fat Greek yogurt or low-fat buttermilk instead of whole milk. This will help cut back some saturated fats while helping retain moisture. You can also use soymilk for a vegan option.Using low-fat dairy products won't necessarily lower all of the fats. They will, however, reduce the bad, saturated fats., People usually just eat one muffin, be it a small one or a large one. A larger muffin will contain much more fats, calories, and carbohydrates than smaller muffins. If you need to count any of those, consider using a mini or regular muffin pan instead of a jumbo one.If you are using a standard-sized muffin tin, fill the wells half-way instead of the usual two-thirds of the way."

Place the cookies 1 inch (2.54 centimetres) apart on a prepared baking sheet.Prepare the baking sheet by either lightly greasing it with cooking spray, or by covering it with a sheet of parchment paper.

,
Bake the cookies for 8 to 12 minutes.,
Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire cooling rack.,
Let the cookies cool completely before decorating them.",How to Make Sugar Cookies2," You can do this in an electric mixer or in a food processor fitted with whisks. It will take about 2 minutes. The butter 'must be at room temperature.

, There should be no streaks of broken egg yolk in the mixture.When you are done, set the mixture aside.

, To prevent your cookies from turning out too dry and crumbly, you must measure out the flour accurately. Do not scoop it up out of the bag. Instead, use a spoon to transfer the flour into the measuring cup, and use a knife to level it off., Set your mixer to the slowest speed possible, then add the flour mixture 1 cup (100 grammes) at a time.

, Cover a baking sheet with a sheet of parchment paper. Roll out a ball of dough into ⅛ to ¼-inch (3 to 6 millimetres) thickness, then cover it with another sheet of parchment paper. Repeat this step for the second ball of dough, using another baking sheet if necessary., You need to refrigerate the dough so that it will be nice and firm when you go to cut it. Once the hour is almost up, start preheating your oven so that it will be ready by the time you finish cutting your cookies.

, When you are ready to start baking your cookies, take the baking sheets out of the fridge, and transfer the rolled out dough to a cutting board. Cut the cookies out as closely together as possible.


You can ball up the scraps and roll them out to make more cookies. If the dough gets too warm, place a cold baking sheet on top of it for 10 minutes before continuing.,, The longer you bake them, the crispier they will become. If you prefer your cookies to be softer, bake them for 8 to 9 minutes. If you light them to be crispier, bake them for 10 to 12 minutes instead.If you have any leftover dough, you can start rolling and cutting it now while the first batch of cookies is baking.

, If you are making more cookies, you can start baking them now while the first batch is cooling off.

, You can decorate them with Royal icing or with glacé icing made from powdered sugar and water. A delicious finishing touch could be a dip in some warm melted chocolate for a gorgeous flavour.

Add the 3/4 cup powdered milk, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons shortening, and 1 1/2 cups hot water to a mixing bowl.,
In another bowl, add yeast and 1/8 teaspoon sugar to 1 1/2 cup warm water.,

Preheat a griddle to 300F, or a pan to medium heat.,
Add a pat of butter to the griddle once hot.,
Add dough balls to the pan or griddle, spacing by an inch.,
Cook each muffin for 5-6 minutes on each side.,
Once both sides are browned, remove and place on a wire rack to cool.,
Allow muffins to cool and then split with a fork.",How to Make English Muffins1," Mix until the salt and sugar crystals are dissolved. When mixed, move on to the next step while this mixture cools.


1 cup of warmed milk can be substituted for the powdered milk combo, as well;
, The water should be very warm to the touch, but not so warm you can't stick your finger in it without burning-- just on the edge of ""hot."" Stir in the sugar and add the yeast, letting it sit for about 10 minutes, until frothy.

, Use a stiff spatula or wooden spoon to mix everything together. This mixture should frothy and bubbly.

, Beat everything together with a flat wooden spoon, stiff spatula, or the flat blade on your stand mixer, stirring until everything is blended into a shaggy, somewhat sticky dough.


Salt can halt or slow yeast production. This is why you only add half of it at first., If you have a stand mixer, attach the dough hook and let it work on the shaggy dough for 4-5 minutes, until you have shiny, smooth ball of dough. If not, sprinkle a cutting board with flour and turn the dough out on it. Knead for 3-4 minutes, until you have a shiny, solid bowl of dough. It should be just barely sticky, and bounce back after you press into it. To knead:


Stand so that the dough is about waist height, allowing you to put your weight into the knead.
Fold about half of the dough on top of itself as if you were making a taco shell shape.
Use the heel of your hand to press the dough down into itself, ""sealing"" the fold.
Rotate the dough a quarter-turn and repeat.|
Keep folding, pressing, and rotating until the dough is a shiny, round ball.
If the dough is sticking too much to you, add a little more flour to your hands and the countertop., Place a damp towel over the dough and let it sit as it rises. It should be about twice as big as when you started.


You can let the dough rise up to 24 hours if you put it in the fridge, and some cooks believe this leads to a better flavor. The next day, all you have to do is shape and cook the muffins., These will be your muffins, so try to get nice, even pieces so they all cook nicely. You can cut as many different pieces as you want, depending on how big you want the muffins to be, but this recipe nicely creates 10 medium-sized English muffins.


Lightly flour the knife or your hands if the dough sticks to it.
Know that this dough expands, slightly, when cooked.

, Place the dough balls on top of the sheet, leaving about an inch of space on each side (they will rise and expand). Sprinkle the tops with cornmeal as well so that you have the classic crunchy bits on the tops and bottoms of your muffins.

, The rising stage lets the yeast create air inside the dough, which is why it puffs up. These same air bubbles create the nooks and crannies in a great English muffin, crafting the perfect texture you're looking for.


If you're in a rush, you can skip this second rise and just start cooking. They will taste good, though the texture won't quite be perfect., English muffins need to cook quickly enough to get a hard, toasted crust but slowly enough that the insides cook as well. If your griddle lets you pick temperatures, set it to 300. If not, or if you want to use a cast-iron or non-stick pan instead, set it to medium heat and let it get nice and hot.

, Know that, once you do, you need to be ready to keep going on the recipe before the butter burns. You don't need much -- 1/2 tablespoon should be good for every 5-6 muffins.

, Simply drop the dough balls, covered top and bottom with cornmeal, on the hot griddle and let them start to cook. If you have muffin rounds -- little rings used to help keep the muffin's shape, add them to the griddle and put your dough balls in the center of them.


Muffin rings are not necessary but do lead to a more uniform shape. Tuna cans that have both the tops and bottoms cut out with a can opener are a great substitute., You'll flip the muffins after about 5 minutes. When flipped, the cooked side should be an appealing dark brown color, but don't worry if you got their too soon -- you can always re-flip them to finish a side if need be., Make sure that the centers are cooked -- the outside edge shouldn't be shiny or doughy anymore, but firm and cooked. If you took them off too early place the muffins in a 350F oven for 3-4 minutes to finish., To get the best texture, including all the nooks and crannies, make sure that you cut the muffin open with a fork, not a knife. This allows all the air pockets to stay intact."

Mix everything in a stand mixer with this simple ""one-pot"" recipe.,
Add an egg to the recipe get a slightly richer English muffin.,
Use coconut oil, olive oil, or butter instead of shortening.,
Turn your English Muffin into a simple crumpet with an extra 3/4 cup milk.,
Replace the milk with water, almond milk, or soy milk for a vegan muffin.",How to Make English Muffins2," The following ingredients simply go together in your Kitchen-Aid or another stand mixer. Then, using the paddle attachment, mix it all up. Once the ingredients are mixed, put on the dough hook and let it knead for 3-4 minutes before rising, shaping, and cooking like normal:


1 3/4 cups lukewarm milk
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 large egg, lightly beaten
4 1/2 cups (19 ounces) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour
2 teaspoons instant yeast, Add this to the warm milk mixture after it has cooled, which prevents the egg from cooking. Beat it into the recipe like normal, continuing from there. Eggs have fat and protein that leads to a richer, slightly denser muffin.

, All of these ingredients are fats used to bind the ingredients, and all of them can be used to subtly flavor and change your muffins. Note, however, that olive oil is the only liquid fat here, which means it should be split half and half with butter instead of being used completely on its own., Looking for a thinner English crumpet? The recipe is almost the exact same, except that crumpets require a thinner, almost pancake-like dough. The extra milk will cover this for you, but you'll need to use Muffin rings when cooking -- the thinner dough won't hold its shape like the English muffin dough does., You'll also need to replace the butter on the pan, but olive or canola oil will cover this easily. These muffins have all the flavor of a normal English muffin, especially if you use a milk substitute instead of just water."

Roll and cut out the cookies.,
Bake the cookies.,
Consider frosting the cookies.",How to Make Whole Wheat Sugar Cookies1," Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C). Get out a few baking sheets and tear out several sheets of parchment paper. Lay one piece of parchment paper on each baking sheet. Set the prepared sheets aside while you make the cookies.If you don't have parchment paper, you could also use a silicone baking mat.;
, Mix together the dry ingredients in a medium sized bowl. You'll need to whisk 2 cups (260 g) of whole-wheat flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder until they're combined. Set the dry mixture aside.Whisk the ingredients for at least 30 seconds. This ensures that the baking powder is evenly distributed among the flour.

, Place 10 tablespoons (142 g) of softened butter, 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar, and 1 ounce (30 g) of softened cream cheese into a large mixing bowl. Use a stand or electric mixer to beat the ingredients on high speed for several minutes. The mixture should look light and fluffy.Your butter and cream cheese must be soft. If they're still cold, they won't cream and you'll have lumps in the cookie dough.

, Turn the mixer down to low speed and add 1 large egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the creamed butter, cream cheese, and sugar mixture. Beat the mixture until the egg and vanilla are completely combined.If you'd like to flavor the cookies with something else, consider leaving out the vanilla extract. Instead, you could use almond, lemon, peppermint, or orange extract.

, Keep the mixer running on low speed and slowly add the dry ingredients. Beat the sugar cookie dough just until it's combined and you no longer see pockets of flour. Scoop the dough onto plastic wrap and shape it into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for one hour.Chilling is important because it will make the cookies easier to roll and will prevent them from being tough.

, Sprinkle your work surface with a little bit of flour. Remove the chilled dough from the fridge and roll the disk until it's 1/4-inch (6 mm) thick. Use cookie cutters to stamp out cookies from the dough. Reroll the scraps and keep cutting out cookies until you've used all of the dough. You should get about 32 cookies.Use cookie cutters that are about 2 to 3-inches (5 to 7 cm) in size.

, Arrange the cookie cutouts on the prepared baking sheets. Ensure that there's at least 1-inch (2.5 cm) of space between each cookie so they have room to expand as they bake. Bake the cookies for about 12 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.The cookies should be lightly brown around the edges once they've finished cooking.

, For a really simple frosting, place powdered sugar into a small mixing bowl. Add a little bit of milk or cream to the sugar and stir it with a fork until the sugar dissolves. Adjust the liquid to get a spreadable frosting consistency. Frost the cookies once they're totally cool.


You can also tint the frosting different colors. Consider using food gel so that it won't make the frosting too runny.

Bake the whole wheat sugar cookies.",How to Make Whole Wheat Sugar Cookies2," Turn on the oven to 375 degrees F (175 C). You'll need to have a few baking sheets ready to put the cookies on. You won't need to grease or spray the baking sheets.If your cookies frequently stick to the pans, consider laying a sheet of parchment paper on the pans.

, Since this easy whole wheat sugar cookie recipe comes together in one large mixing bowl, just measure out the most of the dough ingredients into the bowl. Beat them with an electric mixer on medium speed until they're combined. You'll need:1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar
1 teaspoon of baking powder
½ teaspoon of salt
½ teaspoon of ground nutmeg
½ teaspoon of baking soda
2 tablespoons (30 ml) of milk
1 tablespoon of lemon or orange zest
1 teaspoon of vanilla
½ cup (113 g) of butter, softened
1 egg

, Turn the mixer speed down to low and gradually stir in 2 cups (260 g) of whole-wheat flour. Mix the dough together until the flour is incorporated and you don't see any dry pockets.Avoid over mixing the dough since this can make the cookies tough.

, Use a cookie scoop or two teaspoons to measure out a few tablespoons of dough. Roll each portion of dough between the palms of your hands to make a smooth ball of dough. Place all of the balls of dough on the ungreased cookie sheets and leave about 2-inches (5 cm) of space in between them.Each ball should be about 1-inch (2.5 cm) in size.

, Use the palm of your hand or a glass to slightly flatten each ball of dough a little. Mix together the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the cookies.You could also play around with the flavors. Try substituting ground nutmeg or cocoa for the cinnamon.

, Place the cookies in the preheated oven and bake them for 8 to 10 minutes. The cookies should puff up and crack a little bit once they're baked. They'll also turn light brown around the edges. Remove them from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.If you have to bake the cookies in batches, avoid placing cold cookie dough on hot baking sheets.

Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat. Position the oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven as well.Be aware of how your oven indicates that it’s preheated to the desired temperature. An indicator light may flash or a beep may sound for most models.;
, To make the cookies, you’ll need 3 13-inch by 9-inch by 2-inch (33-cm x 23-cm x 5-cm) metal baking sheets. Line all of them with foil, leaving some to overhang the edge. Next, grease all of the foil and edges of the pan with 2 tablespoons (28 g) of unsalted butter that’s been softened to room temperature.You can use parchment paper instead of the foil if you prefer.

, Place the whites from 6 large eggs in the bowl for a stand mixer. Attach the wire whisk, and beat at medium-high speed until soft peaks form. It should take approximately 2 to 3 minutes.You’ll know that soft peaks have formed in the egg whites when you turn the whisk upside down and peaks form that flop over slightly., Once the egg whites have formed soft peaks, slowly add ⅓ cup (66 g) of sugar to the bowl, and continue beating on medium-high until stiff peaks form.You’ll know that stiff peaks have formed when you turn the whisk upside down and the peaks stand without collapsing.

, Once the egg white and sugar mixture is thick enough, transfer it to a large bowl. Place it in the refrigerator and allow it to chill while you work on the rest of the batter.Use a sheet of plastic wrap over the top of the bowl to cover the egg white mixture.

, With the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 12 oz. (340 g) of almond paste that’s been chopped with the remaining 1 cup (200 g) of sugar on medium low. Mix the two ingredients until they are well incorporated, which should take approximately 4 to 5 minutes.Make sure that you’re using almond paste and not marzipan. Almond paste has a coarser texture and isn’t as sweet as marzipan., Once the almond paste and sugar are well blended, turn the stand mixer’s speed up to medium-high and gradually add 2 cups (453 g) of unsalted butter that’s been softened to room temperature. Beat the mixture for 2 to 3 minutes or until it becomes fluffy.The best way to soften butter to room temperature is to cut it into pieces and leave it out on the counter or table for approximately 30 minutes. When you touch it with your finger and it leaves a small indentation, it’s softened enough., When the almond paste, sugar, and butter mixture is light and fluffy, keep the mixer on medium-high and mix in the yolks from 6 eggs until well combined. Next, stir in 2 ¾ cups plus 1 tablespoon (344 g plus 8.5 g) of all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon (1.5 g) kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon (5.69 g) salt, and beat until all of the ingredients are well incorporated., Remove the bowl from the stand mixer, and take the egg white mixture out of the refrigerator. Use a spatula to fold half of the egg white mixture into the rest of the batter. When it’s fully incorporated, fold in the other half of the egg whites and mix until completely blended.It’s best to use a spatula with a wide, flexible blade when you’re folding in the egg white mixture. That allows you to move more of the batter at a time while still keeping your motion gentle, so you can work more quickly., Once the egg white mixture is fully incorporated, divide the batter evenly among three bowls. In one of the bowls, stir in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) red food coloring to color the batter red. In a second bowl, stir in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) green food coloring to color the batter green. Leave the third bowl alone to create plain batter.You can use paste or powder food coloring in place of the liquid. Just make sure to consult the packaging to see how much of the formula you should add. It’s best to start with just a little and add more if necessary.

, Take the 3 pans that you lined with foil and greased earlier, and use one pan for each color of batter. Transfer the batter to the pan, and spread it to the edges with an offset spatula that’s been dipped in water. Run the spatula across the top of the batter as well to ensure that it’s smooth.If you don’t have an offset spatula, you can use a regular spatula or a butter knife. It just might be more difficult when you get along the edges of the pan.

, Place the pans in the preheated oven, and allow them to bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges just begin to pull away from the sides of the pan. Approximately halfway through the baking process, though, rotate the pans to ensure that they bake evenly.Depending on how large your oven is, all three pans may not fit in at the same time. If that’s the case, just bake them in batches.

, When the cakes are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Let them cool in the pans for approximately 25 to 30 minutes. When they’re cool enough to handle, use the hangover edge of the foil to carefully remove each cake from its pan and place it on a cooling rack right side up to cool completely., Once the cakes are completely cooled, take the green cake and spread half of ¾ cup orange (248 g) marmalade that’s been heated and strained over it. Use a pastry brush to ensure that the marmalade reaches the edges of the cake.If you don’t have a pastry brush, you can use a butter knife to spread the marmalade across the cake.

, After the green cake is covered with marmalade, take the plain cake and place it on top of the green. Use the rest of the orange marmalade to cover the top of the plain cake just as you did with the green cake.Make sure that you place the plain cake on top of the green cake right side up.

, With the green and plain layers covered in marmalade and in place, take the red cake and place it on top of the plain cake. Next, use a piece of foil to cover the top of the cake.You can use plastic wrap instead of the foil if you prefer.
You don’t have to wrap the foil all the way around the cake. Just make sure that the top of it is protected.

, With the foil over the top of the cake layers, take one of the pans that you used to bake the layers and place it on top of the foil. Use some heavy canned food or other items from around the house to weigh down the pan and compress the cakes layers. Place the weighted down cake layers in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.Make sure that the pan that you place on top of the cake layers is completely cool.
While the cake can set up in 4 hours, you can leave it in the refrigerator overnight to firm it up even further.

, After the layers have had enough time to set up in the refrigerator, take it out. Take off the weights and the pan, and pull the foil away from the cake., Take 4 ounces (112 g) of bittersweet chocolate that’s been melted, and spread half of it over the top of the cake in a thin layer. Place the cake in the freezer for 10 minutes to allow the chocolate to harden.The best way to melt the chocolate is to place it in a heatproof bowl and set it over a pan of simmering water. Heat it until it melts, stirring regularly.

, After the chocolate has hardened on top of the cake, take it out of the freezer and cover it with waxed paper. Place a baking sheet over it, and flip the cake over. Spread the rest of the melted chocolate over the bottom of the cake and freeze for another 10 minutes.If you want to give the tops of the cookies a decorative look, use a fork to scrape wavy lines through the chocolate before placing it in the freezer.

, After the top layer of chocolate has hardened, use a sharp knife to trim the cake down to 12-inches by 8-inches (30-cm by 20-cm). Next, cut the cake crosswise into 6 2-inch (5-cm) wide strips.Use the knife to divide the stripes crosswise to form 96 ½-inch (1.2 cm) wide cookies.When you store the cookies, make sure to place them in an airtight container.They can last up to a week.

",How to Bake Lavender and Lemon Cookies,"


Try picking your lavender just before you use it so that it has the freshest possible taste. Choose blossoms that have the fullest color and pass over any that are wilted or less robust.;
,, Alternatively, you can place the blooms in a salad spinner as long as you spin them slowly and gently.

,, Cream the mixture on medium speed using either a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld mixer.

, Continue mixing until the ingredients are incorporated.

, Knead the ingredients with your clean hands until a dough forms.

,,, Using the rolling pin, press the flowers into the dough.


In essence, the dough for lavender and lemon cookies is a shortbread dough. You won’t actually add the lavender until after you have rolled out the dough.

,, This will keep it from sticking to the dough as you cut out your cookies.


While the instructions call for a round cookie cutter, you can use cookie cutters of any shape according to your preference.

, Place the cookie onto the baking sheet.

, Place the cookies about 1-1/2” apart on the baking sheet so that they have some room to spread.

,, Allow them to cool on the stovetop for 2 minutes.

, Place the cookies on wire racks and allow them to completely cool.

If you prefer to use paper or aluminum muffin wrappers, place one wrapper into each insert of the pan.Greasing the pan ensures that the muffins won’t stick to the pan after they’ve baked.
Using muffin wrappers lets you skip the process of greasing the pan and ensures that the muffins will come out of the pan easily after they’ve baked.

, Carefully pour or spoon the muffin batter into each insert of the muffin tin until about two-thirds full. Try to distribute the batter equally so that each muffin is about the same size.Smooth the tops of the batter with a spoon if they’re uneven on top.
You can also hold the muffin tin in each hand and shake it gently side to side to make sure that the batter lays flat in each insert.

Mix with a whisk or a large spoon until all the ingredients are well combined, then set the bowl aside., You will need melted butter to make the muffin batter. Before you melt the butter, cut the stick into small cubes about an inch in length to help the butter melt faster and more evenly., Melt the butter either in the microwave or on the stovetop. If you are melting the butter in the microwave, place the butter cubes in a small bowl and microwave on medium-low (30%). Check every 15 seconds or so until the butter is almost melted. Then take out the bowl and stir the butter until it’s all melted.If you’re melting the butter on the stovetop, place the butter cubes in a saucepot over medium-low heat. Heat on the stove until almost all the pieces have melted, then take the pot off the heat and stir until the butter is completely melted.

, Pour the melted butter into a medium sized mixing bowl, then crack the egg into the butter. Whisk the egg until the yolk and egg whites are fully incorporated. Then add the milk and vanilla extract and mix., Pour about one third of the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and stir with a large spoon or whisk until combined. Continue gradually adding the flour, folding it in and incorporating it into the batter., Pour in the chocolate chips while stirring, and mix until they are distributed throughout the batter. Make sure that the batter looks even and consistent., Spray a standard-sized muffin tray with non-stick cooking spray, or rub the inside of each insert with a stick of butter. You can also line each compartment with paper liners if you prefer., After preparing the tray, distribute the muffin batter between each compartment of the muffin tray. Pour the batter until each compartment is about ¾ of the way full, since the muffins will expand during baking. Try to distribute the batter evenly so that each muffin is around the same size., If you wish, sprinkle the tops of each muffin with a pinch of granulated sugar. The granulated sugar will make the muffins slightly sweeter and adds a crunch to the muffin tops.Skip the step if you prefer the muffins without the extra sweetness.

, Place the muffin tray in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes. By this time, the muffins should have expanded and the tops should look golden brown.

, After 15-20 minutes, stick a toothpick into one of the muffins. If the toothpick comes out clean, the muffins are done and you can remove them. If the toothpick comes out with crumbs, put the muffins back in the oven and check with a toothpick every minute or so until it comes out clean., After you take the tray out of the oven, let it cool for a few minutes on a cooling rack. Placing the pan on the cooling rack helps it to cool down more quickly., After 5-10 minutes, carefully remove the muffins from the tray. If you used paper liners, simply lift up the muffins by the liners. If you put the muffin batter directly in the tray, use a knife to go around between each muffin and the pan. Then lift up the muffins and place them on the cooling rack., Even if you’re eager to eat the muffins while they’re still hot, letting them cool on the rack for about five minutes so that they have a firmer consistency.

, Enjoy the muffins while they are still warm, or wait for them to cool completely before digging in. Enjoy them with a large, refreshing glass of milk!

 ;
, There are two different ways to make mini blender muffins, one which requires rolled oats and one that uses peanut butter. The recipe with rolled oats will have more of a muffin-like consistency. However, the recipe with peanut butter is simpler and uses only five ingredients. It’s up to you which recipe you’d like to follow! After you’ve measured everything out, mix all the dry ingredients into one bowl for easy pouring.You can also set your extra ingredients or add-ins aside. These are any fruits, nuts, or chocolate that you want to bake in with your muffins., You can use a standard blender or a food processor. However, a handheld blender may not work as well. There is no set order to putting ingredients in, but alternating wet and dry items might aid in the mixing process. Once you’ve added everything, blend until the mixture is smooth. This should take one to two minutes.

, Take a basic 12-piece mini-muffin tin and line each cup with parchment paper or cupcake liners. If you don’t have either of these, you can also spray the cupcake tin with cooking spray or oil. Once prepared, fill each cup with a portion of the muffin batter. As the muffins will rise while baking, try to fill each tin only halfway.

, Depending on the type of muffin you want, you can add-in whatever ingredients you like. For example, if you want blueberry muffins, stick a couple of blueberries into each portion of batter. You can also add chocolate chips, almonds, strawberries, apple slices, or just cinnamon. Or, if you want a little bit of everything, alternate ingredients throughout each cup. It’s up to you!, Once the oven is at 400°F (204°C) degrees, place the muffin tin in the center of the rack. Bake the muffins for around eight to ten minutes. Baking time can vary depending on the oven, so be sure to check your muffins by sticking a toothpick or fork in them. If you see muffin batter on the items when you pull them out, then your muffins need to cook longer.

, Once you’ve removed the muffins from the oven, leave them in their muffin tin to cool. This should take about five or six minutes. After that, feel free to remove the muffins from the tin and place them on a plate or platter. The muffins should also be ready for eating at this time.

Pour the batter into a regular muffin tin.,
Add in any extras.,
Bake the muffins.,
Let the muffins cool.",How to Make Blender Muffins2," Set your oven for 400°F (204°C) degrees before you start mixing ingredients. This should take about five to ten minutes. However, if your oven doesn’t have a timer to indicate that it’s ready, try using an oven thermometer. You will have to check the thermometer before baking, but you will get a more accurate temperature reading than just guessing.





, You can make muffins using either rolled oats or peanut butter, but for regular sized muffins you will have to double the ingredients. For example, to make regular muffins with rolled oats, you need two cups of oats, two bananas, two eggs, one cup of Greek yogurt, and so on. The same would apply for regular sized muffins made with peanut butter. Set aside all add-ins like blueberries, coconut flakes, chocolate chips, almonds, mango, pineapple, and strawberries.

, As you measure out each ingredient, put them into a standard blender or food processor. The order you add them doesn’t matter, but try alternating wet and dry for better mixing. Make sure to only add the first set of ingredients, though, as the add-ins like blueberries, chocolate chips, and almonds will be put in later. Once every item has been put in, blend the mixture for one to two minutes until smooth.

, Before filling your muffin tin, make sure to line each cup with a cupcake liner or piece of parchment. You can also use cooking spray or oil to coat the cups and prevent sticking. After this, pour batter into each cup in the tray until they’re 3/4th full, as the muffins will rise.

, After all the batter has been portioned out, start adding any additional ingredients you want. For example, if you want chocolate chip muffins, put a couple of chocolate chips into each cup of batter. Or if you want blueberry cinnamon, place two to three blueberries into each mixture and sprinkle them with a pinch of cinnamon. You can also alternate inclusions if you want a bit of everything.

, Once your oven has hit 400°F (204°C) degrees, place the muffin tin into the center of the rack. The muffins should bake 15 minutes or so depending on your oven. To be sure they are baking through and not being over baked, check the muffins about five minutes in. You can insert a toothpick or fork to see if the batter is baking properly. If either item comes back wet with batter, then the muffins need longer.

, Once they’ve finished baking, the muffins will need to rest and cool for five to six minutes. You can leave the muffins in their tin for this. However, after they have cooled, feel free to move them to a different plate or platter. You can also eat them if you like.

While you are waiting, prepare the biscuit dough to give the oven enough time to preheat., Pour the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the ingredients by briefly pressing the pulse button twice so that the ingredients get mixed.If you don’t have a food processor, stir the dry ingredients with a large spoon until they are mixed.

, Take the sticks of butter and unwrap them, then cut them into cubes about a half an inch long (1 ½ centimeters). Cutting the butter into small pieces instead of melting it will make your biscuits fluffy as opposed to dense.Try to use cold as opposed to room temperature butter. Cold butter makes the best biscuits because when the butter melts in the oven, it separates the flour into “layers”, which makes the biscuit tender and flaky.

, Start to sprinkle the butter cubes into the food processor, pulsing every now and then as you add more. When you have finished adding the butter, pulse once more to make sure that the ingredients are blended.The mixture should look coarse but blended. Some chunks of butter are ok.
Don’t over-mix in the food processor, as this can heat up and melt the butter.
If you don’t have a food processor, use a sharp knife to dice the butter into smaller chunks, then add the butter and hand stir the mixture.

, Pour in the buttermilk and pulse the food processor until just blended. Again, don’t over-mix the dough in the food processor because this can change the consistency of the biscuits.If you don’t have a food processor, pour in the buttermilk gradually while stirring.

, Take the dough and place in on a counter or cutting board. Use your hands to turn the dough over on itself and knead it gently for about ten seconds. Knead a couple of times until the dough is shaggy and cohesive. Be careful not to over-handle., Spread a layer of flour onto a counter or a large cutting board. Use your hands to spread the flour and even out its surface., Scoop the dough out of the food processor and place it into the floured surface. Use your hands to shape the dough into a rectangle that is about ¾ - 1 inch (2-3 cm) thick. Again, make sure not to over-handle the dough., Use a cookie cutter or a knife to cut the dough into circular shapes that are about three inches wide (7.6 cm). If you prefer your biscuits in a different shape like a triangle or rectangle, cut them accordingly.

, Take the scraps left over from the dough and shape them into biscuits. You may only have enough for one, or you may be able to make several biscuits out of the leftover dough., Cover a large baking sheet with parchment paper, then arrange the biscuits on top. Make sure that there is at least an inch of space between the biscuits and that none are overlapping., Use a pastry brush to brush cream over the top of each biscuit. Distribute the cream equally so each biscuit gets an even coating. Then sprinkle the coarsely ground black pepper over the top of each biscuit.The cream makes the biscuits richer and less dry, and also helps the pepper stick to the top of each biscuit.

, Place the tray with the biscuits into the preheated oven and wait 15 minutes. After fifteen minutes, poke a biscuit with a toothpick. If the toothpick comes out clean, the biscuit is done baking. Take the biscuits out of the oven with an oven mitt.


If the toothpick comes out with crumbs of biscuit on it, keep testing every minute until it comes out clean., Transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack and let them sit for 15 minutes. A cooling rack ensures that all parts of the biscuit cool at the same rate, so that the texture and consistency are the same throughout., After fifteen minutes, the biscuits are ready to be served. Serve them immediately while warm, or wait until they have cooled if you prefer.


You can eat the biscuits on their own, top them with gravy, or make them part of a larger meal like an Eggs Benedict.

Roll each section of dough into a ball, and place them in separate bowls.For example, if you want to make red and blue marbled cookies, you’ll need to divide the dough in half and create two balls. If you want red, yellow, and orange marbled cookies, you’ll need to divide the dough in thirds and create three balls.

, After you’ve separated each ball of dough into individual bowls, add a small amount of gel food coloring in your chosen shade to the first ball of dough. Knead it with clean hands to mix the coloring into the dough, and repeat the process with the remaining balls of dough.Always start with a small amount of food coloring when you’re coloring the dough. If you aren’t happy with the finished shade, you can mix in more.
If you want “white” dough, don’t add any food coloring to one of the balls of dough.

, Make sure each piece of dough is still shaped into a ball, and remove them from bowls. Use your hands to flatten each piece until it’s approximately ½-inch (1.27-cm) thick, and wrap them in plastic. Chill the dough in refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours, or until the dough is firm.You can make the dough the day before you plan to bake the cookies, and leave it to chill overnight if you like.

, When you’re ready to make the marbled sugar cookies, it’s important to prepare the oven by preheating it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Make sure that you understand how your oven indicates that it’s reached the desired temperature. It will usually beep and/or flash an indicator light.

, You don’t want all of the dough to get warm while you’re creating the marble effect, so remove just half of each color from the refrigerator. Place the dough that you’re going to be working with on a floured surface, and leave the rest in the refrigerator., Take a small piece of each color of dough that’s approximately the size of a tablespoon (18 g) and drop them on your floured surface. Be sure to position the dough pieces so they’re all touching one another. Continue adding pieces until you’ve used up all the dough.Drop the different colors of dough randomly so there’s no obvious pattern.

, Once you’ve dropped all of the first half of dough into pieces on your floured surface, use a rolling pin to flatten and mix the colors together for the marbled effect. Flatten the dough until it’s approximately ⅛- to ¼-inch (3- to 6-cm) thick., Once the dough is completely mixed and flattened, use cookie cutters to cut it into your desired shapes. If you don’t have cookie cutters, you can use a glass to create simple round marbled cookies.It’s a good idea to dip your cookie cutters into flour before pressing them into the dough. That will keep them from sticking.

, When you’ve cut the dough into shape, place the cookie on ungreased baking sheet so they are approximately 1- to 2-inches (2.5- to 5-cm) apart. Next, sprinkle each cookie with coarse decorating sugar in assorted colors if desired.While it’s not necessary to grease the baking sheet, you may want to line it with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat so cleanup is easier.

, Once the cookies are on the baking sheet, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the cookies to bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until they are firm.Avoid baking the cookies too long or they may become browned, which can ruin the look of the marbled effect.

, When the cookies are finished baking, let them cool on the baking sheet for 1 to 2 minutes. Next, move them to a wire cooling rack to cool fully, which should take 15 to 20 minutes., After your first batch of cookies is finished baking, remove the second half of dough from the refrigerator. Repeat the entire process of breaking the dough into pieces, rolling them together, cutting them into shapes, and baking them with the rest of the dough.Store the cookies in an airtight container. They should keep for 7 to 10 days.

Begin by spreading a thin layer of flour over a clean counter or cutting board. Then place the dough on top of the floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough until the sheet of dough is about ¼ inch thick (0.6 cm.)If you are making the gluten-free cookies, use almond flour to flour your surface.
You need to roll your dough if you are using cookie cutters to cut out your sugar cookies. If you are just making round sugar cookies, don’t roll out the dough. Instead, roll the dough into small balls with a diameter of about 1 inch (2.54 cm.)

, After you have rolled out your dough, use cookie cutters to cut out your sugar cookies. Then place the cut-outs on the baking sheet, separated by about 1 inch (2.54 cm) of space. If you have scraps left over, form them into a ball, roll them out, and cut out more cookies.If you are not using cookie cutters, place the balls of dough that you made on the greased baking sheet. Then dip the bottom of a regular drinking glass in flour or sugar and press on each ball to flatten it to about ¼ inch (0.6 cm) in thickness.

, Place the pan of cookies in the preheated oven and bake them for 7-10 minutes. The low-calorie sugar cookies will likely need the full ten minutes, whereas the gluten-free cookies may only need 7 or 8. Keep an eye on the cookies and take them out of the oven when they are golden-brown., After you take the cookies out of the oven, remove them from the pan using a spatula and place them on a cooling rack.

, Once the dough has come together, leave it in the bowl and let it sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. For the best results, choose a spot that isn’t too warm or bright to keep the dough.Cover the dough with plastic wrap or foil while you’re letting it rest.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cookies, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Pay attention to the oven so you know when it’s reached the desired temperature. Most models will beep or flash an indicator light to let you know.

, To bake the cookies, you’ll need at least 1 baking sheet. Rub the sheet down with butter or spray it with cooking spray so the cookies don’t stick to it.You can line the baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat if you prefer.

, Use a medium cookie scoop or a tablespoon measuring spoon to pick up some dough. With your hands, gently roll the dough into a ball.The piece of dough that you roll should be approximately the size of a walnut.

, Once you’ve formed the dough into a ball, roll the dough against a floured work surface to create a rope that’s approximately 4-inches (10-cm) long. Bend the rope to form a crescent, and pinch the ends lightly. Repeat the process with all of the dough.Make sure not to roll the dough into a rope that’s any longer than 4-inches (10-cm). If the rope is too long, the cookies will end up being too thin.

, When the dough is all formed into crescents, place the cookies on the greased baking sheet. Make sure to space the cookies so they’re at least 2-inches (5-cm) apart., Place the cookies in the preheated oven, and allow them to bake until they’re a light golden brown. It should take approximately 20 to 25 minutes.Halfway through the baking process, rotate the baking sheet to ensure that the cookies bake evenly.

Use a spatula to gently remove the cookies one by one from the baking sheet, and roll each one carefully in the sugar to dust both sides. Repeat the process until you’ve dusted all of the cookies.If you’re concerned about the powdered sugar clumping on the cookies, you can use a baker’s dusting wand to dust the cookies. It features a container with perforated sides at the end of a handle. You fill the container with the powdered sugar, and shake the wand over the cookies to lightly dust them.

, After you’ve dusted the cookies, set them on a cooling rack. Let them cool for another 20 to 30 minutes or until they’re cooled completely.Store the cookies in an airtight container. They’ll stay fresh for 3 to 5 days.

You can also use a stand mixer to make this buttercream.;
, Pour in the whipping cream, orange extract, and five drops of orange food coloring. Beat the mixture on medium speed until the ingredients are fully combined. If necessary, beat in more food coloring in five-drop increments until you achieve the desired color.


The food coloring is optional in this recipe, and you can leave it out entirely.

, If you want the frosting to be orange but don’t want to use the artificial color, substitute the food coloring with reduced carrot juice.


Heat fresh carrot juice in a medium saucepan until it reduces to a paste, then use that in place of the food coloring., For the best results, use a pastry bag to frost desserts with buttercream. If you don’t have a pastry bag, spoon the frosting into a freezer bag, push it all to the bottom left corner of the bag, and snip a small hole in the corner of the bag.


You can frost desserts with buttercream by using a knife, spoon, or icing knife as well, but you'll get more interesting designs and a cleaner look if you use a pastry bag.
This recipe makes enough icing for up to 24 cupcakes, or two cakes.

, Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of juice and whisk to combine. Whisk in more juice as needed if the icing is too thick. The ideal glaze consistency depends on what you're looking for:For a thinner glaze that you can drizzle over cookies and cakes, add more orange juice to make the glaze a little runny.
For a thicker glaze that you can dip cupcakes into without it running, add less juice.

, There are several ways that you can apply a glaze icing to different desserts. Check the recipe you're working with to see if it calls for special instructions.


For cakes and Bundt cakes, run a whisk or spoon through the glaze and then drizzle it over the cake, letting the glaze run down the sides.
For cupcakes, dip the top of each cupcake into the glaze. Let the excess drip off over the bowl, then flip the cupcake over (right-side up) and let the glaze set for about 15 minutes.
For cookies, use a pastry brush to brush the glaze onto the top of each cookie."

Substitute your ground sugar for icing sugar.",How to Make Icing Without Icing Sugar1," Choose granulated white sugar, if you have it. Alternately, you can use coconut sugar, brown sugar or cane sugar.Use only a cup of sugar at a time.Refined white sugar, when ground, has the closest texture to icing sugar.
Breaking down more than a cup at a time won’t produce results as even in consistency.;
, Combine cornstarch with granulated sugar if you’re going to store the sugar. Cornstarch helps prevent clumps so your sugar maintains a powdered consistency.If you plan to use the sugar right away, cornstarch isn’t necessary.
If you’re low on cornstarch, one teaspoon (six grams) will work.

, Pour the sugar into a glass blender or food processor. Add cornstarch, if desired.Pulse it for about two minutes.Alternately, you can use a spice grinder or coffee grinder, but be aware these may absorb flavor from previously-used spices or coffee.
You may want to avoid using a plastic blender. It’s unlikely – but possible – that sugar crystals may cause scratches to a plastic appliance.
If you’re using a blender or food processor with multiple settings, choose “pulse” or “blend.”

, Wipe the spatula along the inside of the blender. Mix the sugar well so that it will blend and break down evenly., Turn off and unplug the appliance, if applicable. Pick up a bit of sugar in your fingers and feel the texture. Resume grinding the sugar if it feels gritty, until its texture is powdery.The sugar is done when it looks fine-grained and fluffy like confectioners’ sugar., Stir the sugar with a fork. Place a mesh strainer over a bowl. Spoon the sugar into the strainer. Tap the side of the sieve repeatedly to sift the sugar into the bowl.Sifting aerates the sugar so that it’s lighter, fluffier and clump-free.

Add more powdered sugar.Most frostings contain powdered sugar, and the most common way to thicken a runny frosting is by gradually mixing in a bit more powdered sugar to offset the liquid ingredients.,
Mix in a bit of meringue powder alongside the powdered sugar.,
Use tapioca, cornstarch, or arrowroot starch.,
Only use flour for cooked frostings.,
Try softened cream cheese.If your frosting is too sweet as well as being too runny, you can try adding cream cheese to it as a way to thicken the consistency and add a contrasting tanginess to the existing sweetness.,
Increase the amount of cocoa powder, when applicable.,
Mix in more butter or shortening.,
Consider mixing in a dash of heavy cream.,
Refrigerate the frosting.,
Cook hot frosting for more time.,
Follow the instructions closely.,
Mix the ingredients together in the best possible sequence.,
Add ingredients slowly and in small amounts.",How to Thicken Frosting,"









Only add the sugar a little at a time. Sprinkle an additional 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) into the frosting and mix well. If you add too much at once, the frosting will become too sweet and may become too thick. If this happens, you will need to add more liquid to balance it out, and the consistency problem may only continue from there.
Powdered sugar contains cornstarch. Starches absorb liquid, and the cornstarch present in powdered sugar prevents the powdered sugar from caking.;
, To cut down on the sweetness of powdered sugar, you can add meringue powder, as well. It will thicken your frosting without contributing any sweetness of its own.









Typically, if you are adding more than 1/2 cup (125 ml) of powdered sugar to thicken a runny royal icing recipe, you should also add 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of meringue powder. This is especially true if the recipe already contains meringue powder.Meringue powder is made from dried egg whites, sugar, and gum. The sugar can absorb some of the liquid and the gum is a natural thickener. If used in excess, however, you might end up with a frosting that is too heavy or stringy.

, Dry starches like these absorb liquid and are a great way to thicken frosting without altering the taste of the frosting.








Add roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of starch to your frosting. Heat the frosting over low heat, if it can withstand higher temperatures, while stirring the starch in. Remove from the stove as soon as the frosting begins to thicken.
Cornstarch is probably the most popular starch to use in frostings since it has low gloss, little flavor, and works well with dairy. It congeals when exposed to low temperatures, though, so it is not ideal for use with frostings that need to remain refrigerated. It works best for frostings that are cooked on the stovetop slightly before cooling to room temperature.
Arrowroot produces a high gloss and works better with acidic liquids. It tends to become slimy when added to dairy, but if your frosting contains dairy products with a higher acidity, like sour cream or buttermilk, arrowroot is a good choice. It also thickens at a fairly low temperature, making it suitable for frostings that will need to remain cool.
Tapioca also has a high gloss, but it stands up well to cold temperatures and thickens at a fairly low temperature, as well, making it a better option if you have a frosting that will need to remain cold.

, If you are making warm frosting on your stovetop, you can try thickening a runny frosting with a bit of flour.









Do not use flour in cold frosting recipes, however. Flour has a distinctive taste when eaten raw, and the only way to get rid of this taste is by cooking it out. As such, you can use flour for cooked frostings, assuming the frosting is still undergoing the heating process, but it is not a suitable thickener for cool frostings that require no cooking.
Flour will not reach its maximum thickening capability if it is not heated.
Sprinkle 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (5 ml to 15 ml) of flour into the frosting and stir over low heat on the stove until it begins to thicken.
Remove the frosting from the heat as soon as it begins to thicken. Cooking flour in for too long can cause the frosting to become thin and runny again.

,









Add about 1 oz (30 ml) of cream cheese to your frosting and blend it in well. This works best with frostings that already contain cream cheese or those that could benefit from less sweetness.

, While this is not an option for vanilla, cream cheese, or other non-chocolate frostings, the addition of more cocoa powder is worth trying if you are making a chocolate frosting.









Add more cocoa powder into the frosting 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) at a time. Otherwise, you may end up with a frosting that is too thick or too potent. Since cocoa powder is also fairly bitter on its own, too much can also cause the frosting to become bitter.
Cocoa powder is a starch thickener, as well, but does not need to be cooked in order to thicken liquid. As a result, cocoa powder is a better addition than melted chocolate when you are trying to thicken your frosting.
Unsweetened cocoa has more thickening power than bittersweet chocolate. The former contains more starches than the latter.

, For frostings that use butter or shortening, using more of either ingredient can help thicken a frosting that is a little too runny.









Only add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) or so at a time to prevent distorting the taste and consistency too drastically.
Note that adding butter to the frosting may not seem to help immediately. As the frosting heats up from being mixed, the butter will melt, making the consistency thinner. Refrigerate butter-based frostings to get an accurate picture of how thick the frosting really is.

, For frostings that can stand to be beaten and chilled, heavy cream is another way you can thicken the consistency without making the taste too sweet.









Cream will provide a thick, rich texture.
This works best if you plan on heating or whipping your frosting after you add the cream. Heating cream causes it to reduce down, becoming thicker as a result. Whipping cream causes it to fluff up, which also makes it thicker and causes the frosting to become lighter in texture.
Only add about 1/4 cup (60 ml) heavy cream to the frosting. Too much will only make the frosting thinner.

, Some frostings seem thin simply because they need time to set. If this is the case, chilling the frosting in your refrigerator for 30 to 90 minutes will usually do the trick.









This trick generally works best for frostings that have been cooked on the stove. Place the frosting in your refrigerator to let it set. As the temperature drops, the consistency will usually thicken, as well.
This can also work if your frosting is butter-based or if it contains whipped cream. These ingredients are heat sensitive, so the longer they are exposed to room temperature, the thinner the frosting will seem. Placing the frosting back in the refrigerator will cause it to thicken back up.

, If a stovetop frosting still seems a little too liquidy, you might be able to reduce some of that liquid by extending the cooking time slightly.









Note, however, that you should exercise caution while trying this technique. If you cook a frosting too long, it may burn or break down. Stir the frosting frequently as it cooks, and if it does not appear to start thickening after a few additional minutes, remove it from the heat and try a different tactic.

, Frosting might seem simple, but making even a minor change to the ingredients can result in an unexpected change to the consistency.









Unsweetened chocolate will make your frosting thicker than bittersweet or milk chocolate. Cocoa solids have starches in them, and unsweetened chocolate has a higher amount of cocoa solids in it while sweeter chocolates have more sugar and less starch. As a result, if a recipe calls for unsweetened chocolate and you use semisweet, your frosting may turn out thinner than expected.
Cream cheese and milk are other examples. Generally, there will not be much difference between a frosting made with 2% milk and whole milk, but if a recipe calls for half-and-half or heavy cream, do not substitute milk in its place. Similarly, low-fat cream cheese has been known to produce thinner frostings when a recipe calls for standard cream cheese.

, Typically, the fully liquid ingredients in a frosting are added last. Following this procedure could help you to prevent runny frosting before it happens.









If the sugar and butter (or shortening) are mixed first, add other liquids like water and milk afterward. In this instance, these ingredients are only added to make the frosting easier to whip and spread, and should be added cautiously to prevent the frosting from becoming runny.

, One of the biggest reasons why people often end up with consistency problems while making frosting is simply that a little too much of one ingredient gets added, throwing the entire recipe off.









Both the liquids and powdered sugar need to be added slowly and in small amounts. If a frosting ends up being way too thick at first, the need to thin it by adding more liquid can result in the addition of too much liquid, which will make the frosting too thin.

Warm the mixture over medium-high heat until a candy thermometer reads 240 degrees Fahrenheit (116 degrees Celsius), which should take 10 to 15 minutes.If you don’t have a candy thermometer, fill a bowl with ice cold water. Drop some of the corn syrup mixture into the water. The mixture should easily form a soft, flexible ball in the water when it reaches the right temperature. If it forms thin threads instead, it isn’t hot enough yet. If it forms a hard ball, you’ve cooked it too long.;
, While the corn syrup mixture is heating, add the whites from 3 large eggs to the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment inserted. Whip the eggs whites on medium until they become foamy.To separate the egg whites from the yolks, crack the eggs against a flat surface, such as a counter or tabletop. Divide the eggs in two over a bowl, and let the yolks to fall into the lower half. Move the yolks back and forth between the halves, allowing the white to drip out into the bowl. Continue moving the yolks until all of the whites have dripped out. Save the yolks for another recipe.
If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can use an electric hand mixer instead.

, Once the whites are foamy, turn the mixer’s speed up to high. Add ½ teaspoon (2 g) of cream of tartar and a pinch of salt, and continue whipping until the mixture forms soft peaks, which typically takes 1 to 2 minutes.You want the egg white mixture to reach the right consistency just as the corn syrup mixture is finished heating. If the egg whites are coming along more quickly than the corn syrup, it’s okay to stop mixing them and wait for the corn syrup to reach the proper temperature.

, When the corn syrup mixture has reached 240 degrees Fahrenheit (116 degrees Celsius), remove the pan from the heat. Let the mixture rest for approximately 20 seconds so it cools slightly.Don’t allow the corn syrup mixture to cool any longer than 20 seconds. It may become too thick to incorporate into the egg white mixture.

, Turn your mixer on to high, and slowly pour the corn syrup mixture into the egg whites. The mixer bowl may get warm, but continue mixing the ingredients for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the outside of the bowl returns to room temperature again.Try not to pour the corn syrup mixture so it hits the whisk. Instead, aim for the side of the mixer bowl.

, When you’re finished mixing the corn syrup mixture into the egg whites, add 1 ½ teaspoons (7 ½ ml) of vanilla extract to the bowl. Continue blending the mixture until medium-stiff peaks form, which should take 1 to 2 minutes.The recipe makes 2 to 3 cups (200 to 300 g) of marshmallow fluff.

, When the butter is creamed, gradually add 4 cups (500 g) of powdered sugar to the butter. Continue mixing until the sugar is fully incorporated, which should take approximately 2 minutes.You may want to add the powdered sugar in increments and mix after each addition. That often makes it easier to blend it into the butter.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl as you’re mixing to ensure that all of the powdered sugar is incorporated.

, Once the butter and powdered sugar are fully blended, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of milk to the bowl. Continue blending the mixture until it is completely smooth, which should take approximately 30 seconds to 1 minutes.For the richest buttercream frosting, use whole milk.

, When you’ve finished blending the butter mixture, line a large baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper. Spread a 10 ounce (284 g) bag of mini marshmallows over the baking sheet in a single, even layer.You can substitute a silicone baking mat for the parchment paper if you prefer.

, Place the baking sheet with marshmallows under your oven’s broiler. Allow them to heat until they are puffed and brown, which should take approximately 45 seconds.Keep a close eye on the marshmallows because they can burn quickly.

, When the marshmallows are toasted, remove them from the oven and immediately add them to the butter mixture. Beat the frosting on medium until it is smooth.The marshmallows will melt into the frosting as you beat it, but you’ll still see little brown, toasted bits in the finished product.

, The frosting will be warm after mixing the marshmallows into it because they’ve been toasted. Let the frosting cool completely before spreading or piping it on your cake, cupcakes, or other baked goods.It’s best to use all of the frosting up right after you make it. Refrigerating it can cause the marshmallows to harden, so the frosting’s texture may change.

Divide the icing and add food coloring.,
Apply the icing to the sugar cookies.",How to Make Icing for Cookies1," This simple recipe for sugar cookie icing only takes fifteen minutes to make. It yields enough icing for twelve to fourteen cookies. Bake your sugar cookies before you start on the icing. They must be completely cool before you can ice them.Corn syrup is optional. It can be substituted with granulated white sugar.;
, Measure out the ingredients and place them into a small bowl. Mix them together until the mixture is smooth. You can mix them together manually by stirring or you can use a mixer on its lowest setting.

, Measure out the ingredients and add them to the bowl. Use your mixer to blend it all together. Keep beating the icing until it appears smooth and glossy. Stop mixing and test the consistency of it.


The icing needs to be thick enough to stay on the cookies and thin enough to easily paint onto the cookies.
For a slightly different taste, replace the ¼ teaspoon (1.2 ml) of vanilla extract with ¼ teaspoon (1.2 ml) of almond extract.

, Use a few of your pre-baked sugar cookies as testers. They must be completely cooled before you try to ice them. Paint a small amount of icing on the edges of the cookie. Allow it to dry for a few minutes, then check to see if the icing dripped over the edges. If there is no dripping, your icing is ready to use.


If your icing is too thin, mix small amounts of powdered sugar into the icing until it thickens up.
If you can’t easily paint the icing onto a cookie, it is too thick. Add small amounts of corn syrup to the icing and stir until you reach the right consistency.
If you're planning on dying the icing and making multi-color cookies, make some of the icing slightly thicker to use as ""border icing"" (the icing used to trace around the cookie). Use slightly thinner icing as ""flood icing"" (the icing that fills in the middle area of the cookie). The thicker border icing will help to keep the thinner flood icing on the cookie., Place small amounts of the icing into separate bowls so that you can add the food coloring. Add a different color of food coloring to each bowl. Use a few drops at a time and then stir together well.


If you want the color to be darker, add a few more drops and stir.

, You have a few different options for application. You can dip the cookies into the icing. You can also paint the icing on with a clean paint brush or spread it onto the cookies using a knife or the back of a spoon. You can also use a piping bag to apply the frosting.


Squeeze bottles and using spoons to pour icing are two additional methods that will yield excellent results.
Using a piping bag will give you the most professional-looking results. Dipping the cookies is probably the easiest way, but painting will allow you more control.

",How to Smooth Fondant on a Cake," Fondant can be homemade or bought. Remove the fondant from any plastic, paper, and so forth. Lay it on a clean cooking space and knead well to help the fondant stay together and not crumble.;
, Flour your surface and gently push the fondant down, making it the shape of a pancake. Use a rolling pan to make the fondant stretch until thin. Avoid rolling too much, however, because the fondant will tear when being added on the cake.

, Using a butter knife, spread a thin layer of butter cream frosting on the cake. Butter is greasy and can stick really well which helps the fondant stay on the cake.

, Gently and carefully lay the fondant on the cake like you are laying a blanket. Close the bottom edges and try your best to make everything even to avoid wrinkles or clumps.

, With a smoothing tool, smooth the sides and top of the cake to make it straighten. Don't use your hands, they leave fingerprints and other shapes on the cake. Smoothing helps the fondant not bubble.

, Use a pizza cutter to cut of the excess edges, going around slowly. You can store the extra fondant for later use.

Measure and cut around the tip.,
Place the piping bag in a tall cup or glass.,
Spoon your frostings into the bag.,
Squeeze out all air bubbles.,
Try a few practice swirls.",How to Swirl Multiple Frostings for Cupcakes1," The type of tip you choose will change the style of the frosting. For example, a Wilton 2D closed star tip creates a ruffled appearance in the frosting. Whereas a Wilton 1M open star tip will give you a smoother look. However, the choice is up to you!You can also use a coupler, which allows you to change out the frosting tip without having to use a new piping bag.
Or, if you don’t have a piping tip, don’t worry! You can simply cut off the end of the bag and go from there. However, be mindful that how much you cut off will change the width of your frosting.;
, Use a pen or sharpie to mark a line in the piping bag right before the base of the frosting tip. You want to leave a little space between the end of the tip and where you’ll be cutting the bag. This will help prevent the tip from falling out or frosting from leaking when you start to use it. After you measure the area, use scissors to cut the tip of the bag away so the frosting tip pokes out freely.If using a coupler, just cut the bag past the end of the coupler, then put on your preferred icing tip and attach the smaller part of the coupler over it to secure it.

, The material of the cup doesn’t matter, however, try to make sure it’s not too narrow. Once you have a glass, put the piping bag inside with the tip facing down. Then fold the rest of the bag over and around the edges of the glass. Secure the excess of the bag with a rubber band. You may have to wrap it more than once as you want the piping bag to be secure., Use a spatula or large spoon to place your frostings into the piping bag. Focus on one frosting at a time. You want to try to keep each frosting to its own side. When working with two frostings it’s easier as you are simply halving the bag. However, working with three to four frostings makes this a bit more difficult.Leave some space between the frosting and the top of the cup.
Don’t worry if it isn’t perfect, you’ll still be able to swirl the frosting without issue.

, Remove the rubber band and take the bag from the cup. Then grip the piping bag by the edges and push all the frosting down towards the tip. You can twist the end of the bag to make this easier. Squeeze evenly until a bit of frosting escapes from the tip.

If you want, you can secure the end of the bag with a rubber band or twist tie.

, Depending on how many different types of frosting you have in the bag, it may take longer to get a proper swirl. Try piping a bit onto a paper plate or spare cupcake if possible. It’s likely you will only see one or two of the flavors at first before the rest of them come out.

Remember it’s okay to have an uneven swirl. This can even add a bit of character to your cupcakes.

For example, if you want to swirl three different frostings, then you will need three piping bags plus one. The extra frosting bag will be used to combine all of your frostings into one and should be set aside.Keep in mind that going over four different frostings will make fitting everything into one bag very difficult.

, Take each bag and put them tip down into separate cups. Then fold the excess of the bags over the edges of the glasses. Secure each with rubber bands. It’s important that they stay in place as you will be putting frosting in the bag that will weigh it down., Use a spatula or large spoon and start moving your frosting into the piping bags. Push down, but don’t pack the frosting as you want the tip to remain unfilled. Since you are only putting one frosting in each bag, you can fill them however you’d like. Just make sure you are only filling them around 3/4ths full as you will need to twist the bags closed later., Remove each piping bag from their glass and use your hands to push the frosting down towards the tip. You can twist the base of the piping bag as you’re doing this to aid in moving the frosting downwards. Once you can no longer push down, secure the ends of the bags with rubber bands or twist ties., Now that each bag is full of frosting, it’s time to cut off the tips. You don’t need a large hole, just a small area for the frosting the go through. Try just snipping off the very tips of the bag. You can always cut off more if you run into trouble with it later on., Now take the spare piping bag you set aside earlier, and push a frosting tip into the end of it. The type of tip you choose will change the way the frosting on your cupcakes looks. For example, a Wilton 2D closed star tip creates a ruffled look while using something like the Wilton 1M open star creates a smoother line of frosting. There’s no wrong choice here, so feel free to play with it!, Once you’ve placed the frosting tip into the end of the piping bag, mark a line just before the tips base. This is where you will cut the bag. Make sure you leave a bit of overlap between the bag and the end of the frosting tip as this will help with leaking. It will also keep your tip securely in the bag!, It will be a tight fit, however, you should be able to get three to four bags into the spare one. You may have one or two bags slightly higher than the others, but this won’t matter once you start frosting. Everything should even out as you go along., In the same way you moved frosting downwards in the separate bags, squeeze all the frostings down towards the tip of the combined bag. You will want to do a few practice swirls or lines to get each color out. However, it shouldn’t take long for you to see a perfect mix of each shade."

Turn one side of the fondant back over the rolling pin.,
Pat the fondant around the cake gently.,
Remove excess edges.,
If adding any indented pattern to the cake, do it before the fondant sets.,
Add motifs if using.,
Allow time to dry.",How to Use Fondant2," The cake should be placed on its presentation cake board or flat platter before adding the fondant––check that it is sitting flat upon placement.


If the cake does not sit flat, consider slicing the base a little to ensure that it sits well. This is known as ""leveling a cake"".
If the cake seems a little crumbly, place it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to help it firm up.

, This is the same principle as filling in cracks on furniture or walls before painting––if you don't fill in any holes or cracks, the surface fondant risks sinking into the cake and leaving dents in your otherwise perfect cake!

, Popular choices include apricot, strawberry or raspberry jams. Using a pastry brush, brush this over the surface of the cake, both top and sides.

, For a very smooth surface underneath the fondant, chefs commonly use marzipan as the first layer, over which the fondant is placed. While the end result will look better, not everyone likes marzipan and it's usually not suitable for children's cakes. If you are using marzipan, do as follows:


Roll out the marzipan to a flat shape slightly larger than the cake.
Cover the cake with the sheet of rolled marzipan.
Smooth it down with a frosting smoother or similar item. Be sure to remove any bumps or joins when smoothing.

, If it has cracks, place this part under the ball. Roll out the ball on a surface sprinkled with icing/confectioners sugar or cornflour (this prevents it from sticking). Keep rolling back and forth over the fondant, rotating it a quarter of the way every few rolls to help ensure even distribution of the fondant. When it looks wide enough to cover the cake and has a thickness of about a 1/4 inch or 0.5cm, it's ready to place on the cake.


To gauge the size to roll the fondant to, measure the distance from the cake board, up the side, across the top and down the other side of the cake to the edge of the board that side.

,


Place the rolling pin on the center of the rolled out fondant.

,


Lift the rolling pin up with the fondant securely draped over it and shift the fondant over the the cake.
Carefully unroll the fondant onto the cake, rolling the fondant across and eventually removing the rolling pin.

, Push it down the sides and be sure to cover all of the cake.


Smooth down the sides to meet the cake's board or platter. Any air bubbles that form can be pricked with a clean needle; simply rub over again to remove any evidence of it.
Smooth out any bumps, pleats or unsightly bits using the smoother. You may also need to occasionally stretch the fondant with your hands.
Fondant icing can be given a good ""polish"" by rubbing over it with your hand in a circular motion, until it looks (and feels) like satin.

, Cut off any extra fondant around the base edge using a palette knife. Hold the flat edge against the cake and slowly work around the whole cake, turning the cake as you go. Smooth out the edges as you go.

, There are tools that will produce pretty patterns or crimping or you can be creative and use your own pattern.

, These can be attached before the fondant dries simply by gently pressing. If the fondant has already dried, use freshly made up icing/confectioners sugar as the ""glue"" (or a small brush of water will also work).

, The amount of time will depend on the fondant recipe. For a fruit cake with marzipan and fondant covering, this may take up to a week.

Make balls.,
Make ball variations.",How to Use Fondant3," Simply roll the fondant into a ball, small or big, as required. Use the palm of your hands and move the fondant in a circular motion to form the ball.


Balls can be cut in halves and quarters.
To make smaller balls, divide in half again and again and keep rolling.

, There are various simple shapes that you can roll or stretch the ball into:


Teardrop: Roll one end of the ball back and forth until it becomes elongated and thinner than the other end.
Cone: Roll one end of the ball into a V shape.
Sausage: Roll the whole ball on a flat surface, rolling back and forth until both sides are the same and a sausage shape forms.
Tube: Make a sausage and just keep on rolling until the fondant gets skinnier and a tube forms.
Pinch in either end of a cone or sausage to make an interesting shape for working with.

Draw a grid on a piece of plain paper.,
Draw the motif into the squares.",How to Use Fondant4," The grid squares should add up to make the exact same size as the motif you're making. (This means that using pre-drawn graph paper may not always work out.) A simple method is to determine the size of the motif, draw a box to that size, then use a ruler to measure evenly to divide the square into grid boxes.


If you're upsizing an original motif, then the number of squares need to match the original amount on the smaller motif.

, Either copy with existing grid motif or copy in an image you like.


You can skip using the squares if the image you like can be printed, cut out and is simple enough to work over the top of without gridding. Be aware though that it's usually easier to work a grid design when shaping the fondant pieces.

"
"
Slip the motif inside a plastic pocket or sheet.,
Smear edible oil over the motif area.,
Shape the fondant onto the motif design.,
Shape all the back pieces first.,
Shift the motif from the plastic template to the cake top:


Use a palette knife.",How to Use Fondant5," This provides a protective cover that you can work on top of.

, This will prevent the fondant from sticking to the plastic sheet.

, For each part of the motif and each fondant color, always roll the fondant into a ball, then press down into the motif template area. The size of the ball will vary depending on how much fondant each part of the motif requires; you'll get better at estimating this with practice.


Always work on the back pieces first, leaving the front pieces (such as eyes, whiskers, noses, etc. until last). For example, if you're making a cat motif, the cat's body, tail and head will likely be shaped first, then paws and then add on the ears, eyes, whiskers and nose.
In general, the middle of each piece of fondant should be higher than the sides, which will usually be smoothed into the joining pieces.

, Then move onto the next layer of pieces and continue in this manner until all the elements have been added in an appropriate order.


Use the shape suggestions from the section above to guide how you make and change the shapes.
Leave the small details until last.
If you want the motif to appear shiny, brush on a tiny amount of vegetable oil.

, Slip this under the motif with care, making sure to lift up all of the motif before lifting off the plastic sheet. Have the cake already sitting next to the motif workspace and quickly but carefully move the motif across and onto the exact position on the cake.
If both the cake fondant and the motif fondant have dried, use fresh icing/confectioners sugar or a brush of water to ""glue"" in place. If the motif is still fresh, it will usually adhere on its own.

"
"
Add color.,
Texture using a palette knife.,
Use cookie cutters.,
Use tools to make interesting patterns.",How to Use Fondant6," This can be done by using a very fine brush dipped in food coloring or luster. Simply brush onto the area you would like more color added.

, Lines, indents, curves and other designs can all be carved or pushed into the fondant using a palette knife.

, If you don't want to go to the trouble of making a template (as outlined above), sometimes simply punching out motif shapes in rolled fondant using cookie cutter shapes is the best solution. Anything from stars to bunnies will work well. You can always build on the basic punched out shape by adding details such as eyes, hair and clothing, etc.

, The kitchen and craft cupboard are full of possibilities when it comes to implements that can make interesting shapes, details and patterns. Think of such things as the end of piping or cookie dough nozzles, drinking straws, designs on spoons, buttons, sculpting knives, cookie stamps, unused printing stamps, fork tines, etc.

Work on a clean, flat surface.,
Remove jewelry and change into suitable clothing.,
Allow ingredients to reach room temperature.,
Sprinkle your work surface with icing/confectioners sugar.,
Knead your fondant.,
Place the fondant on your prepared work area.,
Roll your fondant into a thick, even disk.,
Stop rolling when you reach your desired thickness.,
Transfer your fondant to your cake.,
Trim your fondant.,
Apply a crumb coat to your cake for a smooth finish.,
Flip fondant to hide cracks.,
Soften dry fondant when smoothing.",How to Roll Fondant," In many cases this will be your counter top. A marble or wooden chopping board works well if your counter is irregular in shape or has trenches in it from grouting. Irregularities in your counter can make your fondant irregular when rolling.Depending on the amount of fondant you're working with, you might only need a small area to work in. Generally, you'll need at least enough space to accommodate a rolling pin.;
, Fondant can get stuck to your rings or the space between your finger and ring, creating both a mess and interfering with the rolling process. Clothing with many stray fibers or hanging sleeves can transfer threads and lint to your fondant.


If you plan on wearing an apron, check it for stray threads before tying it snugly around yourself to prevent it from draping onto the fondant., Take your fondant ball out of your refrigerator if you have stored it there and allow it to sit on your work area until it has reached room temperature. If you've wrapped your fondant in plastic wrap, remove this now.


To prevent your fondant from prematurely sticking to your work area, you may want to leave the bottom covered by plastic wrap.
Depending on your climate, the time it takes for your fondant to reach room temperature can vary. In most cases, 15 minutes to a half hour should be sufficient.
You may want to remove your fondant from the refrigerator before you begin preparing your work area. This way, you can prep while waiting for the fondant to reach room temperature.

, Powder the area you'll be rolling your fondant on with a thin layer of confectioners sugar. This will stop the fondant from sticking to the surface on which you are trying to roll it out. You should also dust your fondant working tools, like your rolling pin, in the sugar.


In most cases, you should only need enough sugar to create a thin coating on your tools and work area.
Fondant is very sticky. Especially in warm or moist climates, you may find you need to use a considerable amount of sugar on your work area and fondant working tools.
If you don't have confectioners sugar available to you, you can use corn starch as a substitute., The kneading action and heat of your hands helps the fondant become smooth in consistency and pliable. Before you knead, you'll want to coat your hands with confectioners sugar or corn starch to prevent the fondant from sticking to yourself.


If you are working with white colored fondant and need to add food coloring to it, you should do so during the kneading process. You may want to use plastic gloves to prevent your hands from being stained.
If using several different colors, portion out your fondant in the quantity you believe necessary and knead the coloring into each portion separately.
The motion for kneading fondant is very similar to that of kneading dough. However, the fondant will in most cases be heavier and thicker.
Generally, you can expect to knead your fondant for about five to eight minutes before it reaches the correct consistency., Your fondant should be now at room temperature and your work area coated with either sugar or corn starch to prevent sticking. Put your fondant atop your prepared work area., Take your rolling pin and place it on your fondant ball. Remember, you want your pin to be sugared or corn starched beforehand to prevent sticking. Roll back and forth continuously to flatten the fondant. Use gentle but firm pressure, and take your time to ensure evenness in the rolled fondant.


When you are finished rolling your fondant, if you're still waiting for your cake to finish, you can prevent your fondant from drying out by covering it in a thin layer of shortening.
If you're trying to roll your fondant into a large circular shape to cover a large cake, try turning the circle every few rolls. Rotate about 90 degrees each time, the roll the fondant outwards, away from yourself., How thick you want your fondant is going to depend on what you are using it for. An even fondant covering for a simple cake can be rolled fairly thin, which will make it easier to drape over the cake. If you plan on molding the fondant into flowers, characters, shapes, or designs, thicker fondant might be best.


Fondant that is ½"" (1¼ cm) thick can be useful for molding characters, flowers, and three dimensional designs.
When layering the outside of a cake with fondant, a thick coating of fondant can be overpoweringly sweet. In this case, you may want to roll your fondant until it is the thickness of cardboard or thick card stock.
Rolling your fondant too thin can to make it tear easily. This will make it difficult to transfer to your cake. It may take some trial and error before you find the perfect thickness for your fondant design., If you are draping a sheet of fondant to entirely cover a cake, it can be transferred easily by placing the rolling pin on the fondant and winding the fondant around the pin. Then take the pin and fondant to your cake and gently unroll it atop the cake.


You may notice that your fondant is slightly irregular in places. This is fairly common. Even a steady, well-practiced hand at fondant isn't perfect. You can use a palette knife or butter knife to smooth your fondant, if needed.
Alternatively, you can pick up the rolled fondant gently with your hands and drape it on top of your cake. You may want to coat your hands first in confectioners sugar/corn start to prevent sticking, or wear plastic gloves., Now that your fondant is rolled and applied to your cake, you'll need to trim off extra bits so it is uniform and neat. For precision trimming, you may want to use a clean utility knife for this purpose, or a very sharp paring knife.

, A crumb coat is a thin layer of frosting on the surface of your cake that prevents crumb build up. Crumbs beneath the surface of your fondant can give it a lumpy or irregular appearance. Use a spatula or offset spatula to spread a thin, uniform layer of icing on your cake.


White icing works well as a crumb coat for most kinds of fondant. Dark colored icing can sometimes show through lighter colored fondant., The sugar in your fondant can sometimes crack, causing your cake to look less polished. When this happens, flip your fondant and inspect the other side. In many cases, the cracks will only appear on one side of the fondant.


If there are cracks on both sides, gently rub solid vegetable shortening in a circular motion over the afflicted area. This should fuse the fondant back together.
Avoid using water to revitalize or repair fondant. Water will cause the sugar to break down., Getting your fondant to look just right can take time. When you are smoothing your fondant, you may notice that some parts harden and become brittle. Use a smoother to gently rub solid vegetable shortening on the dry fondant in a circular motion to revitalize the fondant.


Attempting to shape or smooth dry fondant can result in it breaking.
When smoothing, you may want to use a special tool called a fondant smoother. This will help smooth the fondant with less risk of it tearing."

Choose a tip.,
Insert the tip into the pastry bag.,
Add the frosting.,
Squeeze the air out of the bag.,
Work the frosting to the tip.,
Frost the cupcake.,
Finish your frosting with a peak.",How to Pipe Frosting on Cupcakes1," Pastry bags typically come with a set of tips that you can switch out to make different designs with your frosting. Pick a tip that looks appealing to you. Common designs are circles, stars, dots, and other simple shapes, though more complicated tips are also available.


Choose the smallest tip you can for the design you are trying to pipe. Smaller tips let the frosting come out more slowly and are easier to perform detail work with, making them best for intricate designs. Larger tips are fine for simple designs.;
, Depending on the type of bag you're using, there are several different ways to do this. See below:


Many modern bags have a screw-on mechanism. For these, thread the bottom end of the bag through the coupler. Next, screw the tip on to tighten and lock it in place.Some bags simply have a hole at the bottom. For these, set the tip point-down inside the pastry bag. Shift it around so that it sits at the hole in the bottom. Give it a gentle downward tug to pull it snugly into place.
Some disposable bags allow you to push the tip through the plastic at the bottom.

, Roll the top of the pastry bag over on itself. This keeps frosting from getting on the outside. Use a spoon or spatula to transfer the frosting inside. Unroll the top edges of the bag. Squeeze the frosting down toward the tip.


You can either buy commercial frosting or make your own. See our cupcake frosting recipes for a few good ideas. It's easy!
The frosting should not run out of the bottom of the bag when loading it. If it does, it is too thin. Thicken it by whipping in powdered sugar or a very small amount of cornstarch (less than a tablespoon for average recipes)., Push the air gently out of the top portion of the bag. Don't use too much force or you may push the frosting through the tip.


Twist the top of the bag shut to keep the air out. Hold the bag shut with one hand.

, With the hand holding the bag shut, squeeze lightly until you see the tip of the frosting peeping out of the tip. At this point, you're ready to start frosting the cupcake. Any squeezing you do now will push frosting out.

, Hold the piping bag 5 centimeters (2.0 in) above the edge of the cupcake. Squeeze gently on the pastry bag to force frosting out of the tip. Cover the cupcake with frosting as you wish. One common design is below:


For a traditional swirl design, start piping at one side of the cupcake and lay the frosting around the border in a circular pattern. Move inward and overlap the frosting with each full turn to build a spiraling pile of frosting.

, When you are satisfied with the frosting, stop squeezing the bag. You're not quite done yet. To get a good-looking peak, use a a quick, ""bouncy"" upward movement to pull the pastry bag away from the cupcake. This may take a little practice.


If you have frosting to spare, you can practice this motion on a plate before attempting to frost the actual cupcake.

"
"
Find a suitable bag.,
Add the frosting.,
Seal the bag.,
Cut off the corner.,
Frost the cupcake.",How to Pipe Frosting on Cupcakes2," If you don't have a pastry bag, don't worry. It's easy to use a Ziploc or similar plastic disposable bag. Fairly large, sturdy bags that can stand up to a little squeezing pressure tend to be easiest to work with.


Make sure the bag is clean before you start. You won't want to re-use a plastic bag unless you've cleaned and dried it well.

, Roll up the top edges of the bag. Use a spatula or spoon to scoop frosting into the bag. When you're done, unroll the top of the bag.


You can save yourself a little work if you place all of the frosting in one of the bottom corners of the bag.

, Work as much air as possible out of the bag, then close the top. You can do this either by twisting the top ends (like with a normal pastry bag) or by using the bag's actual locking mechanism.


After this, push as much of the frosting as you can to one of the bottom corners You will use this as the tip.

, Use scissors to just barely snip off the corner of the bag that the frosting is. Squeeze gently to test how much frosting comes out on a plate. If you have to squeeze hard to get what you want, make the hole bigger. Gradually increase the size of the hole until you're getting the desired effect.


Decide how thick you want your frosting to look on the cupcake before you make your cut. The bigger the hole in the bag, the more frosting will come out. This is basically the same as deciding which tip to use in a pastry bag.

, Now, you can more or less frost as normal. Squeeze the bag to push a stream of frosting out of your improvised ""tip."" When you're done, use the same upward pulling motion to give your frosting an appealing peak.


You may need to be slightly more careful with this method. The tip of the plastic bag will be less firm than the metal tip of a pastry bag, so it will be easier to make mistakes or to use too much frosting.

The cream should be whipped until it forms soft peaks.
When lifted with a spatula, the whipped cream should remain on the spatula without falling off.
If over-whipped, the cream will be too stiff to spread nicely. Stop when you see those peaks! That's when it's still wonderfully spreadable.

These both need time to set and mature, so it’s important to start one to two days before you want to assemble the penguins.

Once you make the sugar paste dough, it needs to sit for 24 hours before you can use it.
After making the edible glue, it requires 12 hours to set before you can use it to assemble the penguin parts.;
, To make and assemble the penguins, you'll need your white, black, and orange sugar paste, along with a few tools. Other supplies you'll need include:

Stand mixer or large mixing bowl
Paddle attachment or electric beaters
Two sealable plastic bags
Small mixing bowl
Whisk
Fondant rolling pin
Sharp knife
Small decorating brush
Small oval cookie cutter, about three-quarter inches (19 mm) long
Small round cookie cutter, about one-quarter inch (6 mm) in diameter
Black edible marker

, Place the egg whites into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat the eggs in the stand mixer or with electric beaters on medium speed for about 10 seconds, or long enough to break up the egg whites.If you're using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment to make the sugar paste.
When you're making sugar paste, the dough will have to sit for 24 hours, so start this one to two days before you want to make your sugar paste penguins.

, Turn the mixer to low speed and gradually add 6 cups (750 g) of the powdered sugar, beating it in one cup (125 g) at a time. When you’ve added the 6 cups of sugar, continue beating until it takes on the consistency of icing.

Increase the speed of the mixer to medium and beat the mixture for two minutes, until the mixture starts to form soft peaks.
The soft peak stage means the mixture will form peaks, but they’ll melt back into the mixture within a couple seconds., Turn the mixer to low speed and slowly sprinkle in the tylose powder. Continue mixing for about 30 seconds, then turn the mixer to high for 30 seconds.

As the tylose is incorporated, it will thicken everything to a dough.
Tylose powder is a food additive that’s also called carboxymethycellulose. It’s used to make thick pastes that harden when they dry, which is why it’s great for making sugar paste., Dust a flat surface with powdered sugar and turn the dough out onto it. Knead the dough, gradually adding the remaining ⅔ cup (83 g) of powdered sugar, until you have a soft dough.When the dough is ready, it will be soft and pliable, but not sticky to the touch.

, Place the dough into a sealable freezer bag. Press out as much air as you can to prevent the dough from drying out. Seal the bag, and then place that bag into a second sealable bag.

Move the dough to the fridge and let it rest for 24 hours., In a small bowl, combine the tylose powder and warm water. Whisk the two together to remove as many lumps as possible.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or put a lid on. Transfer the mixture to the fridge and let it set overnight, about 12 hours. As the mixture sets, it will become thick and syrupy.
This mixture will form an edible glue that you can use to attach different parts of the penguin to the body.

, When the dough has had 24 hours to relax, remove it from the fridge and let it warm up to room temperature.To make the penguins, you'll need black dough for the bodies, white dough for the stomachs and face, and orange dough for the beaks and feet. To divide the dough:

Cut the dough in half and set one half aside for the bodies.
With the remaining dough, use your eye to divide the dough into thirds. Use a knife to notch the one-third divisions into the dough. Cut off one-third of the dough, and leave the remaining two-thirds intact.
This larger section will remain white, so you don’t have to add any food coloring to it.

, Drizzle a flat work surface with some of the vegetable oil. Take the large half of dough and turn it out onto the oiled surface. Add about 10 drops of black food coloring, and gently knead the color into the dough.

Knead in more food coloring in 10-drop increments until you achieve the desired intensity of black for the bodies.

, Clean off your work surface so there's no leftover sugar, oil, or coloring. Drizzle fresh oil on the surface. Turn out the small one-third section of dough, and knead five drops of orange food coloring into the dough.

Knead in more color until you achieve the desired intensity for the beaks and feet.

, Remove enough sugar paste from the black dough to form a sphere with a one-inch (2.5-cm) diameter. Roll the dough into a ball, and then roll it into an oval to create the body of the penguin. Press the top and bottom of the oval to flatten them out.Flattening the top and bottom of the oval will give you a platform for the head and allow the penguin to stand.
To make a larger penguin, increase the amount of dough you use to create the body, and use proportionally more dough to create the other body parts as well.

, Roll out the white sugar paste into a circle that’s one-sixteenth inch (1.6 mm) thick. Use the cookie cutter to cut out an oval.Dip the decorating brush into the edible glue and coat one side of the oval with a thin layer of glue. Press the white oval onto the center of the black body and apply delicate pressure to secure the belly.


If you don’t have small cookie cutters, use a knife to cut out the oval.

, Remove some sugar paste from the black dough and roll it into a sphere with a half-inch (1.3-cm) diameter. To make the face, use the round cookie cutter and punch out a white circle from the white sugar paste.

Use the brush to apply some edible glue to the face, and gently press the face onto the head.
To make the eyes, apply two dots of edible marker to the penguin’s head.If you don’t have an edible marker, you can use two black sprinkles, sesame seeds, or tiny balls of black sugar paste instead.

, Break off a pea-sized piece of orange dough. With your fingers, roll it into a teardrop shape. Gently flatten the teardrop between your fingers. At the wider end, flatten the curve a little so it will conform to the shape of the penguin’s head.

Dip the brush in the glue and apply a thin layer to the beak before pressing the beak gently onto the head. Center the beak below and between the two eyes.
With your knife, cut a slit on either side of the beak to make it look like and upper and lower half., Apply a layer of glue to the bottom of the penguin’s head. Gently press the head into the body, being careful not to squish the beak or alter the shape of the head or body., For the first wing, break off a piece of dough that’s about the size of two peas. Roll the dough between your fingers to form it into a teardrop shape. Flatten the teardrop between your fingers. The rounded half will be the top of the wing.Apply some glue to the rounded half of the teardrop. Attach this end to the left side of the penguin’s body where the head and body meet.
Repeat for the right wing.

, Break off a piece of orange sugar paste that’s about the size of two peas. Roll the ball into a teardrop shape, then flatten it with your finger.Apply some glue to the pointed end of the teardrop, and attach it to the body.

Attach the foot to the front of the body, slightly left of center.
Repeat with the right foot.

Choose which colors you want.,
Determine what flavors you need.,
Boil and simmer vegetables for reds, purples, and blues.,
Puree fruits and vegetables to produce most colors.",How to Naturally Dye Icing1," Natural food dyes are typically vegetable or fruit juices. Juices work better than purees for icing as icings tend to be a thin glaze. You can buy the juice from the store or make your own. Depending on what color you want, you can use different types of fruits and vegetables to color your icing. Some natural products that work well in icings and frostings include:



Red: beet juice, pomegranate juice, or strained raspberry purée

Pink: beet juice, cranberry juice, or raspberry juice

Orange: carrot juice

Green: liquid chlorophyll, matcha powder, spinach juice

Blue: red cabbage juice and baking soda

Purple: blueberry juice, blackberry juice, concentrated grape juice;
, Vegetable and other natural dyes can flavor an icing as well as color it. Keep this in mind as you prepare your natural frosting. Choose vegetables that have a neutral flavor or consider how the flavor of the dye might mix with the flavor of your dessert.Beets, spinach, and liquid chlorophyll all have neutral flavors.
Carrot juice adds a slightly sweet flavor.
Fruit flavors, such as pomegranate, raspberry, and blueberry juice, might pair nicely with chocolate or vanilla desserts.
While some people use spices like turmeric, saffron, and paprika for natural food dyes, these may be too strongly flavored to use in an icing.

, You can make vegetable juice for your dyes by placing the beets (red or pink), cranberries (pink), or red cabbage (purple or blue) in a pot with water. Bring to a boil, and then simmer for between five and forty minutes. Simmer longer for a deeper color and shorter for a lighter color. Afterwards, drain the juice into a dish to cool. Save or discard the vegetables.


If you want to produce blue, boil and simmer red cabbage using this method. Wait for the purple juice to cool completely before adding ¼ teaspoon of baking soda.The longer you simmer beets, the more red the juice will be. The shorter you simmer beets, the more pink they will be. You can simmer beets for more than forty minutes to produce a darker red.Let the vegetable juice cool completely before you use it to dye icing. You can place it in a refrigerator to speed this process.

, If you have a vegetable or fruit juicer, all you need to do is place the vegetables inside and turn on the machine to produce a brightly colored juice. If you don’t have a juicer, you can place the vegetables in a food processor with a tablespoon or two of water. Process the fruits or vegetables until they liquefy, adding more water if needed. Strain the pulp with a cheesecloth, and collect the juice in a bowl. The juice will act as your dye.This method works with:


Carrots (orange)
Spinach (green)
Beets (pink or red)
Raspberries (red or pink)
Strawberries (pink)
Blueberries (purple)
Blackberries (purple)

, Insert a star shaped tip into your piping bag, such as the Wilton 195 or 363. Fill the piping bag with a medium-consistency buttercream frosting.This method will create a very simple tulip, shapes sort of like the top part of a fleur de lis., The center petal is a simple, vertical line that is fatter at the bottom and thinner at the top. You can create this by applying more pressure when you start, and hardly any pressure when you finish. How tall you make the tulip is up to you., The left petal starts at the base of the center one and angles to the left, curing at the tip. Place your piping bag at the base of the center petal, and pipe to the left. Once you reach leave the petal, start piping upwards, at a slight angle.

Replace the liquid with juice in a homemade recipe.,
Mix together.",How to Naturally Dye Icing2," If you are making your own icing, you should put all ingredients except for the water or milk in the recipe in a mixing bowl. The water or milk in the recipe will be replaced with your juice. If you don’t have a recipe for icing, you might use one of the following:


Mix one cup confectioner’s sugar, one tablespoon dried egg whites, ½ teaspoon corn syrup, and ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl. You will add two to four tablespoons of natural dye to this recipe.If you don’t like using corn syrup, you can mix one cup of confectioner’s sugar and one teaspoon of brown rice syrup for a similar icing. You will add three teaspoons of natural dye to this recipe.If you are making a frosting instead of an icing, the same principle applies. Replace any water or milk in the recipe with natural dye instead.

, Use the same amount of vegetable juice that you would use water or milk. For example, if the recipe calls for two tablespoons of water, use two tablespoons of juice instead.


If you have bought a store-bought icing, you should not use this method. You will have to boil the juice down into a syrup to avoid diluting the icing.

, Using a whisk, fork, or hand blender, mix the icing with the juice. Stir until the color is completely mixed in and all white streaks have disappeared from the icing. If you want a deeper color, add more dye.


It is better to start with a small amount of dye and add more as you need than to add too much at the beginning. You can always add dye, but you can’t remove dye.
Be careful when adding more liquid dye, as too much liquid can make your icing runny or watery."
"
Reduce juice to a syrup.,
Buy natural food dyes.,
Add a few drops to the icing.",How to Naturally Dye Icing3," For a more concentrated dye, you can simmer the liquid dye uncovered on low heat for 24 hours until the liquid is ¼ its original volume. You may want to use a crockpot or slow cooker for this.Keep an eye on the juice as it simmers to make sure that too much liquid does not boil out.
While you can add unconcentrated juice to icing to color it, the color may be very light. If you add too much juice, you might make the icing watery.

, If you don’t want to make your own concentrated food dyes, there are many brands that offer natural food dyes without artificial coloring. Some health food or natural food stores may carry them; you might also look online to see if you can have them shipped to you.Some brands of natural food dye include:


India Tree
Trucolor
Color Garden

, Dump the icing into a mixing bowl, and add just a few drops of the concentrated dye to the icing. Use a whisk, fork, or hand mixer to blend the color with the icing. If the color is too light, add another drop of two until the icing reaches the desired color.You can also mix different colors of concentrated food dyes to produce different shades or hues.

, Place the tip against the parchment paper, and use gentle pressure to squeeze out a mound about the size of a small coin. Make sure that it has some height., Pull off the large round tip, and replace it with a small round tip, such as a Wilton 3. Place the tip against the center of the mound, and apply gentle pressure to the bag while pulling upwards., It's okay if these dots aren't touching each other, but they all need to touch the one in the center. Use less pressure when creating these, and don't pull the bag up as much., Replace your small round tip with a curved petal tip, such as the Wilton 123 tip. Hold the bag at the 12 o'clock position on you flower nail. Tilt it at a 45-degree angle, with the wider end of the tip facing down and against the bottom edge of the mound. Gently squeeze on the bag and pipe out some frosting, rotating the nail by 1/3 of a turn. The petal should cover two sections of the template.A curved petal tip looks similar to the standard petal tip in that it is wider at one end, and narrower at the other. It is different in that it has a slight curve to it, like a "")"".

, Wipe the tip down, and make a second petal, overlapping the first one. Finish off with a third petal, then wipe the tip down again.Wiping down the tip will clear it up, prevent it from clogging, and give you crisp, clean edges.

Take a large sheet of parchment paper or baking sheet and set it out on the countertop where you will be working. This will be the surface you will use to construct your spun sugar cobwebs., You will use an upside down bowl as the surface upon which you will shape your spun sugar cobwebs. If you want to create spun sugar cobwebs for cupcakes, use a small bowl like a cereal or fruit bowl. If you want to create a large spun sugar cobweb for a cake or pie, use a large bowl similar in size to your cake or pie.


Use a glass, glazed ceramic, or rimless metal bowl. These material types will prevent the spun sugar cobwebs from sticking to their surface.

, It is important that you grease or oil the bottom and outside of the bowl. This step will ensure your spun sugar cobwebs don’t stick. Place a few drops of vegetable oil on your fingers. Lightly oil the bottom and outsides of the bowl by rubbing your fingers in small circles over the bowl’s outer surfaces until completely oiled.

, You will need a bowl of ice water to cool your sugar syrup in prior to making the spun sugar cobwebs. This bowl should be large enough to fit a small saucepan. Fill the bowl halfway with water and then add 10-15 ice cubes. Set aside.

Let the sugar syrup rest.,
Test the syrup to see if it forms thin threads.",How to Make Spun Sugar Cobwebs2," Set aside a small, stainless steel saucepan. Using a liquid measuring cup, measure ¼ cup of water. Pour the water into the saucepan. It is important to use a liquid measuring cup, as dry measuring cups can vary significantly from their liquid counterparts., Use a dry measuring cup to measure 1 cup of sugar. Use a knife to level off any excess sugar on the top of the measuring cup. Then take your fingers and sprinkle the sugar evenly across the surface of the saucepan.

, Turn your stove burner on medium-high heat. Cook the sugar mixture over medium-high heat for eight to fifteen minutes. Swirl the sugar mixture occasionally while cooking. Hold the handle of the saucepan and make a swirling motion. This will ensure the mixture cooks evenly.Do not stir the sugar mixture as it cooks, as this will create unwanted sugar crystals.

, The sugar mixture should be done after cooking for eight to fifteen minutes over medium-high heat. You will know the sugar mixture is done when the sugar is dissolved and the mixture has turned into a pale, golden syrup with a consistency similar to honey. Once your mixture reaches this consistency, immediately remove from the heat and turn off the burner.

, After removing the saucepan from the burner, place it in the bowl of ice water for five minutes. This will cool the sugar syrup and stop it from cooking. Remove the saucepan from the ice water after five minutes. Place it on the baking sheet your prepared earlier.

, It is important that you let the sugar syrup rest for at least two to three minutes after you remove it from the bowl of ice water. Allow the sugar syrup to rest until it forms thin threads.

, Dip a fork in the syrup. Slowly lift the fork from the syrup. If it forms a thin thread, your syrup is ready. If it forms droplets, it is not ready. Allow your syrup to cool for an additional two to three minutes if it forms droplets, and then test again.

, With a small ball of fondant, form a thin petal, in an egg shape with a sharp, pinched point at the narrow end.

, The more petals you have, the fuller your rose will be, but how many you should make will probably depend on the size. Actual roses have between 5-40 petals.

, Place a petal on a clean, food-safe sponge or piece of foam. Use a ball tool, a pea-sized ball bearing, or the cup of a 1/2 teaspoon measure (assuming it is a basic round) to round out the petal. Rub it in a circle at the center to form the cup of the petal shape and then rub it at the edges to make the very edge thinner than the rest of the petal.


Do not worry about keeping the edge of the petal perfectly straight or even, as real petals are curled and uneven normally.
If the fondant sticks to your tool or surface, use wax paper or saran wrap.
You can also do these same formations with only your finger, if you do not have any tools.

, Place the first petal so that the pinched base is at the base of the center you formed earlier. Carefully wrap the petal around the center. Add on the next petal, with the pinched base slightly to the side of where the first one was placed. Wrap that petal and continue on to the next. Continue in this fashion until the rose is to desired fullness. As you go, the petal should become less tightly wrapped and should begin to pull away from the center of the flower at the top.

, Once all of the petals are on, smooth out and shape the base until it looks how you want it to look. Slide it off of the skewer or toothpick.

, You can use food paint, edible glitter, or even other fondant to add various finishing touches to your rose. Consider adding fondant leaves or try dried grape leaves. Enjoy your fondant rose!

Prepare the piping bags.,

Spiral around the center.,
Hide the tail.,
Let it dry.,
Press the leaf base into the side of the rosette.,
Pull away while squeezing less.,
Dry the leaf.,
Store until ready to use.",How to Make Icing Flowers1," Fit one piping bag with a star tip, like tip #13, and fill the bag with royal icing in the desired color of your rosette. Place a leaf tip, like tip #65, on the other piping bag and fill it with green royal icing for the leaf.

You should also prepare your work surface. Spread out a sheet of wax paper or parchment paper. The sheet should be large enough to hold several rows of rosettes.;
, Hold the star tip bag slightly above the wax paper. Gently squeeze the bag to start the flower.

Keep the bag nearly perpendicular to the work surface. Tilting the bag could distort the shape of the rosette.
Do not lift away the tip after creating the initial dollop. Proceed directly into the next step, ideally without easing up on the piping bag.

, Continue squeezing the bag while moving the start tip around the center dollop. Wind the icing all the way around its center in a full circle.The piping bag should remain perpendicular, and you should apply even, continuous pressure to it as you form the flower.
Keep the tip close to the center as you create the spiral. The icing should curl over itself, forming a tight circle.
Stop squeezing the bag as soon as you finish the circle. Lift the bag away only after the icing stops coming out of the tip.

, Sometimes, a small tail will form when you lift away the piping tip. Use a toothpick to gently press that tail into the side of the rosette.Alternatively, you could use a clean paint brush to gently tap the tail into the side of the blossom. If the icing is too stiff, you may need to dip the tip of the brush in water before tapping down the tail.

, Allow the rosette to dry for 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature before continuing.

If you wish to make multiple rosettes, you should form all of the flowers before moving onto the leaves. All of the flowers should have at least 30 minutes of drying time before you begin to work on the leaves.

, After the rosettes dry, hold the leaf tip bag at a 45-degree angle to one side of one flower. Gently squeeze the bag until a wide base builds itself onto the base of the flower.

Make sure that the green icing comes into direct contact with the dried rosette. If it doesn't, or if it barely touches, the leaves will not stick to the flowers.

, Slowly pull the tip away from the rosette while simultaneously applying less pressure to the bag.

This should cause a narrower leaf tip to form off the initial base.
When the icing stops flowing, carefully lift the tip up and away to create the final point of the leaf.

, Allow the leaf to dry for 30 to 60 minutes. Keep the rosette out at room temperature as it dries.

If you plan to create multiple leaves, create them all at once and make sure that each one dries for at least 30 minutes.

, Peel the dried rosettes off the wax paper and store them in an airtight container.

When you're ready to use them, attach the bottom of the rosettes to the intended surface using wet icing.

Prepare your supplies.,
Hold the drop flower tip above the paper.,
Simultaneously squeeze and rotate.,
Lift away the tip.,
Squeeze a dot in the center of the flower.,
Store until ready to use.",How to Make Icing Flowers2," Fit one decorating bag with a drop flower decorating tip, like tip #2D, and fill it halfway with medium royal icing in the color desired for the flower petals. Place a round tip, like tip #3, on the other piping bag and fill one-quarter with the center color icing.

Prepare the work surface by covering it with parchment paper or wax paper, taping it down as needed to prevent the paper from peeling up as you work. Use enough paper to hold as many flowers as you wish to make.

, Position the drop flower tip directly over the parchment paper, holding it so that the tip just barely touches the surface.

Keep the bag at a 90-degree angle from the work surface. If you tilt it, you'll distort the shape of the flower.
Rotate your hand one-quarter turn without piping the icing. The back of your hand should face away from you. If you're right-handed, your knuckles should be at the 9-o'-clock position; if you're left-handed, your knuckles should be at the 3-o'-clock position.

, Gently squeeze the pastry bag while slowly rotating your hand. Continue squeezing and rotating until your hand returns to its normal position.Your knuckles should return to the 12-o'-clock position, so you'll end up rotating 90 degrees (one-quarter turn).

, Immediately stop squeezing the bag once you complete the turn. As soon as the icing stops flowing, lift the tip away.

Lift the tip straight up. Removing it at an angle can distort the shape of the petals.

, Hold the round tip bag at a 90-degree angle in the center of the flower. Carefully squeeze a small dot of icing into the center.

The tip should almost touch the flower itself, and the icing you squeeze out should come into direct contact with the petal icing. Keep the tip buried as you pipe the center dot.
Stop squeezing once the dot looks large enough. When the icing stops flowing, lift the tip up and to the side so that no tail hangs off.

, Allow the flower to dry for 30 to 60 minutes, then carefully peel it away from the parchment paper. Store the dried flower in an airtight container until you're ready to use it.

If you plan to make multiple flowers, form all of them before letting them dry. Make sure that each one dries for at least 30 minutes.
You can apply these flowers to the surface you wish to decorate with fresh icing.

Prepare the piping bags.,
Pipe a ball of icing.,
Pipe zigzags around the ball.,
Create two to three more zigzag rows.,
Add smaller dots to the center.,
Dry and use as desired.",How to Make Icing Flowers3," Fit one piping bag with a petal decorating tip, like tip #101, and the other piping bag with a round decorating tip, like tip #7.This flower is created with one color, so fill both bags with the same color icing. The icing should be of medium consistency. Buttercream is easier to form, but royal icing will dry harder.

, Grab the flower nail with your non-dominant hand and the piping bag with your dominant hand. Hold the round #7 tip perpendicular to the center of the flower nail, then squeeze the bag to form a relatively flat ball.

Once you're satisfied with the size of the ball, stop squeezing the bag. Lift the tip straight up and away after the icing stops flowing.
If the ball looks too rounded, dust your fingertip in cornstarch and gently press down on the top of the mound until the top surface looks slightly flat.

, Hold the petal decorating tip a 45-degree angle to the flower nail. Gently squeeze the bag. As the icing flows, spin the nail while simultaneously rocking the tip back and forth to create zigzags.

The wide end of the petal tip should touch the outer edge of the center ball when you start the row.
Once you complete a full rotation with the zigzag row, stop squeezing the bag. Carefully lift the tip straight up and away when the icing stops flowing.

, Use the same technique to create two or three more rows. Tilt the tip more dramatically for each consecutive row.The thin side of the tip should tilt upward at a higher angle, but the wide side should still touch the round base of the flower.
For the final row, you should pipe the zigzags directly over the flattened top of the center mound.

, Switch the #7 round tip for a small #1 round tip. Use the smaller round tip to pipe five dots over the exposed center of the zinnia.

To make the process less messy, you could attach the #1 tip to a third piping bag instead of switching out the larger tip.
For each dot, hold the tip perpendicular to the flower and squeeze gently. Release the pressure once a small dot forms, then lift the tip straight up and away.

, Allow the flower to dry for roughly 30 minutes, then carefully peel or slice it off with a flat knife.

Flowers made with royal icing might be hard enough to peel away with your fingers, but if the zinnia resists gently pressure, slice it off with a knife.
Attach the dried flower to your cake or other pastry surface using fresh icing.

Fry the doughnuts in small batches.,
Dip the doughnuts into the cold syrup.,
Cool before serving.",How to Make Koeksisters1," The night before you plan to make your koeksisters, make a batch of syrup. This gives the syrup time to chill, and the hot doughnuts will be dipped into the cold syrup to get them crispy and shiny.Bring the water, sugar, and cream of tartar to a boil over medium heat in a small saucepan. Stir constantly so the sugar doesn’t burn.
When the mixture comes to a boil, add the lemon juice. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. You can also add a pinch of cinnamon and dried ginger to the syrup at this point if you want to add a bit of spice.
After simmering, remove the syrup from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. Then divide the syrup into two separate bowls and chill overnight in the fridge.;
, Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Sifting will remove clumps and make the batter smooth. Add the butter to the flour and use the tips of your fingers to rub the butter into the flour until the butter has been distributed throughout.You want to distribute the butter in the flour as evenly as possible. The texture will become slightly crumbly.

, Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk it together with the water until incorporated. Then pour the egg into the flour and stir with a spoon to combine all the ingredients.


Continue stirring until everything comes together as a ball of dough. Then knead the dough until it becomes smooth and soft.
Cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap or a damp towel and set it aside for an hour to rest.

, Heat the oil over medium heat in a deep fryer or in a deep frying pan. For the best results, you want about three to four inches (seven to 10 cm) of oil.Place a pea-sized ball of dough into the oil.

When the piece of dough begins to cook and sizzle, the oil is ready.
If you have a candy thermometer, heat the oil to about 340 F (171 C).

, Turn the dough out onto a flat and lightly oiled surface. Grease a rolling pin with a bit of oil and roll out the dough into a large rectangle that’s about a quarter-inch (6.3 mm) thick.


Cut the dough into long thin strips that are about an inch (2.5 cm) wide and six inches (15 cm) long., Take three strips of dough and pinch them all together at one end. Then braid the three pieces together. When you get to the end of the dough, pinch all three ends together to seal them.To braid the dough, lay the three strips out side by side. Take the left strip and lay it over the middle strip, so that the two switch positions. Then take the right strip and lay it over the middle strip. Go back to the left strip and lay it over the middle again. Repeat until you reach the end of the strips.
Repeat this process with all the dough strips until you have assembled all the koeksisters.
This recipe will make about a dozen doughnuts. If you have any strips of dough left, you can cut them in half lengthwise to make smaller koeksisters, or fry single strips of dough.

, Place a few doughnuts into the hot oil and let them cook for about three to five minutes, until they are golden brown. When they are cooked, transfer them to a paper towel for a few seconds to allow the excess oil to drain off.When the first batch of doughnuts is cooking in the oil, remove one of the bowls of syrup from the fridge and place the entire bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice.Keep the other bowl chilling in the fridge.

, After a few seconds on the paper towel, dunk the doughnuts immediately into the bowl of syrup. Allow the doughnuts to soak in the syrup for a minute or two.

Remove the koeksisters from the syrup with a slotted spoon, allowing the excess syrup to drain off back into the bowl.
Transfer the syrupy doughnuts to a wire rack to cool.
When the bowl of syrup becomes warm from the hot doughnuts, return it to the fridge and start using the second chilled batch. Place the fresh batch into a bowl of ice as well., Allow the koeksisters to cool to room temperature before serving. If you have extra syrup left over, transfer it to small serving bowls for dunking the doughnuts into.

When the butter has melted, whisk in the milk.

, Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk it briefly. Add the egg, oil, and butter and milk to the dry ingredients.Use a wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients together. Continue mixing until the ingredients come together to form a smooth dough. If mixing with the spoon becomes difficult, knead the dough with your hands instead.

, Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place it somewhere warm to rise for one to two hours.It’s important to cover the dough so that it doesn’t dry out.

A good warm place for the dough to rise is an oven that’s turned off, but with the oven light turned on.

, When the dough is ready, cover your hands with a layer of oil and turn the dough out onto a flat surface. Roll the dough out with your hands into a long cylinder that’s two inches (5 cm) thick.Cut the dough cylinder into smaller pieces that are one to two inches (2.5 to five cm) long.
Arrange the dough pieces on two baking sheets and leave them to rise for another 30 to 40 minutes.

, While the dough is rising for the second time, prepare the syrup. The doughnuts will be fried and then dunked into the syrup right away, so it needs to be ready for when the doughnuts are fried.

Combine the sugar, water, and spices in a medium saucepan. Bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent the sugar from burning. When it comes to a boil, lower the heat and continue simmering and stirring until the syrup becomes thick.Lower the heat again and keep the syrup warm over low heat until the doughnuts are ready.

, Fill a deep fryer or deep frying pan with oil and heat it over medium–high heat. Drop a pea-sized piece of dough into the oil. When it begins to cook and sizzle, you know the oil is ready.

Take a piece of dough and stretch it out slightly to get an oval shape. Repeat with every dough piece before frying.Drop a couple oval dough pieces into the oil, but don’t crowd them.
Fry the dough until the koeksisters become golden brown, about one to two minutes.

, Remove the doughnuts from the oil one at a time using a slotted spoon. Place them on a paper towel to remove some of the excess oil. Poke a few holes in each doughnut with a fork.Transfer the doughnuts to the warm syrup and roll them around to coat all sides.

, When the doughnuts are drenched in syrup, remove them one at a time with the slotted spoon. Allow the excess syrup to drain off over the saucepan.

Roll each doughnut in the shredded coconut to coat them completely. Transfer them to a serving plate and enjoy!"

Start with the freshest and cleanest organically grown flax seed available.,You will need 2-cups of clean water for every 1-pound of flax seed.,
Combine water and flax seed in a bowl and stir.,
When your flax seed and water mixture is a nice gooey consistency, add your favorite spices, herbs or whatever you want your cracker to taste like.,After you have you batter flavored up the way you like it, cover your dehydrator trays with a Teflex sheet or parchment paper and spread the gooey mixture about 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) thick.,Place them into your dehydrator at 120-130 degrees and rotate trays 180 degrees every hour for about 4 hours.,Turn your dehydrator down to 110 and continue rotating every hour.,Once the cracker is dry enough, peel off the paper, flip the cracker over and return to the dehydrator for another 5-6 hours or until desired crispness.,Store crackers in an airtight container for up to one year and even longer when kept in the refrigerator.",How to Make a Flax Cracker," Bulk flax seed often contains lots of weed seeds and broken flax seeds, and this will cause your flax crackers to taste bitter or rancid. If you want the best tasting flax cracker, then you have to use the best tasting flax seed.
,, Wait about 5 minutes and stir again. Repeat this process every 5 minutes about 4 times. Then repeat the stirring process every 15 minutes about 3 times. When the flax seed starts to absorb the water it becomes a gelatinous gooey mixture, and if you don't follow this process the flax seeds will clump together., Example recipes: Onion Garlic - tomato, garlic and onion; Lemon Pie - lemon juice and agave nectar; Pina Colada - pineapple, coconut and agave nectar.

Serve immediately.",How to Make Cheddar Bay Biscuits," Set your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, or 232 degrees Celsius.It’s great to do this first, so the oven is hot and ready to go when your biscuits are prepared.Depending on your oven, this can take anywhere from ten to twenty minutes.



 ;
, It’s best to use a large bowl for this, so that you have plenty of room to stir the ingredients well without any falling onto the counter. Continue to stir, scraping the sides of the bowl to make sure you get everything mixed thoroughly. You can certainly use a mixer for this step, but mixing it by hand will not be too time consuming.If you do not have Bisquick baking mix, you can use any comparable baking mix.

, Scoop your fully mixed dough from the bowl and place on a flat, floured surface. The flour will keep the dough from sticking to the surface. Using a rolling pin, flatten the dough until it’s about one inch thick.Using a cookie cutter or a biscuit cutter, cut your biscuits. If you don’t have either, you can use the rim of a glass to cut the circles.Once you’ve cut as many circles as possible into the dough, pick up the scraps, re-flatten the dough, and cut more until you’ve used all the dough.

, Spread them out over the entire pan to give them room to rise and expand during baking. Try to keep at least a half inch of space between each biscuit. Put the tray of biscuits to the side while you make the butter.

, Put your butter in a small saucepan and set your stovetop to a low heat. As it slowly heats up, stir it gently to speed up the melting process. Do not turn up your heat, or you risk burning the butter.When it comes to creating the butter spread, slow and steady works best.

, Once your spices have been added, you can turn the stovetop off. Continue stirring your melted butter so that the spices are evenly distributed throughout., Use a pastry brush for this step, which you can find at any store that sells kitchen supplies. Make sure that you apply the butter evenly and generously to each biscuit., Some people prefer their biscuits soft and gooey, while others like theirs a bit firmer, so bake yours accordingly! You can always check on your biscuits after eight minutes and decide if you want to let them bake longer or not. A good rule of thumb is to wait until they look golden brown.Don’t forget to set your timer!

, This step is optional, and perfect for those who like their Cheddar Bay Biscuits extra buttery. If you have left over butter mixture, dip your pastry brush in it again and give your baked biscuits a second coating.

, Cheddar Bay biscuits are best when they’re fresh out of the oven. They go great as a side dish for a delicious seafood entree, like lobster, salmon, or crab. If you aren't a fan of seafood, they're just as good with chicken, lasagna, or any warm comfort food. They don't have to be eaten as a side dish, though! You can eat them on their own as a snack too. This recipe makes ten biscuits, so they’re perfect for sharing – no judgment if you keep them all for yourself, though!

Combine the mashed cauliflower with the yogurt, cheese, and whole eggs.,
Beat the egg whites and fold them into the cauliflower biscuit dough.,
Fill a mini-muffin tin and bake the cauliflower biscuits.",How to Cook Cauliflower Biscuits1," Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Wash 1 head of cauliflower and discard any leaves. Chop the cauliflower into chunks while you heat a sauce pot with a little water in it. Set the cauliflower inside a steamer basket and place it in the pot. Cover the pot and steam the cauliflower until it's very soft.It should take 10 to 12 minutes for the cauliflower to become tender.;
, Place the steamed cauliflower into a food processor along with 3 cloves of minced garlic. Put the lid on the processor and blitz it a few times, so the cauliflower is pureed. The mixture should be completely smooth.The softer your cauliflower is, the smoother it will be once you puree it. This is why it's important to steam it until it's completely tender.

, Get out a large mixing bowl and scoop the pureed cauliflower mixture into it. Stir in more of the biscuit dough ingredients with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the mixture is completely combined. You'll need to mix in:1/3 cup (95 g) of nonfat Greek yogurt
1/2 cup (50 g) of shredded cheddar cheese
2 eggs
1 teaspoon of kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper

, Get out another mixing bowl and place 2 egg whites in it. Use an electric or stand mixer to beat the egg whites on high speed. Beat the egg whites for a few minutes, so they become stiff. Gently fold the egg whites into the cauliflower mixture.To fold the egg whites, hold a spatula and carefully use a twisting motion with your wrist to combine the cauliflower mixture with the lighter egg whites. The goal is to maintain the volume of the egg whites.

, Spray a mini-muffin tin with cooking spray, to prevent sticking. Fill the cups with the cauliflower biscuit dough, so the dough comes to the top of each cup. Bake the biscuits for 20 to 25 minutes. They should brown and look a little crisp around the edges. Let the biscuits cool on a rack until they're cool enough to handle and serve.Consider using a small cookie scoop to fill the muffin cups. You could also just use a few small spoons to scoop the dough.

Put the cauliflower florets into a food processor that's fitted with a shredding blade attachment. Shred the cauliflower.To save time, you could purchase riced cauliflower in the produce department of your grocery store.

, Pour 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of extra virgin olive oil into a large skillet. Heat the oil over medium and add the shredded cauliflower. Chop 1 jalapeno and add it to the skillet along with 1/3 cup (50 g) of chopped, cooked bacon. Saute the mixture for about 7 minutes, so the cauliflower softens a little and looks a little clear. Season the mixture with:1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon of sea salt
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper

, Turn off the heat and transfer the sauteed mixture to a mixing bowl. Crack 2 eggs into the bowl and add 1/2 cup (48 g) of almond flour. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mix the ingredients until they're completely combined.Since there's no gluten in the dough, don't worry about over mixing it.

, Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop out a portion of biscuit dough onto the parchment paper. It should come out easily in a circular shape, although you may need to tap down hard to get the dough to fall out. Continue portioning out the dough into biscuits. You should end up with about 12 biscuits on the sheet.If the dough is sticking to the cup, you can dip the cup in some almond flour.

, Put the sheet of biscuits in the preheated oven and bake them for 35 to 40 minutes. They should turn golden brown and crispy around the edges. Remove the baking sheet once they've finished baking. Let them rest on the sheet for 5 minutes before you remove them to a cooling rack.Use oven mitts when handling the hot baking sheet.

, Place the flour, sugar, and salt in a medium mixing bowl, whisking gently to combine.


If you want to make these crackers slightly healthier, consider using 3/4 cup (188 ml) whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup (188 ml) all-purpose flour instead of using all-purpose flour for the full amount.

, Pour the olive oil and water into the flour mixture, stirring well. Continue stirring until a sticky dough forms.


Some excess flour may remain at the bottom of the bowl, but if more than several teaspoons (5 to 15 ml) remain, consider adding an extra 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water to help mix the flour into the dough. Repeat as needed.

, Lightly sprinkle a clean work surface with flour, then turn the dough out over it. Use a rolling pin the flatten the dough to your desired thickness.


Gently shape the ball of dough into a large rectangle after turning it out. Lightly flour the rolling pin and roll it over the dough, starting in the center and working outward.
For thick crackers, the dough should be about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick. For thin crackers, the dough should be 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) thick., Evenly sprinkle the sea salt and sesame seeds over the surface of the dough. Use your hands to gently pat the seasonings into the surface.


While not strictly necessary, it may help to brush the surface with a small amount of water before topping it. The water may help the salt and seeds stick.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into individual crackers.


The average size of a snacking cracker will be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 2 inches (5 cm), but you can change these dimensions as desired.

, Use a fork or toothpick to poke the centers of each cracker, creating holes in the dough. Doing this should keep the crackers flat.


You should also move the crackers to the prepared baking sheet. Use a dough scraper or spatula to do this, and arrange the crackers so that they are close without touching.

, Place the crackers in the oven and bake them until the edges become golden brown, flipping once in the middle of the baking process.


Thin crackers should finish in 6 to 8 minutes, so you should flip them after the first 4 minutes.
Thick crackers will need 12 to 15 minutes, so you should flip them after the first 6 minutes.

, Remove the finished crackers from the oven and cool them on a wire rack. You can eat them once they cool to room temperature.


Store extra crackers in an airtight container kept at room temperature. They should last up to one or two weeks.

If you don't have parchment paper, you can dust the pan with additional flour. Note that this is not the flour called for in the recipe.

, Place the flour, baking soda, and table salt in a medium to large mixing bowl. Toss the ingredients together with a whisk until evenly combined


All-purpose flour will create the most conventional soda cracker, but you may also substitute up to half the flour with whole wheat flour if desired.

, Place the butter and egg in the mixture. Use a pastry blender, knife, or fork to cut the butter into the dry ingredients and simultaneously mix in the egg. Continue until the mixture becomes crumbly.You can use butter, margarine, lard, or shortening, but make sure that the fat used is cold and solid before you begin. Similarly, you can also combine fats in equal amounts, e.g., 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) butter and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) shortening.
If you don't have liquid eggs, use half of one large egg. Lightly beat the egg with a fork and measure out 2 Tbsp (30 ml) for use in this recipe.

, Pour the buttermilk into the crumbly dough. Stir well, continuing until a soft, sticky dough forms.

, Lightly flour a clean work surface and turn the dough out over it. Using a rolling pin, lightly pound the surface of the dough until air bubbles form across the entire surface. This may take around 20 minutes, and you should fold the dough repeatedly throughout the process.


Alternatively, knead the dough for 3 to 5 minutes, then let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Some air bubbles should form while the dough rests.

, Roll out the dough using a lightly floured rolling pin. Continue until the dough is 1/16 to 1/8 inch (1.5 to 3 mm) thick.

, Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, divide the dough into individual crackers. You can vary the size as desired, but 2 inch (5 cm) squares are standard.


You also need to transfer the crackers to the prepared baking sheet. Lift them with a flat spatula, then arrange them so that they are close but not touching. Soda crackers will usually shrink during baking instead of spreading out.

, Using a fork or toothpick, prick the surface of each cracker several times, creating holes in the dough. This should allow the crackers to bake flat.


If you wish to add salt to these crackers, sprinkle coarse salt over the surface of the dough now. Use your hands to lightly press the salt into the dough.

, Place the crackers in your preheated oven and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until they become lightly browned around the edges.


There's no need to turn these crackers while they bake, but you should remove any that bake quicker than the others to prevent them from burning.

, Transfer the finished crackers to a wire rack and let them cool to room temperature. Enjoy them once they cool.


Store extra crackers in an airtight container kept out at room temperature. They should remain edible for up to one or two weeks.

Gather your ingredients.,
Prep some additional supplies you will be using.,
Follow the recipe on how to make gum paste.",How to Make Gum Paste," To make gum paste, you will need confectioner's sugar, gum tragacanth, shortening, unflavored gelatin, extra large eggs and warm water. Gum tragacanth is the ingredient that makes the gum paste pliable. You can find this at stores that carry cake decorating supplies or from bakery supply retailers on the Internet.;
, Fill a saucepan halfway with water and begin to simmer it on the stove.

,


Place 6 cups of confectioner's sugar and 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons of gum tragacanth in a metal bowl. Sit the bowl on the pan of simmering water. This acts as a double boiler, heating the items in the top bowl while decreasing the likelihood that the ingredients will burn. Leave for about 5 minutes, stirring once about midway. Remove the mixture from the heat.
Mix 6 tablespoons of warm water with 4 teaspoons of unflavored gelatin in a small bowl. Stir slowly until the gelatin dissolves. If necessary, place the bowl on the saucepan of simmering water to raise the temperature of the water a little and progress the dissolving process. You can also place the mixture in the microwave for a few seconds to heat things up. Add 1 heaping tablespoon of shortening to the liquid and stir until it melts and incorporates together.
Add the gelatin mixture to the bowl of sugar. You will also put in 2 eggs. Mix well. This can be mixed together in a mixer. Due to the consistency, you may find that using dough hooks works the best.
Knead this mixture in with 1 1/3 cups of confectioner's sugar. One way to do this is to place the confectioner's sugar in another bowl and make a well in the center of it. Add this mixture to the center of the well. Incorporate the items together by kneading with your hands. Grease your hands if necessary.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid so the container is airtight. This keeps the gum paste from becoming too dry.
Allow it to sit and rest overnight. You can place it in the refrigerator for several hours, but you will need to bring it back to room temperature for it to be easy to use.

Dollop the frosting onto oatmeal or ginger cookies to add a little sweetness.",How to Make Cream Cheese Icing," Avoid low-fat, whipped, or spreadable cream cheeses, as these can lead to runny frosting. This means Neufchâtel cheese is out, too (you’ll probably see it right next to the cream cheese), as its fat content is too low. The fat in the butter and cream cheese are essential to stabilize the frosting and keep it from liquefying.If you can’t find full-fat cream cheese, you can try adding more butter to the recipe.;
, If the butter is too cold you may end up with lumps in your frosting, and melted butter will not mix well with sugar. The best method is to let a cold stick of butter sit out on your countertop for thirty minutes to an hour.If you are short on time, you can speed up the process by cutting the butter into smaller pieces. Use an electric mixer or stand mixer to beat the butter until soft and creamy.
Avoid softening the butter in a microwave, as this usually ends up melting the butter.
If your butter sits out too long and starts melting, simply put it back in the refrigerator until it becomes solid again.

, Let the cream cheese sit out until it is room temperature.


Be sure the cream cheese is softened before you add it to the frosting. Unlike the butter, you can overwhip the cream cheese and ruin your frosting., This will work best if you have a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or an electric mixer. Pause to scrape the bowl with a spatula, then mix again. This will help eliminate lumps. If you don't have an electric mixer, you have a few options.


You can beat the butter by hand, which will make your arm sore and take a little longer, but will still get the job done. Simply put the butter in a large bowl and mash and beat it with the back of a wooden spoon, scraping it off the sides as you go.A food processor with the chopping blade can also work and should make your frosting extra smooth., You don’t want to over-whip the cream cheese and risk runny frosting, so stop mixing once the butter and cream cheese are fully blended.


Cutting the cream cheese into smaller chunks can help ensure smooth icing.

, The amount of powdered sugar you end up using can vary, depending on how sweet you like your frosting. Adding more powdered sugar can also stiffen frosting, which can be helpful if you plan to pipe it onto your dessert., Your finished icing should be thick, creamy, and spreadable, with no lumps.


If your icing is too thick, thin it with a splash of milk. Only add about a tablespoon at a time so you don't accidentally overdo it.If your icing tastes too sweet and has lost the cream cheese flavor, a little lemon juice can bring out the tanginess., Substitute almond or coconut extract for vanilla, or mix in the zest of your favorite citrus fruit.

, Just beat them into the softened butter before adding the cream cheese.

, Pipe the frosting onto your batter when it's about to go into the oven; use a knife to swirl it throughout the batter.

, Or use it as the filling for a cookie sandwich by piping it onto the bottom or (flat side) of a cookie. Then top with another cookie, again making sure the flat or bottom side is facing the frosting.

Cream the butter.,
Mix in the sugar.,
Add the other ingredients.,
Serve at room temperature.",How to Make Cupcake Icing1," Beat the butter with a whisk or electric mixer with a paddle attachment. Stop once the butter is smoother and lighter in color. This takes a couple minutes.


If using an electric mixer, beat the butter straight from the fridge.If beating by hand, cut it into small pieces and let it soften for 10–15 minutes first.;
, Slowly pour in 3 cups (375g) powdered sugar as you keep beating the butter. This completes the creaming process, adding air bubbles that make the icing fluffy. When ready, the mixture will look lighter and larger in volume. It will also coat the sides of the bowl, with the mixer's paddle scraping ridged patterns into it.If you don't see this, or if you like extra-sweet icing, add up to an additional 1 cup (125g) sugar.


Powdered sugar is also called confectioner's sugar and icing sugar.
Too much beating can make your butter melt and collapse the icing.

, Reduce to medium speed and mix in the heavy cream and vanilla extract. Once thoroughly combined, taste the icing. If it's too sweet, mix in a pinch of fine salt. Salt has a complex effect on taste, but a small amount should cut the sweet taste a little.


Add more cream if the icing is too thick. Add more sugar if it is too thin.

, If chilled, the butter in the icing becomes firm and heavy. In hot weather, it melts into a greasy mess.Pipe or spread onto your cupcakes, then keep them at room temperature in an airtight box.

Add the cold flour mix, vanilla, and salt.",How to Make Cupcake Icing2," Do this in a medium saucepan, but don't turn on the heat. This reduces the risk of flour lumps forming, and will help the sugar dissolve.Use granulated sugar, not powdered. Powdered sugar will make slightly ""rough"" icing when used in cooked recipes.

, Pour in the milk as you whisk. Turn the heat to low and keep whisking. Bring to a boil. Cook and whisk until it thickens into a pudding. You should be able to see the bottom of the pan when you push the sauce away.Smash apart flour lumps with a rubber spatula.

, Move the pudding base to a plate with deep sides. Cover with plastic wrap tightly, pressing against the mix. This will prevent a skin from forming. Move to the refrigerator to chill while you start on the next step.

, Cream the butter by beating until it is smooth and lighter in color. If using an electric mixer, use butter from the fridge and beat at medium speed for a couple minutes. If beating by hand, cut the butter into pieces and let soften slightly before beating.

, Beat the flour mix in one spoonful at a time. It may look lumpy at first, but after a few minutes it should become silky and fluffy. Mix in the vanilla and a pinch of salt as well.

, Pour in the sugar while whisking at low speed. Keep whisking until smooth.

, Blend strawberries or your favorite fruit in a food processor. Drain off the juice and measure the solid fruit. This recipe can take up to ½ cup (120 mL) of blended fruit. You may want to add this bit by bit, as the icing can easily get soupy.You can use fruit preserves instead, for a sweeter taste and less liquid.

, The icing should last in the fridge for several days. If you make this in advance, you may need to beat it again to make it lighter before spreading on cupcakes."

, Take 115g (½ cup) salted butter on the cool side of room temperature, workable but not melting. Cut it into small chunks and add to a mixing bowl.Most of the flavor of shortbread comes from butter, so using a fresh, high-quality product can make a big difference. The traditional choice is a European-style butter, which has a little more fat than American-style.If you only have unsalted butter, just add a pinch of salt to the recipe. It won't mix in quite as well since shortbread dough is so dry, but it's not a major problem., The recipe calls for 55g (¼ cup) sugar, but which type you use depends on your preferred texture. The most popular choices are caster sugar, for a sandy texture, or icing sugar, for a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth shortbread.Whichever you choose, add the sugar gradually as you beat it into the butter, until light and fluffy.


This takes about three minutes with an electric mixer's paddle attachment on low speed, or a bit longer by hand.In the U.S. and some other countries, caster sugar is called ""superfine"", and icing sugar is ""powdered"" or ""confectioner's.""
You may use granulated sugar, but the recipe sometimes ends up a little gritty.

, Sift 130g (1 cup) plain flour and 40g (¼ cup) rice flour together to remove all lumps. Mix this into the butter mixture just long enough for it to form a soft, crack-free dough.If this takes more than six or seven minutes, slowly dribble in water, but no more than 15 mL / 1 tbsp.Electric mixers and food processors can overwork the dough, making it tough. If you use one, keep it on low and finish it by hand.The warmth of your hands helps bind the dough together.
Rice flour (also sold as ground rice or rice powder) encourages the signature sandy texture. In a pinch, the shortbread should still turn out fine if you replace it with additional ordinary flour., Let the paper hang over the edges so you can easily remove the shortbread. A single batch of this recipe should fit a 15cm (6 inch) pan.This baking method makes a thick circle of shortbread with a soft center.You can use a special shortbread mold instead to make shortbread with a patterned surface. If you do, dust the mold with icing sugar and place it in the fridge., Press the dough into the pan and pat it flat, minimizing the handling time. If you'd like a smoother surface, cover the dough with plastic wrap and roll over it gently with a pastry roller or a lightweight jar., Cover the pan in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for fifteen minutes (or even a full hour, if you're a perfectionist).This will improve the texture of the shortbread.

, Poke the top of the shortbread with a fork, outlining eight or sixteen wedge-shaped slices on the surface. Poke the surface of each slice in several places as well. Besides looking decorative, these holes allow steam to escape, preventing cracking or bubbling.This wedge shape is a traditional presentation for shortbread, called ""petticoat tails."", The shortbread is ready at the very first sign of golden brown at the edge, or even just before. It will take longer to bake in a smaller pan, since the dough is thicker.

, Let cool for a few minutes, then transfer out of the pan using parchment paper. Cut into slices while still warm, using a knife or pizza roller. Place slices onto a cooling rack to cool to room temperature, then serve or refrigerate in an airtight container.


Optionally, sprinkle with extra sugar.

, Form the dough into a log with your hands, with minimal handling. You'll be slicing this log into rounds, so estimate the size of biscuit you'd like to make.


If your hands are warm, it's best to avoid further handling of the dough. Instead, roll the dough onto parchment paper and cut out rounds with cookie cutters. Dust the rolling pin with icing sugar instead of flour, if you have it., Cover the dough in plastic wrap and place in the fridge. Let chill for at least fifteen minutes, preferably 30 to 60, in order to prevent spreading in the oven., The thickness can be anywhere from 5mm (1/5"") for crisp biscuits, to 12mm (nearly 1/2"") for chewy, soft-in-the-center rounds.

, Poke a fork once or twice into the top of each round. This lets steam escape through the holes instead of bubbling or breaking the shortbread.

, Place the rounds on a lined baking tray. Check on them around the 12 minute mark, especially if the round are thin. They are ready when set but still pale, or when pale golden if you prefer them crisp. Remove them immediately if they look brown, since the underside cooks faster than the top.

, Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Sprinkle in sugar before eating for a sweeter, sparkling biscuit.

1 cup of superfine sugar
6 tablespoons of butter or margarine (softened)
1/2 cup of cocoa powder
1 cup of powdered sugar
1/3 cup of milk (whole or 2%—not skim)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract.;
, In a large bowl, whip room-temperature butter at medium speed with an electric mixer, or with a whisk, until it is fluffy.


Beating the butter with an electric mixer will be quicker than beating it by hand with a whisk. Either way, using room temperature butter will make it easier to whip to the right consistency while minimizing the risk of lumps.
Similarly, use butter over margarine when possible. When opting for margarine, use softened stick margarine over soft spreadable margarine, since both butter and stick margarine will hold their form better, resulting in a thicker frosting.

, In a small bowl, sift and whisk to combine the cocoa powder and granulated sugar.


Sifting the ingredients should help break up and eliminated lumps that may negatively impact the consistency of your frosting.
Superfine sugar is actually preferable since granulated sugar can give the frosting a grainy taste, but granulated sugar can be used if you are unable to find superfine sugar. You can also substitute additional powdered sugar, but only use 1 cup (250 ml) during this step, and be aware that it will make the frosting much sweeter.

, Add the cocoa/sugar mixture to the creamed butter alternately with the milk. Do not add too much milk, or the mixture will become too thin.


Add the milk about 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) at a time, mixing well after each addition, and stop once the mixture seems thoroughly moist.

, If it's too thick, add more milk, 1 tsp (5 ml) at a time. If it's too thin, add more cocoa/sugar mixture, 1 tsp (5 ml) at a time.


Additional cocoa/sugar mixture should be prepared in a ratio of 2 parts granulated sugar to 1 part cocoa powder.
The mixture should be spreadable, but still somewhat thin at this point.

, Once the frosting has reached the right consistency, add the vanilla extract. Blend well to combine., Whisk in the powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) at a time, blending well so there aren't any clumps.The powdered sugar should make the frosting even thicker, allowing it to hold its form better.

, You can spread this frosting on your cake or cupcakes, or refrigerate it in an airtight container for two or three days before use.

Refrigerate or freeze the tin filled with batter for 15-30 minutes.,
Cook the fondants for 7-9 minutes.",How to Make Chocolate Fondant2," Beat the eggs lightly, until liquid, then start adding the sugar slowly. Use a whisk or electric mixer to whip the eggs and sugar until they are light and fluffy, starting to hold their shape slightly. They should leave a trail when you pull your whisk out of the mixture.








, It needs to be small enough to fit into your double-boiler, and it should have a handle to help you grip and stir it.

, Place the pot in your double boiler and leave it there. Lower the heat to medium-low and watch it until it is melted, but not mixed. Do not stir., This should happen quickly, forming a silky smooth chocolate sauce. Let it cool for 5-10 minutes. It doesn't need to be cold, but it definitely shouldn't be hot.







, Pour the mixture slowly into the eggs, keeping the beater going the entire time. Keep mixing until everyone is one consistent liquid.








, When overworked, flour gets tough, so skip the mixer and just fold it in buy hand, working from the outside of the bowl inwards. Flour will give your fondant it's body and slightly thickens up the inside ""sauce.""









Make sure the flour is sifted, or free of chunks. If you don't have a sifter, simply whisk it with a fork before adding., Leave about 1/4 inch between the top of your tin and the pour line -- just shy of the very top. If you have any left over mixture, refrigerate it while you prepare more tins.








, Cooling the batter will keep the center from cooking too quickly. If you want more cake-like fondants, you can skip this step. However, the dish will almost always come out cleaner, with a better texture, if you chill the batter first.

, When done, they will have a nice, firm cake appearance, and they should come out of the pan cleanly with a butter knife. Serve hot, turning them out immediately after the come out of the oven. A dollop of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream will be heavenly.








If you use wider dishes, you'll need longer cooking times! A 3"" wide, deeper dish may take up to 10-12 minutes.
A good indicator of ""doneness"" is when the edges of the cake start to pull away from the edges of the pan(s)."
"
Add more egg yolks, and less full eggs, to get a richer cake.,
Whip some extracts into the batter to give it a punch of flavor.,
Try a splash of liquor for bit of bite and flavor depth.,
Experiment with other forms of chocolate.,
Add an extra ""core"" to your fondant to increase the depth inside the dish.",How to Make Chocolate Fondant3," Egg yolks hold the bit of fat and protein that gives the dish it's rich, filling flavor. If you're feeling extra decadent, go nuts with a bit more yolk and a little less white.

, Most commonly, you'd add a teaspoon or two of vanilla extract, though there are other options. Add any of the following along with the flour, after most of it is incorporated:


Vanilla extract
Almond
Mint or peppermint
Hazelnut, Fondants go wonderfully with a fruity or cocoa liquor -- any flavor that would go well with chocolate. Simply fold in 2 tablespoons of your favorite liquor after the flour goes in, then bake like normal. Some ideas include:


Chocolate, current, black raspberry, or cherry liquors
Coffee spirits or liquors
Tia Maria, Cointreau, and other specialty liquors., While most people need some dark chocolate to offset the sweetness of the sugar, you can mix and match milk, dark, and even white chocolate to find your favorite fondant. Simply add whatever chocolate you desire in place of the dark, and melt like normal.


Want to hide some ""crunch"" in your fondants? Add some chocolate chips, of any type, to the cooled batter right before it goes in the oven. A fun-sized candy bar, though decadent, works well too.

, If you want a little more than chocolate to ooze out of your fondant, you have a few excellent choices. To make them, simply freeze the liquids like ice cubes, then plop the cube into the center of your batter by pouring half in the dish, adding the cube, then covering with batter. Try out:


Frozen peanut butter
Frozen caramel sauce
Frozen jelly (such as raspberry, which pairs well with the dark chocolate_
Frozen chocolate sauce (like a white chocolate center)"

It can be straight or slightly bent. Try to make the branch thicker at the base, and thinner at the tip.

If you are using a tiny round tip (ie: Wilton 1), consider creating a ""rope"" instead by piping tiny, tight coils., These branches should be smaller and shorter. Try having two on one side of the main branch, and one on the other side, for some variety., Plan on using 6 to 8 blossoms per branch.If you have a lot of branches to decorate, it would be a good idea to separate them into smaller groups ahead of time., The icing can be plain, white icing, or it can be leftover pink, brown, or grey icing., Try to arrange the flowers in small clumps.

Use a whisk to completely combine the flours with the baking soda and spices. Set the dry mixture aside while you make the rest of the dough. You'll need to combine:2 cups (300 g) of all-purpose (plain) flour, plus extra for rolling
1¼ cups (180 g) of rye flour
1 teaspoon of baking soda
2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons of ground ginger
¾ teaspoon of ground cloves;
, Crack 2 eggs into a large mixing bowl and add 1 cup (220 g) of sugar. Place a whisk attachment on a stand or hand mixer. Whisk the eggs and sugar on high speed for 5 minutes. The mixture should become thick and pale.Since the pierniczki cookies don't have butter or oil, the cookies get their texture from the beaten egg mixture. This is why it's important to whisk the eggs and sugar for the full 5 minutes.

, Gradually whisk ½ cup (175 g) of honey into the sugar and egg mixture. Continue to whisk the mixture until the honey is completely combined. If you lift up the whisk, the mixture should fall like a ribbon back into the mixing bowl. This means that the ingredients are well mixed.Use a high-quality honey since it gives a lot of flavor to the pierniczki cookies.

, Turn off the mixer and add the dry ingredients to the bowl of wet ingredients. Use a wooden spoon to combine the mixtures into a thick gingerbread cookie dough.Avoid using an electric mixer since the dry ingredients could fly out of the dough or the dough could be over mixed.

, Sprinkle your counter or work space with a little flour. Once the cookie dough comes together in the bowl, dump the dough onto your counter. Use your hands to press the dough into a large smooth ball. Divide the ball into three parts and shape each part into a disk.Wrap two of the disks and keep one on your counter for rolling out.

, Turn the oven on to 395 degrees F (200 C). Get out two or three baking sheets and lay a sheet of parchment paper on each baking sheet. Set them aside while you roll out the cookies.You can also use silicone baking mats instead of parchment paper.

, Sprinkle flour on your counter or work space and use a rolling pin to roll out one disk of the cookie dough. The dough should be half a centimeter (4 mm) thick. You may want to turn the dough frequently to keep it from sticking to the counter.Avoid sprinkling a lot of flour on the counter or it may coat the cookie dough and give the cookies a pale appearance. Only sprinkle a little flour when the dough starts to stick.

, Use cookie cutters in any shape to cut shapes out of the rolled dough. Try to use cookie cutters that are about 3 inches (8 cm) in size. Cut out as many shapes as you can. Re-roll and cut out the remaining dough and other disks of dough.Traditionally, Polish gingerbread cookies are cut in heart shapes.
If you'd like to make the pierniczki cookies for decorations, just poke a straw into each shape to form a small hole. This will allow you to hang the cookies as decorations.

, Put the cookie shapes on the prepared baking sheets. Ensure they're at least one inch (2.5 cm) apart so they don't spread into each other as they bake. Bake the cookies for 8 to 10 minutes. The cookies will be dark golden brown once they're baked and they should smell fragrant.You may need to bake the pierniczki cookies in several batches so they bake evenly.

, Remove the baked cookies and cool them on the baking sheets until they're completely cool. You'll probably need to let them set for 20 minutes. Make a quick icing by combining icing ingredients and drizzling the icing over the cooled cookies. For the icing, stir together:1 cup (200 g) of powdered sugar
1 tablespoon of water
1/4 teaspoon of almond extract

, The size can vary according to your liking. Shape each piece into a ball.

,, Each end should be twisted in the opposite direction to create more texture and tension.

, The dough should turn on itself and create the iconic “twist”.

,,


If using an electric deep-fat fryer, heat the oil to 365°F (185°C) according to manufacturer's directions.

Next, take a 12 cup muffin tin and fill the compartments with paper cupcake liners.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the proper temperature. It will usually flash an indicator light or beep to alert you.;
, Add 1 ⅓ cups (167 g) of all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking soda, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking powder, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground ginger, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground cloves, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground allspice, and ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of salt to a large bowl. Stir until the ingredients are fully blended, and set aside.If you don’t like the flavor of ground cloves, you can substitute an equal amount of ground allspice.

, In a separate large bowl, beat together ½ cup (115 g) of softened butter and ½ cup (100 g) of packed dark brown sugar with a hand mixer set to medium. Blend the mixture until it’s light and fluffy.You can use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place to mix the batter.
You can also mix the batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort.
You can substitute light brown sugar for the dark brown sugar if you prefer.

, When the butter and sugar mixture is light and fluffy, mix in 1 egg. Blend until it is totally incorporated into the butter and sugar.It’s a good idea to break the egg into a separate dish before adding it to the butter mixture. That way, if the egg is bad, you won’t ruin all of the batter.
Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary to ensure that all of the egg is blended into the butter and sugar.

, Once the egg is fully mixed into the batter, add ½ cup (118 ml) of water and ½ cup (156 g) of molasses. Beat the mixture together with the hand mixer on medium for 30 seconds to 1 minutes.Don’t worry if the molasses isn’t fully incorporated into the mixture. It’s normal for the batter to have a piece-y consistency at this point.

, Turn the hand mixer’s speed to low, and gradually add the dry ingredients into the batter. Beat the mixture until the dry ingredients are just combined with the wet ingredients.Be careful not to overmix the batter. You may wind up with tough, chewy cupcakes.
Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as you’re mixing to ensure that the ingredients are blended.

, When the batter is completely mixed, spoon it into the lined muffin tin. Add enough batter to fill the cups ⅔’s of the way.Don’t overfill the muffin tin. The muffins may puff up and bake into one another if the compartments are too full.

, Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven, and allow the cupcakes to bake for 20 to 25 minutes. They’re finished when you stick a toothpick in the center and it comes out clean., Set the muffin tin on a wire rack and let the cupcakes cool for 10 minutes before removing them. Place the cupcakes on the rack, and allow them to sit for another 20 to 30 minutes or until they’re cooled completely.It’s important to ensure that the cupcakes are entirely cool before you frost them. If you place the frosting on warm cupcake, it will melt.

, Add 8 ounces (224 g) of softened cream cheese and ¼ cup (60 g) of softened butter to a medium size bowl. Use a hand mixer to beat them together on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. It should take approximately 2 minutes.For the best results, use full fat cream cheese.

, When the cream cheese and butter are combined, add 2 cups (240 g) of powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream. Blend them into the cream cheese and butter on medium for approximately 2 minutes or until the mixture is smooth.You can substitute milk for the heavy cream if you prefer.

, Once the powdered sugar and cream are blended into the frosting, mix in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract. If the frosting is too thick, stir in another tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream to thin it to a spreadable consistency.If the frosting tastes too sweet, mix in a pinch of salt to help balance the flavors.
To give the frosting a spicy flavor, add 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon.
Give the frosting a bright citrus flavor by mixing in ½ teaspoon (1 g) of orange zest.
If you like maple, stir ¼ cup (79 g) of maple syrup into the frosting.

, When the frosting is mixed, use a butter knife or spatula to spread it on the cooled cupcakes. You can also place the frosting in a piping bag and pipe it onto the cupcakes. Place the frosted cupcakes on a platter and serve.If you don’t plan to serve the cupcakes right away, store them in the refrigerator. They’ll stay fresh for 3 to 4 days.

, Adding only 1 teaspoon of milk or cream will make the frosting more stiff and is perfect for designing using a frosting tip but if you prefer a more loose and 'spreadable' butter cream you can opt for 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml). If you're still uncertain with the amount of milk or cream to add, you can just add 1/2 a teaspoon first to check. You can also substitute the vanilla extract for 1 teaspoon of a different flavor. For more ideas, click here. For a lighter buttercream, consider using milk instead of whipping cream.


If you would like to make your buttercream less sweet, then add a pinch of salt.

, You can leave the buttercream plain, or you can make it coloring by adding a few drops of food coloring or gel icing coloring. Keep in mind that some flavorings, such as cocoa powder, will already tint the icing darker, so the coloring will not show up.

",How to Make Buttercream Frosting4," You can give your buttercream a more interesting flavor by adding some extract, flavoring oil, or milk. Keep in mind that flavoring oils have a much more intense flavor than extracts, so you won't need as much.Here are some suggestions:


1 teaspoon of an extract, such as: almond, lemon, peppermint, or vanilla
A few drops of a flavoring oil, such as: butterscotch, lemon, orange, or raspberry

, Simply add the ingredients to the powdered sugar and mix well. Here are some suggestions:1 to 2 teaspoons of a spice, such as apple pie, cinnamon, or pumpkin pie, will give you a more aromatic buttercream, perfect for those fall and holiday treats.
1 tablespoon instant coffee mixed with 2 tablespoons of water will give you coffee-flavored buttercream. You can also add in a pinch of cocoa powder for a mocha-flavored buttercream.
Substitute ½ cup (50 grams) of the sugar for cocoa powder. This will give you chocolate-flavored buttercream.

Make the icing.,
Add color.,
Add the smooth layer of icing.,
Gather piping supplies.,
Pipe on decorations.,
Pipe flower designs.",How to Make Cake Designs1," Buttercream frosting is an excellent choice for standard cake decorations, including writing and flowers. Royal icing will dry hard to make a longer-lasting decoration, but must be applied right after you make it.You can try a different recipe if you have a favorite, but some icings are too runny to use as decoration.


Buttercream or royal icing can easily be stiffened by mixing in sugar, or made runnier by adding a drop or two of water. Slightly soft mixtures are best for the first, smooth layer, and stiffer mixtures are best for the decorations on top.;
, Mix in food coloring to the frosting a drop at a time until you get the color you want. Keep in mind that colors will deepen over a couple hours time when added to buttercream, but fade when added to royal icing, or when any icing is exposed to bright light.Divide the icing into batches and use several colors for more options.
Alternatively, sugar icing or royal icing can be added to the cake plain, then have food color painted on them in fine designs using a small paintbrush, barely dampened in food coloring.

, Start with a thin ""crumb coat"" to lock the crumbs under the icing, then spread a large amount of icing onto the cake's top and sides, so you can spread it using a flat spatula without scraping the cake. Try to get it as smooth as you can, then use one of these two methods to perfect it:


For white icing, use a pastry scraper or other wide, flat edge to scrape off the excess icing to a flat surface. Between each scrape, wipe off the scraper's edge on the icing bowl, then with a paper towel.Colored icing can look spotted after being scraped, so it's best to use a bit less icing so there's less to remove after spreading. To smooth it out, wait until it is dry to the touch, then place a paper towel over the cake, rub it gently back and forth for thirty seconds, then repeat along the side. Note that most paper towels are textured, which will add a pleasing pattern.

, The classic swirls and flowers on bakery cakes are made by piping icing through a pastry bag – which you can make at home – with a metal tip at the end. There are many different types and sizes of decorating tips, but three of them will get you started on most common decorating techniques:Use a simple round tip for dots and writing.
A star tip can make rosettes with a short squeeze, or classic swirls if you move as you squeeze the bag. A ""closed star"" tip will give the swirl more pronounced ridges.
A petal tip is used for making ruffles, ribbons, scallops, or flowers.

, Once the tip is attached to the pastry bag, spoon in some icing and push it down to the bottom of the bag. Twist the top closed, then manipulate the bag to separate the icing into two lumps, with one fist-sized handful down at the bottom. Use one hand to squeeze this handful through the tip, and the other hand to guide the pastry bag's movement, holding either the tip or your other hand. Keep these tips in mind, and consider practicing on a plate first:For most purposes, hold the pastry bag tip at a 90º angle to the surface you're decorating, and about 1/2 inch (2.5 cm) above it.
Try to squeeze the bag as evenly as possible, and move the bag at a constant rate, or the decoration will have uneven width.
When you are finished with a swirl, line, or other decoration, stop squeezing, then lift the pastry bag straight upward to prevent smearing.

, Icing flowers are more complicated to create than most other designs, but turn out great once you have some practice. You'll need a petal piping tip on your pastry bag for this step:Hold the tip at a 45º angle just above the surface, with the thin end of the petal tip pointing upward.
Squeeze briefly while moving the tip in a tiny circle, to form a cylinder.
Squeeze again, this time moving the tip quickly in a teardrop or U shape, starting and ending against the edge of the cylinder. Move the tip up as you reach the bend of the U and down again when you return to the cylinder. This makes a single petal.
Repeat around the cylinder, then add additional layers of petals until your flower is complete.

Finished.

",How to Make Cake Designs2," Fondant is a smooth, easily molded covering used to cover the whole cake or to make cake toppers. You can make it yourself or purchase ready-made fondant to save yourself the trouble.


Some brands of fondant tear more easily than others. Fondarific, Duff, and FondX are good beginner options.Fondant dries quickly, so keep any portions you are not currently using wrapped in plastic or in the original container., Make this as smooth as possible to prevent wrinkling or tearing the fondant, which will go over the buttercream. See the icing section for tips.



Ganache can be used instead. It may be more difficult to smooth, but will provide a more stable base.

, Sprinkle cornstarch or spread shortening on a clean surface to prevent the fondant from sticking, then knead it for a couple minutes or until pliable. Knead by pushing with your flat palms and heel of the hand, to avoid trapping air bubbles in the fondant.Skip this step if you purchased ready-to-use rolled fondant.

, Use a rolling pin to roll the fondant out to a ¼ in (6 mm) thickness.Occasionally rotate the fondant by sliding your hand underneath it to the center, to make sure it hasn't stuck to the table.


If you plan on covering a circular cake with fondant, you'll need a circle as wide as your cake's diameter plus twice the cake's height.

, Once the fondant is rolled out, roll it around the rolling pin, then unroll it again over the cake to drape it over.Use a flat tool – or your hands if necessary – to smooth the top surface and remove air bubbles. Next, smooth out a full circle around the top of the cake's sides, to make sure the fondant is firmly attached. Smooth the rest of the sides, gradually moving around the cake, until it is fully covered. Cut off the remaining fondant with a utility knife or pizza cutter.


If you are covering a cake with an unusual shape, put the fondant in the same mold you used for the cake, let it harden slightly, then place it over the cake. Large cakes may need to be covered piece by piece, then repaired as described below.

, You can easily make two-dimensional fondant decorations by cutting shapes out with a utility knife or scissors. Use fondant in multiple colors to make faces, animals, or any shape you like. It can also be sliced into strips and arranged to form ribbons or a spiral flower.Three-dimensional shapes can be sculpted just like clay, although fondant is best suited for small cake toppers, since it dries quickly.

, Fondant can tear, crack, or bulge fairly easily, especially when used to cover an entire cake. Here are a few ways to repair these imperfections:Put a small amount of new fondant into a bowl and mix in water ¼ tsp (1 mL) at a time until you get a toothpaste consistency. Spread this with a flat spatula over cracks or dents to make them smooth, then wait for them to dry.
If the fondant cracks before you've started decorating, knead in some shortening or glycerin.
Hairline cracks can sometimes be smoothed out with your fingertips, or disguised with a brush of shortening.
A bulge is usually an air bubble. Try pricking it with a pin, then smoothing out the fondant.

Heat the sugar, water, and cream of tarter in a pot on medium heat with a candy thermometer.,
Put the egg yolks and whole egg in a stand mixer with a whisk and beat on high.,
Test the sugar syrup temperature, removing from heat at 230F.,
Slowly pour the sugar syrup into the egg mixture.,
Continue adding the syrup, letting the mixer beat until the side of the bowl is cool.,
Add the room temperature butter in small cubes.,
Add flavorings if you want and stir lightly.,
Store this frosting immediately in the fridge.",How to Make Buttercream Icing1," You cannot skip the thermometer -- you need to know when exactly to take the sugar syrup off the heat.The cream of tarter is not essential, but will lead to a smoother frosting. 1-2 tablespoons of light corn syrup can help with this as well, and can be added with the tarter or alone.;
, Using an auto mixer, such as a Kitchenaid, whip the eggs on high. The eggs will foam up and get to the “ribbon stage.” This means that when you run your spatula through the eggs and lift up, the eggs will run down in a ribbon that settles on top of the egg mixture.








You can't over whip the eggs! Just keep them going.
You will not need the whites of the eggs after separating. They can be discarded.

, Use a candy thermometer to gauge the temperature. It should reach 230 degrees Fahrenheit (“soft ball” stage). As soon as it hits this temp, take it off the heat and turn off the burner.


If the temperature exceeds 230 degrees, the mixture will reach the ""firm ball"" or ""hard ball"" stage. In these stages, the sugar syrup mixture will start to hold its shape if made into a ball. It won't be spreadable as icing anymore., Aim somewhere between the moving whisk and the side of the bowl, so it incorporates slowly without splatter. Be very careful and slow when pouring the sugar syrup into the egg mixture. Keep the mixer running as you pour.









It’s crucial that you pour very slowly. Otherwise, the hot sugar syrup will start to cook the eggs in the bowl.

, You want the mixture to keep moving until the sugar syrup loses all it's heat and the metal bowl is cool to the touch, especially on the bottom. Add a pinch of salt when done, if desired -- this will help bring out the richness of the eggs., Cut the butter into small pieces and add slowly into the syrup-egg mixture. It is a pain in the butt, but you really should add it one small, 1"" cube at a time. If the butter is added all at once, it won’t mix well with the eggs and you’ll have chunky icing. You're creating an emulsion -- or mixture of two things that don't want to mix. It takes time.








Keep the butter out on the counter to soften as you work. This way, when you add it, it will mix in much more easily.
It’s best if you use a paddle attachment with your stand mixer for this step. The whisk may have trouble mixing the butter with the rest of the mixture.

, Once the frosting is all well-mixed and fluffy, it is the time to flavor your frosting if you so choose. Add 2-3 teaspoons of cocoa powder, almond extract, vanilla, lemon juice, or other flavors, mix them in thoroughly, and you're done.








, The raw egg in the icing, though not harmful, will go bad out in the open. Unlike classic buttercreams, this frosting must be refrigerated. You may need to whip it again before using to get a light consistency again."

For a less sweet buttercream, use salted butter.;
, Beat it into the butter until it is smooth. Adding the sugar a little bit at a time gives the butter enough time to absorb it. This gives you a smoother texture.


If you are using a handheld mixer, start at a slow speed. This will keep the sugar from flying out everywhere.To make the texture even smoother, sift the sugar first. This will break up any clumps.

, The vanilla extract will give the buttercream a slight ivory color. If you prefer pure white buttercream, use a clear vanilla flavor or extract instead.


To give your buttercream color, add in a bit of icing coloring. Using the gel kind instead of the liquid kind will mix easier into the buttercream ., It will take about three minutes. There should be no streaks, swirls, or clumps.


If you are using a handheld mixer, you can increase the speed to a higher one once the sugar is mixed in.

Warm up cooled buttercream icing to room temperature after storing.",How to Make Buttercream Icing2," Use good quality salted butter, as the bit of salt is essential to bring out the full flavor of your icing. Leave the butter out of the fridge for an hour so that it will soften. It should give freely under your finger when pressed. Note. it doesn't need to be liquid -- just soft.If your butter has been in the fridge, defrost it in the microwave for about 15 seconds, using 5-second bursts to ensure it doesn't liquefy.
Another way to soften butter is to cut it up into small pieces and place next to a warm stove. Smaller chunks of butter will soften more quickly., Use a low speed to mix up the butter, using the paddle attachment. Scrape the sides of the bowl to make sure that all of the butter is mixed together. Beat for about 3 minutes, or until the butter is light and fluffy.Using a wooden spoon is hard work, but not impossible. Basically, you want to keep working and beating the butter until it is a nice, airy mixture.

, Slowly add the sifted powdered sugar to the butter. Use a hand mixer at low speed to mix it together with the butter, keeping it moving as you add the sugar slowly. It can help to divide up the sugar first, adding only a fourth or a third at a time.


Powdered sugar can me sold as icing sugar or confectioner’s sugar, as well.

, Vanilla is added next. Keep mixing the icing with your hand mixer. Don't worry about adding it slowly -- just toss it in. You can use imitation vanilla in a pinch, but real vanilla is always a better choice., When you add cream to your icing, add it in one tablespoonful at a time. Mix up the icing after each time you add more milk. This will help you see how thick or thin your icing is getting. More cream leads to a more whipped icing, less leads to something more firm.


If you don't have cream, use whole milk in order to ensure at least some creaminess and richness. Some recipes call for heavy cream, which can be used for an extra rich icing.

, Depending on how thick your icing is, you may choose to thicken it up more or thin it out. Add a tablespoon of powdered sugar to thicken the icing. If you need to thin out the icing, add another tablespoon of milk. Continue to mix the icing to make sure your addition is integrated into the mix.


Mix the icing until it is light and fluffy. It should be easy to spread on a cake but not so runny that it slides off the cake., Put the icing in an airtight container to store in the refrigerator. Do not store it next to fragrant foods, such as onions or fish. Store for up to 2 weeks. If you want it for a longer time, you can keep it in the freezer for up to three months.


Store cakes with buttercream icing at room temperature for 2-3 days, max. Cakes that have icing on them can be stored at room temperature for 2-3 days.

, Bring the icing out of the refrigerator and warm it up to room temperature. Stir it well with a spatula or use a hand mixer. The texture may not be as good as when you originally made the buttercream icing, but it will be close.

Use salted butter if you want less sweet buttercream.

, Adding the sugar a little bit at a time will allow the butter to absorb the sugar better. You'll get a smoother cream in the end.


If you are using a handheld mixer, start at a slower speed. This will keep the sugar from flying out.
Try to sift the sugar into the butter. This will get rid of clumps.

, Keep mixing until the color and texture are even and smooth. There should be no streaks, swirls, or lumps. It will take about three minutes.


If you are using a handheld mixer, you can increase the speed after the sugar and cocoa powder are mixed in.

, Chocolate buttercream tastes wonderful, but you can improve your buttercream by giving it a hint of another flavor. Be sure to mix it thoroughly to evenly distribute the flavor. Here are some ideas that work well with chocolate:To give the buttercream a hint of sweetness, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
To give the buttercream a hint of extra flavor, add ½ teaspoon of almond extract.
To cut the sweetness and give the buttercream a richer flavor, add in a splash of brandy or rum.

, If the buttercream is too thin, add some more sugar. If the buttercream is too thick, add some more milk. Start with a tablespoon or two at a time, mix, and add more as needed.

Make sure that your pastries are cool before you start to fill them.,
Use a butter knife or palette knife to spread buttercream on the base layer of a cake.,
Add some sliced strawberries along with the buttercream between the cake layers.,
Perhaps spreading some jams over the buttercream before you put the top cake layer on.,
Use a spoon to hollow out a cupcake before filling it with buttercream.,
Use a piping bag to fill homemade Twinkies.,
Use a paring knife and a piping bag to fill cream puffs.",How to Make Buttercream Filling4," If you use buttercream on a pastry that hasn't completely cooled off, the buttercream will melt and make an oozy mess.

, Spread the buttercream evenly, right up to the edges. Finish up by placing the top layer on the cake.

, After you have spread the buttercream filling over the bottom layer, place some thinly sliced strawberries on top of the buttercream. Try to spread them as evenly as you can, so that none of the buttercream is visible. Once you have arranged the strawberries, spread more buttercream on top. When you are done, cover with the upper cake layer.


You can also use other types of fruit as well.

, Once you have spread buttercream over the bottom cake layer, spread some of your favorite jam over the buttercream. Make sure that the jam is spread evenly, and that there is no buttercream showing. When you are done, cover with the upper cake layer.

, You can use a measuring spoon or even an apple corer. Scoop out a hole on the top of a cupcake. Fill the hole with buttercream. Fit a piping bag with your desired decorating tip (such as a star) and swirl more buttercream on top to cover the hole., Fit the end of the piping bag with a filling tip. Poke three holes into the bottom of the pastry: one at each end, and one in the middle. Squeeze on the piping bag as you poke each hole; this will fill the pastry., Cut a large slit into the side of a cream puff. Put the tip of the piping bag into the slit, and squeeze the buttercream into the puff. Stop when the buttercream starts to ooze out from the slit. Repeat this step for all of the cream puffs."

Add equal amounts of red, blue and green to your recipe.,
Adjust the color.,
Wait for the final color.",How to Make Black Food Coloring1," You can mix these colors to make a dark grey, which is about as close as you can get without buying black food coloring.


If you're making icing or frosting, use gel or paste food coloring. Liquid food coloring is less intense and can make the icing runny.;
, The end result is always better when you start with a dark recipe. If you're using white frosting, you can fix this by mixing in cocoa powder, one spoonful at a time.Black cocoa powder gives the best result, but ordinary cocoa powder should work fine for this method.
If you skip this step, you'll need to use much more food coloring, which can affect the taste and texture.

, Start with just a couple drops of each color, stirring them in well. Repeat until the mixture darkens to a deep grey, always adding equal amounts of the color.


You can use yellow instead of green, but the lighter color makes it more difficult to achieve black.

, If you see hints of other colors in the grey, make these adjustments:If it looks green, add more red.
If it looks purple, add more green.
Make all adjustments one drop at a time, stirring thoroughly between each drop.

, Most food coloring will deepen in buttercream and fade slightly in royal and boiled icing.If you are making the latter type of icing, consider adding the color a half hour before serving to minimize the fading.


In some regions, chemicals in the water can change the color. Buttercream usually has a more reliable color when made with milk instead.Keep the recipe away from direct light and heat, which can cause fading."

",How to Make Buttercream1," Buttercream's texture is dependent on light, fluffy butter. It's necessary to start with softened (not melted) butter and beat it until it takes on a pale yellow hue and becomes quite malleable. Use an electric mixture or a stand mixture to beat your butter; it'll be a lot harder to whip in enough air using a whisk.






;
, Start with 3 cups of confectioner's sugar. Measure it out and dump it in your mixing bowl with the fluffy butter, then beat on low until the mixture is thoroughly combined. Turn the mixer to a higher speed and keep beating until the combination is light as a feather.









If you want to make chocolate buttercream, now's the time to add some unsweetened cocoa powder. Start with 1/2 cup. If you want the buttercream to be more chocolatey, you can always add more.
You can flavor your buttercream with other spices if you're not into chocolate. Consider cinnamon, cardamon, dried crushed rose or lavender - whatever suits your fancy.

, To finish your buttercream, add the vanilla and salt, and start with 2 tablespoons cream. Beat the mixture until well combined. Your finished buttercream should be light, fluffy and spreadable.









If it seems too dry, add another tablespoon of cream - up to four total.
If it seems too wet, add more sugar.
You can use a flavor other than vanilla, like almond or mint.
You can color your buttercream by adding a few drops of food coloring.

Mix black cocoa powder into cake batter.,
Add squid ink to savory dishes.",How to Make Black Food Coloring2," This special type of cocoa powder, labeled ""black"" or ""ultra Dutch processed,"" has a darker color and more mild taste than regular cocoa. This will make a deep black cake with a chocolatey flavor. When replacing ordinary cocoa powder, make the following changes to the recipe:Add a little extra fat (butter or oil).
Use 1 tsp (5mL) baking powder instead of each ¼ tsp (1.25mL) baking soda.

, This has a briny taste and is not suitable for sweets or desserts. This is mostly used to color pasta, rice, or savory sauces. For the most intense color, mix it into homemade pasta dough (replacing the salt and a little of the liquid ingredients). For a faster but less consistent method, add the ink to the water while the pasta or rice is boiling. Stir ink into the sauce as well for a more dramatic look.Fishmongers sometimes sell this, but you may need to ask at several stores.
Add squid ink in small quantities. It is quite salty and can taste of iodine in large quantities.

",How to Make Buttercream2," By changing the ratio of butter to confectioner's sugar, you can create a buttercream more suitable for filling cakes and cookies. It's a little lighter than buttercream frosting, and can be flavored in any way you like. Here's how to make it:









Beat 1 cup of softened butter until fluffy.
Add 1/2 cup shortening and beat well.
Add 1 pound of confectioner's sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt and keep beating.
Add 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Beat until creamy and spreadable.

,, If you're looking for a frosting more stable and sturdy than buttercream, but with the same rich flavor, buttercream fondant is for you. It's made with marshmallows and butter flavoring, so it emulates the flavor of buttercream but won't melt as easily.Here's how to make it:









Microwave 8 cups mini marshmallows, 2 teaspoons clear vanilla extract, and 2 teaspoons butter extract until the ingredients are melted together.
In a separate bowl, beat 2 pounds confectioner's sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons water and 1 tablespoon white corn syrup.
Combine the marshmallow mixture and the sugar mixture in a mixing bowl, and beat until fluffy.
Turn the dough onto a nonstick surface and knead for 10 minutes. Grease your hands with vegetable shortening to keep the dough from sticking.
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for an hour before rolling it out and using it.

, Sifting the sugar first will help reduce any lumps or clumps. It might be a good idea to have a few cups of extra sugar on hand, in case the icing is too thin., Start with 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters). Keep stirring until everything is smooth and no lumps remain. The icing should have a syrup-like consistency. If the icing is too thick, add another tablespoon (15 milliliters) of milk. If the icing is too thin, add more icing sugar, 1 tablespoon (7.5 grams) at a time. Whisk well after each addition.

For more flavor, add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.For a lighter icing, use water instead of milk., Plan on using two different colors.You can use liquid food coloring or gel food coloring. If you are using liquid food coloring, simply squeeze a few drops straight from the bottle. If you are using gel food coloring, use a toothpick to scoop a small amount out, and dip it into the icing.You can use more than two colors. Be sure to use a new toothpick for each color.

, This goes for both liquid and gel food coloring. Do not over-stir the food coloring, or it will mix into your icing and make a muddy color. A few stirs is all that you need. You want the dots to turn into streaks., Pick up a doughnut and hold it upside side with the bottom facing up. Dip the top of the doughnut into the icing. Hold it in the icing for a few seconds, then pull it out., Hold the doughnut upside down and wait for the excess icing to drip off. Turn the doughnut over and set it down on a wire cooling rack.For easy clean up, slip a sheet of wax paper or parchment paper under the wire rack. This will catch any drips from the icing and keep your work surface clean.

, At one point, your icing may turn white again. If this happens, simply add a few more drops of food coloring and swirl them together with another toothpick.

If you are glazing mini doughnuts, the icing may get stuck in the hole. If this bugs you, use a clean toothpick to open up the hole again., This will take about 1 hour.If you want to add some sprinkles, let the wet icing dry for 1 minute before shaking any on.

",How to Make Black Icing1," Unless your heart is set on vanilla, go with a chocolate icing. Starting with a brown-colored icing means you have to use less dye to achieve a black hue.You can still start with a white icing, but you will probably have to add flavoring later to cover the bitterness of the dye.
You can dye most icing--including buttercream, cream cheese, or royal icing--black by following these instructions. Because royal icing is white, you may need to add flavoring or cocoa powder to hide the bitter flavor.;
, You may be limited to what they carry at your local grocery store, but if you have a choice between liquid or gel coloring, choose the gel. You will use less of the gel than you would the liquid coloring.If you cannot find black dye, mix equal parts red, blue, and green food coloring. You won't get the ""true"" black like you would from the store-bought black, but you can achieve a very dark gray that can pass for black., Adding the dye (especially liquid) may thin out your icing, which can lead to bleeding. Store-bought icing will probably be a fine consistency, as it is usually nice and thick.


To thicken, thoroughly mix in some sifted powdered (aka confectioner's) sugar.If you don't want your icing any sweeter but it's not thick enough, add some meringue powder instead.If you are using royal icing, drag a butter knife through the surface. Count how long it takes the icing to smooth back over. If it's between 5-10 seconds, your icing is thick enough. Any faster and you need to mix it longer or add a little sifted powdered sugar or meringue powder., The black dye may stain plastic.You may also want to wear an apron so you don't get any dye on your clothes.

, You will probably end up using a lot of dye--sometimes up to 1 oz or a teaspoon of coloring per cup--but it's better to add it gradually so you don't accidentally overdo it and end up with runny or splotchy icing.,, Black icing can make your icing bitter and unpalatable. If this happens to your icing, look at section three (Addressing Common Problems) to learn how to cover the bitterness.

, If you are close to black but can't seem to get past a dark gray, give your icing a few hours to develop. The color will deepen over time, and in as little as one hour your dark gray icing can turn a rich, complex black.The color will continue to deepen even once you've piped it onto a cookie or cake, so if you are super short on time you can go ahead and decorate immediately. Just be aware you won't have the opportunity to troubleshoot if the icing doesn't develop into the black you want.Keep the icing out of direct light as it develops, as this can cause the black to fade.,"

Be aware that black icing may stain people's teeth and lips.,
Add flavoring if your icing is bitter.,
Add color or time if your icing isn't the right shade.,
Take precautions to keep your icing from bleeding.",How to Make Black Icing2," While you may want that deep, true black color, toning down the black by using less dye can help with this. Otherwise, just have plenty of water and napkins on hand.You can also avoid this problem by using black only sparingly. Try to use it just for accents and outlines.

, A common problem with black dye is that it can give your icing a bitter flavor. If you plan to use only a little bit of black icing, this may not be too much of a problem. Otherwise, there are a couple ways you can hide the bitter taste.


Cocoa powder will give your icing a chocolatey taste and will help darken the color, too. In a small bowl mix 1/2 cup of cocoa powder with 2 teaspoons of water (so it won't make lumps in your icing). If it's still bitter, add another 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder.Add a strong flavor, like cherry or orange, to your icing. Use about 1 teaspoon per 2 cups of icing.If you can't have cocoa, substitute with carob powder.

, Before you add any more dye, allow the frosting to sit for several hours. The color can change drastically in that time.


If your black has a green hue, add red food coloring one drop at at time.If your black has a purple hue, add green dye one drop at a time., Bleeding is usually cause by condensation. Store your icing in a cool, dark room instead of the refrigerator. If you are decorating a frozen cake or a cake that was just in the fridge, allow it to thaw and breathe before you begin to decorate.Avoid storing your cake or cookies in the refrigerator or an air-tight container at room temperature, as this can cause condensation and make your colors bleed.Try to use as little dye as possible when mixing your black. If you use too much, you can thin out the icing, which can cause it to bleed. If you have already added too much black dye, try thickening with a little powdered sugar. You will probably also want to flavor the dye to cover the bitterness of too much black.
