Set the bowl aside.For the best results, sift the ingredients through a wire sieve into the bowl before mixing.
Some recipes omit the ground nutmeg, and replace it with ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) ground allspice and ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) ground cloves. You can also choose to include all three, depending on how spicy you want your gingerbread cookies to be.;
, In a second large bowl, mix together ¾ cup (170 g), or 1 ½ sticks, of softened butter with ¾ cup (150 g) firmly packed brown sugar. Use an electric mixer to beat the two together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy.Softened butter should be cool when you touch it, but light pressure from your finger should leave an indentation. The best way to soften butter is to leave it out at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes. Cut it into chunks to help it soften more quickly., When the butter and brown sugar are thoroughly combined, stir ½ cup (170 g) of molasses, 1 egg, and 1 teaspoon (5 mL) vanilla extract into the bowl. Make sure to mix thoroughly, scraping down the sides of the bowl several times to ensure that the ingredients are completely combined.Because molasses is so thick, it’s best to drizzle it into the bowl, rather than dump it all in at once.

, To make the dough, combine the flour mixture with the butter mixture. Use a wooden spoon to slowly stir the dry ingredients in so you can ensure that they are fully incorporated. It will form a stiff dough when they’re fully mixed.You’ll have an easier time mixing the dry ingredients into the butter mixture if you do it in batches and stir after each addition.

, Once the dough is formed, press it in a flat disc. Cover the disc with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator. Allow it chill for at least four hours, though you may get better results if you refrigerate it overnight.You can make the dough up to two days in advance of when you plan to bake the cookies.

, When you’re ready to cut and bake the cookies, start by getting your oven to the proper temperature. Allow it to preheat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 175 degrees Celsius).Make sure to pay attention to your oven. It should beep or an indicator light should illuminate when it reaches the correct temperature.

, If you try to roll out the dough right after removing it from the fridge, it will be too stiff to work with. Instead, take it out of the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes until it’s warm enough to roll without tearing or cracking.You may find it easier to divide the dough into two sections and work with one at a time so the dough doesn’t get too soft outside the refrigerator.

, While the dough is warming, prepare your work surface by sprinkling it lightly with flour to keep the dough from sticking to it. Set the dough on the surface, and sprinkle the top of it with a pinch of flour before rolling out it with a rolling pin to a ¼-inch (6.35 mm) thickness.Roll your dough to ⅛-inch (3.17 mm) thickness to end up with crispier cookies.

, Once the dough is rolled out, use floured cookie cutters to cut the cookies. A traditional gingerbread man shape is most popular for this type of cookie, but you can use any shape that you like. You’ll make approximately 24 cookies, depending on the size of your cookie cutters. If you don’t have cookie cutters, you can use a glass to cut out round cookies or print out shapes on your computer to create templates that you can place on the dough and cut around with a knife.

, After cutting out the cookies, transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. For the best results, use a non-stick cookie sheet. Make sure to place the cookies so they are 1-inch apart to prevent them spreading into one another during baking.If you don’t have a non-stick baking sheet, line yours with a baking mat or parchment paper to make it easier to get the cookies off once they’ve baked.

, Place the cookie sheet in the oven and allow them to bake until the edges are set and crisp. That usually takes between 10 and 15 minutes, depending on the thickness that you rolled the dough to and the size of cookie cutters that you used.The cookies should be firm but still soft when they’re baked through.

, Once the cookies are done, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Allow the cookies to cool on the sheets for 1 to 2 minutes to ensure that they’re fully set before you move them., After cooling the cookies for a couple of minutes on the baking sheet, use a spatula to transfer them to wire racks. Allow the cookies to cool completely, which should take approximately 20 to 30 minutes.If you plan on decorating your cookies, it’s especially important to allow them to cool fully. Otherwise, the royal icing may melt when you apply it to the cookies.

, In a large bowl, mix 2 pounds (970 g) of sifted powdered sugar, ⅓ cup (80 mL) of whole milk, and 2 large egg whites. Use an electric mixer on low to beat them together until they form a thick icing that’s you’re still able to pipe with a pastry bag.You may need to add a little extra milk to the icing to make it thin enough for piping. Add a couple of drops at a time and stir, so you don’t accidentally make it too thin.
You can refrigerate the icing for up to two days if you store it in an airtight container. You may want to make it ahead of time, so it’s ready when it’s time to decorate the cookies.
If you’re short on time, you can substitute canned vanilla frosting from the grocery store for the royal icing.

, Royal icing is naturally white, but depending on how you plan to decorate your cookies, you may want to color it. Use food coloring drops or paste to color the icing before putting it in a piping bag.When you add the food coloring, start gradually so you don’t make the icing too dark.
You may want to divide the icing, and color it in multiple shades to fit the occasion.

, Once the icing is the right consistency, place it in a piping or pastry bag. Make sure that the bag has a fine tip attached to make decorating easier.If you don’t have a piping or pastry bag, you can use a squirt bottle to dispense the icing on the cookies.

, Once your pastry bag is ready, you can pipe the icing on as an accent for the cookies. You can use it simply to outline the shape of the cookie, or to add fine details, such as a face for a gingerbread man cookie.You can also use the icing to pipe patterns on the cookies, such as an all-over polka dot or stripe design.

, Royal icing works extremely well as a glue to hold decorative candies and other embellishments on the cookies. Just add a dot of the frosting onto the cookie where you want to place the decoration and press the candy into place. When the icing dries, it won’t move.You can use candies specifically meant for cookies decorating, such as sugar pearls or dragees, or you can use regular candies, such as M&M’s.
Allow the icing to dry completely before you place the decorated cookies in storage containers.

, If you want an easy way to decorate the cookies, use a knife to spread the icing over the entire cookie. While the icing is still wet, sprinkle colored sugar over it for a colorful, sparkling look.


You can use a single colored sugar for the entire cookie, or use a piece of paper towel or a paper plate to block off sections of the cookie as you sprinkle to use multiple colors for a striped effect.

Set them aside while you make the biscotti.You could also line the sheets with a silicone mat or parchment paper. These would make it easier to lift the logs to a cutting board later on.;
, Place 1/2 cup (115 g) of softened butter, 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar, 1/2 cup (100 g) of firmly packed brown sugar and the gingerbread spices into a large mixing bowl. Beat the mixture on medium speed until it's light and fluffy. This should take a few minutes. For the gingerbread spices, you'll need to add:1 tablespoon of ground ginger
3/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves

, Add 2 large eggs and beat the mixture until they're combined. Stir in 3 tablespoons of molasses until it's incorporated. Turn the mixer to low and stir in 2 1/2 cups (312 g) of of all-purpose flour and 2 teaspoons of baking powder. The biscotti dough should be well combined.For a sweeter biscotti, you can also stir in 1/2 cup (90 g) of mini semi-sweet chocolate or cinnamon chips.

, Divide the biscotti dough into two halves. Sprinkle a little flour onto your work surface and set one half on the surface. Dip your hands in warm water and use your hands to shape the dough into a 12-inch (30.5 cm) log. Set the log on the baking sheet and flatten the top of the log a little.Repeat this with the other half of the biscotti dough and set it at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) apart from the other log.

, Place the baking sheets into the preheated oven and bake the biscotti logs for 22 to 25 minutes. The logs should puff up, become golden brown, and may look slightly cracked. Avoid cooking them too long or they'll crumble as you slice the biscotti.Ensure that the logs aren't too close to each other on the baking sheet since they will expand as they bake.

, Wear oven mitts to take the baked logs of biscotti out of the oven. Set the baking sheets on a wire rack. Turn down the oven temperature to 325 degrees F (162 C) and transfer the logs to a cutting board.Don't forget to reduce the oven temperature or your biscotti may overcook during the second bake.

, Once they're cool enough to handle, carefully use a sharp serrated knife to cut the logs into 1/2-inch (1.3 cm) slices. If you'd like smaller, round slices, make the cuts evenly across the logs. If you'd like longer slices, cut the slices diagonally. Set the individual slices onto ungreased baking sheets.Consider filling a small clean spray bottle with water. Spritz the biscotti logs to make them easier to slice.

, Place the baking sheets back into the oven and cook the sliced biscotti for 9 minutes. Wear oven mitts and remove the baking sheets so you can turn the biscotti slices over. Return the sheets to the oven and finish baking the biscotti for another 5 to 7 minutes.The biscotti should be completely dry and crisp once they've finished cooking. Let them cool while you make the optional white chocolate drizzle.

, Chop 5 ounces (140 g) of white chocolate into rough chunks. Place the chunks in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave the chocolate at medium power for one minute. Carefully remove the hot bowl and stir the chocolate until it's smooth. You may need to microwave it in 10 second intervals until the chocolate melts.While you can use candy almond or white chocolate bark, these often contain additives that will make the white chocolate icing taste waxy. Choose a high-quality white chocolate that lists cocoa butter as one of its ingredients.

, Lay the biscotti on their sides and place them next to each other. Arrange them on a wire rack and set a baking sheet underneath so excess chocolate will drip down under the rack. Drizzle the melted white chocolate over the cooled biscotti and let the chocolate harden before you serve them. This should take about 15 minutes.You could also dip one side or end of the biscotti, if you'd like more white chocolate on the biscotti.

, Let the white chocolate set up before you serve the biscotti. They should sit for about 15 minutes before serving. Biscotti is traditionally served with espresso or a hot cup of coffee. You can dip the biscotti into the coffee so that it slightly softens the biscotti before you bite into it.Store the biscotti in an airtight container for up to one week. You don't need to refrigerate them.

Mix until all of the ingredients are combined.You can substitute butter for the shortening. However, your gingerbread may be a little darker, and the cookies may spread more when you bake them.;
, In a separate bowl, combine 2 cups (250 g) of flour, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking soda, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking powder, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground cloves, 1 ½ teaspoon (3 g) of ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon (2 ½ g) of cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon (2 ½ g) of ground ginger. Stir well until all of the ingredients are combined.You can also add a teaspoon (2 g) of allspice to the dough if you want extra spice.

, Once the flour mixture is blended, slowly start to add it to the wet ingredients. Stir in small amounts, and mix until until the dry ingredients are incorporated before adding more. Continue the process until all of the dry ingredients are mixed in and a soft dough forms.If you’re using a hand mixer or stand mixer to mix the dough, keep the speed on low as you’re adding the dry ingredients. That will prevent flour from going all over your kitchen.

, When the dough has come together, separate it into two equal pieces. Cover each piece in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes.You can chill the dough for up to 2 hours.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the gingerbread, set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to hit fully. Next, line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Make sure that you know how your oven indicates that it’s reached the preheated temperature. It will likely beep or flash a light to alert you.
You can substitute a silicone baking mat for the parchment paper if you prefer.

, When the dough has chilled for at least 30 minutes, remove half of it from the refrigerator. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a sheet that’s approximately ¼-inch (6-mm) thick on a floured work surface.If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a wine bottle, a water bottle, or a thermos to roll out the dough.

, Once the dough is rolled out, place a 8-inch (20-cm) plate on top. Use a knife to gently trace around the plate and create a circle of the dough. Pull away the excess dough.You can also use the bottom insert from a springform pan to serve as a template for the wreath base.
Save the dough scraps from the wreath base. You can mix them in the other dough when you’re cutting the cookies.

, To create the center hole in the wreath, press a 3- to 4-inch (8- to 10-cm) round cookie cutter in the center of the dough circle. Remove the excess dough from the center.Just as before, save the dough from the middle to use for the cookies later.

, Use a spatula to carefully lift the dough wreath from your work surface. Place it on the lined baking sheet, and bake it in the preheated oven for 7 to 10 minutes or until it is set and a light golden brown.It helps to bring the baking sheet to the edge of your work surface so you can just slide the wreath onto it.
Don’t turn off the oven after you remove the wreath base. You want to stay hot enough to bake the cookies.

, Once the wreath base is finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Allow the wreath to cool on the sheet for 5 minutes, and then carefully transfer it to a wire cooling rack to cool completely., Take the other half of dough out of the refrigerator, and unwrap it. Place it on a floured work surface, and use the rolling pin to roll it out into sheet that’s approximately ¼-inch (6-mm) thick.Make sure to mix in the scraps from the wreath base in with the reserved dough before you roll it out.

, Once the dough is rolled out, take cookie cutters in holiday shapes, such as snowflakes, snowmen, stars, and Christmas trees, to cut out cookies. As you cut out the cookies, reroll the dough scraps until you’ve cut out all of the dough.For the best results, use cookie cutters that are 1 ½- to 3-inches (4- to 8-cm) in size.

, After you’ve cut out the cookies, move them to the lined baking sheet. Place them in the preheated oven, and allow them to bake for 7 to 10 minutes or until they’re set and lightly golden brown., Once the cookies are finished baking, remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Let them sit for 5 minutes on the sheet, and then transfer the cookies to a wire cooling rack to cool for at least 15 minutes.It’s important to ensure that the cookies are completely cool before you put the icing on them or it will melt.

, Add 4 cups (480 g) of powdered sugar and 5 to 7 tablespoons (75 to 105 g) of milk to a large bowl. Mix until the icing has a spreadable or pipeable consistency.Start with 5 tablespoons (75 ml) of milk, and only add more if the icing is too thick.
You can substitute water for the milk if you prefer.
If you want to color the icing, divide it between a few bowls. Mix a few drops of food coloring into each until you have all of the colors that you’d like.

, Use a butter knife to spread the icing over the cookies in whatever design you’d like. You can also transfer the icing to a piping bag, and pipe it onto the cookies., You want to make sure that the icing on the cookies has dried so it won’t smudge. Let the cookies sit for 1 to 2 hours so the icing has time to fully set., Once the icing on the front of the cookies is set, use a knife or piping bag to add a small amount of icing to the back of the cookies. Gently press the cookies onto the wreath base, adding cookies until the entire wreath is covered.If you want to layer cookies on top of one another, let the icing “glue” set for at least 30 minutes before placing the second layer.

, After you’ve covered the entire wreath with cookies, leave it in a cool, dry area to set. You’ll want to give the icing at least 1 to 2 hours to dry before displaying the wreath.It’s a good idea to cover the wreath with plastic wrap while you’re waiting for the icing to set.

, When the icing has set, put the wreath on a decorative platter. Set it on your holiday table as a centerpiece, or allow guests to break off cookies.If you have any extra cookies that didn’t fit on the wreath, you can serve those alongside it.

You can use a handheld mixer or a food processor with a whisk attachment to beat them., Keep mixing until you get firm peaks., Use a spatula to guide the egg whites mixture into the egg yolks mixture a little bit at a time. Stir the two mixtures together using a rolling motion, starting from the bottom of the bowl and moving upwards. This will help trap some air bubbles inside the batter., Stir slowly so that you don't lose the air bubbles. Try to use that same horizontal stirring motion as before., Start at one end of the pan and slowly work your way towards the other. If needed, move the mixing bowl back and forth in a wave-like motion. The batter needs to spread over the entire pan. It will be thin, which is normal; you will be rolling the baked gingerbread into a roll later., Take it out of the oven once the time is up, and leave it some place where it will not be disturbed., Dampen a tea towel and sprinkle confectioners/icing sugar all over it. Place the cake upside-down onto the tea towel and lift the pan away. Peel off the parchment paper and discard it., Start at one end, and begin rolling the cake into a tube. Some people find it easiest to roll the cake along with the tea towel. You will be unrolling it later., To make the filling, combine the heavy cream, sugar, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl. Whisk together until your get firm peaks. Start at a slow speed before increasing to a higher one., Make sure that the cake is completely cool before you start filling it. Once it is cool, use a spatula to spread the filling over the top. Start from the center, and spread the filling all the way to the edges. Remember to leave some of the filling for the outside of the cake., Use the spatula to spread the filling over the top and sides of the cake. You can cover the two flat ends, or your can leave them uncovered; the spiral can look nice.For some added color: dust some ground cinnamon over the top of the cake. If you left a bumpy texture with the frosting, this can make your cake look like a Yule log.
For some added flavor: sprinkle some lemon zest, orange zest, candied orange peel, or candied ginger over the top of your frosted cake.
For some added design: make some sugared cranberries and arrange them on top of your cake. Add some mint leaves to make them look like holly.

, Place in the center of the oven for even baking. It's ready when it turns slightly darker at the edges and feels firm to the touch.








, Let cool before using (otherwise, the icing will melt).








,, Choose cutters that match the gingerbread theme, such as gingerbread people, stars and Christmas trees.








, The time needed will be on the lower side, as these pieces are smaller.








, Beat until foamy (about 2 minutes).








, Beat it in until stiff (about 9-10 minutes).








, It's also useful to have some in a small bowl for dabbing here and there, as needed.








, It is helpful to have an extra set of hands at this stage––get the kids, your spouse or neighbors involved!









Glue the walls together first. Let them set in place before adding the roof pieces.
The roof pieces can be tricky but with the right angle and some patience at holding them gently in place until any risk of sliding is abated (about 1-5 minutes), they will sit firmly. If you don't want to hold them by hand, use props such as kitchen utensils or upturned mugs, etc. Size up your clean kitchen gear to do the task!

, Once the whole gingerbread house has set, the roof needs to be iced to represent snow. Use a palette knife or butter knife to spread the snow evenly across the roof.








, The candies will stick to the roof easily before it dries, so do this part now. Stick candies, dragées, sugar crystals and any other items on the roof.








, Stick the candy items and gingerbread cut outs to the walls using dabs of royal icing as glue.








, This can be as simple or elaborate as you like. You're not limited to edibles; a few plastic trees and the like can be added provided they're hygienic and food-safe.








, Admire your work and expect lots of compliments! In good conditions, a gingerbread house should last a few weeks provided nobody tucks into it sooner.

, Avoid regular thickness sandwich bags because the plastic is too thin and will not hold up to the punishment of being used as a pastry tube. Approximately 1 cup of icing each bag is enough. Make sure that each gingerbread artist has his or her own bag of icing.








,, You now have an ""icing tube"". As you decorate, you'll squeeze the icing toward the snipped corner and use it to dispense a bead of icing on your gingerbread house.








, Set four of them aside to form the roof and the two long sides of your house.








, Use a gentle ""sawing"" motion with a serrated knife. Use the short end of a cracker to measure the angled line from the center of the long side to the centerline of the cracker.








,,, Stick the side edge of the gable end cracker to the bead of icing on the flat side of the wall cracker. The walls should hold each other up.








, Use a bead of icing along the bottom to stick the pieces to the pie tin. Also, use a bead of icing where the two walls will join at the corners.








, Then, stick the flat of the roof to the top edges of the gable ends and walls. Allow the icing to set for 15 to 20 minutes before handling the house again. If you place candies on it too quickly, you risk collapsing the house.

This means you will need to determine your guest list at the beginning of the planning process. You may find that after you choose a location for the party, you will need to trim the guest list so that each guest has space to make their gingerbread house.If you are inviting children, you should also invite enough adults to help supervise the children.;
, After you decide whom you will be inviting to your gingerbread decorating party, you will need to find a location that will accommodate all your guests. Each adult or child making a gingerbread house will need a flat workspace, such as a countertop or table, and a chair to sit in while they decorate their gingerbread.Choose a location that can accommodate all of your guests, or adjust your guest list to fit the space you choose.

, Once you’ve finalized your guest list and decided on a venue, you will want to select a date and time to hold your gingerbread decorating party. Consider your guests’ schedules when you decide exactly when you will host the gingerbread decorating party.


For example, if you are inviting children, you will want to select a date when the kids are not in school and their parents will also be free to attend.

, Once you've nailed down your guest list and venue, you will need to outline the supplies you need and estimate the costs of these items. When determining the budget, you will need to take into account the cost of gingerbread decorating supplies, invitations, refreshments, decorations, and venue rental if applicable.


Think about ways you can save money. For example, consider buying your supplies in bulk or at a discount store.

, You’ve selected a location, determined a date and time, and set the budget for your gingerbread decorating party. It’s now time to invite your guests. You can invite guests to your party in a variety of ways, including by telephone, by mailed invitation, by social media invitation, or by an invitation you email directly to your guests.Your invitation should include the date, time, and location of the party.
Make sure you ask your guests to RSVP so you can purchase gingerbread decorating supplies accordingly.

, You can make your gingerbread houses in a variety of ways. Two of the most popular include making the houses out of homemade gingerbread and constructing the houses out of graham crackers. Keep in mind that one of the keys to a successful party is constructing the houses the night before., You will need to purchase gingerbread or graham crackers for your gingerbread houses. You will also need to buy ingredients for royal icing, which serves as a type of edible glue. Finally, you will need to buy decorations for the gingerbread houses. You can use gumdrops, licorice, peppermint candies, and more. Gingersnaps or round candies make great shingles, and candy bars can be arranged to create a convincing door!Be creative when deciding on your decorations, and keep them edible, especially if there will be children participating.
Make sure you purchase enough supplies for each guest’s gingerbread house.

, Your gingerbread houses will be held together with royal icing. Royal icing is a delicious and gooey icing that serves as an adhesive. It will help candy shingles and gumdrop chimneys stick to your guests’ gingerbread houses. You can whip it up the night before and refrigerate it until you are ready to use it.Each gingerbread house will need about one cup of royal icing for construction and decorating.

, Your gingerbread decorating party will go smoothly if you construct the gingerbread houses well in advance of your party. This is especially important if there will be children attending your party. To save time, you can make the gingerbread houses using graham crackers instead of gingerbread. For a more traditional gingerbread decorating party, you can make gingerbread houses from homemade gingerbread.You can construct the gingerbread houses the night before your party.

, You can easily make icing tubes that your guests can use to decorate their gingerbread houses. Take about one cup of royal icing and place it in a quart-sized zipped style freezer bag. You will need one bag of icing for each guest. When it is time for your guests to decorate their gingerbread houses, simply snip one of the bottom corners of each bag.

, Each guest will need a space to decorate their gingerbread house, such as a table or countertop. Ideally, they will also have a chair to sit in while they decorate. Place a paper plate at each decorating space. Place the candy decorations in small cups, with each guest having access to a variety of decorating supplies. Right before your guests arrive, place a constructed gingerbread house and icing tube on each plate.


You can create name cards for each guest and place at their decorating space.

, Welcome each guest to the gingerbread decorating party. Show them the space you have set up for gingerbread decorating. If you have decided to use name cards, show each guest to their seat. If you did not utilize name cards, allow each guest to choose a seat or wait until the rest of the guests arrive.

, Since you have already constructed the gingerbread houses, it will be simple to give your guests an orientation to gingerbread decorating. Explain to your guests that the icing serves as glue and will hold the decorations in place on the gingerbread house.


For example, use an icing tube to demonstrate gluing some gingersnap shingles on the roof of your house or a gumdrop post near your gingerbread front door.

, Once your guests have learned how to decorate their gingerbread houses, let them go wild! Encourage creativity and help those who might need some ideas for decorating. A few fun, yet easy decorating ideas include:


Candy cane doors
Gumdrop shingles
Sprinkled sugar snow on the roof
Peppermint candy windows
Candy bar columns
Swedish fish fence

, While everyone is having fun decorating their gingerbread houses, make sure you document the event. Take photos as your guests deck out their gingerbread houses in all the trappings of the season. Make sure you ask guests’ permission before you post the photos on social media. You can also print out photos from the day's festivities and give them to your guests as they leave.

, Allow the gingerbread houses to sit for at least an hour after your guests finish constructing them. Then place the houses in cardboard boxes or plastic containers. Advise your guests to gingerly walk the houses to their vehicles and hold on to them tightly while transporting them to and in the car.

A thick-bottomed pan is always your best bet, as they hold heat much better than thinner pans.
You can also wait to pre-heat the oil until after you've made the dough. However, this can take some time, so starting now is a good idea if you think you can do the dough quickly. If you do, just keep the burner on medium, not high, to prevent burning., Stir it frequently, until everything is well dissolved and the mixture is bubbling nicely.

,, There are a lot of ways to turn your ball of dough into long, delicious churros, and none of them are wrong. Use whatever works for you, making long, thin, cylindrical treats:



Pinch and Roll: The simplest method, simply pull off a 2"" ball of dough and roll it between your hands to form a snake-like shape, roughly 1/2"" thick.

Decorative Piper: Usually used for icing, these have star-shaped tips that will get the ridges found on fairground churros. Pack the dough where the icing goes and then push it through to make perfect, even logs of dough.DIY Decorative Piper: Take a large freezer back and fill it with dough. Then cut the bottom corner off the bag to form a small opening. Squeeze the dough through this whole to make your logs., The total cooking time will depend on how thick the churros are, but you should be able to tell easily when they are done, as the outsides will be an alluring golden brown. Don't put more than 3-4 churros in the pan at once -- too much will drop the temperature of the oil rapidly, leading to greasy churros.








, Set them aside on a plate of paper towels, then lightly pat down the tops with more paper towels to get rid of excess oil.








, You've got your finished churros! Combine them in as much or as little cinnamon sugar as you want -- they'll be delicious either way.









Some people take things a step further by drizzling the finished churros in chocolate sauce, too."

An easy way to do this is to utilize the printed measurements on the butter wrapper. For example, you can cut the butter into 7 equal pieces of 1 tablespoon each by cutting along the tablespoon measurements on the stick of butter., You will be using both milk and butter to make your dough. It is important that both the milk and butter are at room temperature to ensure proper mixing of the ingredients. Leave the following ingredients on your kitchen counter for 30 minutes to bring them to room temperature:2/3 cup (160 mL) whole milk
7 tablespoons unsalted butter

, In order to make chocolate filled donuts, you will need an electric stand mixer or an electric hand mixer. If using a stand mixer, it needs to be fitted with a dough hook attachment. This will ensure that your dough is properly mixed.

, In the bowl of your electric stand mixer or in a large stainless steel bowl, combine the milk and yeast. Stir the two together with a spoon, and let stand until the yeast is completely dissolved. This should take about 1 minute. You will stir together:2/3 cup (160 mL) whole milk
2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast

, Once the yeast has dissolved completely in the milk, it is time to add and mix additional ingredients. Place the flour, sugar, salt, and eggs in the bowl of your electric stand mixer or, if using a hand mixer, in a large stainless steel bowl. Mix on low speed for about 3 minutes. In addition to the milk and dissolved yeast, you will be mixing:3 ½ cups (420 grams) all purpose flour
1/3 cup (65 grams) granulated sugar
2 teaspoons kosher salt
3 eggs

, You will next add the butter, two pieces at a time. Add two pieces and mix on low speed until the two pieces of butter are completely incorporated into the dough. Keep adding the butter two pieces at a time, making sure it is fully incorporated before you add the next pieces. It should take a total of 5-6 minutes to incorporate all 7 tablespoons of butter., Once you have incorporated the butter, remove the bowl of dough from the base of your electric stand mixer. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the donut dough for at least 6 hours, but no more than 15 hours.

, Turn the saucepan on low heat. Stir continuously until the mixture reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit or about 71 degrees Celsius. You will be stirring together:


¾ cup (180 mL) whole milk
2 egg yolks
¼ cup (50 grams) granulated sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

, Once the mixture of milk, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and sugar has reached a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit or 71 degrees Celsius, add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. As you add the cornstarch, turn the heat up to low-medium. Cook for 5-6 minutes until the custard gets very thick. Stir the mixture occasionally as it thickens., Once the filling has reached a custard-like consistency, stir in ¼ cup (40 grams) chocolate chips. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and combined with the filling mixture. The filling should have a pudding-like consistency. Remove from the heat., You will need a piping or pastry bag and metal tip to insert the chocolate filling into the donuts. Scoop the chocolate filling into the piping bag fitted with the metal tip. Place the bag in the refrigerator for 30-45 minutes., Once you form the donuts, you will be placing them on a baking sheet where they will rest until frying. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with nonstick cooking spray. Set the prepared baking sheet aside.

, You will be rolling out dough and forming donuts on a well floured work surface. Your kitchen counter, a large pastry board, or a large cutting board will work well. Lightly dust your work surface with flour, taking care not to pile on too much flour., Remove the donut dough from the refrigerator and place it on your floured work surface. Take your hands and gently roll the dough into a 12 inch or 30 centimeter square. The square should be about ½ inch or 1.27 centimeters thick.

, Using a 3 ½ inch or 9 centimeter round cookie cutter, cut the dough into 9 separate donuts. If you don’t have a round cookie cutter, you can use a cup or glass that is 3 ½ inches or 9 centimeters in diameter. Transfer the donuts to the baking sheet you prepared earlier.

, Once you have transferred the donuts to the prepared baking sheet, you will cover them with a piece of plastic wrap sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Move the baking sheet full of donuts to a warm spot. Allow the donuts to rise in the warm spot until they are pillowy, about 2 to 3 hours., In a small bowl, place 1 cup (200 grams) of granulated sugar. You will be using this sugar to coat the donuts after you fry them. Set the bowl of sugar aside.

, After the donuts rise, you will fry them. After frying the donuts, you will need to place them on an absorbent surface to drain excess oil. Line a large baking sheet with several layers of paper towels. This is where you will place the donuts as you remove them from the oil.

, In a large, heavy bottomed pot, pour about 3 inches, or 7.5 centimeters, of canola oil. Heat the oil to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit or about 177 degrees Celsius. If you do not have a temperature gauge, you can check the temperature by dipping a wooden spoon handle in the oil. If the oil starts to steadily bubble, then it has reached the proper temperature.You can also use a deep fryer to fry your donuts.

, Take 3 donuts at a time and lower them into the hot oil. Fry them for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side. Then carefully turn them over using a slotted spoon and fry for an additional 2 to 3 minutes on the second side. Place the fried donuts on the paper towel-lined baking sheet.The temperature of the oil may fluctuate during cooking, so you will need to use your thermometer to monitor it and adjust accordingly.
The donuts should be golden brown when they are cooked.

, Once the donuts have cooled enough so that you can handle them without burning yourself, you will toss them in the bowl of sugar. Your goal is to coat each donut evenly. Once you have coated each donut, return it to the paper towel-lined baking sheet.

, After you have coated the warm donuts in sugar, let them cool completely. It is important that the donuts are completely cool before you fill them with chocolate. Let the donuts cool for at least 30 to 40 minutes.

, Your chocolate filling should have been chilling for about 30-45 minutes. Once you have refrigerated the filling for this time period, remove it from the refrigerator.

, In order to fill the donuts with chocolate, you will need to create a hole on the side of it. Use the tip attached to the piping or pastry bag. Gently poke a hole in the side of the donut.

, Once you poke a hole in the side of the donut, firmly squeeze the piping or pastry bag. Keep squeezing until you have filled the center of the donut. Serve as soon as they are filled, as chocolate filled donuts are best enjoyed immediately!"

You can begin with a smaller amount of candy and add more as you stir., Set an upside-down colander or block of Styrofoam on the counter. You will use this to hold up the cake pops. Then, place the donut holes onto the paper lollipop sticks. The donut holes should fit snugly and not fall of.You can dip the lollipop sticks into the candy coating first if the donuts do not fit snugly.

, Going one at a time, dip the donut hole into the melted candy. Dip the donut hole until it is completely covered and then remove it quickly. Drip the excess candy over the bowl. You can use a spoon to scrape the excess coating from the bottom of the donut hole., You can choose from toppings like nuts, sprinkles, and or other candies. Don’t add the toppings until all of the donut holes stop dripping, but they should still be wet. Gently roll the cake pops into the toppings. You can spread the toppings out on a baking sheet or tray.You can also choose to sprinkle the topping by hand.

, Put each cake pop back into the colander or Styrofoam. Make sure each cake pop is completely separated and upright. Wait until the coating has hardened to eat or to add a candy coating drizzle. The coating should harden within ten minutes., If the cake pops won’t be eaten immediately, store them in an airtight container. You can store them in the refrigerator, or set them out on the counter. The donut hole cake pops will be good for up to three days.Store the donut holes in the refrigerator instead of on the counter if the temperature in your kitchen stays warm.

Roll the twisted dough in cinnamon and sugar mixture.,
Serve warm, with chocolate dip if desired.",How to Make Churros2," The dough in a ""real"" churro is a little different than the dough in a biscuit, but the basic ingredients are the same and they will cook similarly. It is usually best to use the smaller biscuits, allowing you to more easily fry everything.

If you don't want the fat of biscuit batter, you can use 1 cup hot water and 3-1/4 cups of your favorite all-purpose pancake mix. Blend into a dough and proceed like normal., Churros need to be long and thin in order to really cook nicely. Try to make all the ropes roughly the same diameter for the best results.








, Simply make a rope out of the biscuits by braiding one over the other, When done, pinch both ends together to fuse them. You can also lightly roll the whole thing together to keep the centers together.








, Simply put the dough into a large plastic bag, then snip off the bottom corner with scissors. You can push the dough straight out the bottom of the back in perfect strips.








, Heat until it reached 375F. Make sure there is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of oil in the pan to cover the churros. There should be enough oil so that they float freely while frying, and all sides, except the very top, are being cooked at the same time.









If you don't have an oil thermometer, 375 is when there is barely smoke coming off the top of the oil. Don't let it get much farther than this point.

, Fry for about 2 minutes, or until golden brown. They don't take long, but you can easily see when they are finished by the color on the outsides. Once they look good to eat, they usually are.








, Pat them down with paper towels to remove excess oil, which will make them soggy if it cools on the churro.








, In a separate bowl, mix up 1/2 cup of sugar with a teaspoon of cinnamon. Then roll the warm churros in the mixture to coat them deliciously.








, They are fine on their own or with a delicious chocolate dip. Enjoy!

3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons shortening
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt

",How to Frost a Double Layer Cake," After baking the layers, let them cool to at least room temperature. You may even wish to chill them in the fridge overnight, in order to minimize any chance of the cake crumbling or breaking.If your cake layers came out of the oven domed, consider cooling them upside down to slightly offset this effect. You may need to cut off prominent domes before frosting.;
, A dollop of frosting in the center of the stand will help keep the bottom layer of your cake in place while you assemble and frost it.If you are using a plate, consider placing it on top of a tall, stable surface such as a stack of oversize books. This may give you a better view of the cake during frosting.

, Place the bottom layer on the cake stand or plate, centered evenly. If the stand is wider than the cake, wedge strips of parchment paper around the edge, underneath the cake, to catch spills while you frost., Use a spoon to place enough frosting on this layer to create an even spread at the desired thickness, typically about 1 cup (240 mL) for a 9 inch (23 cm) cake. Use an offset spatula, or an ordinary spatula, to spread the frosting evenly over this layer, hanging over the edge of the cake on all sides. You'll use the overhanging frosting later; you do not need to spread it yet.


Use 1.5 cups (350 mL) for a heavily frosted cake, or as little as 1/3 cup (80 mL) if you prefer only a thin layer of frosting.Be careful with sparse frosting, as it is easy to tear up the surface of the cake and bring crumbs into your frosting layer.

, Press the next layer gently on top of the frosting, then cover with frosting in the same way as the first. Try to use roughly the same amount of frosting for each layer, so your cake has an even appearance once cut. If the layers were cut from one cake after baking, turn the top layer upside down, so the outside surface of the cake is smooth and relatively crumb-free.


Frost the sides of the cake using a piping bag
Continue to use a spoon to transfer the frosting, and a spatula to spread it. Dipping the spatula into the frosting bowl increases the chances of spreading crumbs in your frosting.
If you are making a triple or quadruple layer cake, simply repeat this step until each layer is frosted.

, Spread the frosting dollops leftover from frosting each layer to make a thin, smooth surface. The frosting should cover the entire cake, but only in a thin layer. This is the ""crumb coat,"" preventing crumbs from falling off the cake.Add additional frosting only if there are portions of the cake still dry after spreading. Avoid creating a full, thick spread of frosting on the sides at this point.
You may choose to skip this step if the icing and cake are both dark in color, making crumbs in the frosting less noticeable.

, The ""crumb coat"" of frosting will harden slightly when chilled, sealing in the crumbs more effectively. Chill for 15–30 minutes, or until a finger that touches the frosting comes away clean., Use a final 1–2 cups (240–480 mL) of frosting, or more for a larger cake, to spread a thick layer of frosting around the sides of the cake. You may find it easier to make the layer an even thickness if you focus on 1/4 or 1/8 of the cake at a time, adding frosting as you go.

, If you have a cake scraper, press the edge lightly on the sides of the cake and move it slowly around the cake to create an extra-attractive surface. The top of the cake is more easily smoothed out with your spatula, but consider dipping the tool in a little water first, shaking out the excess drops. The water will soften the frosting slightly, and make it easier to spread smoothly., For more advanced frosting decoration, you'll need a piping bag with a piping tip attachment on the small hole. Fill this with excess frosting, tamping it down near the tip, then twist the top of the bag to keep it closed.


If the frosting isn't tamped down hard enough, air bubbles may cause breaks or splatter when you squeeze.
If you don't own a piping bag, learn how to make your own out of parchment paper or a plastic bag. Homemade piping bags may be flimsy and more difficult to handle, however, and cannot typically be twisted without spilling the frosting.

, If you've never piped frosting before, practice a little on parchment paper first. Grasp a small handful of frosting near the base, separating it from the rest of the frosting-filled bag by twisting the bag. Hold the tip with this hand, and use your other hand to steady your first hand. Hold the piping tip at a 90º angle above the paper, and move it just above the surface as you gently squeeze, getting a feel for how hard you need to squeeze to create an attractive, unbroken design.


Some people find it easier if they grasp the bag with their dominant hand and steady it with their non-dominant hand, while others prefer the other way around.Try out both to see which is more comfortable.

, For the classic ruffled cake border, use any piping tip with a wavy or star shape. Move the piping bag slowly around the circumference of the top layer, while squeezing.

, For more complex piping decorations, consider trying a design on a square of parchment paper. The paper can then be chilled in the refrigerator to make the design less fragile, then the design can be transferred carefully onto the top of the cake.



Make a frosting rose for an impressive, yet classic decoration

, Besides actual sprinkles, you could use chopped nuts, crumbled cookies, or small, soft candies such as jellybeans. For a more striking effect, use dark objects on light colored icing and vice versa.

, Fondant is a special type of icing with a more dough-like consistency. Purchase it at a baking supply store or make it at home, then sculpt it into designs for the top of your cake.

, Small slices of fruit are often arranged on the top of lemon cakes, or cakes with light frosting. You can use an array of brightly colored fruit slices, or decorate more fancifully with strawberry fans.

, Select a paper lace pattern, or an old lace doily, and lay it over the center of your cake. Use a sifter or sieve to sprinkle powdered sugar or cocoa powder over the cake, then lift up the lace pattern to witness the results.

, For a cake that is 9 inches (22.9 cm) in diameter, you will need a cup or so of confectioner's sugar. You can always mix up more if you need it.









Do not use granulated sugar, as it is not fine enough, and will result in a grainy-textured icing.
Other sugars, such as brown sugar, are also not acceptable to use in icing.

, Pour a teaspoon of boiling water over the sugar, and stir the water with the sugar until it reaches a smooth, spreadable consistency.









If you find the icing too thick or lumpy after the first teaspoon of water has been stirred in, add another teaspoon of water. Keep stirring and adding tiny amounts of water till you get the right consistency.
If you add too much water and the icing becomes runny, add more confectioner's sugar.If it's slightly too runny, add a little more icing sugar.

, If you wish to customize your icing to a certain color or flavor, add a few drops of food coloring and flavoring. Stir them in thoroughly, and continue adding color and flavor until the icing has reached the color and taste that you desire.









Vanilla, almond, hazelnut, peppermint, and other flavored extracts are popular choices. These can be purchased at many grocery stores, and even large selections are offered at baking stores.
Be careful not too add too much, since a little color and flavor go a long way. Add two or three drops, stir it in, and taste and look at before you decide to add more.

",How to Frost a Layer Cake," The cake needs to be completely cool before you frost it. You can let it cool at room temperature or you can cool the unfrosted cake layers in the refrigerator.









Consider cooling the cake layers upside-down. Doing so can help flatten out the top, so it will be easier for you to deal with domes and your cake will look neater when all is said and done.
Remove the layers of cake from the cake pans before chilling them.
The best way to chill your cake is to wrap the layers in plastic wrap and place them in the refrigerator overnight. If you do not have enough time for that, though, you can wrap the cake layers in plastic wrap and place them in the refrigerator for two to three hours.Refrigerated chilling is more thorough and preferred over room temperature cooling.
A cooled cake is far easier to work with than a warm cake. A warm cake can cause the frosting to melt as you work with it, and your finished product will look much messier if you are working with melted frosting.;
, It is a fairly typical practice among home bakers to slice each cake layer into two even halves using a serrated knife. This is not an essential step, however.









If you decide to split each layer in half, set the cake layer down flat on the counter. Hold the top down gently with one hand and use your other hand to gently cut the round in half from the side. Turn the cake as you lightly saw away with your serrated knife. You should saw 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the side all the way around the cake before slicing straight through the center.Thin layers like these need to be moved with cardboard cake rounds or rimless baking sheets. Do not use your hands since the cake layers are more likely to break apart if you do.
Note, however, that if you do not divide the layers in half, you can usually use your hands to move those thicker layers around.

, If any of your layers have a “domed” top, you need to use a serrated knife to slice away that dome and create a flat, even top surface.









Cut away the dome the same way that you would cut a layer in half. Place the layer flat on the counter with the dome facing up. Hold the cake steady by placing one hand on top of it and use your other hand to gently saw away the dome with a serrated knife. Shave off as little as possible.

, Most frostings should be prepared and used at room temperature. Whipped cream based frostings should be refrigerated, though.









If the frosting is cold when you use it, it will end up being stiff and harder to spread. When frosting is difficult to spread, it tends to cling to both the cake and the spatula, and as a result, chunks of cake can be yanked out from the side or top as you spread the frosting on., Spoon out 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of frosting onto the center of your cake platter.









This initial dollop of frosting acts as a sort of ""glue"" that holds the cake in place as you frost it, transport it, and serve it.
You could also use a cake board instead of a plate. Cut the board so that it is the exact same size as the cake.
If you have the cake board or plate on a stand, secure it to the stand by placing a few loops of tape beneath the board or plate.

, Cut four strips of wax paper or parchment paper. Arrange them so that they form a square around the center dollop of frosting on the platter.









The wax paper is used to keep the platter clean as you frost the cake. As such, the paper strips need to overlap with one another and they need to be large enough to cover the bottom perimeter of the cake once you place the cake on top of your platter.
These strips of paper will be removed after you finish decorating the cake.

, Place the first layer of cake onto the prepared cake platter. The bottom center of the cake should line up with the dollop of frosting you spread on the plate earlier, and there should be wax paper underneath the entire bottom perimeter of the layer.









Note that the flat bottom of your cake must sit on the stand.
If you cut your layers in half, place the cut side of the cake down on the plate.

, Add a hearty glob of frosting to the top of the first layer. Spread it over the entire top surface using a spatula, covering the surface evenly but leaving a slight lip along the outside edge.









Use roughly 1 to 1.5 cups (250 to 375 ml) of frosting.Place the frosting in the middle of the layer and spread it out toward the edges.
The added lip of frosting will help hold in any additional filling you decide to add, but even if you decide not to add other filling, this excess is still helpful since it will help you frost the sides of the cake.
Consider placing the frosting on the cake using a spoon and spreading it with your cake spatula. Doing so can prevent crumbs from the spatula from tainting the primary bowl of frosting.

, If you plan on adding any filling other than frosting, like jam, fudge, or butterscotch, spread the filling over your initial layer of frosting. Only spread the frosting as far as the outer lip of the frosting and not over that lip.









Only pour 1/2 cup (125 ml) to 3/4 cup (190 ml) filling onto the center of the frosting.Use the back of a clean spoon or separate spatula to spread the filling out toward the frosting barrier or lip.

, Center the second layer of cake directly over the first layer. Keep the edges as even as possible.









Gently press down on the top layer to secure it onto the first.
It may help to step back and look at the cake from a bit of a distance to ensure that the layers are evenly aligned.
If you cut your layers in half, the cut-side should always face down when you stack it onto the previous layer.

, If you plan on adding more layers of cake, spread frosting and filling over the second layer before adding a third. Repeat this pattern until you reach the final layer, but do not spread frosting or filling over the top layer.









Use the same amount of frosting to coat additional layers as you used when covering the top layer.

, After all the layers have been assembled, you need to spread a thin coating of frosting over the top of the cake and around the sides. This coating of frosting will trap the crumbs along the rough surface of the cake, which is why it is commonly referred to as a “crumb coating.”









It is perfectly acceptable for the cake to show through the crumb layer. The only thing you need to accomplish with this layer is locking in the crumbs. The frosting itself does not need to look neat or smooth.

, Place the cake in the refrigerator or freezer long enough for the crumb coating to chill and harden slightly.









Usually, you can set the crumb coat by chilling it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Check the frosting with your finger before pulling it out of the refrigerator. If it feels sticky, let it cool for a longer period.

, Add the remainder of your frosting to the top and sides of the cake, distributing it as evenly as possible with your spatula.









Apply frosting generously. Too much can be scraped off without much difficulty, but if you start off with too little frosting, you increase the risk of catching crumbs, even with a protective crumb coating.
It can help if you visually divide the cake into quarters. Frost the sides one quarter at a time, focusing on a smaller area rather than the larger perimeter.
Turn the cake as you frost the sides so that no one side is any more difficult to frost than the others.
You can frost the top of the cake in the same way you frosted the top of each layer. Place the frosting in the center and use your spatula to push it out toward the edges.
Do not expect your initial application to look smooth on all sides.
As you spread the final coating of frosting onto the cake, dip the spatula into warm water in between strokes. Shake off the excess before continuing to frost the cake. A little excess moisture can keep your strokes smoother and cleaner.If you are nervous about using water, you should at least wipe off excess crumbs and frosting from the spatula in between strokes.

, Hold the icing spatula at a slight angle and pass it around the sides of the cake. Doing so should smooth out any uneven patches of frosting.









If you have a separate scraper, use it. If not, clean off your frosting spatula and use that.
You might need to smooth the frosting out using several passes. Use gentle pressure for each pass, scraping away excess frosting little by little, until you achieve the smoothness you want to see.
If you want to make the frosting extremely smooth, finish up the smoothing process by dipping the spatula into warm water, shaking off the excess, and passing the moist edge over the frosting. A hint of moisture can help smooth the final outer layer.

, The cake is already frosted at this point. If you want to add other decorations to the cake, now is the time to do so.








, After you finish decorating the cake, carefully slide the strips of wax paper or parchment paper out from beneath the bottom. Your cake is now ready to show off.

Let your cake cool.,
Make the cake flat.,
Set up the cake.,
Add the crumb coat.",How to Frost a Cake1," The biggest mistake you can make when frosting your cake is using a hot cake and cold frosting. If your cake is even slightly warm, it will melt the icing which will then run over the edges and soak into the top layer, making it soggy. Further, if you use cold frosting it won’t be smooth enough to spread and will bring up a lot of crumbs.

Always wait for both your cake and your frosting to reach room temperature. This may take several hours of waiting, but is necessary for a completely smooth cover of frosting.
If you are leaving your cake to cool on the counter, place a slice of regular sandwich bread on the top of the cake. This will keep it moist and protect it from going stale.;
, When you baked your cake, likely the center rose into a small dome. While this is perfectly normal, it prevents your cake from having a completely smooth layer of frosting as the dome will eventually lead the frosting to slide towards the sides. To keep this from happening, use a serrated edge knife (cake knife preferably) to slice a thin layer horizontally off the top of the cake, so that the top and bottom of the cake run parallel to each other.

When possible, cut the top layer of the cake off while the cake is still in the pan. This will help you to get a more level surface.
If you are making a layered cake, cut the top layer off of all the layers of cake you will be using.

, When your cake is cooled and cut to size, prepare it for frosting by placing it on a round piece of cardboard or cake bottom. Add strips of wax paper about 2” thick to the edges of the cake along the bottom. When you finish frosting the cake, the wax paper will be removed and reveal a smooth bottom. It is easiest to frost your cake on a spinning cake stand, which are available at most kitchen, craft, and cooking stores.

Get your cake frosting tools, including an offset spatula and bench scraper to smooth the icing. Don’t use a knife or rubber spatula, as these may be easy to use but will not give the desired smooth frosting you’re looking for.
If you want, you can use a piping bag with a smooth frosting attachment to add the first layer of frosting. You can also add different tips to the piping bag afterwards to add decoration to your cake as well.

, The crumb coat is a rough layer of frosting that is used to seal in the crumbs so that your frosting can be smoothed easily. To add the crumb coat, use an offset spatula and spread a thick layer of your room temperature frosting to the top and sides of your cake.

As you spread the frosting over the cake, move the spatula in the same direction (rather than back and forth) so that any loose crumbs are tucked under the frosting rather than brought to the surface.
Keep your spatula from ever touching the cake to minimize the chance of crumbs getting stuck to it and appearing at the surface of your frosting.
Place the crumb-coated cake in the fridge for at least thirty minutes before adding additional layers of frosting."

",How to Ice a Cake2," You may choose round or square cakes, but it's important that the dimensions be exactly the same. Allow the cakes to cool completely.

, Since the cake will be unwieldy once it is layered and iced, it's best to use the same plate on which you plan to serve the cake.

, Hold the knife parallel to the brim of the cake and slice about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) off the top. Be careful to slice straight across, holding the knife level as you go.









Try to create a flat, even surface. This will serve as a base for the second layer.
Remove the rounded top of the cake and discard it, or save it to eat.
Don't attempt to cut off the top of the cake with a small knife, as this will result in an uneven surface.

, Spoon the filling of your choice onto the bottom layer of the cake. Use the spoon or a knife to spread it around until it covers the entire layer.









Raspberry, lemon curd, cream, or chocolate are popular cake fillings.
Try not to let the filling drip over the edges, since you don't want it to mix with the icing.

, The flat side of the second layer should be down, and the rounded side should be the top of the cake.









If you want the finished cake to have a flat surface instead of a domed one, repeat the process of slicing off the rounded top of the second layer with a serrated knife. Place the cut side down, so that the smooth, flat bottom of the second layer forms the top of the cake.
Use a paper towel to wipe away filling that squeezes out when you add the second layer.

, For a professional-looking cake, you'll be adding two layers of icing, starting with a ""crumb coat"" that serves as a base to catch all the crumbs, so the second layer looks clean and crumb-free. Use the recipe above or your own icing recipe to ice the cake with a butter knife.









The crumb coat needn't have flavor or color, unless you'd like it to. You can use plain white icing.
Be sure to ice the entire cake, including the sides. Take care not to get too much filling mixed in with the icing.
It's OK if the crumb coat doesn't look perfect - the point is simply to cover the entire cake and trap in the crumbs.
Allow the crumb coat to set for half an hour before continuing.

, Using the recipe above or your own icing recipe, ice the cake once more with a final pretty layer.









If desired, add flavor and color to the batch of icing you use for the final layer.

This will create a lovely marbled or feathered appearance to the top of your cake., Use your traditional cake piping bag with different tips to add pretty designs to the top of your cake. You can create a repetitive pattern, writing, or small shapes with a piping bag. If you don’t have a piping bag, try using a traditional ziploc bag with the tip cut off., Purchase or make your own colored fondant - a sugar based dough-like frosting that can be shaped and spread for seamless application. Coat your entire cake in a layer of fondant, or use it to form small figures and details to place on top of your cake., Once you have completely frosted your cake, add fresh flowers for a fresh appearance. Fresh flowers give the appearance of a lot of effort, but are an incredibly simple addition to your cake., You can choose to use real ribbons for a satiny look or create strips of ribbon out of fondant to add to the border. Ribbons are especially effective on a cake with several tiers, such as a wedding cake."

, Drop about 2-3 drops of food coloring gel into the frosting. Feel free to add more drops to make a deeper shade. This will not be needed for food gel, however, since food gel is more vibrant makes the color much brighter.

, Use a spoon and stir the frosting and dye together. The color of the food dye you added should start to appear. If you want to make it darker, use more gel or food coloring. Thoroughly stir the dye so the color mixes in evenly. You may use a blender, especially if you are making homemade frosting.

, Use your food coloring for cupcakes, cakes, brownies, cookies, and more. The color of your frosting can match with themes, parties, celebrations, and holidays. Be creative! Store the frosting for later use by wrapping with plastic wrap and leaving in the fridge.

Decide on how you wish to decorate the egg.,
Prepare the workspace.,
To make a simple fondant egg, take the fondant and roll it out to 5mm (0.19"") thick.,
If you wish to color the fondant, either buy it colored or knead food coloring into the fondant until the color is consistent throughout it.,
Prepare the Easter egg molds.,
Press the fondant gently into the Easter egg molds.,
Allow the eggs to dry until completely set.,
Place the two halves together to check for a good fit.,
Glue the two sides using royal icing.,
Decorate the sugar eggs.,
At this stage, the eggs are finished as a simple decoration.,
Use the sugar eggs as a decoration and/or gifts.",How to Make Sugar Easter Eggs1," Some decorative styles will require additional sculpting tools. If so, these tools are very similar to clay sculpting tools, but are made of food-safe plastic. They can be purchased from the cake decorating supplier as well.

Read up on the decorating with fondant, as the tools will often have simple instructions that give you an idea of the different effects you can make with the tool on the sugar egg.;
, Your tools, hands and surfaces should be spotless to prevent dust from contaminating the fondant, as any marks will make it appear dirty., This thickness should be consistent across the fondant that will be used for the Easter egg.
, For rich colors, look for color pastes rather than liquid types, as too much liquid will make the fondant too soft to form the egg shape. Read ""How to Color Fondant"" for more information.

Note that by kneading it so it is not consistent, you can achieve a marble effect, but be aware that this takes a lot of practice and technique to make it look attractive rather than just messy.

, Clean and thoroughly dry the egg mold and gently dust it with a tiny amount of cornflour to prevent sticking.
, Trim the edges so they are as neat and flat as possible. In practice, this is just like lining a pie tray with pastry. Repeat for each Easter egg being made –- two halves for each whole sugar egg; the amount will depend on your mold size.
, Tap the sides gently and listen to the sound it makes -- if it sounds hollow or like ceramic then it is sufficiently dried.

Once dried, the egg half should tip out easily. If it sticks, it's not fully dried yet, so give it a little more time. Humidity should be avoided.

, Hold the halves together and look for any large gaps or rough areas. Don't worry too much about the smaller gaps, as most can be filled with royal icing, but large gaps over 5mm (0.19"") will be much harder to disguise (see tips section).

If you're making more than one, try different halves together to get the optimal fit between all halves.

, Place the royal icing into a piping bag. Pipe right around the edge of each egg half, removing anything the dribbles off the edge. Then, press the egg halves together gently and remove excess icing that oozes out.

Remember, the smoother the fit, the better the end result. Allow the eggs to rest and dry; you can put the egg back into one side of the molds to act as a support.





If you wanted to hang the sugar eggs, insert a suitable small stainless steel hook or a loop of ribbon into the icing seal at the top of the egg while the icing is still wet. Larger eggs require hooks with internal supports to share the weight, so only use ribbon for very small sugar eggs.
If you wanted to include a toy or a surprise inside the egg, add it at this stage, and then seal it up.

, When dry, pipe small decorative shells or small balls evenly across the seal to disguise it. Doing this will act as a frame to any decorative additions that you may want to use. It will also strengthen the hook or ribbon loop.
, If you wish to decorate them further, allow them to fully dry for another 24 hours, then try some of the following suggestions:

Pipe words or a picture onto the eggs.
Using a very clean small drill, carve a ""window"" hole or pattern into the dried fondant.
Paint using food coloring. Liquids resemble watercolors and pastes resemble oil/acrylic paints.
Using a glue made of icing thinned with a little water or pasteurized egg white (it should reach a thin, paste-like consistency), decoupage a photo or paper on. Small paper cake decorations featuring chicks, bunnies, spring themes, etc., are all ideal. As this can add to the drying time it's better to make these eggs well in advance.
Use ribbons or other decorative add-ons.

, Your completed eggs can be used as a table centerpiece, as a gift, decoration or as a symbolic gift at baby showers. They can last for decades if stored well!"

Make sure the top of the cake is level before you begin. Frost the top and sides of your cake with a buttercream frosting of your choice.Using an all-butter buttercream will help the fondant stick to your cake and can hide imperfections in the baked cake.
You may want to place the cake on a lazy susan so you can frost it while rotating it.;
, Move the frosted cake to the fridge for 15 to 20 minutes. The buttercream frosting should set up so the surface is firm and easy to work with. Just make sure you have enough space in your refrigerator to set the cake so that things in your fridge don't bump or jostle the cake.If you live in a warm climate or it's a hot time of year, you may need to refrigerate your cake longer. Keep it in the refrigerator until the frosting has hardened a little and your finger doesn't leave an impression when you touch it.

, Take your ready-made fondant icing and knead it with your hands till it's pliable like a dough. Dust your work surface with cornstarch or powdered sugar and set the fondant on it. Use a heavy rolling pin and roll the fondant out in all directions. Lift up the fondant every few turns to make sure it's not sticking to your work surface. If it is, scatter a little more cornstarch or powdered sugar. Continue rolling until you reach the size you need for your cake.Always roll more fondant than you'll actually put on your cake. For example, for a double-layered 8"" cake, you'll need to roll out 2 1/2 pounds of fondant, but will only use 1 1/2 pounds.
If you notice tiny air bubbles, carefully pop them using a needle or pin.
Kneading is important to break down sugar crystals in the fondant which will give it a smooth texture.

, Remove your frosted cake from the refrigerator and spray it all over with fresh water. This will help the fondant stick to the cake and keep it from drying out. Gather up your thinly rolled fondant by holding a light rolling pin or long cylinder a few inches above the center of your fondant. Use your other hand and carefully drape half of the fondant over the rolling pin so it drapes down onto the other side.You could also lift and transfer the fondant with your hands, but you risk tearing the fondant by handling it more.
Using a rolling pin or cylinder will also ensure that the cornstarch side remains on the bottom. This way, the shiny side will be exposed on the top and sides of your cake.

, Hold the rolling pin with fondant over the center of your cake and lower it towards the cake. Unroll the fondant off the rolling pin so it gradually falls across the entire cake.The fondant should cover the top and extend down and past the sides of the cake.

, Use a plastic fondant smoother tool and gently rub or buff the sides of the cake covered in fondant. Apply gentle pressure as you work around the entire side of the cake. This will smooth out any irregularities in the fondant while helping it stick to the cake.It may help to have the cake on a lazy suzan while you smooth the sides of the cake.

, Take a sharp pizza cutter and trim the fondant along the base of the cake. Be sure to leave a very little bit of an edge (about 1/4"") so you can make sure you have enough fondant on the sides of the cake. Smooth the sides of the cake again and re-trim the bottom, cutting right along the base of the cake this time.Take this time to check over the cake for any air bubbles. If you find them, pop them with pins or a fine needle. Use your finger to gently smooth out the mark left by the pin.

, Pinch off a few coin-sized pieces of fondant and set them on a sheet of wax paper. Set one ball of fondant on the end of another sheet of wax paper and fold the opposite end of paper over the ball. Squish the ball with the wax paper and use your finger to smooth out one tip of the squished fondant. This will make the tip of your rose petal. Do this for all the balls to make petals. To assemble the rose, roll one petal into a cylinder and begin applying the petals to the base of the cylinder till you shape a rose.The more pieces you use, the more petals you'll make. Roll each piece into a ball.

, Buy a lace stencil from any craft supply or cake supply store. Roll out your fondant into a large rectangle so that it's thin. Set the stencil over your fondant. Use a small rolling pin to firmly press against the fondant while you roll across the stencil. Remove the stencil. You should see the appearance of the lace impressed on the fondant.The thinner you roll the fondant, the more delicate the lace will appear.
Make sure your stencil stays in place as you roll the fondant or the lace pattern will blur.

, Roll fondant into a rectangular shape so it's 1/8"" thin and cut it into short strips. Each one of these strips will make a loop in the bow so cut as many as you'd like. Take a strip and fold it over so you can pinch the ends. Set the loop aside to dry for a few days. Do this for all of your strips. To assemble the bow, squirt a little melted chocolate or royal icing on a piece of wax paper. Set the loops into this edible glue, turning some loops on their sides. Continue placing all the loops until your loops resemble a bow. Let the bow dry overnight.If the ends of a strip won't pinch together, moisten an end with a little water. This time, the strip should stay together.
Add more melted chocolate or royal icing if you make multiple rows of loops in your bow.

, Roll out your fondant till it's the thickness you want. Take a cookie cutter in the shape you'd like to make and stamp down into your fondant. Repeat this until you've cut as many shapes as you like.


You can use a variety of shapes or try using one shape, but making different colors.
You can also buy specially designed fondant cutters that are more detailed than traditional cookie cutters.

, Dip a toothpick into icing color of your choice. Dab the toothpick onto your fondant before you roll it out. Knead the fondant until the icing color is evenly distributed and the color is uniform. Go back and add more icing color if you want a brighter color. Remember that some colors (pink and violet) will fade under fluorescent lights and in sunlight.To create a marbled look, dab the toothpick with icing color onto the fondant. Hold the fondant with both hands.Twist and knead the fondant only a little, so that the colors marble.

, If you're making your fondant decorations even a little in advance, they may droop or fall by the time you're ready to serve the cake. To remove the moisture that causes this drooping, let your decorations dry in at least overnight (or up to 2 days) in a muffin tin.If you don't like the idea of drying and storing your fondant decorations, consider using gum paste instead of fondant. Gum paste is easier to use when rolling out flowers and they'll store longer without drooping.

, Depending on the shape of your decoration, you may be able to insert it and apply it using buttercream. For example, if you have balls of fondant that you want to apply to the base of your cake, pipe a row of buttercream and press the balls into the frosting to anchor them. Or if you're working with thinly rolled decorations, you can brush the backs with water and apply them directly to the fondant covered cake.For example, if you're applying stamped fondant decorations, brush the backs with water using a pastry brush. Immediately position them onto your cake so they dry onto the fondant of the cake.

Gather the fondant and knead it until it becomes smooth.,
Shape the balls of fondant into solid egg shapes about the size of a large grape and keep it covered with cling film.,
Using a small skewer, fork or toothpick, dip the eggs into the cooled melted chocolate and twirl or turn the egg very gently in the air above the bowl to coat.,
When the chocolate has set, it will no longer be as glossy and a thin coating will not take long at all.,
Alternate Method: If soft fondant is not to your household's taste, buy small ordinary hollow chocolate Easter eggs and prepare some buttercream icing from one of the recipes in or according to your own recipe, (marshmallow is another good filling).",How to Make Sugar Easter Eggs2," If you wish to flavor the fondant, you can knead in flavorings to taste (such as cocoa powder, instant coffee powder, custard powder, etc).
, You can press the fondant into small egg molds (dusted with cornflour as per above fondant egg method) for a neat finish, but this does take much longer as you will need to have two sides of the mold to press the fondant into shape. Cover it with cling film and refrigerate until firm (approximately 1-2 hours)., Allow the excess to drip off. Keep twirling the egg gently until it has just set.

The cold fondant and the cooler melted chocolate means it will set faster, but if the chocolate is too cold, it will provide a really thick coating. It is recommended to have the chocolate warm enough to give a thin coating just to cover.

, Place onto a tray lined with baking parchment and store in a cool place. If you quickly dip and then place the egg directly on a tray, the chocolate will run and set flat on one side and will not look as neat.

These can be decorated when chocolate is still soft by rolling them in crushed toasted nuts or dessicated coconut (or even dusted with cocoa powder or grated chocolate). Alternatively, when they are cold, you can also pipe decorations as per the previous method if desired, or cover with gold or silver leaf. If you wish to go further, you can double dip into a different colored chocolate by melting white chocolate with a little powdered food coloring.






, Carefully carve a small hole on the base of the egg using a sharp knife or a warmed skewer large enough to fit a piping nozzle into. Fill a piping bag or a large syringe with buttercream and fill the egg until full and then seal with a little melted chocolate to plug the hole.

Skilled artisans can 3/4 fill the egg with white buttercream, then pipe the remainder with a yellow buttercream to make an egg white and yolk.
The buttercream eggs can be messy things to eat, but chocolate and buttercream is usually win-win (except for for the diet...). For adult-only eggs, a little liqueur added to the cream is a popular touch.
These are best made the same day that they are eaten.

Less is best because you only want the sugar to be wet enough to stick together, not too wet or it won't hold it's shape in the mold., Clean them and sprinkle a little cornflour to prevent sticking.
, Make sure the sugar mixture is pressed to an even thickness across the mold, about 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) (6.35mm to 12.7mm) thick. Don't make it any thicker or it will be too hard to eat and there won't be room inside it to make the egg hollow., This is to ensure that they will fit together with ease. Leave them to dry for 24 hours at least. As with the fondant eggs, when they're dry they should slip out of the mold easily.,"

, Draw it across the surface as far as it will go.


Avoid digging into the fondant. This can introduce unwanted pockets of air, which can leave bubbles in the fondant.

, Keep rolling until the color has been evenly distributed.


For a marbled effect, stop when the surface looks streaked or striped.






If you want your fondant darker, just add more color. It's best to start with a little, and increase if needed.

Choose a coloring type.,
Be aware of a few issues with some colors:

Daffodil Yellow is an all natural food coloring and does not contain yellow #5.",How to Color Fondant4," There is a wide variety of possible colorings for use with fondant, including:


Paste colors - only use a tiny quantity as this is very concentrated
Gel colors - this is a strong color and it's easy to use
Powder colors - this needs to be dissolved in liquid before use to avoid undissolved pieces showing in the fondant
Liquid colors - use cake decorating versions to ensure nice consistency
Lustres - for adding a sheen.

, (Many people are allergic to this). Daffodil Yellow currently contains alcohol which all other colors do not have present.






Leaf Green is a brighter green with more yellow than Kelly Green. Both of these greens require very little color, how much color added depends on the tone of the green you want.






When icing is colored deep red, a bitter aftertaste may be detected. Red No-Taste should be used when a large portion of red coloring is used on the cake. Red No-Taste does not contain red 3 which causes the bitter taste.






Rose paste color will obtain hot pink with good results. Rose Petal is a soft, muted rose color. Pink is a traditional pastel with a slight yellow tone.

Refresh the gum paste.,
Use a toothpick to get the coloring from the container.,
Apply food coloring to the gum paste.,
Don a pair of gloves.,
Knead the color into the paste.,
Get the right color.",How to Add Color to Gum Paste2,", Gum paste will begin to harden if exposed to air. Keep unused portions in a sealable bag or air-tight container to retain moisture.

, After you take it from the container, the gum paste may be stiff. Knead it in your hands a few times to make it soft again.

, Dip 1 end of the toothpick into the food coloring. This covers the tip of the pick and allows you to apply little bits of color at a time.

, Wipe the toothpick against the paste, transferring the color. Roll the toothpick to get the coloring off all its sides.

, A pair of kitchen or latex gloves will prevent the color from staining your hands., Use your palms and fingers to work the color into the gum paste. Continue kneading until the color is uniform throughout. This will take some time to achieve a solid color.

, If the color is too dark, you can knead in more untinted gum paste to lighten the shade. Add more food coloring as needed to darken the color of the gum paste. Add color a little at a time to make sure you get the color you want. Since gum paste decorations are mainly intended to be looked at and not eaten, as much coloring as is desired for even the deepest colors can be used. Use a new toothpick each time you need to get more coloring from the jar.

"
"
Make paint to color your gum paste.,
Use a small brush to paint the color on selected areas.",How to Add Color to Gum Paste3," Pour water, vodka or gin onto a small plate or rimmed lid totaling the amount of paint you think you will need. Alcohols that do not contain sugar may be chosen because they evaporate more quickly than water. Sugary liquors like rum should not be used because the sugar content makes the gum paste soft and gooey. Using a fresh toothpick, withdraw the desired amount of food coloring paste from the jar and stir it into the liquid. The thicker you mix the ""paint,"" the darker the paint will be. Lighter colors come from thinner paint, but thinner paint can bleed over into undesired areas.

, For better success using colors right next to each other or layering colors, wait for the previous color to dry somewhat before applying the next one.

Traditional pastry brushes are made from natural bristles.
Newer pastry brushes are made from nylon bristles.
The newest kind of pastry brushes are made from silicone.;
, Pastry brushes can be used for a variety of tasks in the kitchen:


Use to put an egg wash, sugar glaze, salt glaze, or melted butter on pastry.
Use to add fat before assembling phyllo dough.
Use to add a glaze to meats and fish.
Add delicate glazes to cakes and cookies.
Use for candy-making. Such brushes should not be used for any other purpose to avoid tainting candy and chocolate with grease from other foods.

, Natural bristle and nylon bristle brushes can be harder to keep clean than silicone versions. However, they must be cleaned regularly to prevent the growth of bacteria on the fat attached to the bristles after basting.


Dip natural or nylon bristle pastry brushes into bleach solution after washing.Wash silicone pastry brushes with hot water and detergent. Or, simply throw it into the dishwasher.

, Do not put away wet; oily is okay provided the brush has been washed properly.

, Punch it down to remove the gas build up from the yeast, and roll the dough to be about ¼ of an inch thick.

, Start by making the dough into a large rectangle, and then cutting along the diagonals to form small triangles. Try to keep them less than three inches wide on their longest side.

, Fill a pot or pan with enough cooking oil to cover the sopapilla completely. It needs to reach about 400 degrees to be hot enough to fry the dough.

, Fry multiple sopapillas at once to quicken the time it takes to make them all.

, This should take about one minute per side, but the time is variable so watch them carefully.

, Place them on paper towels over a wire rack to drain off excess oil.

, These will need to be fried, not baked, so pour oil into a pan and heat to 400 degrees. You will need to pour a bit more oil that you would for regular sopapillas, as these will take up more space because of the filling.

, Flatten the dough so it is thin but without holes, and then cut it into circles between 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) in diameter.

, For these, you can use nearly any filling imaginable. For a savory sopapilla, fill the dough with rice, beans, and meat. For a sopapilla that can be eaten for dessert, try using a pie filling or chocolate chips.

, Thoroughly close the edges of the dough around the filling by rolling them in slightly and then pinching them tightly. It is very important the edges be closed to not leak filing into your frying oil and create a big mess.

, Place each into the hot oil, waiting 1-2 minutes on each side for the sopapilla to turn golden brown. Fry as many at once as the pan size will allow.

, Place them onto a wire rack covered in paper towels to allow the excess oil to drain off. Allow time to cool, at least ten minutes.

, Although your sopapillas are filled, you can choose to add more on top as well. For a savory sopapilla, top with cheese or salsa. A dessert sopapilla can rolled in more cinnamon and sugar or sprinkled with powdered sugar."

Place each finished sheet of phyllo on top of each other on a well-floured baking sheet.,
Repeat until your 7 - 10 layers are fully stacked.,
Enjoy.",How to Make Phyllo Dough," Use a paddle attachment if possible.;
, Don't worry if they don't mix just quite yet. Add the water, oil, and vinegar mixture to the flour,.


Keeping the paddle attachment mixing on low speed.







, Mix just long enough for all the ingredients to come together. Add more water if dough is too dry.

, The hook attachment of the mixer will simulate kneading, which is essential for phyllo dough to develop good elasticity.


If you don't have a stand mixer and wish to knead the dough by hand — God bless you — get ready to knead for approximately 20 minutes., While kneading, pick the dough ball up and throw it down on the counter several times to help push out any trapped air.

,


Once coated, set aside in a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Wait for at least 30 minutes and as much as 2 hours for the dough to set. You'll get better results (i.e. the dough will be easier to work with) the longer you let is rest.







, Starting with nearly 3 cups of should give you 6 - 10 separate balls of dough. The bigger the ball to begin with, the larger the rolled sheets of phyllo will end up being.


While you are rolling one piece of dough, remember to keep the other pieces of dough covered so that they do not dry out while you are rolling.

, Dowels work great for making phyllo; their thin profiles make rolling very easy, and their length means that you can work on a large sheet of dough all at once. For the first couple of inches, roll the dough much like you would a pizza dough, trying to maintain a circular shape.


While rolling, be sure to use ample flour or cornstarch. You pretty much can't over-flour the dough during the rolling phase.

, Place the dowel slightly above the bottom of the dough. Wrap the dough around the top of the dowel so that part of the dowel is completely covered in dough. With both hands on either side of the dough, roll the dowel back and forth to thin out the dough.

, Rotate the dough 90°, flour it lightly, and repeat the rolling process.

,, Almost like working with a pizza, use both hands to very carefully stretch apart the sides of the dough, making sure to rotate the dough in your hands.


This will create the thinnest possible dough for the amateur baker. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to get the dough as thin as you might in the store.
Your dough will occasionally rip as you handle it and stretch it even farther apart. Don't worry about these small rips. As long as the piece of phyllo you put on top is without blemish, you'll never notice them in the final product.

, If you want your dough to be extra-crispy, consider brushing on either oil or melted butter between each layer. If you prefer your phyllo a little chewy, leave as is.

, You can increase the bulk of your phyllo by cutting the dough in half and stacking it on top. Dough can be kept frozen and saved for later use.

, Use your phyllo to make spanakopita, baklava, or even an apple pie with phyllo subbed in for pastry dough.

Cover the processor and pulse the dry ingredients to combine them.If you don't have a food processor, you can make the rugelach dough in a mixing bowl. Just whisk the dry ingredients together.;
, Cut 8 ounces (226 g) of cold cream cheese and 1 cup (230 g) of cold unsalted butter into cubes. Add them to the dry ingredients in your food processor. Cover the processor with the lid and pulse the mixture 10 to 12 times. The cream cheese and butter should turn into large crumbles as they mix with the flour and salt.If you're using a mixing bowl instead of a food processor, let the butter and cream cheese soften. Use an electric mixer to combine them with the flour and salt.

, Place one egg yolk into a small bowl and beat it with 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Pour it into the butter and flour mixture in the food processor. Cover the processor with the lid and turn it on. Let the processor run until the rugelach dough starts to clump together.If you're using an electric mixer, just beat the egg yolk and vanilla into the butter and flour mixture until the dough starts pulling away from the sides of your mixing bowl.

, Dump the dough mixture onto a counter or work space. Use your hands to form the dough into one large ball. Take a sharp knife and carefully cut the dough into four equal parts. Shape each portion into a 1-inch (2.5 cm) disk and wrap each of them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for a minimum of 2 hours.You can chill the dough for up to three days or freeze them for up to three months. If you freeze the dough, thaw it in the fridge before you roll it out and fill the rugelach.

, If you'd like a decadent chocolate filling, finely chop 6 ounces (170 g) of bittersweet chocolate and place it in a mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon of light brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder. Stir the mixture to make the chocolate filling.To save time, you could substitute the bittersweet chocolate with miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips that you don't need to finely chop.

, For a crunchy nut filling, blitz 1 cup (125 g) of walnuts and 1 cup (125 g) of pecans in a food processor until they're finely chopped. Transfer the nuts to a mixing bowl and stir them with the remaining nut filling ingredients. You'll need to add:1/4 cup (55 g) of melted butter
1/4 cup (85 g) of honey
1/4 cup (50 g) of granulated sugar
1 teaspoon of vanilla

, For a traditional apricot filling, you can simply warm jam and stir in dried fruit. To make any flavor of fruit filling, just warm up 1/4 cup (80 g) of marmalade or jam until it turns liquid. Stir in 1 tablespoon of sugar and let the sweetened jam cool. Stir in 2 cups (10 ounces or 400 g) of finely chopped dried fruit (like apricots, cranberries, cherries or currants) until the fruit filling mixture is combined.Consider using a food processor to finely chop the dried fruit. This will ensure that the pieces of fruit are small and uniform.

, Turn on the oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Get out a few baking sheets and lay parchment on them to prevent the rugelach from sticking to the pans as they bake. Remove the disks of chilled rugelach dough from the refrigerator and let them set out for a few minutes.

You should have your filling(s) ready and set aside before you roll the dough out.

, Remove the plastic wrap from one of the dough disks. Sprinkle your counter with powdered sugar to keep the dough from sticking. Use a rolling pin to roll the disk out into a large circle. The circle should be about 1/8-inch (3 mm) thick.You can sprinkle more powdered sugar if the dough sticks.
The circle of dough doesn't have to be completely neat. It's fine if there are cracks around the edges since you'll be rolling the dough into crescents.

, Take the prepared filling of your choice and place a quarter of it onto the dough circle. Use an offset spatula or the back of a large spoon to spread the filling evenly across the dough. The filling should come to the very edges of the circle so that it's completely covered.If you want, you can use more than one type of filling for a circle of dough. Just place half of one type of filling on one side of the circle and use the other type for the rest of the circle. This way, you can make two flavors with one disk of dough.

, Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to carefully cut the circle of dough into long, thin triangles or wedges. You should get 16 wedges. Use your fingertips to gently lift up the wide outer part of a wedge and roll it towards the thin center. This will form a crescent. Place it on your prepared baking sheet so the tip or seam is on the bottom.Roll up every wedge and place the crescents on the baking sheet.

, Once you've rolled out a whole disk of dough and placed the crescents on the baking sheets, place them in the refrigerator to chill for at least 20 minutes. This will help them hold their shape as they bake and you can roll out the remaining disks of dough while you wait.Consider using a different filling for each disk of dough. This will give you a greater variety.

, Bake one sheet of crescent rugelach at a time to ensure even cooking. Place one sheet in the preheated oven and bake the rugelach for 20 to 25 minutes. They should turn golden brown once they're finished. Let the rugelach cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes after you take them out of the oven.You can store the cooled rugelach in an airtight container for up to a week.

, Turn on the oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Get out a few baking sheets and lay parchment on them to prevent the rugelach from sticking to the pans as they bake. Remove the disks of chilled rugelach dough from the refrigerator and let them set out for a few minutes.You should have your filling(s) ready and set aside before you roll the dough out.

, Unwrap one of the disks and sprinkle your work space with some powdered sugar. This will keep the dough from sticking. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to a rectangle that's 12-inches (30 cm) wide by 7 to 8-inches long (17.5 to 20 cm).Keep the wide side of the rectangle towards you so you can easily roll it into a log later.

, Take the prepared filling of your choice and place a quarter of it onto the dough circle. Use an offset spatula or the back of a large spoon to spread the filling evenly across the dough. Leave 1/4-inch (6 mm) edge bare on the side that's closest to you. This will help seal the dough together when you roll it up.You'll need about 2 to 4 tablespoons of filling for each log.

, Hold the edge of the rugelach that's closest to you. It should be the long, bare edge. Use your fingertips to gently roll the dough over the filling. Continue tightly rolling the dough to make a log. Pinch the ends together to form tight seals. Set the log on a baking sheet in the freezer and chill it for 10 to 15 minutes.Chilling the log will make it easier to cut.
Roll out and fill the remaining logs of dough once you've finished the initial portion of dough. Consider filling each log with a different flavor of filling.

, Remove the logs from the freezer and cut away the ends of each log so they're neat. Use a sharp knife to cut each log into 10 to 12 pieces, depending on how thick you want them. Place the rugelach slices cut-side down on the prepared baking sheets. Ensure that there are a few inches (5 cm) of space between the rugelach. Bake the rugelach for 20 to 25 minutes. They should turn golden brown.Giving the rugelach space will prevent them from baking into one another.

Lay one refrigerated pie crust into the bottom of the slow cooker and use your fingers to press the edges of the crust up the sides of the slow cooker.Traditional pecan pie works best in a round slow cooker, but will still work if you have an oval slow cooker.
You could also lay parchment paper inside the slow cooker before you lay down the crust. This will make it easier to lift the pie out, but may make the crust softer.

, Place all of the filling ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir them well until they're combined. Reserve about 1/2 cup (65 g) of the pecans for sprinkling over the top. You'll need to mix together:3 eggs
1 cup (225 g) of sugar
⅔ cup (200 g) of dark corn syrup
⅓ cup (75 g) of butter, melted
⅛ teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1½ cups (190 g) of chopped pecans

, Spoon the pecan pie filling onto the crust in your slow cooker. Arrange the remaining 1/2 cup (65 g) of pecans over the top of the filling. You can sprinkle them or create a decorative design with the pecans.You can leave the decorative pecans whole if you want a striking presentation. Keep in mind that whole pecans will be trickier to cut into than chopped ones.

, Cover the slow cooker with its lid and turn the cooker on to HIGH heat. Bake the pecan pie for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until the crust turns golden brown and the filling bubbles around the edges. If you lined the slow cooker with parchment, carefully lift the pie up and out. Or slice individual pieces and lift them out. Serve the pie with vanilla ice cream.If you're cooking the pie in an oval slow cooker, you may need to adjust the heat or time. Try cooking it on LOW for the recommended time.

Grease the slow cooker and cut the fruit.,
Mix the fruit filling and spread it in the slow cooker.,
Whisk the dry ingredients for the topping.,
Add the vanilla, milk, and butter to the topping.,
Drop the cobbler dough over the fruit.,
Cook the fruit cobbler.",How to Make Pie in a Slow Cooker3," Spray the slow cooker with cooking spray or coat it with butter so the cobbler doesn't stick. Wash and slice 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 pounds (565 to 620 g) of peaches or nectarines into 1/2-inch slices. Place the slices in the bowl along with 1 1/4 cups (6 ounces or 125 g) of blueberries.You could swap out the peaches and blueberries for an equal amount of other fruit. Consider using apples, pears, raspberries, or cherries.
To make this fruit cobbler, you'll want to use a slow cooker with a 6-quart capacity.

, Place the fruit in a large mixing bowl and stir in the remaining filling ingredients. Use a large rubber spatula to incorporate the filling ingredients and pour the filling into the prepared slow cooker. You'll need to add:1/2 teaspoon of vanilla
3/4 cup (150 g) of granulated sugar
1 tablespoon of cornstarch
1 tablespoon of lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon of fine salt

, Put 1 cup (120 g) of all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup (66 g) of granulated sugar, 1 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of fine salt into a medium sized mixing bowl. Use a whisk or a fork to combine the dry ingredients.If your flour seems lumpy, you could sift the dry ingredients. This will help them absorb the liquid ingredients evenly.

, Pour 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, 1/3 cup (75 ml) of whole milk, and 5 tablespoons (70 g) of melted unsalted butter into the dry mix. Stir the topping mixture with a rubber spatula until the dry ingredients are moist.Avoid stirring the cobbler topping too much or the cobbler will be dense and tough.

, Use a large spoon to scoop the cobbler dough onto the fruit in the slow cooker. Try to dollop heaping tablespoons of cobbler dough. Keep in mind that the fruit won't be completely covered by the dough. Place the lid on the slow cooker.To help the cobbler crisp as it cooks, you can roll out enough paper towels to drape over the slow cooker before you set the lid on it. The paper towels will absorb the moisture from the steam.

, Turn the slow cooker on to HIGH and bake the cobbler for 2 1/2 hours or cook it for 4 hours on LOW. The fruit should be soft and the filling will be bubbly once the cobbler is done. The cobbler dough should be completely cooked and puffy.Let the fruit cobbler cool for 15 minutes with the lid off of the slow cooker before you serve it.

Chill the filling for 20-30 minutes before using.",How to Make Rhubarb Pie1," The leaves of the rhubarb plant are actually toxic, so dispose of the quickly. To be extra safe, stop cutting about an inch from the leaves to ensure you have the best, most tender rhubarb.
, Pie fillings are surprisingly simple, as sugar and salts help draw out moisture to create the gooey liquid and tender rhubarb that you're hoping for.

, This helps the flavors blend and meld and the water to slowly suction out of the rhubarb, softening it.

, Want a little twist on your rhubarb pie? The following ingredients can all be mixed in for a nice subtle twist:

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 whisked egg (makes a richer, thicker filling), The leaves of rhubarb are toxic, so stop cutting roughly and inch below the leaves for the best results., The strawberries are a little more delicate than the rhubarb, meaning they will cook more quickly if they are the same size. Don't worry if a few of them are too small -- you just want the strawberries to be a bit bigger on average., The lemon, sugar, salt, flour/tapioca/cornstarch, cinnamon, etc. all goes into the same bowl the fruit filling., You'll notice there is a little liquid at the bottom of the bowl that has been drawn out of the fruit -- this is a good thing!

Cut 6 tablespoons of butter into small cubes and freeze for 10 minutes.,
In a medium bowl, toss the flour, sugars, and salt together.,
Add the cubed butter and, using your hands, mix until it all reassembles wet sand.",How to Make Rhubarb Pie2," The butter must stay solid for the crust to come together properly, so get it as cold as possible so that you can work it without worrying about it melting under your fingers.

This is also why you need ice water later in the recipe., There should be a mixture a bit like wet sand, with small pebbles of butter coated in the sugar and flour. It won't take long -- only 15-20 seconds of pulsing., Add it one tablespoon at a time, pulsing each one in. Your goal is to get a moist, almost formed dough -- not sandy, but not smooth like batter, either. This usually happens after 6-8 tablespoons of ice water, depending on the humidity where you live. Drier climates tend to need more water., Turn the dough out on the counter and cut in in half. Then gently mold the dough into two evenly sized balls. Wrap them each up completely in plastic wrap., This allows the butter to chill again, but also lets the flour ""relax,"" leading to a better final consistency., You can make your own or buy one from the store. Crumb topping, as the name implies, is only to replace a classic crust on top of the pie. Crumb topping is sweet, lightly spiced, and rich complement to your pie, especially if you made a straight rhubarb pie (which could use the added sweetness)., Cold butter is easier to work with, and it will form the ""crumbs"" that your sugar and flour stick to. You only need 1/2"" cubes, anything smaller is hard to work with., Use a fork or a small whisk to break up any clumps and make sure everything is well mixed., You still want some 1/4"" clumps of butter, but the majority of the mixture should look like loose, damp dirt. There should be big moist clumps and very little ""powder"" left in the mixture.Alternatively, pulse the mixture in a food processor for 30-60 seconds.

Preheat the oven to 400ºF.,
Roll out the dough ball on a floured piece of parchment paper until it is a circle about 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter.,
Using the parchment paper, drape the dough over the rolling pin.,
Ease into a pie tin, then remove excess dough around the rim with a knife, Simply unroll the crust off of your rolling pin and into your pie tin.,
Pour your chilled filling into the mixture into the pie crust.,
Top the pie with your crumb topping or roll out another dough ball into an identical sheet.,
Lower the oven to 375ºF and bake for 35 minutes, or until golden brown.",How to Make Rhubarb Pie3," The pie actually cooks at 375ºF, so the oven needs to be turned down once it goes in the oven. However, this moment of opening the oven and putting in a cold pie quickly sucks heat away, meaning the pie starts closer to 375ºF if you actually start the oven at 400º., If the dough sticks to the rolling pin, sprinkle a little flour on this as well., It is almost impossible to pick up and place a piece of thin pie dough without ripping it. However, by ""wrapping"" it around the rolling pin you can slowly unroll it over the pie tin, placing it perfectly every time., When done, use a knife of clean kitchen shears to cut the dough until you only have 1"" overhanging.


Though not necessary, you can use the tines of a fork to press the edge of the crust into the rim of the pan, making decorative ridges on the edge., It doesn't matter which one you made, they both cook at the same speed and rate. Spread the filling evenly in the dish with a fork.

, If you used the crumb topping, simply spread it evenly over the entire pie. If you want a traditional crust, simply roll it out just like you did the bottom, lay it over the top and press in the edges, then cut away any excess.


If you do a crust topping, cut 4-5 slits in the center to allow steam to escape.
Feeling really creative -- try cutting the top crust into a lattice.


, Don't forget to turn the heat down when the pie hits the oven -- as 400ºF will dry it out. The pie is done when the top (either one) is a gorgeous golden brown and the edges of the pie are well cooked.


There should be bits of pink juice starting to poke out when done.
If the outside of the pie cooks too quickly, and the center is still yellow, you can quickly remove the pie and cover the edges with strips of tin foil, which will prevent them from burning."

, Carefully place the batter, 1 tbsp at a time, into the hot oil and fry the doughnuts in batches for 3-5 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown, turning them as they cook. Continue with the remaining batter, and using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked doughnuts to a dish lined with absorbent paper to drain.

, Either arrange the doughnuts in a shallow serving dish, pouring the syrup over the doughnuts and allowing to stand for about 1 hour before scattering over the chopped almonds; or pile the doughnuts on to a plate and scatter with the chopped almonds, and serve the syrup separately.

Roll the dough flat.,
Go the easy route with cookie cutters.,
Use a parchment paper guide.,
Use the strip technique.",How to Make Pie Crust Letters2," With the dough at room temp, begin to flatten it with flour-covered hands and lay it between two sheets of parchment paper. Roll the dough until it is about ⅛ inch (⅓ centimeter) thick.If you're planning on sticking the letters on a crust, get your pie in the oven and prepare the letters while the pie begins to bake.

, Cookie cutters are the easiest way to cut individual letters out of pie dough. You can find letter-shaped cookie cutters in all sorts of sizes and fonts, at home goods store or online. If you want a budget option, see if your local dollar store has plastic letters for crafting. These will likely work just as well., Cut a piece of parchment paper that is roughly the same size as your flattened dough. Draw all of the letters you’ll need on the paper to make sure you’ll have enough room. Once finished, place the parchment paper on top of the dough with your markings facing up. Use an item with a thin point, like a skewer or toothpick, to gently trace the letters into the dough beneath the paper.Remove the paper and use a knife to carefully cut out each letter.
You can also print a sheet of paper with whatever letters you wish and trace them onto the parchment paper.
Always use parchment paper for tracing letters onto the dough, as it will stick to the dough much less than other types of paper. Further, parchment paper won’t leave behind any chemicals or become damp and tear apart.

, Another way of fashioning letters involves cutting ⅓ inch (just under a cm) thick strips of dough. Cut the strips into smaller pieces and attach them to one another to form letters, or simply twist and bend the strips. Store letters on parchment paper until you’ve got as many as you need.For instance, to make a capital “T”, cut off two short pieces of the strip, one a bit longer than the other. Use the shorter piece to cross the top of the longer piece, and viola.
When making letters with multiple small pieces of dough, brushing the letters with beaten eggs is especially important.

"
"
Cook letters on their own.,
Bake letters onto the top of a crusted pie.,
Place letters on desserts without an upper crust after baking.",How to Make Pie Crust Letters3," After cutting and shaping the letters you need, use the pastry brush to add a layer of beaten egg to each individual letter. Place the letters on a cookie sheet and bake them in the oven at 450° Fahrenheit (232° Celsius). Six minutes should be just about perfect. Allow the letters to cool on a wire rack.For a different consistency, you can also try baking letters at 350°F (177°C) for 10 minutes.
Consider sprinkling cinnamon and sugar on your letters before baking, especially if you intend to serve them alone. Pie crust letters sweetened this way are especially good accompaniments to hot apple cider.

, For pies that have crusts on top, such as classic fruit pies, you'll want the letters to bake onto the upper crust of the pie. For instance, you can arrange the letters however you wish on top of the upper crust when you add the crust to the pie. This will allow for the careful placement of lots of letters.

Alternatively, pull the pie out of the oven after the upper layer of crust has baked for a few minutes and then add the letters to the still-soft crust. This will make the letters more distinct from the rest of the upper crust, though it will be harder to adjust any lettering after its initial placement.

, If you wish to add your letters to the top of a pie that does not have a crust on top, bake the letters separately and add them to an already-baked pie. Not only is this ideal for desserts like pumpkin pie, you can also add pie crust letters to other desserts, such as carrot cake."

Use shortening to oil a wooden spoon and your workspace.,
Place the marshmallows in a big microwavable bowl.,
Microwave the marshmallows in 30-second increments.,
Stir in the powdered sugar.",How to Make Fondant from Marshmallows1," Marshmallows are extremely sticky, and you'll have a difficult time handling them if you don't use a lot of shortening throughout the fondant-making process. The shortening prevents the marshmallows from sticking to the countertops and the spoon you're using.









Rub shortening all over the spoon, not just the bottom. Cover the handle as well.
Rub shortening on a large cutting board, baking sheet, or whatever work surface you're planning to use when it's time to knead and roll out the fondant dough. This is a messy job, so you'll need a big surface.;
, Use the largest one you have that fits in the microwave. Dump all of the marshmallows into the bowl, then pour the 2 tablespoons of water on top.








, You want to completely melt the marshmallows, but do it slowly so they won't make a mess. Check the marshmallows every 30 seconds to monitor their state, and remove the bowl from the microwave when they're melted.








, Pour half the bag of powdered sugar into the marshmallow mixture, and use the spoon to mix it in. Pour in more powdered sugar and keep stirring. The mixture will become very stiff, and eventually difficult to stir with the spoon. That's when you'll want to stop adding powdered sugar. You may not need the entire bag.

For icing to be used as piping, mix the royal icing until soft peaks begin forming.,
Continue mixing and adding sugar, 2 teaspoons at a time, for firmer peaks.,
Adjust as necessary with sugar, water, or egg whites.,
Use royal icing immediately or transfer to an airtight container.",How to Make Royal Icing1," Here's what you'll need to make about four cups of royal icing with egg whites:









3 cups (700 mL) powdered sugar, plus additional as necessary
2 egg whites
1 tsp (5 mL) lemon juice;
, Sifting is not necessary but will help keep your icing from getting lumpy.








, Crack an egg and then turn it crack-side up. As you gently open it, use half of the shell to catch the yolk. Allow white to drain by transferring yolk from one half of the shell to the other several times.









Consider saving the yolk for homemade mayonnaise or Hollandaise sauce.

, You don't have to whisk much or for long. Whisking for 20 seconds will help break up the egg whites and combine it with the lemon juice.








, Start with 1 1/2 cups or 2 cups of sugar, and gradually add the rest while the mixer is on its medium setting. Mix until shiny and opaque, about 5 minutes.









Hand mixers also do the trick just fine if you do not have a stand mixer. In a pinch, a little bit of old-fashioned hard work will work as well, although you'll be getting a considerable workout.
For edible construction projects like gingerbread houses, a thicker, more peanut-buttery consistency will provide extra stability.

, Soft peaks are contoured without being firm; when you dip your whisk into the icing and turn it upside down, the peaks move back in on themselves.








To make your own icing tube, simply put the icing in a Ziploc bag and snip off one of the bottom corners. Start by cutting off very little of the corner to keep your icing lines thinner and more manageable. You can always snip more away as you go.

, If you want firm peaks for your icing, continue adding sugar a little bit at a time while the mixer is still beating. The additional sugar will create a stiffer icing.








, You probably have a good idea of how you want your icing to turn out. However, sometimes, things don't happen according to plan. If you need to change the consistency of your icing — it's too stiff, for example — don't fret. Here's how you adjust the consistency of your icing:









If your icing is too runny, add more sugar. A little bit at a time works best.
If your icing is too stiff, add more egg white. Again, a little goes a long way.
If you want to runny icing, add water, a couple drops at a time, to the icing.Whisk the icing and wait for the peaks to break up. Since this process causes air-bubbles to form, rest runny icing for up to 30 minutes before using to allow time for the air bubbles to dissipate.

, Royal icing hardens very quickly if not properly stored.

Repeat to make several loops.,
Wrap a small piece around the center.,
Lay additional strips on the cake for ribbons leading up to the bow before you attach the bow itself.,
Place the bow on top of the trailing ends.",How to Make a Fondant Bow1," Don't put it in the fridge! It needs to stay warm to be malleable.

, Start from the inside and roll outward.
, For a bunch of bows, this is ideal -- but for one large bow, you may want to go bigger. A pastry cutter will ensure a straight line, but a knife does just fine as well.

The length of the strips can also vary, but should generally be four to six times the width. For one thick bow, cut a strip about 3"" (7.5 cm) wide and a strip 1"" (2.5 cm) wide to adhere the center.

, This will hold the fondant together.
, Press the ends to stick them together. Pinch the center of the bow to give it texture. Do this by flipping it over and folding it in. Start in the center, pinching, and force in the edges.

Insert a bunch of plastic wrap inside the loops to round them out. Stretch out the center of the bow loops to give it a ribbon-like appearance.

, Use longer strips for the lower loops, if you're layering them.
, Wet the back of the piece with water and curve the piece before you adhere it. Pinch and twist off the back.

Adjust as necessary, fluffing out the sides and adding texture by stretching and folding.

, This will give your cake a gift-wrapped look.

Also add any trailing ends of ribbon. If you'd like, cut a V shape in the end of the fondant for a more ribbon-y feel and pinch the ends closest to the bow.

, Put a bit of water on the back side to adhere it to the base. Voila!

Stir in the flavoring and food coloring.,
Knead the fondant dough.,
Rest the fondant.",How to Make Fondant from Marshmallows2," Now's the time to add the extract and food coloring you wish to use. If you don't want the whole batch of fondant to be the same color, separate the dough into pieces before adding different food coloring to each.








, Tip it out onto your work surface. Lather your hands up with plenty of shortening. Start kneading the fondant dough as you would knead bread. Keep kneading until the dough is pliable and has the consistency of real fondant; you should be able to stretch it without it tearing. You'll need to knead for 8 to 10 minutes to achieve this.








The dough may be very hot at first, so be careful when you first start kneading. Wait a minute or two if necessary so you won't burn yourself.
Keep the shortening nearby so you can dip your fingers in as you go; you'll need a lot throughout the process.
If the dough seems very dry, knead in another tablespoon of water to make it more elastic.

, Form the fondant into a ball. Coat it with a thin layer of vegetable shortening. Cover it with plastic wrap so it won't dry out. Place it in the refrigerator and let it rest overnight.

Roll the fondant just before you're ready to use it.,
Lay the fondant over the cake.,
Trim the fondant.,
Finished.








",How to Make Fondant from Marshmallows3," Unwrap the ball from the plastic wrap and place it on a greased work surface. Use a greased rolling pin to roll it out in to a flat, thin disc that exceeds the size of the cake you want to use it to dress.









You can use cornstarch instead of shortening on your work surface to make sure the fondant doesn't stick.
Rolling it to a thickness of 1/16 an inch is a good bet for most cake recipes.

, Lift it using the rolling pin, then carefully transfer it to the cake so that the center of the fondant disc rests in the middle of the cake. Drape the edges of the disc over the sides of the cake. Gently press it around the cake so it stays in place with no bumps or wrinkles.









Don't stretch the fondant at this stage, or the cake will end up with wrinkles.
If the fondant rips while it's being transferred, you can smooth it out by gently pressing the ripped edges together.

, Use a knife to trim the fondant from around the base of the cake. Lift the trimmings away.

",How to Make Royal Icing2," Here's what you'll need to make about 5 cups of royal icing with meringue powder:









4 cups (950 mL) confectioners' (powdered or icing) sugar
3 tablespoons (15 mL) meringue powder
1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) extract (vanilla, lemon, almond)
1/2 - 3/4 cup (120 - 180 mL) warm water

, Many meringue powder labels contain specific instructions on how to make royal icing using their product — with powders varying from one product to the next. Adjust the recipe keeping the manufacturer's suggestions on the label in mind.








,, This whole process takes anywhere from 5 to 7 minutes.







, When using royal icing as the glue with which to bind a gingerbread house, for example, you probably want stiffer peaks. In this case, add more sugar. When flooding a cookie, for example, you probably want a runnier icing. In this case, add more water.









Icing is ready to be used in flooding a cookie when the icing runs off the surface of the beater tong when it's lifted from the mixer.

, Royal icing hardens quickly if not properly stored.

",How to Make a Fondant Bow2," Take a rolling pin and start in the center, rolling out both ends until it's thin like fabric. If you have a textured rolling pin, even better.

Roll out the fondant till it reaches at least 6"" (15 cm) long. Judge the width by how many bows you'd like to make. It may be easiest to roll it out to 12"" (30 cm) to have two sets of ribbons.

, If you have a pastry ribbon cutter, great! That will add a pattern to the sides. Otherwise a knife will do. Give the ends a straight edge.

Sprinkle with cornstarch if you have it available to keep it from sticking.

, This is pretty easy to do with a pizza cutter. You may want to cut off a bit more on some pieces -- the top levels will be easier to work with if they're a little smaller.
, Make sure your hands are dry and squeeze each piece into a loop.

Press the two ends together. Round out the loop and make sure the ends are even. You may want to let the loops dry for about an hour or so.

, Put 8 loops in a circle for the base of your bow. Add a glob of icing in the center to anchor the next level.

Put 6 loops on top of the 8, in the windows of the loops. If you need to adjust the size, cut off a bit of the ends, but maintaining the V shape.
Add another bit of frosting to the center. The next level should be 3 pieces. Adjust as necessary. Done!

, Depending on your level of knowledge, you can make them from a cookbook recipe or from a box mix.

, If you try to ice cupcakes while they are still warm, the icing will get runny and won't look as neat.

, Make your icing from scratch using your favorite recipe, or if you're using store-bought icing, use a spoon to stir it up.

, Place them on a flat surface so you'll have room to ice them.


If you want to serve your cupcakes in their wrappers, leave them on. You can also opt to remove the wrappers at this stage and serve the cupcakes without them.
If you decide to remove the wrappers, be careful not to tear off chunks of the cupcakes.

, Gently slide it over the cupcake's surface. Create a layer of icing that covers the entire surface of the cupcake. Add as much icing as you like.


Different icing textures will have different end results. Store-bought icing is usually slightly gooey and easy to spread. Homemade icing can be stiffer. When you're spreading it around, be careful not to pull up crumbs from the cake.
You can purchase different icing colors from the grocery store if you'd like to write on the cupcakes or make colorful designs. This may include your initials, age, favorite color, or favorite team.

, Use sprinkles or other sugar decorations to add a final touch to your cupcakes.

, Place the cupcakes in an airtight storage container. If you won't be eating them for a few days, put them in the refrigerator. This will prevent the icing from getting too soft.

Buy a piping bag and a large icing tip.,
Make a batch of cupcakes and allow them to cool.,
Make the icing.,
Fill the piping bag with icing.,
Practice piping some icing through the icing tip onto a plate.,
Pipe swirls onto the cupcakes.",How to Ice a Cupcake2," Piping bags are used to pipe icing onto cakes in a controlled fashion through a pointed tip. The design of the tip results in smooth, ridged, or star-shaped icing. When you're ready to ice cupcakes, assemble the piping bag and tip by screwing the tip onto the bag according to the instructions.


Check out the selection of piping bags and icing tips at your local grocery store or specialty baking store.
Larger icing tips result in a better final look for icing swirls. Smaller tips are used for writing or making small decorations.
Make your own piping bag by cutting a small hole at the bottom of a plastic sandwich bag. You'll be able to attach an icing tip to your homemade bag.

, Set the cupcakes on a tray to prepare them to be iced.

, Icing swirls look better when they're made with stiffer icing that can hold its shape. Since most store-bought icing is a little on the gooey side, you're better off making your own.


Use the following basic recipe to make classic buttercream icing, which is perfect for icing swirls. Simply beat the following ingredients together, adding a little more milk if the end result seems too stiff. You can swap out the vanilla for another flavoring and add a few drops of food coloring if you want:

1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks), softened
4 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 Tablespoons milk



, It's easier to control the piping when the bag is at least halfway full. Use a small spatula to scoop icing into the bag. Twist the bottom so icing won't squirt out while you work.

, Holding the twisted bottom of the bag with one hand and guiding the icing tip with the other, put pressure on the bag and pipe in a circular motion. Make sure the icing flows smoothly through the tip and that you're able to control the amount of icing that comes through.


If the icing doesn't seem to be flowing smoothly, check to make sure the tip is screwed on correctly.
Make practice swirls until you've got the hang of how to pipe icing.

, Position the icing bag tip over the center of the cupcake. Pipe a high 'cone'. Now, using a small amount of pressure and starting from the outside edge of the cupcake, pipe towards the center in a spiral. Go up the sides of the 'cone'. When you reach the top of the 'cone', stop squeezing the bag and pull up slowly to make a nice point.


If you don't like the result the first time, just scrape off the icing, put it back in the bag and try again. Make sure not to scrape off any cupcake crumbs.

, For a fun summer treat, skip the traditional icing and use ice cream instead. Let the ice cream soften in the container for a few minutes, then use a knife to spread it onto the cupcakes, just like you would for icing. Serve immediately.

, Use pretzel halves and chocolate candies to create miniature butterflies on cupcakes. After you've baked and iced the cupcakes, use a line of candies to make the butterfly's body, then stick two pretzel ""wings"" on either side.

, Draw hearts, flowers or other designs on pieces of thick paper, then cut them out and tape them to the top section of toothpicks. Stick them in the cupcakes to serve as festive ""flags.""

, Experiment with different tips and icing stiffness! Try techniques such as roses, borders, swirls, loops, and flowers.

Pour the 3 tablespoons (42 g) of melted butter into the processor and pulse the crust mixture for 10 to 15 seconds.The crust mixture should be sandy and clump together if you squeeze it together.

, Dump the crust mixture into a 9-inch (22-cm) pie plate. Use your fingers or a rubber spatula to firmly press the mixture into the bottom and sides of the pan. Put the crust in the refrigerator to chill while you make the filling.You don't need to grease the pie plate, since the crust contains enough butter to keep it from sticking.

, Open an 8-ounce (225 g) package of cream cheese that's at room temperature. Put it into a mixing bowl and add 1/4 cup (50 g) of sugar. Use a hand or stand mixer to beat the mixture until it's light and fluffy. This should take a few minutes.If the cream cheese is too cold, the mixture will become lumpy.

Finished.

",How to Fondant a Cake," Then measure the top and sides of your cake with a piece of string. Lay a long piece of string over the top of the cake and fold the ends down against the sides of the cake. Trim of any excess string that touches the plate. Take the string off and set it aside. You will be using it to measure the size of your fondant.If you are doing a multi-tiered cake, measure one tier at a time.
For any other cake, measure the greatest width across the top (this would be diagonally, from corner to corner on a square or rectangle cake) and then add twice the height.;
, The buttercream will help the fondant stick to the cake, so make sure to get the top and sides of the cake. Try to get the surface as smooth as possible, as any bumps will show. If there are any cracks or holes in the cake, be sure to fill them in using buttercream and then smoothing it down.








Consider using a cake decorating turn table to make this step easier and quicker.
You can also use light or dark ganache or apricot jam instead of buttercream., This will give the buttercream enough time to harden. If the buttercream is too soft, the fondant will slide right off.

, The surface must be smooth, as any imperfections will get imprinted in the fondant. Lightly dusting the surface with powdered sugar will prevent the fondant from sticking to your work surface.









If it is humid where you live, use a mixture of one part cornstarch and one part powdered sugar. If it is very dry, then consider using a thin layer of vegetable shortening., This will make it easier to work with. You can knead it for about five minutes to make it softer and easier to work with; do not let it get too soft and sticky, however.









Consider kneading in some gel or paste icing color. You can also add in some flavoring as well. Do not use a liquid food coloring., Do not make it too thin yet. If you are covering a square or rectangular cake, then flatten the fondant into a square or rectangular shape.

, Make sure to turn the fondant 180° every so often while you are rolling it out. This will help keep it circular and even. Do not lift and flip the fondant over, as this may cause it to rip.








, Take the string you cut earlier and lay it across the fondant. The fondant should be the same size as the string or a little bit bigger; you can always trim any excess fondant off later.

, Place the rolling pin at one end of the fondant, and roll it towards the opposite end, picking the fondant as you go. This will help you transfer the fondant to the cake and lessen the chances of it ripping.









Lightly the rolling pin with powdered sugar before attempting this.

, Place the rolling pin down on top of the cake, close to one of the edges, and roll it towards the other end, unwinding the fondant.








, Start at the top first, then smooth down the sides, using your fingers. Make sure that there are no folds, wrinkles, or air bubbles.Trim off any excess fondant. You can use a knife or even a pizza cutter. Try to cut as close to the bottom of the cake as possible.








, You can give your cake a smooth, professional finish by ""ironing"" the surface of the fondant with a flat-sided glass or a fondant smoothing tool.









Add shine by spraying it lightly with cooking oil mist and smoothing it over again.

, You can leave the cake as it is, or you can add decorations to it using buttercream frosting, such as lettering, swirls, or flowers. You can also use embossed silicon gel mats to give your fondant a pattern.

If desired, you can also add 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) red or yellow food coloring after combining the oil and flour. Mix until the color is even throughout the dough. The addition of food coloring is strictly optional, though.Set the oil dough aside for now.;
, Mix together 2 cups (500 ml) all-purpose flour with 3 Tbsp (45 ml) white granulated sugar in a medium bowl.


Using a fork to mix the dry ingredients can minimize the number of lumps that may form in the flour.

, Add the chilled lard to your water dough and cut it into the dry ingredients using a pastry cutter.


If you do not have a pastry cutter, cut the lard into small bits and sprinkle these bits over the dry ingredients evenly. Use a fork or knife to ""cut"" these lard bits into the dry ingredients until dry, coarse crumbs form.

, Pour the water into the remaining water dough ingredients. Mix with a fork until evenly combined.


If you want to add any food coloring to the water dough, do so when you add the water.

, Turn the water dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic.


If you did not add any food coloring, the dough should change from white to ivory after you knead it completely.

, Divide the dough into two equal halves, and roll each half into a flat square.


The square of dough will be about 12 inches (30.5 cm) long and wide.
Roll the dough until it is only 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick, if not thinner. The thinness of the dough is more important than the shape or other dimensions at this point.

, Use your hands to crumble half of the oil dough over one of the water dough halves. Spread the oil dough crumbles evenly over the water dough square.


Repeat this same process with the other half of the oil dough and the other half of the water dough.

, Roll each square of dough into a tight cylinder, as though you were making a jellyroll.

, Gently roll each cylinder under your palms until the entire thing is only about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.


The finished cylinder should be roughly 16 inches (40.6 cm) long and even in diameter throughout.

, Divide both cylinders of dough in half, producing a total of four separate portions of dough. Wrap each portion of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10 to 60 minutes.


Refrigerating the dough will give the lard a chance to harden slightly, making the dough easier to work with when you assemble the hopia. Do not refrigerate it for much longer than an hour, though, since excessive refrigeration can cause the dough to dry out.

, Place the pork fat in a medium bowl. Sprinkle the sugar over it and toss gently until the pork fat is evenly coated in sugar.


Set the pork fat aside for a few minutes as you prepare some of the other filling ingredients.

, Pour the oil into a large skillet with deep sides. Heat on the stove over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes.

, Sauté the onions, stirring frequently, for 2 to 4 minutes.


The onions should become fragrant and translucent. Do not allow them to burn.

, Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the onions in the pan. Stir until they coat the onions and cook for 30 seconds.


Do not allow the sesame seeds to burn.

, Add the sugared pork fat and diced kundol to the contents of the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the fat and kundol begin breaking down.


You may need to lightly mash the fat and kundol with a fork or mixing spoon as it simmers.
Note that kundol is also referred to as ""winter melon.""
The mashed filling should be chunky but somewhat watery at this point. If there is not much liquid in the pan, add 1/2 cup (125 ml) water.

, Sprinkle the flour into the contents of the pan, stirring continuously. Continue cooking for 5 minutes, or until the filling is thick throughout.


Note that no visible traces of flour should remain when done.

, Remove the pan from the heat and set it aside for 5 to 10 minutes, allowing the filling to cool slightly before you assemble the hopia baboy.

, Prepare two or three baking sheets by lining them with nonstick aluminum foil., Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Place it on the counter and gently roll it underneath the palms of your hands until it stretches out to a length of 12 inches (30.5 cm).


The diameter should be an even 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) throughout.
Note that you should work with one cylinder of dough at a time. After rolling, dividing, and filling the dough of one cylinder, move onto the next. Repeat until you make it through all four cylinders of dough.

, Cut the cylinder of dough in half, then cut each half into three even pieces.


Each of your four original cylinders should give you six pieces of dough, producing a total of 24 pieces.
If you want smaller pastries, you can cut each cylinder in half and each half into four even pieces. Each original cylinder should produce eight pieces, giving you a total of 32 pieces altogether.

, Use a rolling pin to flatten each piece of dough into a small, thin rectangle.

, Place 1 heaping Tbsp (15 to 18 ml) of prepared filling in the center of each rectangle. Gather the edges of dough over the filling, covering it completely.


You should gently pinch the edges together at the center to prevent the pastry from accidentally opening up.

, Arrange each of the pieces on your prepared baking sheet, placing them seam-side down.


Use your fingers to gently pat the pieces into circles, then lightly press down on them to flatten the pieces slightly.

,, Place the hopia baboy in the preheated oven and bake until the bottoms are brown and the tops are golden brown.


Watch them carefully as they bake. Keeping them in the oven a few minutes too long can cause them to burn quickly.

, Remove the finished hopia baboy from the oven. Let the pieces cool until they can be safely handled with your hands, then enjoy.

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, stirring to mix.,
Make a well in the center of the flour, adding the olive oil, vinegar/lemon, and warm water.,
Stir the mixture as you until it becomes a well-combined dough.,
Place the dough on a lightly floured countertop and cover your hands in olive oil.,
Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until smooth and shiny, adding oil to your hands if it sticks.,
Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it sit for 2 hours.",How to Make Filo Pastry1," Whisk it up quickly to make sure it is all well mixed and evenly distributed, without chunks., A well is simply a hole in the center of the bowl of flour, which stores the liquids in one place so that you can mix them in gradually.

Warm water will help you maneuver the dough, and start to loosen up the flour proteins. Use the hottest water you can get out of the tap for the best results., If you have a stand mixer, like a Kitchen-Aid, use the paddle attachment for 3-4 minutes. Otherwise, use a wooden spoon to fold the ingredients slowly into one another, working towards your well of liquids to slowly incorporate the flour. The dough should be shaggy, but still one consistent piece.

If the dough is too dry or hard, and you have trouble mixing, add more water in 1-2 tablespoon increments.
If the dough is too wet or soft, add more flour slowly, mixing it all in before adding more.

, This is to help the kneading process. It also helps incorporate some more olive oil into the dough evenly., You want to really put your weight into the dough, working it into a shiny, consistent ball. To knead, pick up a third of the dough ball and fold it to the top of the dough. Then, use the heel of your hand to press this fold down into the center of the dough. Rotate the ball a quarter turn and repeat, pulling up a different third of dough.

About halfway through kneading, flip the dough over and knead from the opposite side.

, You can leave it overnight if you desire. This lets the glutens developed in the flour relax, which will make the dough much smoother and easier to work with without ripping.

Want to work a bit faster? Leave it at room temperature for just one hour."
"
Set the bowl out for 30-60 minutes to return to room temperature before shaping.,
Cut the dough into 8-10 equal pieces.,
Lay a piece of dough out on a lightly floured surface.,
Roll the dough out as thin as you can with a rolling pin.,
Grab your wooden dowel and slowly begin wrapping the sheet of dough around it.,
Roll the dowel over the dough pressing down and out to spread it thin.,
Unroll the dough from the dowel carefully.,
Pinch together any rips, or cut off any excess dough and use it to patch up holes.,
Place finished dough on parchment paper, then brush liberally with olive oil.",How to Make Filo Pastry2," If you've been keeping the dough in the fridge, make sure to let it warm back up., The whole bowl of dough is far, far too big to roll out at once, so you'll need to take it in individual pieces., The flour prevents the dough from sticking. If it sticks to your hands or the rolling pin, sprinkle some flour on both of them to keep them dry and stick-free., You won't get the necessary paper-thin dough just with the rolling pin, but you can get close. Work to form a long rectangle, as thin as you can get it, before moving on to your dowel.

Remember to sprinkle more flour if the dough is sticking.

, Leaving the dough on the countertop, place the dowel on top of one of the short edges of dough. Curl the dough around the dowel, as if you were about to wind the dough around the dowel.


If you don't have a dowel: Alternatively, you can thin the dough out using the back of your hands, like it was a pizza crust. Drape the dough over the back of both of your hands and slowly work them further and further apart, until the dough is almost see-through. Note, however, this commonly causes rips., This is the hardest part, and will take some practice. You want to roll the dowel forward to curl the dough around it. Think about making a Play-Doh snake on the table, using both hands to roll it forward. As you do, try to also push your hands outwards, spreading the dough along the side of the dowel as you work. Again, imagine you have a limited piece of Play-Doh and wanted to make a long, thin snake.

The exact amount of pressure to exert is a matter of trial and error, but will come with some practice., When done, you should have a nice, round, and thin sheet of filo dough waiting for you. It's okay if there are a few rips -- it is to be expected in the early runs., With a dough this thin, the occasional rip is to be expected. The good news is that these rips won't affect the final flavor, or even the texture, of the finished pastry. Simply fold together to dough to cover up wrinkles, or use a little excess dough to iron over the holes.

Large, nasty rips that can't be easily patched aren't ruined completely. Simply roll the dough back up, knead it for 1-2 minutes, then try to re-roll it out., This prevents the dough from drying out, cracking, or sticking to other layers. Layer the finished, paper thin dough on top of each other, brushing each one with olive oil."
"
Set the bowl out for 30-60 minutes to return to room temperature before using.,
Cut the dough into 12 even pieces.,
Roll out the dough lightly, forming a small disk.,
Run the dough through the pasta maker on its thickest setting.,
Sprinkle your fingers, the rollers, and dough with flour if it begins to stick.,
Keep running the dough on thinner settings with each pass.,
Pinch together any rips in the dough and run it again on the same setting.,
Finish with a pass on the thinnest possible setting.,
Place finished dough on parchment paper and brush with olive oil before starting on the next piece.",How to Make Filo Pastry3," If you've been keeping the dough in the fridge, make sure to let it warm back up., These should be the perfect size to run through your pasta maker, but be aware the not all machines are created evenly. If you need to cut more, smaller pieces that is okay. This won't affect your final dough., Don't worry about getting it too thin at this stage, just get it started. The pasta machine will take care of the rest., This is usually ""1,"" as most pasta machines get thinner as the setting gets higher. You can usually tell which setting is wide and which is thin -- there is a very visible difference between the settings., This will prevent the dough from getting caught and ripping. You don't nee much, just a light dusting on your fingers will usually take care of any issues., Once you finish the first run, crank the machine up and run it again., If you rip the dough, don't worry too much. Pinch it back together, or cut off a little excess section to patch up the rip. Then run it through the last setting you just used to mend the dough up, proceeding with thinner settings after this.

Depending on what you're making, it is usually okay if some of the dough rips. Filo dough is usually stacked and layered, meaning that only a pretty top layer matters., Keep working upwards on your pasta machine, being sure to handle the dough carefully as it gets thinner and thinner. Make your final pass on ""9,"" or whatever your pasta machine's highest setting is, and then set the dough aside., This prevents the thin dough from drying out or cracking, and prevents the later layers from sticking. Use a cooking brush and liberally apply olive oil. You can now stack each thin layer of dough on top of each other, brushing the tops with oil, until you've thinned all the dough."

",How to Make Decorative Edges for Pastry," This is one of the most well-known pastry edgings and it's very simple. Use a fork to press evenly around the entire outer edge of the pie or other pastry item. It is best if the fork is floured before pressing, to prevent sticking.;
, Again, this is a very simple edge and requires only your fingers. Press the edge of the pastry between your thumb and forefinger to raise the pastry edge. Continue all the way around the pastry until it joins up again.


Make a crimped edge. This is a variation on the previous edge. Use your forefinger and thumb the press as before, only this time also use your other forefinger to create an indent where each peak has been made.

, This requires a teaspoon. Press an upturned teaspoon on the pastry edge to create half circles.

, This is made by using leftover pastry pieces. Roll these into long rope shapes and then twist two strands together so that they weave around each other. Attach to the pastry by moulding it around the edges. Keep in place with egg wash or tiny dabs or water.

, This is a slightly more complicated than the roped edge. Cut three long strips of pastry and plait (or braid) them into one long length. Attach to the pastry edge as in the roped edge step.

, Take the edge of the pastry and stand it up. Make even diagonal cuts all the way around the edge. Once the cuts are in place, bend one in and one out in alternate turns.

, You can make a lot of different shapes out of pastry and attach them to the edge with water or egg wash. Some suggestions include:


Stars
Crescent moons
Leaves - cut the leaf shape and create the vein design with a knife
Animals from cookie cutters
Hearts
Flowers, etc.

Enjoy.",How to Make Chin Chin," In a large bowl, mix together the sifted flour, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and sugar until evenly combined.


You could try using other spices, as well, including cinnamon or allspice.Use up to 2 tsp (10 ml) cinnamon and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) allspice. Similarly, you can use spice blends that combine nutmeg and spices with similar flavor profiles, but you will need to vary the amount based on the proportions of each spice used within the blend.
Mix the ingredients together with a mixing spoon or whisk.;
, Sprinkle the cut butter over the surface of the dry ingredients. Use a pastry blender or fork to cut the butter into these ingredients, continuing until the butter is evenly dispersed and until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs.


The butter must be softened and cut into small cubes before you add it to the dry ingredients.
Instead of simply stirring the butter into the other ingredients, you need to press the butter into the ingredients so that it can come into contact with the dry ingredients at a better pace. This is easiest to accomplish with a pastry blender or fork. If neither of these options is available to you, you could also use your hands.

, In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until well-blended. Add the vanilla and whisk again until it, also, is evenly combined with the other ingredients.


For a slightly different twist on the traditional flavor, consider using coconut extract instead of vanilla.

, Form a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the egg mixture inside this well, then gradually mix the dry ingredients from the sides of the well into the center. Continue mixing until the wet and dry ingredients are fully combined.


You could also try adding the wet mixture a little at a time, mixing after each addition. Form a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and pour one-third of the egg yolk mixture in the center. Mix completely, then add another one-third and mix again. Repeat with the remaining egg mixture.

, Turn the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface and knead the dough by hand several times, just long enough for it to become smooth and somewhat elastic.


You should also lightly dust your hands with flour as you work with the dough. Otherwise, they might stick and create more of a mess.

, Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or place it back into its bowl. Place it in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes.


If the dough seems firm enough, you might be able to skip this step, especially if you can work fast. Chilling the dough allows it to harden up a little, which can make it easier to work with in the long run and less likely to stick to surfaces.

, Place the chilled dough on a clean, lightly floured surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out until it is an even 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick all the way around.


Try to keep the dough in the shape of a rectangle as you roll it out. If there are uneven edges, use a knife to trim them away before cutting the main part of the dough into pieces. The scraps of dough should be re-kneaded together and re-rolled after you form pieces from the main portion. Cut additional pieces from these scraps once you roll the scraps back into a workable form.

, Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the rectangle of dough into strips that are roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide. Cut the dough crosswise into another set of 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) strips, ultimately forming 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) squares.


You could make the pieces a little bigger, if desired, but keep in mind that larger pieces will take longer to cook.

, Cut the dough into 2 inch (5 cm) squares. Cut each square in half diagonally, then poke a small hole in the center of each triangle. Carefully pull one corner of the triangle through the hole, forming a knot.To form 2 inch (5 cm) squares, cut the flattened rectangle of dough into 2 inch (5 cm) strips with a knife or pizza cutter. Cut another set of 2 inch (5 cm) strips crosswise, forming the squares.

, Heat on high until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).


The saucepan or skillet you use must have a heavy bottom and deep sides to prevent as much hot oil splatter as possible.
Check the temperature of the cooking oil using a candy thermometer or a frying thermometer.
If you do not have a thermometer, you can check the approximate temperature of the oil by tossing a small piece of dough into it. If the oil immediately begins to sizzle, the oil should be ready.

, Add the chin chin pieces to the hot oil one handful at a time. Fry for 3 to 8 minutes, turning only as needed, until the pieces turn golden-brown on all sides.


The small squares will usually only need 3 to 5 minutes. They may not need to be turned during the cooking process, either.
The knots may need a bit longer, from 6 to 8 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to gently flip them over once, after the bottom begins to brown, so that both sides will cook evenly.
Watch the temperature of the oil as you cook the chin chin. It may rise once you remove the pieces and lower once you add them. For best results, adjust the temperature controls on your oven to consistently maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the fried chin chin using a slotted spoon. Place them on a plate lined with clean paper towels to drain off the excess oil.


Repeat the frying and draining steps until the entire batch has been cooked.

,


Strictly speaking, chin chin should be fried and not baked, so you cannot get a fully accurate taste by baking them. These baking instructions will give you something as close to the traditional taste as possible, though, and are a decent alternative if you are looking for a healthier, oil-free method of cooking the chin chin.
Avoid using aluminum foil. If necessary, though, nonstick cooking spray can be used instead of the parchment paper.

, Place the chin chin pieces on your baking sheets in a single layer. Transfer the pans into your preheated oven, then bake until the tops begin to turn slightly golden.


Make sure that the pieces are kept to a single layer and are not touching. The pieces will stick together if they touch while baking, and they will not cook evenly if they overlap one another.

, Flip the pieces over using a spatula. Continue baking them for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until both sides have become golden brown.

, Remove the chin chin from the oven when done and allow them to cool slightly for 3 to 5 minutes on the baking sheet.


The pieces should not be allowed to cool completely. You simply want them to be cool enough to handle.

, Chin chin are often sprinkled with a little sifted powdered sugar. Transfer the pieces to a serving platter and dust the tops with sugar before presenting them to your guests.


An easy way to dust the chin chin with powdered sugar is to use a small sieve. Hold the sieve above the chin chin and place the sugar in the sieve. Gently sift the sugar through the sieve and onto the pieces of chin chin below.

, At this point, these delightful pieces of crunchy-chewy dough are ready to eat.

Mеtаl саnnоli tubеѕ can bе оrdеrеd оnlinе, but they саn аlѕо bе found in wеll-ѕtосkеd сооking ѕtоrеѕ.;
, Once sifted, incorporate thе shortening (or butter) with a pastry cutter or your fingers. You will want to cut the shortening in until the texture of the dough has a course and grainy texture.

, If it appears too dry to come together at all, then add some more of the liquid. However, you want a loose, relatively dry dough, not a smoothly combined dough., Then rеfrigеrаtе it fоr 2 tо 3 hours. This will allow the flour to really absorb all the liquid from the wine or liqueur.

, The dough should now be more combined and pliable than it was before it was chilled. Roll it into a ball and then and сut it into fоur рiесеѕ.

, You want to aim for about an eighth of an inch thick.You want to get it as thin as уоu саn withоut having it tear араrt.


If you hаvе a pasta rоlling mасhinе, rоll it thrоugh ѕеvеrаl times until the dough iѕ ѕmооth аnd thin. You dоn't hаvе tо hаvе a раѕtа rоlling mасhinе to roll out thе cannoli dough, but it makes it much easier to get nice, thin dоugh., You can use the tор оf a рlаѕtiс bоwl that has a 4-inсh diameter or you can use a ring mold that is the right size.Make sure the board under the dough is floured, so that your dough doesn't stick.

, To seal the edges together, bruѕh the area where the edges overlap with еgg whitе and then press together. You want to make sure that this seam will not come apart, so press together completely, but you also don't want to make the area totally deformed.

, If you are unsure, put your cannoli forms in the pot before filling it with oil and see how far up the oil needs to go to cover them.

, If the oil is tоо hоt you will burn the ѕhеllѕ. If the oil is tоо cool thе shells will turn оut grеаѕу and ѕоft.


That being said, if the temperature fluctuates around ten degrees in either direction, your cannoli shells will be just fine.

, Lеt them fry for аbоut 1-2 minutеѕ, watching thаt they are not getting too dаrk. Rеmоvе with tongs when they look nice and brown, аnd ѕеt them on a rack or paper towels tо drаin.

, Then carefully ѕliр ѕhеll оff оf thе fоrm. You may need to tap the end of the form gently while holding onto the cannoli to get them off the forms but be careful not to break the cannoli shell in the process.


You may even want to use a folded uр рареr tоwеlѕ tо hold onto the cannoli shell while you wigglе it off thе form.

, If you fill the cannoli shells too far in advance, it could soften the crispy shells, which you don't want to do. In an ideal situation, you would fill them cannoli right before serving.Store in a sealed рlаѕtiс container with a paper towel. The paper towel will absorb any moisture, keeping the cannoli shells nice and crisp.,"

Mix the ingredients with a paddle or spoon until they are fully incorporated. The better the ingredients are mixed, the better texture and flavor your beavertails will have, Letting the bowl stand for a few minutes will allow the yeast to swell and dissolve, which is essential to activating the yeast. Do not mix or disturb the bowl while you are waiting as any disruption could affect the yeast’s activation., Combine the vanilla, eggs, remaining sugar, milk, oil, salt, and most of the flour with your water, yeast, and sugar mix. Stir all of the ingredients until fully incorporated and the dough becomes soft and slack. , Knead the dough for 5-9 minutes, adding flour as needed. You may want to use a dough hook rather than your hands, but either method works. Kneading the dough with a dough hook will generally be more consistent than mixing with your hands.

, Then, seal the bowl in a plastic bag. If your bowl cannot fit in a plastic bag, cover it with a tea towel or clingfilm. Grease the bowl with a small amount of oil, enough to prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl while it rises.You can place the bowl in your refrigerator if you plan on waiting before you make the beaver tails.

, Let the dough rise until it has doubled in size, which will take approximately an hour. Letting the dough rise will give the beavertails a lighter texture and density., You can deflate the dough by making a fist and gently pressing it into the risen dough, which should leave an impression and release the gas generated from the yeast. Remember to be gentle, deflating the dough will allow the dough to be workable, but you don’t want to flatten the dough and compromise all of the work your yeast has done., Carefully pull off a small, golf ball sized piece of dough. Roll the piece of dough into an oval shape on a lightly floured surface and cover it with a tea towel. Repeat this step and continue until all of the dough has been rolled into oval shapes.

, Heat about 4 inches of vegetable oil in a fryer. The temperature should be385 °F (196 °C) before you place any dough into the oil. If you don’t have a fryer try using a wok instead. If you use a wok make sure to measure the temperature of the oil with a thermometer as you heat it.


If you do not have a wok, you can use a dutch oven or other deep pot that can hold a large amount of oil.

, Pull gradually on the two ends of a piece of dough until they reach a tall oval shape and look like a beaver’s tail. Pulling on the dough slowly will help the pieces retain their shape without risking them being torn or ripped.

, Gradually and slowly add the beavertails to the fryer. You should carefully place one or two pieces at a time. Do not dump them all in at the same time, you will likely ruin their cook and run the risk of seriously burning yourself! Continue with carefully adding one beavertail after another until they are all in the fryer.Place one beavertail in the oil to make sure the oil is at temperature before adding the rest in one at a time.

, Use a slotted spoon or pair of tongs to flip the beavertails over and keep frying the pieces until the undersides are a deep, brownish color. This should only take a couple of minutes so be sure to keep an eye on them.

, Using a pair of metal tongs, take out the fried pieces and let them drain on a paper towel. Be careful not to let the pieces touch you as they could burn your skin. Let them drain and cool for 3-5 minutes., Carefully pour in the sugar, adding cinnamon if desired. Mix the sugar and cinnamon until they are both fully incorporated.

, Place the beavertails, a few at a time, into the bowl. Carefully and gently shake the bowl so that the sugar and/or cinnamon gets shifted around, making sure the pieces are generously covered. However, you don't need to do this for very long.

, With clean hands, pick up the beavertails, shake off the excess sugar and cinnamon, and transfer them onto a clean plate. You can get rid of excess sugar and cinnamon by gently tapping them against the side of the bowl.

Because maintaining a cool temperature is essential to keeping the gluten strands from forming a strong bond, using chilled flour and a chilled bowl is recommended.


While you're preparing the dough, it's a good idea to chill your butter thoroughly before you attempt to work it in, if you're using butter. Anytime the mixture gets overworked, you can stop, put the mixing bowl into the fridge, and let it chill back down to a workable temperature.;
, There are many different methods of cutting the fat into the flour, but all are equally effective with the right amount of elbow grease. The most important thing is to keep the butter cool, if you use it, so keep it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes or so, cutting it into large chunks before integrating it more thoroughly. You want to mix in the fat until you have small and uniform pea-sized chunks.



Use a food processor. The easiest way to cut the butter is to use a food processor, pulsing the flour mixture for a minute or two, until the butter is chopped up to the appropriate size.

Use a pastry cutter for butter or shortening. A pastry cutter is a great way of chopping up the butter in a good uniform mixture, quickly and without much effort. Roll the pastry cutter through the flour mixture, clearing out the butter from behind the tines after you make each pass around the bowl, if necessary. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Use a fork or two knives. If you don't have a pastry cutter or a food processor, don't fret. It's possible, but takes slightly more hand strength and effort, to cut up the butter with the flat side of a table fork, using two knives to slice the butter in opposite directions, or even just using the end of a metal spatula.

Just use your fingers with shortening. Shortening won't be greatly affected by the heat from your hands or from the room temperature, making it easy to get your hands dirty and crumble up the shortening into the flour using your fingers. You can also do this with butter, but you'll melt it too much and risk making the mixture too glutenous in the long run.

, Use a wooden spoon and gently stir the flour as you pour a small amount of ice water into the bowl. Pour a tablespoon or two at a time, integrating it gently by agitating the flour. The mixture should just barely come together and form a loose ball, and shouldn't be at all damp or wet looking.


Be very gentle. The key to a flaky crust is to make sure you don't overwork the dough. Pie crust is not bread dough, and if you overwork the dough, the crust will become quite tough and difficult to handle. Be a minimalist when it comes to mixing the water into the flour. Less touching means more tender dough.

, If you're struggling to get the flour to come together, or if everything has become too warm, don't be afraid to pop the bowl into the freezer for a couple of minutes to chill it back down to a more workable temperature. Cold dough is easier to work with., Very gently, pull the flour into a ball, touching it as little as possible, and then split ball in two equal portions. The recipe should make two portions, which you could use for one bottom crust and one top crust, or bottom crusts for two different pies. Cut the dough ball in half with a kitchen knife and separate the halves gently.


It's usually a good idea to chill the dough in the refrigerator until you're ready to roll it out and bake with it. If you've already got the oven pre-heated and you're anxious to get started, putting it in the freezer can be a good way to get the temperature down quickly.
If you want to save the dough for a longer period of time, freeze it in a self-sealing freezer bag. When you're ready to use it, let it defrost in the fridge overnight and roll it out normally.

, There are several different techniques to rolling out the pie crust, so it's good to experiment some to find out what works best for you and the materials at hand. Some bakers prefer to prep a clean and smooth work surface, while others will use wax paper or plastic bags to create a non-stick barrier for rolling out the dough and help in moving the crust onto the pie plate safely.


Wax paper makes an excellent surface on which to roll out pie crust. Tape down a piece slightly larger than the diameter of the pie plate you hope to fill with the crust, and flour the surface gently. Many bakers will use wax paper in combination with pastry cloth or a second sheet of wax paper to fold the crust into a triangle for easy transport and use.
A wooden or stone pastry board requires very little or no flour to roll out pie crust. This can be an excellent investment if you plan on making lots of pie crusts.
It's also common to place pie dough in gallon Ziplock bags and unroll them without removing them from the bag. It can be somewhat challenging to keep pie crust from sticking to the rolling pin, making it a useful easy-clean barrier that will keep the pin from sticking. Just make sure you chill the dough thoroughly and flour the dough before attempting to roll it out.

, Start by washing your flouring surface, scraping any old pastry bits off to get the cleanest, smoothest surface possible. If you rinse it with water, let it dry completely before adding flour, or you'll get goopy dough on the board that you don't' want. Pie crust can be very delicate and tender, making it important that you use a very smooth, clean, surface.

, Whether you want to use a pastry board or your kitchen counter, sprinkle a layer of flour onto it evenly and place the dough on or in it. Rolling out the crust is the most difficult part, so give yourself a good layer of flour to avoid ripping it.


The amount of flour used to ""dust the board"" will vary depending on the fat content of the crust you're making, the amount, and the humidity in your area. It's always easier to add more, but it'll be impossible to take flour away if you end up drying it out. Sprinkle no more than a tablespoon or two of flour on the board when you start out, and no more than a tablespoon on top of the dough on top.

, Sprinkle a fair amount of flour on a rolling pin, to make sure the dough won't stick, and start rolling out the dough. Start from the center, rotating your rolling pin around to smooth the dough evenly in different directions, using smooth even strokes and removing the rolling pin from the dough as soon as you've completed a stroke.


Flip the dough over and flour the rolling surface again. Turn over the dough every two or three passes with the rolling pin, to avoid sticking it to the rolling surface.
It shouldn't take more than 5 or 10 passes to get the dough rolled out. The ideal pie crust is about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) thick, and even.
Don't worry if your crust doesn't roll out into a perfect circle. Remember, you want to avoid over-working the dough, so it's better to have a flaky crust that's a little oblong than a perfectly-shaped crust that's too tough. There's nothing wrong with a slightly misshapen pie crust, because you can trim off excess bits after you get it into the pan.

, The moment that you're most likely to tear the crust is during the step from moving it from the rolling board to the pie plate. But with the right technique, you can help to keep your crust in one piece.



If you rolled the crust out on wax paper, sandwich the crust between that piece and other piece, then fold it over, and over again into a triangle. You can store this in the freezer for easy use, or you can use it right away, unfolding it into the pie plate.

If you rolled the crust out on the counter, you can either roll the crust up onto the rolling pin, unrolling it onto the pie plate, or you can use a pastry scraper and gently move the crust flat.

, Use your fingers to push the dough into the bottom corners of the pie plate, and flat against the sides of the pie tin. Using a sharp knife, trim the edges of the crust and use the excess dough to patch any rips or tears in the crust.


You don't need to grease or flour the pie plate before you add the crust. It should release from the tin as it cooks. A tiny dusting of cornmeal in the bottom of the tin can help to unstick the crust, if necessary.

, Depending on what kind of pie you want to make, you might need to cook the filling, or simply empty the pre-made filling into your crust. Follow the directions for the particular variety of pie you want to make and prepare the filling accordingly.



Blueberry, blackberry, or other berry filling can either be made from canned pie filling, or from fresh fruit. If you start from fresh fruit, add white sugar, to taste, and a tablespoon of cornstarch for each cup of fruit to thicken the juice.
To make stone-fruit filling, like Cherry or peach, remove the pits by cutting the fruit in half or using a pitting machine. Remove the skins if desired, or leave them on.
Cook down apple, rhubarb, and other crunchy or sour fruits, like gooseberries, to release the juices and soften the fruit. Add a small amount of cinnamon and brown sugar to the filling as it cooks to add fragrance and taste.
Make pumpkin or sweet potato filling by mixing pureed pumpkin or sweet potato with sweetened condensed milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and other baking spices.
To make Chocolate, coconut, lemon, or banana cream filling, you'll need to pre-bake your empty pie crust before adding the cooked custard and cooling it in the fridge to set.

Mincemeat, chicken, or other savory fillings by sautéing the ingredients completely in the skillet before adding them to the crust and baking them. All meats and vegetables should be cooked completely before being added.

, Flour your rolling surface, roll the second ball of dough out with the rolling pin, and place it atop the filling.


Using a pastry brush (or just brushing it on with your finger), moisten the perimeter of the bottom crust with water or a single beaten egg so that it will stick to the top crust. Using a fork, crimp the top and bottom crusts together so it stays secure. Trim off excess dough with a sharp knife.
You can cut slits in the top to vent the steam, or cut a more intricate design to your liking. You can use excess dough to create little shapes or designs on the top of the pie to decorate it.
Alternatively, you can cut the top crust into several strips of dough, to create the lattice crust.

, Pie crust dough shouldn't be kneaded or handled like bread dough. Kneading and rising is done at room temperature to create gluten strands, which give bread its chewiness. It's desirable in bread, but undesirable in crust. If you want it flaky and tender, handle it as little as possible.


It's also possible that too much water was added to the crust. It takes some practice to get the water right: you want to add very cold water until the dough just starts to come together. You'll likely have to press the crumbs together to make it work, because there won't be enough water to make it come together just by stirring.

, Baking at too low a temperature can make the filling bubble before the pie crust browns, making it seep into the bottom layer. The bottom crust won't firm up properly when this happens, and it can get soggy for that reason.


It's also possible that a soggy pie is the result of too little cornstarch being added to raw fruit. Blueberries, in particular, require lots of cornstarch to set up, and will release a lot of liquid when you start baking them. It'll take some practice to get the cornstarch ratio correct. You'll also need to let the pie rest a while before cutting into it.

, You might have used too little water or too much shortening, but a crumbly crust that isn't flaky like you want it to be, one that has a dusty taste, needs to be tweaked slightly. Try to make the crust again, but substituting the same amount of butter, and see if that affects the consistency. If it comes out the same, you'll know it's the water. If it's different, try to add slightly less shortening next time.

, Leaving small but noticeable chunks of butter in the crust is a good way of creating flakes. As the butter melts, it spreads out, creating that desirable texture in pie crust. If it's too ground up into the flour, you won't get the same texture.

, It's possible to make whole grain crusts by substituting an equal amount of whole wheat pastry flour, as fine a grain as possible. To help the texture, it's also a good idea to add a quarter to a half cup of raw oats, flaxseed meal, or other whole grain flour to help get the mix to come together.


Whole wheat flour tends to be much more brittle and difficult to handle than that made with white flour. Be very careful not to over-mix it.

, Making a cookie crust with finely crumbled ginger snap, Oreo, graham cracker, or some other cookie of your choice. Start with 12-15 cookies in a plastic bag and crush them with a plate or tenderizing mallet, until they're fine enough to resemble a coarse flour. To that, mix in a quarter cup of melted butter, and press into the cookie plate. Bake at 350 F for 10 minutes, watching closely so it won't burn.


Cookie crusts pair excellently with custard or cream pies, like chocolate or coconut. It's less effective for fruit pies.

, Use equal amounts of brown or white rice flour and sweet rice flour, instead of wheat flour. The rest of the recipe works as normal, as long as you use vegetable shortening, which is vegan. It's also common to use a little xanthan gum, about a teaspoon, to bind the dough and replace the need for the gluten strands that form in wheat flour dough."

",How to Make Gluten‐Free Pie Crust," To make a pie crust that’s friendly to dieters and those with Celiac allergies, you can easily substitute gluten-free flour for regular flour. Some popular choices are King Arthur multi-purpose gluten-free flour or Erika’s All Purpose gluten-free flour, but you’re free to use whatever flour you prefer. Your pie crust will benefit from starchier ingredients, as they will help it hold together better and bake to a flakier finish.Rice, flax and other gluten-free flours may be too grainy to be useful for mixing up smooth pie crust dough.Different gluten-free flours have different properties, which will affect how the finished pie turns out. Do a little experimentation with various kinds of flour to find out which you like the best.;
, Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add half a cup of butter, chilled and cut into cubes, along with one whole egg. Fold the butter into the flour by hand, or use an electric mixer or pastry blender to churn the ingredients until they form a coarse mixture.It’s important that the butter be cold and broken up into small pieces. Big lumps of softened butter separate easily when heated, resulting in a runny, oily pie crust.Trade in the traditional butter for coconut oil or vegetable shortening to make a version of gluten-free pie crust that’s also free of dairy ingredients., Create a shallow well into the center of the dough mixture and begin slowly pouring in the ice water, folding as you go. The dough will begin to take on a smoother consistency. If it still feels too thick or dry, continue incorporating additional liquid one teaspoonful at a time until the dough is soft and malleable.It’s important to add the liquid component a little at a time to ensure you get just the right amount. Dough that’s a little too moist is preferable to dough that’s too dry.For richer pie crusts, use a splash of high-fat milk or buttermilk in place of water.

, Compress the dough into one or two large balls. Cover each lump of dough with a piece of plastic wrap and place them in the refrigerator for about half an hour. Keeping the dough cold will help it hold together when you roll it and ensure that it doesn’t get so soft that it starts to lose its shape.If you need a second sheet to place over the top of a filled pie, double the ingredients and make another batch of dough at the same time.
The colder the temperature of the dough, the easier it will be to roll and shape once you’re ready to put your pie together.

, Remove and uncover the dough. Sprinkle your countertop or a cutting board with a small handful of gluten-free flour to prevent the dough from sticking as you shape it. Have your rolling pin ready—this is the fun part!You can also roll the dough on a sheet of wax paper, or sandwich it between two separate sheets so you won’t have to use more flour than you need or worry about the dough sticking.After the dough comes out of the refrigerator, let it rest for about 15 minutes before shaping it.

, Press down firmly on the top of the dough ball with your palm to mash it into a thick disc. This will give you a more level surface to begin rolling. Use a light touch—you'll be doing most of the work with your rolling pin. Quickly coat the outer surface of the dough and rolling pin with flour.Start with as round a ball of dough as possible to make rolling and shaping easier.If you need to dust on a little more flour as you go, do it on your work surface rather than the dough itself.

, Using smooth, light passes, go over the dough with your rolling pin to begin flattening it out. Make your strokes in one direction at a time, then fold the dough over on itself and continue rolling. Folding the dough works out dry or sticky spots and helps you roll it into a rounder shape.Try not to press down too hard on the dough. This can result in a lumpy, uneven crust.If your dough feels too soft to work with properly, pop it back in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes to firm it back up.

, After you’ve rolled the dough into a thin sheet, carefully lift it and lower it into a pie plate or tin pan, making sure it’s centered. Use your thumbs to crimp or ruffle the edges of the dough. Add a filling of choice, such as cinnamon apples, cherries, diced rhubarb, peaches and pralines or chilled custard, or simply bake the crust by itself to fill later.Your crust is now ready to be filled and baked, or preheated on its own to be filled with chilled ingredients later.
If you’re baking a filled pie, place the other sheet of dough over the top, cut it for ventilation and mold the edges of both dough sheets together.

, Set your oven to bake or convection and let it start heating up. Place the unfilled pie crust in the oven on the center rack. Keep an eye on the crust as it bakes. Depending on how thin you rolled the dough, it may take slightly more or less than the prescribed time to cook.
Be careful not to burn your crust. If it starts to turn a darker brown color, it means it’s too done.

, Set a timer for 10-15 minutes. When the timer goes off, the crust will have baked to a perfect golden brown color and be light and flaky to the touch. You can then let the pie crust cool and fill it with your favorite no-bake flavors, like lemon icebox, key lime or coconut or banana cream.Fill your empty pie crust with dry beans or pie weights to keep it from shrinking or losing its shape as it bakes.Switch the light on in the oven so you can watch the crust’s progress.

, If you’ve already filled your pie, you can bake it and the filling together just as easily. After the initial 10-15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and leave the pie in the oven for an additional 30-40 minutes until the filling is hot and cooked through. Let the pie rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving, then enjoy!Pies made with hearty ingredients, like raw apples or root vegetables for pot pies, will typically need to bake a little longer so that the filling has time to soften.

, Continue to work in the peanut butter so that it gradually begins to combine with the other 2 ingredients. Slowly work in the milk in small amounts to help aid in the folding process and keep the mixture somewhat creamy.

, Once the peanut butter and milk are successfully blended into the pie filling, introduce the whipped topping into the mixture. Use a large spoon or spatula to fold in the whipped topping until it integrates with the other ingredients evenly.

, Start with the middle of the crust and use the spoon to gradually fill the bottom of the pie tin while pushing the filling toward the rim of the crust. Use circular motions that gently move the filling into position and minimize the chances of dislodging any of the graham cracker crumbs. Smooth the top of the pie to your preferences, or use the spoon or spatula to create a series of waves on the top layer of the filling.

, In most climates, the pie can be ready to cut in anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour after completion. Since the pie holds up well overnight, it can also be prepared the day before and allowed to set in a covered pie dish in the refrigerator until time to serve.

","How to Make a ""Yooper"" Pasty"," You can use any mix of deliciousness that may appeal to you. Red potatoes, carrots, rutabaga, onions, and beef hamburger make a great mix.


Other options may be; the breakfast pasty with scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and hamburger; the pizza pasty with pepperoni, sausage, cheese, and pizza sauce.;
, The rutabaga will be difficult to cut if you don't use a heavy knife with a sturdy blade. You may peel the potatoes if you prefer, but it doesn't hurt to leave them unpeeled.

, You may prefer your pasties unseasoned, but salt, pepper, hot sauce, garlic, or almost any other seasoning is an option.


Quantities kind of matter at this point, but everything depends on what you have available, and what you like. Generally, this recipe will make more than enough filling for 6 medium pasties.

, Mix it with your hands, kind of like playing with play-dough. Only it is meat. And vegetables.

,, You will need 3 cups of white flour, 1 cup of lard or shortening, and water. Mix the lard with the flour until it reaches a crumbly consistency. Add water until the dough is workable, but doesn't stick to your hands. Add flour as necessary to achieve this state.

, It's time to put these puppies together!

, You'll want to have a relatively circular formation about 10 inches (25.4 cm) across, and about the thickness of a thin pizza crust, or the fabric of a standard t-shirt.

, Place it in the middle of your dough, more or less in the shape of a ball.

, Squeeze/crimp them together at the top and along the sides.


If you have excess dough, be sure to cut it off and reuse it. If you didn't use enough to enclose your filling...well that's ok, just use a little more next time.

, This will prevent even distribution of your precious pasties on the inner surface of your oven.

,,, Keep your eye on them, and when they are golden brown, select one to slice in half to check the doneness of the meat.

, Hot and even warm fillings will create steam and moisture that will have nowhere to go but into the pastry. The pastry will reward you with sogginess. Only add cold fillings when making filled pastries.

, There is nowhere for filling to go inside pastry except into the pastry. Excess moisture in a filling will create soggy pastry. Drain moist fillings, or prefer fillings that do not present a moisture challenge.

, Pies and pastries with dense fruit or moist veggie fillings will benefit from slits to let out the steam escape during cooking.

, The idea behind this is to provide adequate time for base cooking without over-browning the top.Alternately, add aluminum foil to the top to prevent fast browning while the base cooks thoroughly.

, However, this will not allow you to add a hot filling! There remains a need to always use cold filling, blind baked or not.

, If you allow your pastry to cool in its bake ware with nowhere for the heat to escape but into the pastry, it is possible that you will end up with soggy pastry post-cooking but be guided by the recipe and remove the pastry from the pastry pan/dish if and when the recipe asks you to do so.

Consider using a little bit more baking soda in your next batch.;
, Baking soda and baking powder may sound similar enough to use interchangeably, but they are really two different things when it comes to baking. If the recipe calls for baking powder, make sure that you are using that and not baking soda and vise-versa.

, Ideal scone dough is wet and somewhat sticky. If the dough is too dry, the scones won't rise and will be crumbly. On the other hand, if the scones are too wet, they won't rise either, and will be too tough and chewy once baked. Don't hesitate to tweak the amounts and proportions to get the right texture. Things like temperature and humidity can affect a recipe and its ingredients.

, Accidentally using all-purpose (plain) flour in place of self-rising (self-raising) flour or not adding the rising agent to plain flour can cause flat scones.

, This includes things like yeast, baking soda, and baking powder. Over time, these ingredients lose their effectiveness, and will prevent your scones from rising. Here's a few ways you can tell if your baking soda and baking powder are fresh:Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to a few tablespoons of distilled vinegar in a cup. If the mixture fizzes, the baking soda is fresh.
Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to a few tablespoons of warm water in a cup. If the mixture fizzes, the baking powder is fresh.

, If your butter was too warm, it could be a reason as to why your scones did not rise. Try using cold butter next time. The cold butter will melt while you bake the scones, and the steam it releases will help the scones rise.

Try adding the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.,
Rub the butter into the dough.,
Mix the dough just enough so that the ingredients hold together.,
Don't roll the dough too flat before you cut it.,
Check the edges of the cut dough for smoothness.,
Don't let the dough sit for too long.",How to Troubleshoot Scones That Won't Rise2," Sometimes, the order in which you mix things can help the scones rise, or keep them from doing so in the first place. Usually, adding the dry ingredients to the wet ones, and mixing them until they are just combined, will give you light, fluffy scones.

, Don't squeeze or squash it. This will over-work the butter and cause it to warm up. You want the butter to remain cold and a little lumpy so that it can melt and release steam in the oven.

, Try not to knead dough for too long. Over-mixing scone dough can cause the air bubbles to disappear. This will give you tough, flat scones.

, The dough should be between 3/4 and 1 inch (1.91 to 2.54 centimeters) high. Making the dough thick will help the scones rise better.

, Is the dough rough and jagged around the edges you cut? Changes are, you twisted the cookie cutter. Try pushing the cutter straight down into the dough and then lifting it out. This will give you a nice, clean edge and help the scones rise evenly.


If the edges are jagged or smooshed, the scones won't be able to spring up and rise.

, When your scones come out too flat, try to remember how long you let the dough sit before you placed it into the oven to bake. The longer you get the dough sit before baking it, the less your scones will rise. Try to bake the dough as soon as you finishing kneading and rolling it out.


Letting the mixture sit too long will cause the gas bubbles from the baking soda to disappear. These gas bubbles are what help the scones rise.

Make sure the oven is pre-heated.,

Check the altitude.,
Keep the door closed.",How to Troubleshoot Scones That Won't Rise3," Scones need to be baked as soon as the dough is made. If you let the dough sit while you wait for the oven to heat up, the gas bubbles caused by the baking powder will go away. Pre-heat your oven before you put the scones in; this way, everything will be ready and at the right temperature.

, In general, scones should be baked at a higher temperature than most other pastries. Using too low of a temperature will prevent the scones from rising.


If the recipe called for a lower temperature, try baking the scones at 400°F (205°C) next time, and see if that helps.

, Most recipes are made for those living up to 2,000 to 3,000 feet (609.6 to 914.4 meters) above sea-level. If you live higher than that, you will need to adjust your recipe in order to get the scones to bake properly. Here are some tips for you to try:Use less baking soda or baking powder. Use no less than 1/8 teaspoon.
Use less sugar.
Add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of your liquid.
Add more flour. Start with 1 tablespoon.
If you are between 4,000 and 6,000 feet (1219.2 and 1828.8 meters), increase the temperature by 15-25°F.
If you are higher than 6,000 feet (1828.8 meters), use the original temperature, but bake the scones one to three minutes longer.

, Did you open your oven while the scones were baking to peak at them? If so, this might be why your scones didn't rise. Ovens are very sensitive, and opening the door causes the temperatures to drop for a little bit. Scones need to be baked at a high, consistent temperature in order to rise; if the temperature is too low, even for a moment, the scones may not rise.

Make sure that you are using 100% pumpkin purée and not the pumpkin pie filling. The pumpkin pie filling has extra ingredients, which will affect the recipe.

, Once the pumpkin mixture is evenly combined, scoop it into the flour mixture. Use a rubber spatula to fold the two together. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often.


Be careful not to over-mix the dough, or the scones will turn out tough.

, Using your hands, pat the dough into a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) thick rectangle. It will be about 9 inches (22.86 centimeters) long and 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) wide.If the dough is sticking to your hands, lightly dust your hands with flour.
If the dough isn't coming together, knead it 3 to 4 times., Start by making two vertical cuts to divide the rectangle into three smaller rectangles. Next, cut each rectangle in half diagonally to make six triangles.If you want smaller scones, cut each triangle in half widthwise.
You can also cut the scones into squares or circles for something different.
If the knife you are using isn't cutting through the scones easily, lightly coat it with flour.

, To prevent the bottoms of the scones from burning, bake them in the upper portion of your oven. The scones are ready when they turn light brown.Don't cram the scones onto the baking sheet, or they won't bake properly.

, Let the scones cool off before you start preparing the icing. The icing will start to set up very quickly, so you want to prepare it once the scones are cool.


The scones must be cool before you pour the icing over them, or the icing may not set up properly.

, Place a fine, mesh sieve over a clean mixing bowl, then pour the sugar into it. Gently tap the sieve to sift the sugar into the bowl. This will help break up any clumps, and give you a smoother icing in the end.

, Keep stirring until the icing is smooth. If the icing is too thick, add a little bit more milk.

, You can also use a spoon to pour the icing over the scones. Make sure that you coat each scone with the icing evenly.

, You can serve them as they are, or you can take things a step further by making a spiced glaze, and drizzling it over the plain icing.

, Once again, place a fine, mesh sieve over a clean mixing bowl, then pour the powdered sugar into it. Tap the side of the sieve to sift the sugar into the bowl.

, Keep stirring until the spices are evenly mixed throughout the icing.

, This icing needs to be a little bit thicker than the basic icing so that you can drizzle it. If it is still too thick, however, add a little bit more milk. You want the icing to be thick enough so that it can hold its shape when drizzled, however.

, You can also use a clean, squirt bottle to do this.Drizzle as much spiced glaze over the scones as you'd like, then discard the rest.

Keep the butter warm in a small crock pot, over a very low flame, or by storing it in a heavy, ceramic pot. You can microwave it for a few seconds now and then to reheat.

, Measure the filo on the short side and decide if you will cut it into two, three, or four strips. It's better to have strips that are too wide than too narrow.
, You can cut a stack of several sheets at once.

Folding the dough back along itself as you go can help to keep the cuts straight and parallel to the edge.

, Roll extra sheets tightly in waxed paper and store them in the refrigerator until you are ready to work with them. Filo that dries out tears much more easily.

Handle pastry as little as possible.,
Keep pastry cool with cool hands.,
Keep the fat cool.,
Go easy on the fat.,
Keep the liquid at a minimum.,
Set aside standing or resting time for pastry.,
Learn some rolling techniques.,
Add light glazes.,
Learn the key terms.",How to Handle Pastry," The more that pastry is handled, the tougher it becomes. Ideally, pastry should be handled quickly and lightly, to avoid toughening, drying out and hardening. The more pastry is handled, the less malleable and responsive it becomes, making it hard to roll and more likely to break when stretched.;
, When handling, the the introduction of heat from your hands is a major reason for it toughening - hence the need for quick handling. Hot hands also transfer oil.It is also best to use pastry in a cool kitchen; this may mean making the pie first, before the kitchen heats up from other cooking or even the sunshine. Remember the adage - ""cool in the making and hot in the baking.""

, Whether you are using butter, or some other form of shortening, keep it cool before making the pastry. BBC Food suggests removing it from the refrigerator about one hour before using, so that it is not too soft nor too hard to use., Follow the instructions of the recipe and don't be tempted to overdo the shortening. Too much fat in the pastry can compete with the filling and overwhelm the flavour or make the dish too rich., It is always best to add too little liquid and adjust than to have soggy pastry from too much. Just enough milk, water, etc. should be added to allow the pastry to stick together. Otherwise, you risk either soggy pastry, or pastry that shrinks during cooking.

, It isn't a good idea to make the pastry and attempt to use it straight away. You can if you are really in a hurry but you will find that the pastry is harder to roll and that pastry that it produces better results if allowed to stand for a short time. About 20 minutes is the recommended time for standing.The reason behind this is that the gluten in the flour is given an opportunity to practice its elasticity magic, making the dough much easier to roll., Many of us are guilty of stretching the pastry instead of rolling a little bit more. Don't be tempted again - the pastry will reward you by shrinking back during cooking. Instead, roll it the width required. When rolling, always roll to the edge of the pastry from the centre. And don't roll over the edge.

, If your recipe requests a glaze, keep it light to avoid adding too much weight and sogginess. The usual glazes are egg or milk, or some derivation using these ingredients. Water is recommended for shortcrust pastry.Always be guided by what the recipe says.

, It helps to know what the recipe means when it comes to making pastry. Here are some of the most common terms:

Rub in - chop the butter or other fat and add to the flour in the mixing bowl. Use your thumb and fingertips to quickly rub in the fat, sifting through all the flour until the fat is dissolved. Keep your fingertips moving up and down, as this lets in air and this is what makes pastry light (which makes it taste better).Knead - unlike bread, this means to quickly knead and make the pastry smooth. Try to avoid using flour as this will dry out the pastry; keep it to a minimum.







Blind bake - a method for pre-baking the pastry prior to adding the filling. See the article for more details.

Mix the dry ingredients together, cut in the fat and stir until it looks like bread crumbs, and keep in the refrigerator until you're ready to bake; then add sugar (especially if it's a scone) to taste, and enough yogurt or buttermilk until the dough holds together well. The acidity of this liquid activates the baking soda.
At that point you form it by hand into a biscuit or scone, and lay it on a cold griddle or skillet; you don't want to knead it more than 15 seconds or so, because it won't rise well if you wait too long.;
, Turn up your burner to high and set a timer for about 4 minutes., Cook for another 3 minutes or so; you may find that you can cut the fuel off partway through this and just use the stored heat in the griddle to finish the baking., Otherwise return to the heat for another 2 or 3 minutes, or pop in the microwave for 30 seconds or so to cook the inside. You've still saved at least 3/4ths of the fuel you would have used to oven-bake it."

Serve warm.",How to Make Cheese Scones1," Preheat your oven to 425 F (218 C). This recipe will make about 12 scones. Along with your ingredients, you'll also need:


Large bowl and mixing spoon
Sifter
Pastry cutter or two table knives
Fork
2.5-inch (6-cm) cookie cutter
Small bowl and whisk
Pastry brush
Ungreased baking sheet
Wire cooling rack;
, Place the sifter over the large bowl and pour in all the dry ingredients, including the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cayenne, and salt.Tap the sifter against the side of your hand to knock the ingredients into the bowl.


If you don’t have a sifter, put the ingredients right into the bowl and whisk them together.

, Add the cold butter cubes to the bowl and cut them into the flour with pastry cutter or knives. Continue working in the butter until the dry ingredients and butter come together and form pea-sized crumbs.Mixing in the butter this way will ensure that the scones are light and fluffy, rather than dense and heavy.

, Once added, use the fork to mix the ingredients together. You want everything to come together as a slightly sticky ball of dough. Stop when all the ingredients are incorporated, otherwise the gluten in the flour will start to develop, and you'll have tough scones.


For an extra punch of flavor, you can also add in a clove of grated garlic., Turn the dough out onto a flat, floured surface, such as a countertop. Flour your hands and knead the dough for 30 seconds to a minute, about 10 times.Use your hands to roll out the dough. Don’t use a rolling pin, as it’s too heavy. It will flatten the dough too much and your scones won’t rise. Spread out the dough until it’s about three-quarters of an inch (1.9 cm) thick.
Use the cookie cutter to cut out circles from the dough. If you don’t have a cookie cutter, use the rim of a drinking glass or mug. When you’ve cut out as many circles as you can, roll up the remaining dough, work it back into a ball, and pat it out again.
Arrange the scones on the baking sheet, leaving at least one inch (2.5 cm) between them.

, Break the egg into the small bowl and beat it with the whisk. Use the pastry brush to wipe a thin layer of egg on top of each scone. This will help the tops of the scones develop a nice golden color.Instead of egg, you can also brush a bit of milk onto the scones.

, Place the scones onto the middle rack in the oven and bake them for 12 minutes. Check on them at the 12-minute mark, and cook them for another three minutes if necessary.


The scones are done when they develop a golden color., Remove the scones from the oven after 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack and allow them to cool just long enough that they can be handled.


Serve the scones either on their own, or with extra butter, jam, or more cheese."

Bake and serve.",How to Make Cheese Scones2," Set your oven to 375 F (191 C). For this recipe, you will also need your ingredients, one large and one small bowl, a whisk, a greased baking sheet, a sharp knife, and a spoon or fork.


Instead of greasing the baking sheet, you can line it with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet.

, Sift or whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl. Then, use your fingers to work the butter into the flour. You want the dry ingredients and butter to come together into pea-sized crumbs.You can use a pastry cutter or two table knives instead of your hands to work the butter into the dry ingredients.

, Trim the tips and ends off the scallions and rinse them under cold water. With the knife, mince them into small pieces.For an extra savory dish, you can also cut up some cooked ham into small bites as well to make ham and cheese scones. Add them to the mixture when you add the scallions., Add the cheese and scallions to the flour and butter mixture. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk, then add them to the large bowl. Add the mustard and hot sauce as well.


Instead of milk, you can also substitute in cream, ricotta cheese, or sour cream for a richer and slightly heavier scone.Good mustard choices for these scones include spicy, horseradish, and Dijon.
Both the mustard and hot sauce are optional ingredients in this recipe. Leaving them out will result in a tasty scone that isn't spicy.

, Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, roll the dough out into a circle with a diameter of eight or nine inches (20 or 23 cm), and a thickness of about one inch (2.5 cm).


Cut the dough in half horizontally, then again vertically. For smaller scones, cut each of those quarters into thirds, for a total of 12 scones. For larger scones, cut each quarter in half, for a total of eight scones.

, Arrange the scones on the baking sheet, leaving at least one inch (2.5 cm) of space between them. Bake them for 20 to 23 minutes.They are ready when they turn golden brown and are firm to the touch.


Remove the scones from the oven when they're cooked and serve immediately, as soon as they're cool enough to be touched without burning the hands. They can also be served warm or at room temperature.
Place leftovers in an air-tight container and store at room temperature for up to a few days.

The mixture is ready when the ingredients come together with the texture of very course sand., Use a spoon or fork to mix the ingredients gently until they form a slightly sticky ball. Stop mixing when the ingredients are fully incorporated.


Good cheese choices for this recipe include ricotta, camembert, brie, goat cheese, and gouda.Good berry choices include fresh blueberries, dried cranberries, dried apricots, and currants.

, Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and use your hands to flatten the dough into a one-inch-thick (2.5 cm) circle. Cut the circle in half, then in half again, and then cut those quarters in half for a total of eight scones.Transfer the triangles to the baking sheet, leaving space between each one.
You can also use a cookie cutter to cut rounds from the dough to make biscuit-like scones.

, In a small bowl, whisk the egg. Then use a pastry brush to apply a light egg wash to each scone to give them a golden brown color.


Sprinkle the top of each scone with the course sugar.For an extra caramel flavour, use brown sugar instead.

, Bake the scones for about 15 minutes, until they're golden brown. You can serve them hot, warm, or at room temperature.

For less-sweet scones, use 3 tablespoons of sugar.
For sweeter scones, increase the sugar to 1/3 cup (65 grams).
For savory scones, omit the sugar.

, Cutting the butter will make it more manageable and easier to mix.

, You can use a pastry blade or your hands. The crumbles should be roughly the size of peas. Do not over-work the dough, however; this will result in tough, overly-dense scones.To make chocolate chip scones, add ½ cup (90 grams) of semi-sweet chocolate chips and stir.For more ideas on what you can add in, click here.

, Start with a few tablespoons of the liquid, and keep adding and stirring until the dough starts to come away from the sides of the bowl and clump up. You may end up using a little less/more than ½ cup (120 milliliters) of your liquid.


To give your scones a little more flavor, consider adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cream or half-and-half., Leave it there for 15 to 20 minutes. This will give the butter enough time to cool back down, making the dough easier to handle later on.

, Mix one egg with ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of cream, half-and-half, or milk. Beat the mixture with a fork or whisk until the yolk is all broken up and there are no streaks. You will be spreading this on your scones later on.

, You are cutting the dough in half so that you don't end up over-rolling the dough, which could lead to a tough pastry. Putting the dough back into the fridge will prevent it from becoming too soft too soon. Be sure that you cover the dough going back into the fridge with some plastic wrap.

, Make it somewhere between ¾ to 1 inch (2 to 2.5 centimeters) thick, but not thinner or it will not rise enough. Keep in mind, however, that the thicker your dough is, the longer it will need to bake. You can create a line in the centre of your scones to cut through when they are baked and ready to fill with cream or butter by rolling out to half the thickness you require then folding your scone mix in half. Cut through both layers to form the individual scones.

, There are several ways you can do this. Here are some ideas:


Make traditional scones by cutting the dough into a 9-inch (23-centimeter) circle, and then slicing it into eight wedges like a pizza or pie.Make round scones by cutting circles out of the dough using a drinking glass or a circle-shaped cookie cutter.
Using a sharp knife, cut the scones into squares.

, To prevent sticking, consider covering your baking sheet with some parchment paper. If you have more baking sheets and enough room in your oven, you can roll and cut the other half of the dough; otherwise, you will have to wait until the first batch is done baking.

, This will give the scones a shiny-texture after you bake them.

, The scones are done once they turn golden brown.

, Carefully lift the scones off the baking sheet using a spatula and transfer them to a wire rack. Wait about five minutes for them to cool.

, You can serve them plain or you can decorate them by drizzling some sugar glaze over them. You can also serve plain scones with some clotted cream or jam.

Sprinkle sugar generously on a flat, clean work surface.,
Remove the pastry from the freezer and lay it out on the sugar surface, working quickly.,

Cook the palmiers for 4-5 minutes, then flip and cook until golden brown.,
Cool the cookies on a wire rack for perfect crunchiness.",How to Make Palmiers1," The sugar will prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter as your roll it out, and will help coat the inside of the cookies with delicious sweetness. You'll use roughly 1/3 of a cup here. The type of sugar you use is up to you:


White Granulated Sugar will lead to a uniform, chewy consistency, as the small sugar grains melt quickly and evenly.

Course, Demerara, or Turbinado Sugar is bigger, leading to a crunchier cookie with noticeable sugar crystals.

Brown sugar' can be used as well, lending a noticeably sweeter, slightly molasses-like flavor.;
, Puff Pastry dough is a light, flaky, and buttery dough that needs to stay cool to work properly. If it gets too warm, the butter in the dough will start to melt, leading to wilted, weak pastries when cooked. If the butter is cold, it forms a pocket in the dough while it cooks, creating the flaky texture when the butter finally melts out of this little air bubble.

Puff pastry can be bought at a store, and even pie crusts can be used in a pinch.

Making your own puff pastry will always lead to better results, though it takes skill and time. Try out a ""Blitz"" Puff Pastry recipe below for a quicker, easier dough.

, Work quickly but calmly, rolling to dough into a thin rectangle. If the dough is sticking to the rolling pin, sprinkle some more sugar on top of the dough. If you want petite palmiers, you can roll this sheet out to an 1/8"" thickness instead., Brush the egg wash onto the top of the pastry, which will help them cook with a great golden-brown color and slight richness, as well as help the sugar stick and caramelize.

You don't want a thick coating -- just a light brush of egg will do. You should have a fair amount of it left over., Both the insides and outsides of your cookies want to be covered in sugar, as it will caramelize as it cooks into a delicious, crispy golden-brown cookie. Be liberal with the sugar here -- coating most of the pastry with a generous dusting., The final palmier will look like an old, stereotypical scroll. Using your fingertips, roll up the two long sides of the pastry sheet towards each other. You'll have a capital ""B"" shape if you did it well.

You want a nice, tight roll. Start in the corner and work your way down bit by bit.
It can help to alternate rolling each side, instead of rolling one side all the way to the middle and then starting on the other side., Remember, you want the butter in the dough to be cold when the cookies hit the oven, otherwise, the cookies won't hold their shape and the dough will be dense and unappetizing., The sugar in the cookies will quickly stick to a hot baking sheet, so you must line the cookie sheet with parchment paper to ensure they don't crumble when removed.

, Paint the top of the pastry roll with egg and then sprinkle some more of your sugar on top. Again, be generous here. More sugar is rarely missed in a good palmier., Using a sharp knife, cut your roll into little rounds. You can choose whatever width you'd like for the cookies, all that is important is that they are roughly the same size, which will help them all cook in the same amount of time.

Try not to smush the cookies as you cut. Use a sharp knife to slice gracefully through them.

, Make sure they are at least 1/2"" away from each other, or at least spaced enough so they don't touch. Drizzle a little more sugar onto the tops, focusing on the little rolls, so that they crisp and caramelize over., You want both sides to be a glistening copper color. The first side takes a little longer, usually 4-5 minutes, and the second side usually only needs another 2-3 before these guys are finished., Wire racks allow the entire cookie to cool evenly, which prevents steam from getting trapped and leading to damp, less-crunchy parts of the palmier. After 2-3 minutes of cooling you can serve and enjoy!"

Chill for at least an hour before using.",How to Make Palmiers2," Cold butter is essential for a great puff pastry, as it creates pockets in the dough. As it cooks, the cold butter holds its shape initially, creating air pockets when the butter eventually melts. You want it to be almost hard, barely indenting under your finger., Place the paddle attachment on the mixer, then use a fork to lightly break up any clumps of flour., It won't be a ""dough"" so much as a shaggy ball, but this is perfect. Resist the urge to keep mixing it, as this only makes the dough tougher. As soon as everything is roughly combined, stop mixing.Note -- this softened butter is not from the 20 tablespoons in the freezer -- this is separate.

, You want a chunky, still-shaggy dough. The butter should still be in chunks. When done, turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap., Square of the edges so that you have a nice, perfect rectangle. This size is relatively important -- you want it thin enough that you can keep working it., The hardest part of this dough is waiting for it to cool. This keeps the butter cold, again, to impart maximum flakiness on the final pastry., Remove the dough after an hour and lay it out on a lightly floured work surface. Take either end and fold them inward, as if you were closing up two submarine sandwiches. There should be slight overlap in the middle where they meet., This is the first of your folds, which will create the flakes you desire in a puff pastry. These folds will actually hold up in the final cookie, which is why they seem so layered and flaky., As you roll the folded dough, you work these layers into the dough, with the hard butter helping the dough hold its shape and keep the layers distinct., You want to fold and roll the dough a total of four times, meaning the whole dough takes almost 5 hours to make with chill time factored in. This may seem excessive, but this literally creates all the flakes -- skipping it is not an option, as you wouldn't call it puff pastry dough if you did., Get the butter cold again before you start creating your palmiers. The good news is that, in the freezer, this dough keeps well, so you don't have to be in a rush to use it."

Mix the spices on their own first, using your nose to determine if your ratio is to your liking., You can use lemon, orange, or even limes to get a nice burst of acidic freshness in your cookies, and the sugar will ensure that they never get too tart or bitter.

You may find it easier to measure your ingredients by weight (digitally if possible), instead of with cups (as is standard in North America). For this recipe, you will need a measuring tool that can calculate grams.

Macarons utilize egg whites, which can be one of the most difficult ingredients to master and use both safely and effectively. Separating egg whites is quite difficult. It is very important that none of the egg yolk is mixed in with the whites; otherwise, the meringue will not whip and the cookie shell will not properly form.

, Depending on the type of coloring you're using, use about 10 drops of liquid coloring or just the tip of a knife for solid food coloring. Mix through using a silicone spatula.

, Fold the combined mixture together well with a spatula, over and over until smooth. If you lift a bit of the mix out with the spatula, it should form a thick ribbon as it drips back in. Alternatively, test a bit on a plate; it's ready if it forms a smooth dome and not a peak. It will need to be folded again if it looks like a peak.

, Pour the macaron mixture out onto the prepared sheet in a circular shape (it helps to draw the shapes onto the sheet first using a lid or other suitable circle template).

Stir the yeast and water together. Let the mixture rest for a few minutes.Ensure that you're using yeast that hasn't expired.
You should notice a few bubbles on the surface of the water once the yeast begins to activate.;
, Measure out 2 3/4 cups (343 g) of all-purpose flour. Scoop out 1/4 of a cup (31 g) and set it aside. Pour 2 1/2 cups (312 g) of the flour into the mixing bowl with the yeast mixture and add 1 teaspoon of salt. Use a strong spoon to stir the mixture.The dough will look floury and shaggy at this point.

, Place the mixing bowl in a stand mixer and attach the dough hook. Turn the mixer on to low and knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes. The dough should become smooth.If the dough is still sticking to the sides of the bowl after 4 minutes, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
If the dough is too dry and doesn't form a shaggy dough, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until it becomes smooth.
If you don't have a stand mixer, you could knead the dough using your hands. Knead the dough for 5 to 8 minutes.

, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen cloth. Put the bowl in a warm place and let the dough rest for one hour. It should double in size., Once your dough has doubled in volume, transfer the bowl to the refrigerator. Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. This will make it easier to roll out and fold in the butter.If you want to make the dough ahead of time, you can chill it up to overnight.

, Get out the reserved 1/4 cup (31 g) of flour. Sprinkle your work surface with a few tablespoons of the flour. Get out 8 ounces (226 g) of cold, salted butter and set it on the counter. Sprinkle the butter with a tablespoon or two of the flour. Use a rolling pin to gently pound or tap the butter. Once the flour is sticking to the butter, you can pound the butter harder.Pounding the butter will soften it, so you can roll it out to fit the dough. It will also keep the butter cold, so it doesn't lose its shape.

, Keep pounding the butter, so it begins to spread out. Fold it over occasionally, so it doesn't spread too thinly or warm up. Use a bench scraper to fold and move the butter. You should be able to form a 6 x 10-inch (15 x 25-cm) rectangle.The butter should become flexible once you've pounded it enough.
If the butter sticks to your rolling pin, sprinkle it with a few more tablespoons of flour.

, Use the bench scraper to carefully lift up the butter rectangle. Place it on a baking sheet and put the sheet in the refrigerator. Chill the butter while you roll out the dough.Avoid chilling the butter rectangle for more than 15 minutes or it may become to firm to work with.

, Get the bowl of dough out of the refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap or towel. Sprinkle your work surface with more flour and scoop the dough onto it. Use the rolling pin to roll the chilled dough into a rough rectangle. It should be about 12 x 20-inches (30.5 x 50.75-cm)., Take the butter rectangle out of the refrigerator and set it on the center of the dough rectangle. Fold the longer ends of the dough rectangle over and onto the butter rectangle. Use the rolling pin to seal the dough together. Fold the longer ends over again.Fold the sides of the dough over the butter as though you're folding a letter.
The butter should be completely enclosed in the dough.

, Turn the dough so the narrow end of the rectangle is facing towards you. Roll the dough into a 12 x 20-inch (30.5 x 50.75-cm) rectangle. Fold the top third of the rectangle down towards the middle and fold the bottom third of the rectangle up towards the middle. This makes one turn of the dough.Turning the dough means that you've rolled and folded the dough. This incorporates the butter into the dough while keeping distinct, thin layers.
You'll need to do a total of 4 turns to make the kouign amann.

, Turn the dough 90 degrees, so the long side is facing you again. Roll the dough into a 12 x 20-inch (30.5 x 50.75-cm) rectangle. Fold the top third of the rectangle down towards the middle and fold the bottom third of the rectangle up towards the middle.You've now done two turns.

, Place the folded dough onto the baking sheet. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and put the sheet in the refrigerator. Chill the dough for 30 minutes. This will keep the dough from softening and spreading too much.Avoid chilling the dough for more than 30 minutes or the butter in the dough will lose its flexibility.

, Take the chilled dough out of the fridge and remove the plastic wrap. Set it on your floured work surface, so the narrow end of the rectangle is facing you. Roll the dough out to a 12 x 20-inch (30.5 x 50.75-cm) rectangle. Sprinkle half (3/4 cup or 150 g) of the sugar over the rectangle. Fold the top third of the rectangle down towards the middle and fold the bottom third of the rectangle up towards the middle.This completes the third turn.

, Turn the dough 90 degrees, so the open side is facing you. Roll the dough into a 12 x 20-inch (30.5 x 50.75-cm) rectangle. Sprinkle the remaining 3/4 cup (150 g) of sugar over the dough. Fold the top third of the rectangle down towards the middle and fold the bottom third of the rectangle up towards the middle.If some of the sugar falls out of the dough, just press it back in.
You've now finished turning the dough.

, Place the folded dough back onto the baking sheet. Cover it with plastic wrap and put the dough back into the refrigerator. Chill the dough for 30 minutes to help the butter firm up a little., Get out a muffin pan or 12 pastry rings. Use extra butter to grease the insides of the pan or the rings. If you're using the pastry rings, lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Place the greased rings on the sheet. Set the pan or sheet of rings aside while you shape the kouign amann., Sprinkle your work surface with extra sugar. Take the chilled dough out of the refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap. Set the dough on the sugared counter and sprinkle more sugar over the dough. Roll the chilled dough out to an 8 x 24-inch (20 x 61-cm) rectangle.The rectangle should be about 1/4-inch (6-mm) thick.

, Slice the rectangle in half lengthwise, so you have two pieces that are 4 x 24-inches (10 x 61-cm). Slice each of these rectangles into 4 x 4-inch (10 x 10-cm) squares. You should get 12 squares total. Fold the corners of each square towards its center.You can use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the squares.

, Place each square into the prepared muffin tin or pastry rings. The seams should be facing up, so they can expand as the kouign amann bakes. If you're using the muffin pan, you'll need to squish each square in a little to get it to fit.If you want to make the kouign amann ahead of time, prepare it up to this step and then refrigerate them. Ensure that they're covered as they chill. When you're ready to bake them, you can set them out at room temperature and let them rest for one hour before you bake them., Lay a sheet of plastic wrap loosely over the kouign amann. Let them rest in a warm place for 30 to 40 minutes. The kouign amann should puff up a little., Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C) when you begin to prove the kouign amann for the last time. Ensure that the rack is in the center of the oven.If you wait until the dough has finished proving to turn on the oven, the kouign amann may over prove.

, Place the muffin tray or kouign amann in rings on a baking sheet. Place them in the oven and turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees F (180 C). Bake the kouign amann for 40 to 45 minutes. Turn the tray halfway through the baking time, so they brown evenly.The kouign amann should be dark golden and look caramelized.

, Carefully take the pan out of the oven and set it on a cooling rack. Let them cool a minute and then gently remove them from the pan or molds. Put the kouign amann on the wire rack to cool. Serve them warm or cooled.Remove the kouign amann from the pan before they cool and harden in the pan.
Avoid storing leftover kouign amann. They'll become soggy over time.

Beat for a minute or until it forms a smooth ball and leaves the side of the pan. Allow to cool, however do not seal with cling-film or cover the dough as it may sweat which can affect the end result.;
, A food processor makes short work of the dough and makes a good quality pastry, however care must be taken that the dough does not climb under the blade attachment and leak, which it does quite often. The mix-master tends to give the best result, or hand held electric beaters.

, With a food processor this is about 1 minute worth of 5 second bursts, a mix-master takes about 4 minutes. If making a savoury version, add 1/2 tsp of salt or flavouring powders such as 1/2 tsp ground dried mushrooms, or 30g of finely grated Parmesan cheese. Ensure that your oven has been heated to 220C / 428F. You can do this by checking the thermostat or with an oven thermometer

, You may use a plain or a star or fluted nozzle.
It is best to fold the top third of the bag down forming a collar and then using a scraper or spatula to load the dough in, no more than 2/3rd the volume of the bag. Folding the collar leaves a clean top of the bag and when the folded collar is lifted up and the bag twisted closed, the filling does not come out the top. Squeeze by twisting the top of the bag further to increase pressure. Shake the bag gently to remove air pockets and then lift the collar up and twist to contain the paste.
You can also make your own by using a heavy duty strength snap-lock bag and snipping the corner off one end. Line your tray with baking parchment and you are ready to go. The dough may rest reliably in the bag for up to half an hour.

, Or as per advised time if you follow a different recipe.Under no circumstances open the door until this time as the pastry may collapse!
When the puffs or shapes are cooked, place on a cooling rack and use as desired. It is recommended to tear open one of the baked goods (preferably one that doesn't look as good as the others) to ensure the pastry is cooked through.
For the best crisp result, it is best to cut a small hole in the base of each puff or in a discrete place for steam to escape, then place back into the cooling oven with the door open to dry out giving optimal crispness.
When cold, fill as desired. Frequent suggestions are whipped cream, chantilly cream, ice cream or pastry cream. It is best to load your filling into another clean piping bag and filling either from the base, or another discrete place. Eclairs may be neatly slit open at the top or sides, but the side if you wish to cover with a chocolate icing.
Choux pastry may also be deep fried for a very indulgent dessert, by spooning or piping the dough into 175C / 347C hot fat, keeping the piping nozzle free above the fat. This process can make churros and a product similar to beignet.

"
"
Pipe the dough into desired shapes as per the following suggestions.",How to Make Choux Pastry3,"


For profiteroles, hold the bag in an upright position and apply pressure from the top of the bag by twisting the top of the bag to increase pressure. When the paste starts to emerge, place the bag just above the baking paper so the paste touches the paper.
Increase pressure by squeezing the bag (ensuring the twisted top does not open) and raise the bag gradually to pipe a ball approx 3cm across (1.25 inches) up to 4cm (1.6 inches) for large puffs. Reduce pressure and using a swift circular movement, cut off the dough. If a small spike remains, it can be patted down with a wet finger. Ensure you leave space for the balls to double in size before you pipe the next one.
For beginners, it is very common to have the spike which reduces the more you practice, but is also a sign the dough was not beaten enough so it was a weaker paste. A wet finger gently patting the top will smooth the surface.

For éclairs, Pipe long lines approx 10cm to 4 inches long, but the trick is to ensure you have even pressure to give the best quality result. To cease piping, pull the bag swiftly back in the opposite direction, so if you were piping left to right, with a smooth movement reduce pressure and move the bag to the left.

To make a swan, pipe a wide and short éclair approx 2.5cm / 1 inch wide and 5cm / 2 inches long to make the body. On another tray, pipe an ""S"" shape in the same way as an éclair using a 1cm or 0.4 inch nozzle to make the neck.
The piping bag should be even pressure and then cut off, leaving a short narrow end which will make the beak. For a beginner this is tricky so it is easiest to pipe a normal éclair as described and using wet fingers pinch the end to shape. It is best to bake the base of the swan first, then the necks in a separate batch. When cooled, split the body of the swan open and fill with cream, then place the neck in position.

Similar to eclairs, you can then pipe an array of shapes such as rings, letters, or any shape that you prefer. A large donut ring using a wide nozzle is often known as a Paris Brest, which is filled and often topped with chocolate sauce and praline.

To make a large base, or to create a Gateau Saint Honoré, make a paper template to place under your baking parchment. Using a piping bag, Pipe over the shape, either from the middle out in widening spirals, or the outside in, depending on your preferences. The Gâteau Saint-Honoré, is usually such a circle base and then topped with cream and individual puffs. The same method may be used to make squares, pillows and other shapes.

To make a Croquembouche, you will need a large batch of individual puffs. Fill them with whipped cream or pastry cream and create a large pyramidic stack. This is usually built around a cone-hat like frame, or the puffs are stacked and joined in layer with a little caramel as a glue. If you use a frame, it should be covered neatly with the puffs so its invisible.
After the stack has been finished drizzle molten caramel over the cone, this is best done by dipping several metal skewers into the caramel and drizzling the caramel with a light waving movement to create fine strands.

Serve the macarons immediately.",How to Make Cake Batter Macarons," To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cookies, set the temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius). Next, line a baking sheet with parchment paper to keep the macarons from sticking.If you prefer, you can substitute a silicone baking mat for the parchment paper.;
, Add 3 egg whites, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of cream of tartar, and ¼ cup (50 g) of superfine sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment in place. Beat the mixture on medium speed for 2 minutes.You can use a handheld electric mixer to mix the macaron batter if you prefer.
To separate the egg white from the yolk, break the egg against a flat surface, such as a countertop. Separate the egg into two halves over a bowl, and allow the yolk to fall into the lower half. Move the yolk back and forth, letting the white drip into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolk until you’ve removed all of the egg white.
Superfine sugar is also known as caster sugar.

, After you’ve beaten the egg white mixture for a couple of minutes on medium, turn up the stand mixer’s speed to high. Beat the mixture for another 2 minutes, or until it is very stiff., Add 2 cups (200 g) powdered sugar and 1 cup (120 g) of almond meal to a sifter. Sift the two into a bowl to remove any hard lumps.Almond meal is a coarsely ground flour type product made from almonds. You can find it at most grocery stores, or you can make your own.
If you don’t have a sifter, you can use a fine mesh sieve to sift the powdered sugar and almond meal. Use a clean hand to push the mixture through the sieve.

, After you’ve sifted the powdered sugar and almond meal together, add the mixture to the egg whites. Use a rubber spatula to fold the dry ingredients into the meringue until they’re fully incorporated.You don’t need to be particularly careful or gentle when you fold in the powdered sugar and almond meal because you want to knock some air out of the meringue mixture.
When you’ve finished mixing the batter, it should have a thick, paste-like consistency.
If you want to make colorful macarons, you can add several drops of red, blue, green, or your favorite shade of food coloring to the batter and mix it in to tint the cookies.

, After the batter is completely mixed, use the spatula to place it in a pastry bag fitted with a circular tip. Let the macaron batter rest in the bag for about 10 minutes before piping.A round tip that’s between ½- and 1-inch (13- to 25-mm) works best for piping the macarons.
If you don’t have a pastry bag, transfer the macaron batter to a large plastic zipper bag. When you’re ready to make the cookies, cut off a corner of the bag with scissors and pipe directly from it.

, After you’ve allowed the batter to rest for a while, use the pastry bag to pipe it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) mounds on the lined baking sheet. Make sure that the mounds are about 2-inches (5-cm) apart., Once you’ve piped out all of the cookies, hold the baking sheet and tap it against a hard surface, such as a countertop or table. Turn the sheet 90 degrees and tap it again. Next, allow the macarons to air dry for 10 minutes to ensure that they're fully set.Tapping the baking sheets against a hard surface knocks the air bubbles out of the macarons so they won’t crack when they bake.
If you want to add sprinkles to the cookies, sprinkle approximately 2 tablespoons (20 g) of rainbow sprinkles over half of the mounds before they air dry.

, When the macarons have air dried for several minutes, place the baking sheet in the pre-heated oven. Let the cookies bake until you can easily lift them off the parchment paper, which should take approximately 20 minutes.If the macarons stick when you try to remove them from the parchment paper, they likely need to bake for a few more minutes.
The macarons will expand slightly as they bake, which can also help you tell whether they’re finished baking.

, Once the macarons are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack to cool completely.

It’s important to make sure that the macarons are completely cool before you add the filling or it may melt off the cookies.

, Add ½ cup (113 g) of softened butter, 1 ½ cups (150 g) of powdered sugar, ⅓ cup (42 g) of vanilla cake mix, and ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of butter extract to the bowl of stand mixer with the paddle attachment inserted. Mix the ingredients on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy.Any store bought vanilla or yellow cake mix will work for the recipe.
You can usually find butter extract at the grocery store in the same aisle that vanilla, mint, maple, and other flavor extracts are sold.

, After you’ve blended the butter mixture, add 2 tablespoons (20 g) of rainbow sprinkles to the bowl. Use a rubber spatula to fold them in so they’re evenly distributed.You can use whatever color sprinkles you like, though rainbow offers the most festive look for the macarons.

, Once the birthday cake filling is made, use the spatula to place it in a pastry bag. Make sure that the bag is fitted with a circular tip that’s at least ½-inch (13-mm) wide.If you don’t have a pastry bag, you can use a plastic zipper bag just as you did to pipe the macarons.

, When the macarons are cooled, sort through the cookies to group them by size. Match up two cookies that are roughly the same size and turn over the cookie that will serve as the bottom of the macaron so it’s ready for piping.If you added sprinkles to half of the macarons, make sure to match up one plain and one sprinkled cookie. The sprinkled cookies should serve as the tops for the macarons.

, Once the macarons are paired, use the pastry bag to pipe a dab of the filling onto the bottom cookie. Press the other cookie on top to form a sandwich. Repeat the process with all of the macarons., After you’ve filled all of the macarons, set them out on a platter. They are best eaten fresh, so serve immediately.If you have any macarons leftover, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to eat them, let them sit out for about a half hour to soften the buttercream filling.

Whip the egg whites on medium speed until they are light and frothy.To separate the egg whites from the yolks, break the eggs on a flat surface, such as a countertop or table. Divide the egg in half over a bowl, and allow the yolk to fall into the lower half. Move the yolk back and forth between the two halves, so the white can drip into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolk until all of the white has fallen out.
You can use a handheld electric mixer to whip the egg whites if you don’t have a stand mixer.
You can whisk the egg whites by hand, but it will take a little longer.;
, When the egg whites are frothy, add ⅓ cup (65 g) of sugar to the bowl. Whisk the ingredients on high speed until stiff, shiny peaks form., If you want your macarons to be colored, add red food coloring to the mixture and mix until the color is even. A few drops of coloring will give you pink heart macarons, while more generous amount will give you red cookies.Red food coloring is the traditional option for heart macarons, but you can use any color that you like.
Gel food coloring works best in the macaron batter, but you can also use liquid coloring.

, Add ¾ cup (75 g) of almond flour and ¼ (55 g) of powdered sugar to a sifter. Shake the ingredients through the sifter to remove any large lumps.If you don’t have a sifter, you run the almond flour and powdered sugar through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps.

, Once the almond flour and powdered sugar are sifted, add them to the egg white mixture. Use a spatula to gently fold the dry ingredients into the egg whites until they are incorporated.You’ll know that you’re done folding the dry ingredients in when there are no longer any streaks of egg whites and the mixture forms ribbons when you lift up the spatula and allow the batter to drip off.

, For macarons, you’ll need a large cookie sheet. Line it with parchment paper, so the cookies won’t stick after you’ve baked them.You can line the cookie sheet with a silicone baking mat if you prefer.

, After you’ve prepared the cookie sheet, fit a piping bag with a circular tip. Next, use the spatula to fill the piping bag with the macaron batter.If you don’t have a piping bag, place the batter in a plastic zipper bag. Press all the air out of the bag and seal it. Use a pair of scissors to snip off a corner of the bag so you can pipe out of it.

, With the piping bag, pipe the macaron into heart shapes that are all roughly the same size until you’ve used up all of the batter. After you’ve piped all of the hearts, tap the cookie sheet against the countertop or table three to four times to remove any air bubbles.If you don’t want to freehand pipe the hearts, you can find a heart shape image online and use it to create a template. Place it under the parchment paper or baking mat so you can trace the shape with the piping bag. Just be sure to remove the template before baking the macarons, though.
You can also use a heart shape cookie cutter to serve as a stencil when piping the macaron batter.
If you make heart macarons regularly, you may want to purchase a heart shaped baking mat specifically for macarons. They have heart shaped indentations that you fill with the batter, and are made of silicone so you can bake the cookies right on them without worrying about the macarons sticking.

, Once you’ve piped out all of the macarons, leave the cookie sheet out for 30 to 60 minutes so the macarons can “dry”. You’ll know that they’re ready when you can touch them with your finger and the batter doesn’t stick., While the macarons are drying, it’s important to preheat the oven so it’s warm enough when you’re ready to bake them. Set the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the proper temperature. It will likely beep or flash an indicator light.

, When the macarons are dry, place the cookie sheet in the preheated oven. Allow the cookies to bake for 5 to 8 minutes, and then rotate the cookie sheet. Let them bake for another 5 to 8 minutes.The macarons should be firm and dry to touch when they’re finished baking. You don’t want them to change color, though, so keep an eye on them when you reach the 10 minute mark.

, Once the macarons are finished baking, remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Before removing them from the baking sheet, let the cookies cool completely, which should take 20 to 30 minutes., Add ½ cup (113 g) of unsalted butter that’s at room temperature to the bowl of the stand mixer with the whisk attachment inserted. Beat the butter on medium until it light and creamy.As with the macaron batter, you can whip the butter with an electric hand mixer or by hand if you prefer.

, Reduce the stand mixer’s speed to low, and slowly add 1 ½ cups (188 g) of powdered sugar to the bowl. Mix the ingredients until they are fully incorporated.For the best results, add approximately ½ cup (59 ⅓ g) of the sugar at a time.

, When the butter and powdered sugar are just mixed, turn the mixer’s speed up to medium. Whip the mixture for approximately 3 minutes, or until it has a light, fluffy texture., Once the butter and powdered sugar mixture is light and fluffy, add ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of vanilla extract and ½ tablespoon (7 ½ ml) whipping cream to the bowl. Continue to whip on medium speed until the mixture is completely smooth, which may take up to 3 minutes.If the buttercream is too stiff, add up to another ½ tablespoon (7 ½ ml) of cream.
You can substitute almond extract for the vanilla if you prefer.
If you want the butter cream to have a slightly spicy flavor, add ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of cinnamon to the buttercream.

, When the macaroons are completely cooled, use a butter knife or small offset spatula to spread the buttercream evenly over the bottom of the cookies. Cover half of the cookies with the buttercream.If you prefer, you can transfer the buttercream to a piping bag and pipe it onto the macarons.

, After the bottom of the cookies are covered with buttercream, press the plain cookies over the frosting to create sandwiches. Place the macarons on a platter, and serve.Store any leftover macarons in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should stay fresh for 5 to 7 days.

,, Pick up the speed to medium-high and keep beating the whites. Peaks should begin to form., Combine the ingredients together using a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix. Mix the batter together clockwise from the bottom, going up around the sides, and then cutting the batter in half.


The batter will be a little thick at first, but that’s normal. It begins to thin out the more you mix. Test the batter’s consistency by doing the macaron ribbon test. To do it, scoop small amounts of macaron batter on a tray. After ten seconds, the edges of the ribbon should dissolve. If it doesn’t dissolve, keep continuing to fold the batter together, but if it does dissolve then stop mixing at once. ,, Pipe small amounts of batter, about 1.5-inch rounds. Keep each amount one inch away from one another. There will be approximately 42 shells.


If air bubbles appear, firmly tap the baking tray down to pop them. Air bubbles can crack macaron shells when they bake. ,, Before getting baked, let the shells dry. You can test the shells to see if they’re ready to bake by touching one of them gently. If the batter does not stick to your finger, they’re ready for baking. Sprinkle over the salt, if desired.

If you are unable to purchase all-purpose flour, then use plain flour.;
, This will help the butter soften faster and make it easier to blend into the flour and salt.

, Pulse the food processor for a few seconds before you add more butter. This makes the butter more manageable and prevent the blades from getting stuck.If you do not have a food processor, put the butter into the bowl and mix it lightly with the flour using a fork. Then, roll a pastry blade across the butter and flour using a back and forth motion. Keep lifting and rocking the pastry blade until you have a rough, crumbly texture. The butter chunks should be roughly the size of a pea., The dough will start to come together and pull away from the sides of the bowl.


If you are using a bowl, lightly pat the dough down with your hands, then make a small well in the center. Pour the water into the well and mix with a fork until the dough starts to come away from the sides of the bowl.

, After 20 minutes are up, take the dough out and unwrap it.

, This prevents the dough from sticking to everything. Be sure to keep a bag of flour on hand, in case you have to add more flour to your work surface; the dough will absorb the flour as you work with it, making the work surface sticky.

, The dough may feel dry, but this is normal. Do not add water to it; it will become softer the more you work with it.

, Do not make the dough too thin; you will be rolling it out some more later. You may see some streaks of butter in the dough, which is also normal. Do not attempt to mix the butter in.

, Roll in one direction only. The dough should be three times longer than it is wide., Take the bottom third of the rectangle, and fold it just past the middle. Take the upper third of the rectangle and fold it down on top of the rest of the dough, making a square.

, It does not matter which side: left or right. If the dough does not turn easily, it means that it has begun to stick to the cutting board. Gently lift it up and spread some more flour down onto the board. Set the dough back down and try rotating it again.

, In this way, you are creating thin layers in the dough.

, Leave it in there for at least one hour, or overnight.

, Once the dough has thoroughly chilled, you can take it out of the refrigerator, roll it out, and use it to make croissants, filled pastry bites, or even baked brie cheese.

Add the butter cubes, and if using a food processor, pulse until the flour mixture becomes grainy.






If mixing by hand, mix together with your hands by grabbing and rubbing until it becomes rather grainy. (You can also use a pastry blender for this, but hands work best.)







,


Add in batches to the flour mixture while the food processor is running (or if by hand, mix vigorously with a wooden spoon.)






When you're done you'll have a rather shaggy looking ball of dough.







,, Knead it rapidly, pushing and turning, adding sprinkles of flour if needed, until you have a fairly smooth ball.

, Cover with plastic wrap or a plate, and leave to rise for about an hour.

, Suck as much air out of the bag as you can, seal tightly and then put the whole thing into another plastic bag, and place in the refrigerator.


Leave it there for at least 4-5 hours, preferably overnight or more. Making the dough up to this point the day ahead of when you want to bake it makes the most sense. You can leave it refrigerated for a maximum of 3 days. During this time, you will find that the dough will rise and almost burst the bag open, so you will need to periodically take a look at it and punch it down. This is why double-bagging is a good idea, since you may accidentally puncture the bag while punching it too hard.







, Roll out the dough into a long flat sausage and filled it with the chocolate and nuts.

Fold the dough into thirds.,
Turn the dough packet to one side by 90 degrees.,
Repeat the rolling and folding one more time.,
Wrap the packet with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator.,
Roll and fold the dough into thirds four more times, chilling it in between.,
Put the dough into the refrigerator for one hour before baking with it.",How to Make Puff Pastry2," This will allow at the salt and sugar to become evenly distributed throughout the flour. If you do not have a food processor, then put everything into a bowl and stir it briskly with a fork. You can also use plain flour instead of all-purpose flour.

, Start with ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of water; you will be adding the rest later, depending on how dry the dough is. Most food processors should have a spout at the top where you can pour ingredients through without taking the lid off. After a while, the dough should start to come away from the sides of the food processor. If the dough is still too dry and has floury clumps in it, add the rest of the water, one tablespoon at a time. Do this until the dough clumps together and comes away from the walls of the food processor.


If you do not have a food processor, make a hole in the middle of your flour mixture, and pour the lemon juice and water in. Stir it with a fork until the dough clumps together.
The lemon juice will help make the dough more elastic and easier to roll out.You won't taste it once you bake the pastry., The square should measure 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) on each side. Do not make the square too thin.

, This will make the dough easier to work with later. During this time, you can start preparing the butter.

, Make sure that the butter sticks are touching each other and that the flour is spread evenly across them.

, Keep doing this until the flour becomes ingrained in the butter. Once you are done mashing, remove the top parchment sheet.

, The square should measure 8 inches (20.30 centimeters) on each side.

, Leave it there for one hour. This will allow the butter to cool back down and become more manageable later.

, You want to end up with a square that it is about 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) on each side.

, Unwrap the butter and position it so that the corners are touching the flat sides of the dough square. Then, lift the corners of the dough and fold them towards the middle of the butter, creating a square-shaped packet.

, Do not make it too thin, and make sure that the rectangle is three times longer than it is wide.

, Life the bottom third up and bring it just past the middle of the rectangle. Press it down. Next, lift the top third and bring it down onto the rest of the dough, creating a square.

, You can turn it to the left or right. If the packet does not turn easily, the dough likely soaked up the flour. Gently lift the packet up and spread a thin layer of flour onto your work surface. Set the packet back down and try turning it again.

, Roll the dough out into a rectangle and fold it into thirds again. You are doing this to create thin layers of dough and butter.

, Let it there until it becomes firm; it should take about 20 minutes depending on how cold your fridge is.

, After you roll, fold, and rotate the dough two times, put it into the fridge for 20 minutes, then roll, fold, and turn it two more times.

, At this point, you can start using your dough in your recipe.

Lightly indent the center of each circle with a smaller cookie cutter or a cap (such as from a spice jar). Lightly poke the inner circle a few times with a fork. Transfer the circles to a baking sheet and bake at 400°F (205°C) for 15 to 20 minutes. Take the pastry out of the oven and either pat the inner circle down with the bottom of a spice jar or wooden spoon, or lift the inner circle out completely. You can now fill the cups with cream, fruit, or any cooked filling., Roll out your puff pastry until it is slightly bigger than your wheel of brie cheese. Set the cheese in the middle of dough and pour some honey over it. You can also add nuts and dried fruit. Bring the corners of the dough towards the middle of the cheese, creating a packet. Bake the brie on a baking sheet at 350°F (175°C) for 25 to 30 minutes. You can serve the baked brie with apple slices and crackers., Roll out the puff pastry dough into two thin 10 by 14 inch (25.4 by 35.65 centimeter) rectangles. Cut each sheet into 24 smaller rectangles. Press the rectangles into the wells of a mini muffin tin. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 10 minutes. Take the pastries out of the oven and pat the center of each with the end of a wooden spoon or spice bottle. Fill the pastries with whatever you want, then put them back into the oven for 3 to 5 minutes. Here are some ideas for what you can fill the pastries with:


Ham and cheese
Sautéed mushrooms and onion
Brie, pistachios, and peach preserves

, Roll the pastry into two 10 inch by 12 inch (25.40 by 30.48 centimeters) squares. Place one of the squares on a baking sheet and brush it with mustard; leave a 1"" boarding. Cover the sheet with a layer of ham slices, then cover the ham with Swiss cheese slices. Spread egg wash around the border and cover it with the second pastry sheet. Press the edges together, then brush the top pastry with egg wash. Bake at 450°F (233°C) for 20 to 25 minutes. Allow the puff pastry to cool, then cut it into squares and serve.To make the egg wash, whisk together 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of water in a bowl.

, Roll some puff pastry dough into a 10 by 14 inch (25.4 by 35.65 centimeter) rectangle. Brush one half of the pastry with egg wash. Mix 1/3 cup (35 grams) grated Parmesan cheese and 1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning in a bowl, then spread over the other half of the puff pastry. Fold the pastry in half, so that the egg side touches the cheesy side. Cut the pastry into 24 strips. Twist each strip into a spiral, then brush each strip with some egg wash. Bake at 400°F (205°C) for 10 minutes. Let cool before serving.To make the egg wash, beat an egg and a tablespoon of water together in a small bowl.

Make strawberry macarons.",How to Make French Macarons," Macaron halves are baked at a very low heat so that they will rise gently and not collapse. If your oven tends to run hot, you may want to bake the macarons with the oven door slightly ajar.;
, Since these confections are so delicate, it's necessary to use parchment paper so they won't stick to the baking sheet.

, Place the almond flour, confectioners' sugar, salt and cocoa in a bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients until they are fully incorporated. Be sure no lumps remain in the mixture.


If your almond flour is coarse, run the mixture through the food processor to grind it fine. Don't grind it for too long, though, or the mixture will turn to almond butter.
If you don't want to make chocolate macarons, leave out the cocoa powder.

, Place the egg whites in a metal bowl and either whisk or beat them until they form white, stiff peaks. Be sure the bowl is completely dry and clean, or the eggs won't form peaks. Add the sugar and beat until the peaks become stiffer and turn glossy.


At this point you can beat in flavorings such as vanilla, peppermint extract, or almond extract to the wet batter. Add about a teaspoon of your favourite flavouring.
Mix in drops of food colouring to make the macarons more colorful. Match the color to the flavor you have chosen for a nice effect. Keep in mind that macarons tend to lighten when baked, so you may want to add in an extra drop of food colouring in order to achieve the desired shade.

, Gently fold the almond meal mixture into the egg white mixture in two parts. Fold in half of the almond meal mixture with a spatula until the ingredients are just combined. Add the second half of the almond meal mixture and fold it in until just combined. , In order to produce macarons with the classic soft, chewy texture, the batter must be ""punched."" Use the back of a spoon or a spatula to push down in the center of the batter, scrape the batter from the sides to the center, then push down again. Keep punching the batter in this way until it begins to look loose and pudding-like in texture.


You'll probably need to punch the batter about 10 - 12 times before it's ready.
Make sure you stop when the batter looks like pudding; if you punch it too many times, it will become runny, which ruins the consistency of the batter.

, You can use the same type of pastry bag you'd use for icing. Fit it with a large circular icing tip. Fill the bag with macaron batter, then twist the end closed so that the batter won't escape.If you don't own a pastry bag, you can make your own by using a plastic sandwich bag. Cut off one of the corners, then fit it with the icing tip.
Experiment with different icing tips. Most bakers make macarons in the classic round shape, but if all you have is a star-shaped tip, give it a try!

, Squeeze the pastry bag and pipe 3-inch circles of batter onto the baking sheet. The batter circles will spread a little, so give them plenty of space. Try to squeeze the exact same amount of batter for each circle, so the halves of the macaron come out to be the same size. Now hold each baking sheet about an inch over the countertop and let it drop. Do this about 3 times with each sheet; this helps the batter settle.

, Keep the baking sheets at room temperature for about 15 minutes. The macarons are ready to bake when a dry crust has formed over their surfaces. Touch your finger gently to the top of a macaron; if the batter doesn't stick, it's time to put them in the oven., Place the baking sheets in the oven. Bake the macaron halves for 15 minutes, or slightly longer if necessary. The macarons are finished when they have a slightly hard crust and are soft, but not gooey, on the inside. When they're done, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool completely.


You can open the oven door after a couple of minutes to let any humidity escape. This helps the macarons rise and take the correct shape.
Don't over bake the macarons, or they'll brown on top and the texture won't be quite right.
Baking macarons is a fussy process, and takes a lot of practice. If your macarons fall on the first try, consider changing the temperature or cooking time in the future.

, Place it in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir the cream as it heats, and remove it once it begins to steam. Do not let it come to a boil. You could also heat the cream in the microwave in a microwave-safe bowl.

, Let the hot cream melt the chocolate for a minute or two, then use a spoon to stir the mixture together until it becomes a smooth, creamy chocolate ganache.

, This will make it easier to pipe the filling onto the macarons as you fill them. Fit the pastry bag (or sandwich bag) with a small icing tip.

, Chocolate ganache is a popular macaron filling, but there are many other fillings to choose from. Try a simple buttercream filling, either plain or flavored with your favorite extract. If you like fruity fillings, raspberry, apricot, or blueberry jam make great choices.

, Use an offset spatula to gently lift the cooled halves from the parchment paper and turn them over so that their flat sides are facing up. It's easy to crush macaron halves, so be sure to handle them with care.


To help the macarons cool down quickly, baker Eric Lanlard recommends lifting the parchment paper and pouring a little cold water beneath the sheet and the paper. This will create steam, enabling you to remove the macarons with ease.

, Position the icing tip in the center of the macaron half and squeeze about a teaspoon of filling onto the macaron. Repeat with half of the macaron halves you baked.

, Gently position a second macaron half over the filling and lightly press it down, so that you've formed a sandwich. Continue with the remaining macaron halves until all of the macarons have been assembled.

, Enjoy the macarons from the oven, or store them in an airtight container for later use. They will keep for several days in the refrigerator.,, These macarons are violet in both color and taster. Consider giving them a try for a twist your recipe.

, This delicious French cookie with a cookie and cream twist will have your taste buds wanting more. Macarons are a sandwich cookie with a nice crunchy shell and sweet and creamy filling, and these ones are flavored like cookies and cream.

, If you're a big chocolate fan, chocolate macarons might suit you up for the best.

, Add your favorite fruit to your favorite dessert, strawberry macarons are good any day at anytime.

In the center of the flour, create a small indent with your finger or a spoon to serve as a well. Pour 3/4 cup (180 mL) lukewarm milk into the well, but do not mix the flour and milk together.The easiest way to heat milk is in the microwave. Pour it into a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave it on medium-high (70% power) in 10 seconds intervals until it's warm enough. Stir after each interval to ensure that a film doesn't develop on the milk.Lukewarm milk should typically be between 98 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (36.5 to 40.5 Celsius). Test the temperature of the milk by splashing a little on the inside of your wrist. It should feel a little warmer than your body temperature, but not hot at all.;
, Over the milk in the center of the flour, sprinkle a packet (7 g) of yeast. Use a fork to gently stir the yeast and milk together. Allow the yeast to proof, which means letting it sit until it develops bubbles and appears foamy.The proofing process usually takes about 10 minutes.
When the yeast is fully proofed, the foam should make it appear to have doubled in size.

, While you’re waiting for the yeast to proof, attach the dough hook to your stand mixer. Set the bowl with the flour, milk, and yeast on mixer, and turn it to the medium low speed once the yeast has proofed.You can use a hand mixer to prepare the dough. In fact, there are dough attachments available for purchase with some hand mixers that make mixing up the dough easier.
You can also mix your dough by hand with a spoon, but it is a labor intensive process, and will take longer for the dough to come together.

, To the stand mixer bowl, add 1/4 cup (45 g) butter that’s been melted and cooled, 1/4 cup (50 g) sugar, and 1 teaspoon (6 g) salt. Allow the dough hook to knead the dough until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.You can melt butter in a heavy pan on the stove at medium-low to medium heat, or place butter that’s been cut into pieces in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave at 30% power for intervals of 10 seconds until it’s completely melted., When you’ve formed a stiff dough, remove it from the bowl to a floured work surface and form a thick square. Put in in a buttered dish, and loosely cover it with a small dish towel. Chill it in the refrigerator for approximately 2 hours.If you don’t have a tea towel on hand, you can cover your dough with plastic wrap. Just make sure that it’s not clinging to the dough too tightly.

, Place 2 cups or 4 sticks (360 g) of butter in a gallon size plastic bag. Next, use a rolling pin to beat the butter on a cutting board or other work surface. Continue working, alternating between beating and rolling the butter until it forms a flat 6-in by 8-in (15 cm by 20 cm) rectangle that’s approximately ½ inch (1.27 cm) thick. Once it’s done, put it in the refrigerator.Don’t worry if your butter doesn’t form a perfect rectangle. Get as close to the shape and size as possible.
If you don’t have a large enough plastic bag to hold the butter, sandwich it between two pieces of plastic wrap before you flatten it.

, Once your dough has chilled, lightly flour your work surface and a rolling pin. Place the dough on the surface, and use roll it out to form a 16-in by 10-in (41 cm by 25 cm) rectangle.If the dough starts to stick to the rolling pin at any point, add a little more flour to the pin so you can work more easily.

, After your dough is a rectangle shape, remove the butter from the refrigerator. With the short side of the dough facing you, place the butter rectangle on top of it so it lines up as closely as possible., With the butter in place, take the top half of the dough and fold it down over it. Next, take the bottom half of the dough and fold it up to meet the end of the top half. Press the ends of the dough together to seal them over the butter.If you find that the dough is sticking to your hands as you’re working, coat your skin with a little cooking oil.

, With the butter inside, turn the dough so the short side is facing you. Use the rolling pin to roll the dough out again to create another rectangle. This time, aim for one that is 15-in by 10-in (38 cm by 25 cm).Press down on the rolling pin as you work to ensure that you’re getting the dough as flat as possible.

, With the short side facing you, take the bottom portion of the dough and fold it up. Next, take the top portion of the dough and fold it over the bottom to tri-fold it as you would a letter.You should wind up with a rectangle that’s roughly 11-inches by 6-inches (28 cm x 15 cm) when you’re done folding.

, Take the rectangle of dough, and wrap it in plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator, and allow it to chill for approximately 30 to 45. Afterward, place the dough back on the floured surface and repeat the entire folding and rolling process, also known as turning the dough, three more times.In all, you’ll have turned the dough a total of 4 times.

, After you’ve turned the dough for the last time, it needs to be chilled again.Wrap it in plastic wrap, and leave it in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.The longer you chill the dough, the better your croissants will be. Refrigerate it overnight if possible.

, After it’s chilled sufficiently, divide your dough in half. Leave half in the fridge, and return the other half to your floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to once again roll it out into a rectangle. It should be approximately 9-in by 18-in (23 cm by 46 cm) when you’re done., With a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut the rectangle of dough in half lengthwise. Next, cut each each section of dough into triangles. Make sure to cut a small vertical slit in each triangle in the center of the wide base.You should be able to cut approximately 7 to 9 triangles from each section.

, Place a piece of bittersweet chocolate on the dough. It should be parallel to be base and near the slit that you’ve cut. Fold the base of the triangle up over the chocolate, and roll it back toward the tip, keeping it tight.You can use whole pieces of chocolate, shaved or chopped chocolate, or even chocolate chips to fill the croissants.

, Once you roll up the croissants, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.Cover them with a towel or greased plastic wrap, and allow them to rise 2 to 3 hours.Make sure the croissants are approximately 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) apart on the baking sheet.
The croissants will rise best in a warm environment, so you may want to set the baking sheets near a window that gets heavy sun or another source of heat.
Repeat the entire process of cutting, adding chocolate, rolling, and rising with the second half of the dough that you’ve left in the refrigerator.

, When you’re ready to bake your croissants, you want to ensure that your oven will be at the right temperature. Preheat it to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) so it will be hot enough for the croissants.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the correct temperature. It should beep or flash an indicator light when it’s ready.

, In a small bowl, beat 1 egg yolk. Add 1 tablespoon (10 g) of milk to the egg, and mix until thoroughly combined to form an egg wash glaze. Use a pastry brush to apply the glaze to all of your croissants., Place the croissants in the oven, and bake for 10 minutes. When the time is up, reduce your oven’s temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), and bake for 5 to 10 minutes or until the croissants are golden brown.Bake your croissants one sheet at time to avoid crowding the oven.

, When the croissants are done, remove them from the oven. Let them cool on the baking sheet for approximately 1 to 2 minutes, and then move them to a wire rack to cool completely.If desired, you can drizzle melted chocolate over the croissants so friends and family will know what’s inside.

You can use a stand mixer or mix the ingredients by hand with a spatula.
Be sure the milk doesn't come to a boil when you warm it. If it does, start over with new milk.;
, If you're using a stand mixer, you can simply let it continue to do the work for you for a minute or two after the ingredients are combined. If you're kneading by hand, punch out the dough 8 to 10 times. It should feel smooth and elastic when you're done.

, Place the dough into a clean bowl dusted with flour. The flour will make it easier to remove the dough from the bowl later. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel. Allow the dough to rise for one to two hours. When it's doubled in size, you'll be ready for the next step.


You can snip an X into the top of the dough to help the dough rise a little more quickly. Cut an X that's about 2 inches (5 cm) wide in the middle of the dough.
Place the dough in a warm area in your kitchen to help it rise faster.

, After the dough has doubled, gently remove it from the bowl and place it on a countertop lightly dusted with flour. Press the dough into an 8x12-inch rectangle (20x30 cm). Try to keep the edges as straight as possible. You can use your hands, or gently press down with a rolling pin.

Chill the dough.",How to Make Croissants2," Line the countertop with a large piece of wax paper. Put the chilled butter on the wax paper, and fold the end of the paper over the top. Use a rolling pin to roll the butter between the sheets of wax paper, into a 12x6-inch rectangle (30x15cm). Pound the stick a few times with the rolling pin to flatten it, then roll it out quickly into the rectangle. Try to work fast so the butter won't get too warm.


An important thing to keep in mind throughout this process is that you never want the butter to melt until you place it in the oven. Try to prevent it from ever getting warmer than room temperature. Place it back in the refrigerator when necessary.
It helps to chill your hands and kitchen equipment so you don't warm up the butter. Wash your hands with cold water, and work with cooking instruments that have been chilling in the refrigerator. Make sure your kitchen isn't too warm, too.

, Get the dough out of the fridge, and flatten it into a 14x8 inches (35x20 cm) rectangle. Place the rectangle of butter in the center of the rectangle of dough, lining it up so that it is at least a half-inch away from the edge of the dough.

, Fold up the bottom third of the dough to cover the middle third, and the top third down to cover both layers, like you'd fold a letter. Make sure the butter is evenly layered and folded up with the dough.

, Rotate the rectangle of dough 90 degrees, so that the short side of the rectangle is facing you. Roll the dough into a 14x8-inch rectangle (35x20 cm). This is the most important part of the process, and the trickiest one for most people to grasp: you're not rolling the butter into the dough. Instead, you're rolling out the dough and the butter so that the layers are ultra thin.


If the previous steps took you awhile and the butter was starting to look a little soft when you put it into the dough, consider chilling the dough for 15 to 20 minutes before rolling it out in this step. Remember, you want the butter to stay cold and in thin little layers within the dough; you don't want it to melt or become part of the dough.

, Just as you did before, fold the dough like a letter, into thirds.

, Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or wax paper, and place it in the refrigerator. Let it sit for 2 hours.

, Tap it gently with your rolling pin a few times to deflate it. Place it so that the top and bottom sides are short, and the right and left sides are long. Allow the dough to rest for 8 to 10 minutes.

, Roll out the dough into a 14x8 inches (35x20 cm) rectangle. Again, be careful not to press too hard — you don't want to crush the layers, just thin them out. Turn the dough again (folding it into thirds, like a letter). Now rotate the rectangle so that the short side is facing you. Roll it out into another 14x8-inch rectangle (35x20 cm). Fold it into thirds a final time.

, Wrap it in plastic wrap or wax paper again. Let the dough chill in the refrigerator for two more hours. You can leave it overnight if you wish, as long as you put something heavy on top to prevent it from rising.

, Use a pizza cutter or a knife to cut the dough in half lengthwise. You should end up with two 10x5-inch (25x12 cm) pieces of dough. Place one piece of dough on the baking sheet covered in wax paper. Put another layer of wax paper on top.

, Make two width-wise cuts on the strip of dough. Place two of the squares on the wax paper baking sheet. There should be a layer of wax paper separating them from your larger rectangle of dough. Put the baking sheet in the fridge to keep the butter chilled.

, You'll end up with two triangles, which will become your croissants.

, Starting at the widest side, roll the dough upward to the top of the triangle. Form it into a crescent, and place it on the buttered baking sheet so that the top of the triangle is pinned to the sheet by the croissant. Repeat with the second dough triangle.

, Remove another dough square from the refrigerator. Repeat the cutting and rolling process. Continue removing squares from the refrigerator, cutting them into triangles, and rolling the triangles into croissants until you run out of dough. You should end up with 8 croissants on your buttered baking sheet.

, Cover the baking sheet loosely with a clean dishtowel, and allow the croissants to rise for an hour.

Make use of parchment paper for various uses beyond the usual.",How to Use Parchment Paper in Cooking," Parchment paper can be obtained from the baking section of the supermarket and from specialty grocery stores. It is likely to be found in stores that stock cake-making, candy-making, and other food equipment. It is usually rolled up inside a box.

Check your favorite health food or eco-store for parchment paper that has been produced from recycled paper. The eco-friendly option is a good choice for paper that will get tossed away after use.;
, Most types of containers can be lined with parchment paper, including cookie and baking sheets (trays), baking pans and dishes, cake pans and tins, and casserole or stew dishes. Just keep in mind that baking paper is about food not sticking; it is not suitable to prevent juices or liquids from running.
, To prevent wrinkling of baked goods such as cakes, pies, and slices, cut the parchment paper to fit the container properly.

Read How to line a square baking pan for more details.

, As well as baking and cooking, parchment paper is an excellent surface for chocolate and candies that are setting.
, Parchment paper is useful for making pastry or icing cones, for measuring foods onto, for lining food gift boxes (great for candies and cookies), and for lining storage containers. It can even line drawers if needed!

Parchment paper is great for lining baking sheets used for heating up fries and greasy foods. This will stop the fat layer from ruining the sheet.

Make sure you calculate proper ratios when using spelt flour as a substitute in recipes.,
Check the Internet for specific spelt flour recipes, rather than using spelt as a substitute.,
Begin kneading the dough.",How to Use Spelt Flour1," Spelt flour has very fragile gluten, as compared to wheat flour. This means that you will want to treat your mixture differently than you would when using wheat flour.


Start out using only 1/2 of the ingredients that are called for in a wheat flour recipe. Remember, since spelt is different from wheat, it will require either less or more of what is usually in the recipe. One reason why you are only adding half is because spelt flour has a higher concentration of complex carbohydrates. This means that the bread itself will be lighter, fluffier, and have a softer crust. If you are making sponge dough, for example, spelt flour has a higher volume of rise.
A recipe that calls for one cup of wheat flour, 3 eggs and 2 cups of milk may change completely when spelt flour is substituted. To make sure that you do not overdo it on the other ingredients, it is always a good idea to start with half of the other ingredients and work up from there. Start with one egg and 1 cup of milk, and add more as needed.;
, Not all recipes are the same, so it may be a long, drawn out process to have to develop a conversion for all of them. Your best bet is to find new recipes that are designed specifically for spelt flour.

, While kneading, pay careful attention to the consistency of the dough. The general rule of thumb for spelt flour is to only add 3/4 of what you would normally add with wheat flour. When adding water, it is best to keep an eye on the mixture, and only use approximately 3/4 for what the recipe calls. You can always add more in small amounts as necessary.


If it is sticky and too wet, add more spelt flour to create a more dough-like texture.
If it is too dry and not sticking together, slowly add more of the liquid ingredients until a solid but pliable ball of dough forms.

"
"
Plan your diet to account for the nutritional differences between wheat and spelt.",How to Use Spelt Flour2," In addition to fiber, spelt also includes manganese, niacin, copper, phosphorous, protein and vitamin B2.


Spelt is available in two different forms. You can either come by white spelt, or whole spelt. The only real difference is that the white spelt mix has removed the germ and bran from the grain. This might make the bread taste better and increase its sweet flavoring, but it will also remove some of the many health benefits included in the germ and bran in the spelt flour.

Review your assignment.,
Prepare for your assignment.,
Consult your school's electronic databases.,
Talk to a librarian.,
Don't be afraid of paper books.,
Evaluate your sources carefully.,
Skim resources for a broad picture of your topic.,
Collect research for your paper.,
Keep your research organized.",How to Write a Research Paper on the History of the English Language1," This is where you will evaluate how much and what type of information you will need to collect. Brainstorm about what your paper will look like. Plan how you will approach the assignment. Think about how many pages your paper needs to be. Your teacher or professor may specify what type of sources to use.


Make a list of your own deadlines for different steps of the writing process. Allow yourself enough time for each step. This works best if you either write deadlines into your planner or calendar, or even make your own small calendar for this assignment to post in your work area. Think about key terms or topics you will need to look up like the Anglo-Saxons, the Great Vowel Shift, Old English, Middle English, Beowulf, The Norman Conquest, Geoffery Chaucer, and Shakespeare.;
, Do a brief internet search on the history of the English language just to become generally familiar with the topic at hand. The internet is not a great source for this type of history-based nonfiction topic, but you could get the basic idea of what types of information you will be discovering and sorting through.


During prewriting (the process during which you prepare to write), think about your audience. Presumably, the audience is your teacher or a reader who knows a little bit about the topic. The tone, academic level and writing style should match with the audience.

, Before you start writing, you will need to find sources to use in the paper. Since this is a research paper, you’ll want to find reputable sources to cite and take information from. Think about what types of sources would be appropriate. In this case, they may be English, history or language related from your school's electronic database. If you aren't sure how to access it from a computer, call or e-mail your library staff at the school. They are always there to help.

, Use the local library or school library resources and employees to find books on the topic “history of the English language.” Many schools have librarians specially trained to help locate hard-to-find research resources. Don't be afraid to ask any questions you might have. You are learning, after all. , Your school or local librarians are there to help you find related nonfiction books. The internet doesn't have all the in-depth historical information you need for this sort of topic. In general, it's good to use other sources besides just the internet.

, Look through the books, academic journals and other materials you’ve collected about the history of the English language. Take notes on the information you think is important or put bookmarks or sticky notes on pages you want to revisit. You’ll need to think about what information you want to incorporate into your paper.


Someone’s blog or a “sketchy” looking web site are not good sources. Try looking for governmental, academic or news related sites, if you plan to use any.

, Glance through each source before deciding to use it. Make sure the type of information the source contains are what you can use in the paper. You'll gain basic knowledge on the topic and get a good idea on how you want to structure the paper.

, Keep track of all the good sources you found for your paper. Academic and in-depth information is often found in academic journals accessible through the school's systems or in nonfiction books. If you found a good source at the library, take it out, or request copies of the pages you'll need. Carefully note where any copied pieces of paper came from. You can also bookmark information electronically or in books. Keep all your sources in one place.

, Label all the sections of information you want to cite in your paper. Keep track of what topics each section of information cover with notes, sticky notes or other methods. Remember, you are the master of your own organization. The more organized you are, the easier it will be to make an outline, and ultimately write your paper.


Remember you are mostly looking for the highlights and main points from sources since your paper only will have so many pages. You do not have to become an expert, but you will have to pull out key facts and summarize information presented.
Label any quotes you want to include in your paper. Remember, quotes are always used word for word and must be cited properly. Only use quotes that you think say something important in a great straightforward way. "

Start with an outline.,
Spend time on your thesis.,
Flesh out an introduction around your thesis.,
Write the body of your essay.,
Cite while you write.,
Integrate research with your own ideas.,
Write a conclusion.,
Finalize your works cited (reference) page.",How to Write a Research Paper on the History of the English Language2," This will ensure your paper has a logical order. Think about the key questions and points you want to explore. You may break the paper into sections based on time and key important advancements, inventions or people. You could write about Old English, Middle English and Modern English. , The thesis is the main point of your paper, so think hard about what you want it to be. It's usually a sentence at the end of your first paragraph that makes an argument (a point you are trying to prove) about the topic. Think of something that is relevant to the topic based on your research that you are able to prove with the evidence you've collected. Remember, you only have so many pages to prove it. You can always edit your thesis as you learn more about the topic.
Make sure the main idea of the thesis is carried out throughout the content of the paper.

, Begin with an introduction that discusses the importance and role of English language in the context of our culture. Get the reader familiar with the topic in a brief way. The introduction should focus on the themes and point of your thesis. End with the thesis itself. , Keep the flow and organization in mind during your first draft. It doesn't have to be perfect. Try to think of each paragraph as one main point, time period or issue. This is where you will use the outline and research you've previously collected.


Make sure that you elaborate by adding as much information as appropriate.
You may consider asking your teacher for advice when you have questions. That’s what they are there for.

, Use your sources and cite them as you go. Any information that is not common knowledge needs to be cited. You may need to reference web sites or books such as Purdue OWL https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/658/01/. Your school may also have reference materials or help available.


Make sure to include in-text citations. EasyBib http://www.easybib.com is a good site to cite your sources properly. Different format styles require different types of citations. In MLA format, you will put the last name of the author in parenthesis before your period at the end of each sentence.

, Since this is an original paper, you should be proving a point (your thesis) using the sources you've discovered. Try to come up with your own conclusions. Think of the overall theme or revelation that someone could come up with after researching your topic. You want to slowly guide the reader to your thesis using proven information from your sources.


For example, you'll want to say something about the evolution of the English language that can be proven, in this case.

, Make sure it wraps up the paper and ties together all the ideas. Think about what the point of the paper is. In this case, you’ll want to tie together all of the advancements and changes in English language. Show how everything in your paper comes together for one main idea or message. Think: What’s the point? Remember, you are not restating ideas or your thesis, but showing how they all come together in our present day speech and writing. , Make sure you follow the format of the style your teacher assigned (like MLA, APA, etc.) You should find examples in an English reference book or you can visit Purdue OWL https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/. This is where keeping careful track of all your sources comes in. Do not leave out any required information from the source list. All of the sources in the works cited page should be used inside the paper itself.

"
Make substantive revisions first.,
Proofread for conventions.,
Ensure you're following style guidelines appropriately.,
Do a final edit after a break if possible.,
Turn your paper in on time.",How to Write a Research Paper on the History of the English Language3," Make sure the paper flows. This means you use transitional phrases and each paragraph has a clear point. Also check to make sure your paper doesn't have any extra information that doesn't go with the topic of the paper. Does the paper prove the point that was given in your thesis? Now is the time to rearrange any paragraphs or add any pertinent information that's necessary to prove your point. Make sure your paper has an introduction, body and conclusion that all solidify the thesis. It's ok to make major changes at this stage of the game.

, Begin by correcting any common mistakes such as grammar and spelling. Make sure you intended the beginning of each paragraph. Each sentence must have the right punctuation. Some of these issues are basic, but they are east to overlook. , Make sure you write in paragraph form and follow whatever format you are supposed to write in (like MLA or APA). The style and format should be in line with the expectations your teacher provides. Each format has its own rules. Refer to a reference book or search online for the name of the association name of your style. , Look over your paper other time. Sometimes it's easy to miss small errors after you are used to reading the paper. Ask someone to look over your draft. Another person will find errors you didn't catch. Even professional writers need to proofread time after time. Remember that proofreading doesn’t just entail finding grammar, spelling and punctuation errors. Sometimes the writer needs to rearrange content, delete parts or add important information.


Visit your school’s writing or tutoring center, if it has one.
Review your assignment sheet again. Make sure you met the word count.
Make sure you didn’t use the wrong word in any sentences. Spellcheck will not catch the wrong words used. , Look through your paper one last time and make some final touches. Make sure it ends on a strong note. Then, print it out and hand it in! Make sure you staple the pages in the right order.

Submit your paper!",How to Write a Research Paper in a Day," Before you pick a topic, you will want to be sure that it fits within the confines of the assignment. Read the instructions very carefully; you don’t want to waste time writing something and then find out that it doesn’t fit the assignment.


Imagine that this is your prompt: “Though virtually every 19th century woman did domestic work inside the home, many also labored outside of their homes. Choose an occupation that American women frequently held in the 19th century. Write an 8-10 page research paper about this occupation.”
Take note of the particular confines of the research paper. For example, you can only write about women’s work, and you must stick with a job American women held in the 1800s.;
, Think about the topics you already know a little about from class or personal interest. Your list of possible topics for a paper on 19th century women’s labor might look like this:


teacher
midwife
innkeeper
seamstress
factory laborer

, If any of them return very few results, cross them off your list. You won’t have time to track down sources for a difficult topic, so go with one that returns lots of hits.


Be sure that a lot of your hits return results from credible sources. Look for sites that end in .edu or .gov. Check to see if a Google search returns any books on your topic. Odds are good that you’ll be able to find at least part of the book (or a book review) online, so this will help you later.

, Pick a topic that returned a lot of credible hits on Google, and, if possible, also interests you.


Let’s imagine that you chose midwives as the topic of your paper on 19th century women’s labor. This topic returned a lot of hits from university and government sources, and there appear to be lots of books about 19th century American midwifery.

, It’s a good idea to write a simple outline before you get too far into your research. This will help you form more in-depth searches.Odds are good that you will have to alter the outline as you go, but that’s okay. You may want to include some questions that you have about your topic in your preliminary outline.


You will probably want one subtopic for roughly every 2-3 pages.

So for a 10 page paper, try to think of at least 3-4 subtopics. It’s okay to have too many or too few at this stage.


Your outline on 19th century midwifery may look something like this:

Demographics - Which women were midwives? (Age? Race? Class?)
Payment - Did people pay them cash?
Daily life - Did midwives have other responsibilities beyond childbirth? What did their daily lives consist of?
Laws - Legality of midwifery?
Qualifications - How did a person get to be a midwife?
Stats - How many women were midwives?



, Especially since you’re in a hurry, you don’t want to have to waste valuable minutes trying to find a website you saw an hour ago. Choose an organization system that works well for you.Consider:


Bookmarking the websites on your browser of choice
Copy and pasting links into a Word or Google document (which you can later turn into a Bibliography)
Using a research organization tool such as Zotero (or any other site that keeps track of sources and creates Bibliographies)

, Be sure to try various ways of phrasing it.


For example, if you want to find out about midwife demographics first, there are a variety of ways you might accomplish this. You might search variations on any of the following:

”19th century midwife demographics”
”how old were most 19th century midwives?”
”19th century midwives, race”



, At this point, you should just skim them for relevance to your topic. You will look at them more carefully as you start to write.Don’t spend more than one minute on each page. If you’re fairly certain that it contains information that can help you, save it, and move on.
For example, if your search “19th century midwife demographics” returned a chart from a university website organizing midwives by age, race, class, and location, you do not need to read the chart carefully right now. This is obviously a source that will help you, so you should save it and move on.

, Google and Amazon have both digitized a huge quantity of books.Start by searching for your subtopic on Google and Amazon. Save links to any books that appear.
If you find part of a relevant book on Amazon, but it’s missing pages that might help you, try Google Books (and vice versa). One of the two sites may have the part that you need.
The advantage to looking at digitized version of books is that you can use the search feature to find keywords relevant to your topic.
If you find a book that has exactly what you need, but the text of it is not available online, you may want to make a quick trip to your library and check it out. If you’re not writing your whole paper in the library, it’s probably best to save a trip there until you have finished doing online research so that you can get everything you need all at once.

For example, a book with a title like, American Midwifery Before and After the Civil War may be worth the effort to track down.
On the other hand, a book called, Life in the 18th Century, which appears to include just a few paragraphs on midwifery, may not be worth your time.



, This search engine will return peer-reviewed and reliable sources. Save your results.


This search will return both scholarly articles and books. If any books appear, don’t forget to go back and check for them on Amazon or Google Books.
If you find a particularly helpful article, look for the “related articles” link. Clicking this may yield more good sources.
Some articles that Google Scholar returns will only have a preview or an abstract. If you can’t get all of the information you need from the text that appears, you can usually buy the article for less than $20. You may want to wait until you have conducted the bulk of your research to determine whether any articles are worth buying.

, If you have access to a college or university library, login, and choose a database such as JSTOR, Proquest, or LexisNexis.


Search for your topic and subtopics in any of the databases you have access to.
If you don’t have access to a college or university library, and you are having trouble finding enough resources online, it might be worth your time to figure out if any of your friends or family has a university library login.

, Be sure to save all of the relevant sources.


At this point, you still shouldn’t be carefully reading every source you find. Even if you aren’t 100% sure that the source will be helpful to you, save it. Eliminating sources later is much easier than having to do more research at the last minute.
For example, maybe you ran across an article that discussed 19th century midwifery worldwide. A quick skim shows you that there may be some information here that helps you write about American midwives, but it’s hard to tell how much of the information will be useful at this point. Save the article anyway, and you can return to it later if you need to.

, This is the time to decide for sure which subtopics you will write about. You will probably want at least 2-3 pages per subtopic, depending on how much information you found. Narrow your focus to the topics that you have lots of information on.


If any of your subtopics did not turn up enough relevant results for you to write a few pages about them, cross them off your outline.

Perhaps you didn’t find much about how midwives were paid. There are a few good websites that talk about the exchange of goods in payment for midwifery services, but not enough information to yield several paragraphs. Cross this topic off your list or absorb it into another subtopic, such as “daily life.”


If any of your searches yielded ideas for new subtopics, add them to your outline.

Maybe as you were searching, you discovered that 19th century American midwives frequently clashed with professional, licensed physicians, and you found lots of good sources discussing this issue. Add an appropriate subtopic (such as “conflicts with doctors”) to your outline.



, Pick the subtopic that you feel most comfortable with, and start writing about that topic, then work your way through the other subtopics.


Keep a Word or Google document open on one side of your computer (or one monitor, if you have dual monitors), and open your first resource under your first subtopic on the other side (or the other monitor). Be sure that you can see both at the same time. This will save you a lot of time switching back and forth between screens and losing your place.
Beginning with the first source that you open, start reading carefully. Absorb the information, and then write about it in your own words.
Don’t edit much as you go. It’s okay to just let your ideas flow at this point. Don’t waste time editing sentences that you may eliminate later.
Don’t worry much about phrasing at this point. If you come to a place where you don’t know how to express your thought, just make a note about what you’re trying to express, highlight it so that you remember to return to it, and move on.
Don’t write your introduction first. Your introduction will need to sum up your major points, so you should not write it until you’ve written the bulk of your paper.

, Check your research paper instructions to determine how your instructor wants you to cite your sources.


Each time you use information from a particular source, cite it. Be very careful not to plagiarize in your haste.
You probably don’t want to write out a full citation as you’re creating your first draft. Simply inserting a link or the title and author’s name is okay at this point. Don’t waste valuable time formatting citations for information that you may decide to eliminate later.

, After you’ve written a couple of sections, return to your outline. Are you going to have enough information to reach the page limit using only the subtopics you’ve written about so far? Do you need to expand the subtopics a bit?


For example, maybe you discovered that there is a lot to say about the daily lives of midwives. You might want to cut out some of the other subtopics that you haven’t written about yet.

, Write about any remaining subtopics on your outline, being sure to cite as you go.


Keep an eye on the page limit. You don’t want to write the bare minimum, because you’ll look like a slacker. On the other hand, you don’t want to waste valuable time by writing much more than you have to.

, It may seem counterproductive to stop working when you are under a time crunch, but it is important to let your brain rest for a little while so that your ideas can gel. Take a quick walk, do some yoga, eat a snack, or run a quick errand.

, Now that your ideas are all down on paper, summarize your arguments and major points in the intro and conclusion.


Write a strong thesis statement stating your major point or argument. Be sure that this sentence is the last sentence in your introduction.
For example, perhaps the major point of your paper on midwives is “Nineteenth century American midwives, most of whom were middle-aged, working class women, struggled to practice their trade in the face of economic hardships, increasing legal restrictions, and competition from licensed male physicians.”

, This is a good time to flesh out half-formed thoughts. Keep your eye out for spelling and grammatical mistakes, but don’t worry too much about this yet.


Eliminate any paragraphs or sentences that don’t support your thesis.
This is the time to slow down and read everything carefully.

, Be sure to do so according to the style guide your instructor or discipline prefers. Common style guides include


Chicago: http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html

APA: http://www.apastyle.org/

MLA: https://www.mla.org/MLA-Style

The Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) can help with most style guide questions: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/


, Be sure to only include sources that you actually used in the paper. Refer to the appropriate style guide for formatting.

, At this point, you will probably be very tired. Grab a cup of coffee, eat a snack, do some jumping jacks. Try to resist the urge to look at screens. Your eyes are probably tired of staring at the computer.

, Check for spelling and grammar errors and inconsistencies.


If you have access to a printer, it’s a good idea to look at a hard copy at this stage.

, Phew!

Optionally, prepare a baking sheet.,

Cut out two-inch biscuits.,
Bake the biscuits until lightly browned.",How to Make Easy Homemade Biscuits1," This recipe uses a high baking temperature to cut down on cooking time. While you wait for your oven to heat up, you can proceed to the next few steps to save even more time.;
, This recipe does not call for baking sheet that's been greased or made ""non-stick"" in any way. However, if you wish to grease your baking sheet with shortening or a non-stick spray, this won't hurt the biscuits. This may be a good idea if you have had problems with baked goods sticking to the pan in the past.


Other alternatives include using a sheet of baking parchment or sprinkling a layer of flour over the baking sheet.

, Add the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Whisk together until well-blended.

, Measure the oil and pour it into a separate bowl or container. Next, measure the milk and pour it on top of the oil. Do not stir or combine these ingredients. Pour them together into the bowl containing the dry ingredients.

, Use a mixing utensil or your hands to lightly combine the wet and dry ingredients. Transfer the dough to a floured surface (countertops work well) and knead once or twice to form a ball of dough.


You don't want to mix too much or the biscuits can lose their light, flaky texture. Be sure to stop mixing when the dry ingredients are almost uniformly moist and sticky — a few tiny clumps that aren't combined are OK. Be sure also to knead only once or twice.

, You have a little freedom here depending on how thick you like your biscuits. On the same floured surface where you kneaded the dough, roll it out to about 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick. You can use either a roller or your hands as long as you get the dough uniformly flat.


To cut down on mess, you can put the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap before rolling it if you wish.

, Use a round cookie cutter to cut circles of dough two inches in diameter from the flattened dough. Dust the biscuit cutter in flour first to prevent sticking. Transfer the cut-out biscuits to your baking pan, leaving at least an inch of space between each so they cook evenly.


When you've cut out all the biscuits you can from the dough, roll the leftovers into a ball and flatten it again, then repeat.

, This will typically take about 10-12 minutes. However, since you're using high heat, it's wise to check on the biscuits after about eight minutes just to be safe.


After carefully removing the baking pan from the oven, let the biscuits sit for about five minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature."

However, if you notice major differences between the instructions below and the instructions on the packaging, stick to the latter for best results. The directions in this section are intended to be general — they may not work in all cases.

, As with the recipe above, you do not need to grease or prepare your baking sheet, though you can if you wish. Proceed to the next steps while you wait for your oven to warm.

, There are only two ingredients in this recipe — the mix and the milk. Pour the mix into a large bowl, then add the milk. Stir lightly to combine. Stop stirring as soon as the dough reaches a uniformly sticky, flaky consistency.


Note that some biscuit mixes may call for you to add oil or butter as well. Check the directions to be safe.

, Turn the sticky dough onto a floured baking surface (you can use the biscuit mix itself as well). Use your hands to turn the dough over on itself 10 times. Kneading more can cause the biscuits to lose their light, flaky qualities.

, From this point on, the directions are almost the same as for the recipe above. Use a roller or your hands to roll the dough ball into a 1/2-inch thick layer. If you wish, you can roll the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap to prevent a mess.

, Use a 2-inch cookie cutter to cut circular biscuits from the flattened dough. Transfer each circle of dough to your baking pan. Re-combine the leftover dough into another ball, roll it flat, and repeat.

, This should take about 8-10 minutes in your preheated oven. When the biscuits are done, let them cool on the pan for about 5 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack and let them cool until pleasantly warm.

Crust the bread up with steam.",How to Make Bread1," For this basic French bread, all you'll need is:


6 cups of all-purpose white flour
1 tsp. salt
2 cups of warm water
3 tsp. or 1 package active dry yeast
;
, In a cup or a small bowl, mix your yeast with about a 1/4 cup of warm warm (100-110˚F) water. The temperature of the water needs to be warm to the touch, but not hot. If the water is too warm, the yeast will be killed, while if it's too cool, it won't activate enough to make the bread rise properly. It should be warm enough you could keep your finger in it without becoming uncomfortable.


After a minute or two, the mixture should start to take on a thicker, frothy texture, and should smell a lot like a beer. If it's bubbly and thick, the yeast is activated properly and ready to go.
If you use ""Rapid Rise"" or self-activated yeast, you don't have to activate the yeast before adding it to the flour. Skip this step and go to the next.


, The bowl needs to be big enough to hold all your flour and water together at once and mix it comfortably, preferably with a sturdy wooden spoon. When you've mixed the dry ingredients, you can also add the yeast, whether you're using quick yeast or the bubbly activated wet mixture. Stir it into the flour.


Alternatively, you can mix the dough in an electric mixer or KitchenAid, provided you've got a dough hook attachment. Mixing the dough, however, is only a short part of making a loaf of French bread, so it's usually easier to just mix it up by hand. It's not necessary to use a mixer, especially because you'll need to get your hands dirty anyway!

, Slowly add water to the bowl with one hand, while you stir the flour with the wooden spoon in your other hand. You're looking to form the initial dough and get all the ingredients to come together into a workable mass, so it's important to keep your spoon moving. It can be helpful to have someone add the water while you stir, or vice versa.


The amount of water you'll need to make the dough can be quite variable (less in humid climates) but you'll get it with some practice. Add slowly and stir, watching the dough come together. As soon as the bread starts coming together in the bowl, you should stop adding water.
Reach into the bowl with your hands (get some flour on them first) and pull the dough together. Push all the stray bits of wet dough into the ball and start to form the basic dough in the bowl before turning it out. 


, Let the dough rest for at least five minutes. At this stage, the gluten strands are starting to form, giving the bread its wonderfully chewy texture. The strands are forming whether you're kneading or not, so it'll be easier to knead if you let the gluten do its work for a few minutes, making your job easier by bringing the bread together.


In the meantime, you can clean the mixing bowl out thoroughly, before using it to rise the dough.

, The initial kneading is the most important step in preparing the dough. You want to firmly knead constantly for at least 5-10 minutes, or until the dough feels smooth. The surface of the dough should be soft and look mostly uniform, not tacky or lumpy. If it looks like the craggy surface of the moon, keep kneading, adding flour as necessary.


It takes some practice to get the motion right, but it's a lot like Mr. Miyagi's advice from Karate Kid: wax on, wax off. You want to push hard into the dough, rolling it away from you, and folding it over. Don't be afraid to push hard, as if you were trying to push through the dough and touch the table, pushing it forward and rolling it over.
Make sure your hands are well-floured, and that the dough isn't sticking to the surface by keeping a light dusting of flour on both. If the dough seems wet, add more flour to the surface of the dough by sprinkling it on and continue moving it.


, Put the dough back into the bowl after cleaning it out thoroughly (or at least rinsing it) and cover with plastic wrap, or a towel. Keep the dough in a warm, but not hot, place. The ideal temperature is about 70-75 degrees F for dough to rise.


If it's cold in your house, or you're baking in the middle of winter, a good place to rise your dough is on or in the stove while it's off, letting the warm pilot light control the rise.


, You don't need to knead the dough for nearly as long as you did before the first rising. Roll it over a few times on a floured surface and return it to the bowl for the second rise. Here, you're looking to simply reform the dough into the basic shape you started with. It won't take long and the dough should be much more easy to work with, smooth and soft., Opinions vary on the necessity of a second rising: some bakers skip the second rise and go straight to forming loaves and proofing the dough before baking, while some bakers prefer three risings for the best consistency. Good crusty French bread is distinctive for the airy inner crumb, which you'll only get from lots of little bubbles created by the yeast in the rising. If you want to make ""real"" French bread and you've got the time, rise it twice, or three times. If you want that hot delicious bread smell filling your kitchen like ten minutes ago, go ahead and skip it. It'll still be great.

, Remove the dough from the bowl and cut it into however many distinct loaves, batards, or baguettes you want to bake, then start rolling it out.



To form boules cut the dough in half and reform into two simple rounded lumps like you've been forming. Place them onto a sheet sprinkled with a small amount of cornmeal and cover.

To form baguettes cut the dough into 4 equal portions and roll them out on a floured surface, long and skinny. It'll take several rollings to get them worked out long enough, so keep moving from the center of the loaf outward, rolling them as evenly as possible.

To form batards, cut the dough into 4 or 6 portions and roll shorter, squatter baguettes. There's no perfect way to roll them, and they'll taste good no matter what.

, After placing your rolled-out loaves onto the baking sheets you intend to use in the baking, cover them for at least 45 minutes and let them plump back up before putting them in the oven.


It's customary to cut the top of the loaf, with an X or your own patented pattern before putting it in the oven. Make small cuts, about half an inch into the dough, spaced about an inch away from other cuts to let the dough plump up evenly as it bakes. 


, The bread will be ready to come out when there's a good golden crust on it and the bottom of the bread is firm, making a hollow-ish knocking sound when you tap on it or flick it with your finger.

, The secret to the perfect crust? Steam. Use a spray bottle to periodically squirt the bread, or squirt the inside of the oven with a small amount of water a few times during the baking to create a steamy mist on the inside of the oven that'll yield a crunchy exterior, perfect for French bread.


Alternatively, it's common to put a pan of water in the oven on a rack under the bread, so allow steam to gradually form throughout the baking process. Experiment some with your oven to see what works best for you.

If they are covered with foil, go ahead and loosen it to allow some air to circulate.If the rolls were frozen in a pan, it is fine to leave them that way, just make sure to give them ample time to warm prior to baking.;
, If you’ve stored your rolls in the refrigerator, then you can shorten the thawing time quite a bit. Usually 10 minutes is sufficient to thaw rolls not encased in a container. You may need to go up to 30 minutes if the rolls are packaged., If the rolls are individually wrapped, then unwrap each of them before setting them out to thaw. It is best if the rolls are not touching. If the rolls are wrapped as part of a package, loosen the covering or remove it entirely to prepare for baking., After the rolls are fully thawed, get out a baking sheet and place them on it at least one inch apart. Place them in a 400 degree Fahrenheit (204 degree Celsius) oven for 10-25 minutes until they are completely reheated. You can gauge the doneness of the rolls by looking for a golden appearance and by breaking open a test roll to see if the interior is warm.You can also place the rolls into a brown paper bag with a few sprinkles of water on top. Close the bag tightly. Place this bag within a 350 degree Fahrenheit (176 degree Celsius) oven and bake for 10 minutes., Set your toaster oven to preheat to 350 degrees. Place the rolls within the oven, evenly spaced out and not touching the sides. Bake for between two to ten minutes, depending on the oven’s temperature performance., Wrap each individual rolls in a moistened paper towel. Place a single roll at a time in the microwave. Cook for 10 seconds or so per roll. Carefully remove the roll and continue the process, being careful not to burn your hands.You can also do a combination method where you start by microwaving the rolls and then move them into the toaster oven to get the crispiness on the outside. This works especially well with French bread rolls., In the period between reheating and serving, keep the temperature of your rolls steady by putting them in a basket or other container with a kitchen towel placed over them. If you keep this towel in place, it will hold in the warmth., This is the best option when serving reheated rolls. Take them directly from the heating element onto the serving dish for the table. This will make it possible for any butter applied to the rolls to melt immediately and evenly. It will also prevent the rolls from becoming dried out as they cool in temperature., If any of your rolls that were reheated remain uneaten, then you can usually place them in a sealed container for up to two days. You can even try to reheat them once more, but it will likely dry them out and negatively impact the taste.Of course, you will also want to keep an eye on the appearance of the rolls. Don’t eat a roll if you see any signs of mold or discoloration.

, Either directly before or after warming, get out a pastry brush and apply melted butter to the tops of the rolls. This will help the rolls to retain some moisture and will also add taste to the final product., If you are concerned that the rolls will have a plain flavor, then select a number of fresh herbs. Chop them up finely. Sprinkle them on top of the rolls prior to baking. Some of the best herb options are oregano, rosemary, and sage.You can also choose herbs that will complement the rest of the meal. For example, if you are eating potatoes as well then dill might be a good option.

, The reheating process can leave some rolls tasting stale. To counteract this, get a pinch of sea salt and place it on top of each roll. This will add a bit of texture and flavor to the roll. It may also make it possible for the rolls to last longer after reheating."

Additions or alternative ingredients will be suggested throughout, but for the basic starter sandwich bread, you'll need:


6 cups all-purpose flour (white or whole wheat)
3 tsp. or 1 package active dry yeast
1 cup water
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons of unsalted butter
2 tablespoons of sugar or honey
1 tablespoon of salt
oil (optional)
1 egg, beaten (optional)

, Using 1 cup of warm water (100-110 deg. F), sprinkle the yeast into the bowl of a standing mixer or a large mixing bowl and cover it with water to let it activate.

, Heat the milk quickly on the stove over high heat, until just before it boils, then take it off the heat and add in the butter and the sugar, mixing it thoroughly. You don't want to actually burn the milk, and be careful that it doesn't boil over, since milk tends to start frothing very quickly. Keep an eye on it and take it off the heat as soon as it starts to steam. Let it cool down slightly before you add it to the yeast.


Alternatively, it's perfectly fine to heat the milk in the microwave and add the butter and sugar when it's hot., Stir the mixer for about 2 minutes at medium speed. As the dough starts to form, gradually continue adding in the rest of the flour, one cup at a time. When all the flour has been added, beat on a higher setting for 2 more minutes.


How much flour you use will depend on how humid it is, so keep an eye on the dough and use your judgment. Wheat flour is likewise very different to work with--you'll likely need to use less of it to form the dough. When you're first starting out, it might be a good idea to use half wheat and half white flour to get used to the difference.

, Press all the leftover crumbs of flour into the dough ball, then turn the lump out onto your floury kneading surface. Keep kneading until the dough has a soft, smooth surface texture that springs back when you push into it.


Alternatively, it's perfectly fine to knead in your electric mixer, provided you've got a bread hook. It can be much easier on the hands. Knead the dough in the mixer for about 10 minutes to form the gluten strands that'll give the bread a wonderfully chewy texture.

, This stops the surface from drying out and cracking while it rises--the dried dough will become nasty lumps in your finished bread. Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel or plastic wrap and put the bowl in a warm (but not hot) location.


Leave the dough alone for about 90 minutes while it rises. It should about double in size, or at least plump up significantly if you're using a lot of wheat flour.

, Put your fists on the ball of dough and squish it until it's about the size you started with. You don't need to knead it again, as the dough should be soft and springy. Divide the dough into two equal portions with a chef's knife or a pastry knife to form your loaves.

, On your kneading surface, roll out the dough with your hands by flattening it first into a kind of tall rectangle, then folding the bottom and top in toward the middle and pinching the seam closed. This will make the bottom of the loaf.Add the loaves into the greased pans and cover the pans again with the towel to let the dough rise again for 30-45 minutes while you clean up the kneading surface and preheat the oven.

, Before adding the bread into the oven, slit the dough 3 or 4 times about a half inch deep to score the surface, then top with beaten egg or oil if you want to create a shiny crisp top crust.


The bread is finished when the bottom of the loaf is firm, and you're able to make a hollow tapping with your finger. If you're not sure, turn it out of the pan and check by tapping on it with your finger a few times. It'll be hot, so be careful.

Simply mix together 3 cups of white flour, a half cup of sugar, and a 12 oz can of beer thoroughly in a bowl. Pour the batter into a greased loaf pan, brush with melted butter, and bake at 375 F for 45-50 minutes. It's impossible to mess up and makes a great quick accompaniment to dinner.

, Soda breads can be sweet or savory, depending on your tastes and the ingredients available. For a simple one, mix together your dry ingredients: 4 cups of flour with a tsp each of salt and baking soda, then add several tablespoons of sugar (1 if you want savory bread, up to 4 if you want it sweeter). For the wet ingredients, mix together 2 cups of milk or buttermilk with four tablespoons of melted butter and combine everything in a bowl. Knead lightly and bake in a greased loaf pan for about an hour at 375 F.


Common additions include lemon or orange zest and dried fruits or nuts. Serve topped with marmalade or plain.

Bring the water to a boil and cook the potato until it is soft. This should take approximately 30 to 40 minutes.Poke the potato with a paring knife to see if it is fully cooked. The knife should be able to easily penetrate the potato with no resistance.

, Place the cooked potato into a ricer and then squeeze the ricer closed. This will force the potato through small holes pressing the potato into a smooth consistency. The peel will remain in the ricer and can be discarded.You can also use a standard potato masher, mixer, or fork if you do not have a ricer. Make sure the potatoes are thoroughly mashed with no remaining lumps.

, Using a stand up mixer with the whisk attachment, combine 1 cup (237 ml) of whole milk and ¾ of a cup (177 ml) of mashed potato. Continue to mix until there are no lumps remaining., Then, add ½ a cup (118 ml) of melted butter and continue to mix until the butter has been completely incorporated., Switch to the dough hook attachment on the stand-up mixer and add 1 ½ cups (473 ml) of all-purpose flour, ¼ ounce (14 g) of active yeast, and three heaping tablespoons of sugar. Mix on medium speed until a wet and sticky dough is formed. This will take approximately two minutes.While mixing, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to make sure that all of the ingredients are completely combined.

, Place the uncovered dough in a warm location and let it stand for approximately 30 minutes. The dough should puff up and rise slightly., Then, add 2 large eggs, 1 egg yolk, 2 ⅔ cups (630 ml) of bread flour, and one tablespoon of salt. Mix together on a medium-high setting, until the dough is a smooth and elastic consistency. You may need to add a bit more flour in order to reach the desired consistency.This should take approximately five minutes.

, Brush the dough with melted butter and then cover and let stand in a warm location for approximately 30 minutes. During this time the dough will expand about 1 ½ times the original size., Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and then divide the dough into 18 equal parts., Then, using your hands roll each of the parts into a ball and place them on a buttered pan. The baking pan should be 9x13 inches (22x33 cm).Place the dough balls close enough together so that they touch. This way when you are finished baking them you will have to pull apart the rolls.

, Brush the rolls with melted butter and then let them sit, uncovered, for an additional hour. The rolls should almost double in size during this period., While the rolls are left to rise, you can begin to preheat the oven. This can be done when the rolls have approximately 15 minutes left to rise. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius)., Once the dough rolls have finished rising, brush them once more with butter and sprinkle them with a little bit of sea salt. Then, bake them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the tops of the rolls are a nice golden brown., After the rolls have finished baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool in the pan for approximately 10 minutes. You can move the pan onto a wire rack while they cool., Once the rolls have cooled slightly, remove them from the pan and let them cool for an additional 30 minutes directly on the wire rack. When the rolls are not longer piping hot, they are ready to be served."

Buy or order vital wheat gluten.,
Measure out the all-purpose flour for your recipe.,
Add one teaspoon vital wheat gluten per cup of flour.,
Add a small amount of whole wheat flour.,
Mix well.",How to Make Bread Flour1," For this recipe, you'll need only two ingredients: all-purpose flour and vital wheat gluten. All-purpose flour can be purchased at nearly any grocery store. However, you may need to make a trip to a health food store or a baking supply store to find vital wheat gluten.Alternatively, if you can stand to wait, vital wheat gluten is easily available for order online. Either way, it is not especially expensive — a small bag should cost less than $10.You won't need more than a few teaspoons of vital wheat gluten for most bread recipes.;
, Look at the recipe to see how much bread flour is required. Measure out this much all-purpose flour instead. Pour this flour into a mixing bowl separate from the other ingredients.

, This converts all-purpose flour to a form that can be used just like bread flour. This ratio scales proportionally.


For instance, if your recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of bread flour, you would add 2 1/2 teaspoons vital wheat gluten to 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour.

, This step isn't essential, but a little wheat flour works well as a binding agent and gives the bread a subtle ""nutty"" flavor. Add no more than 1/2 teaspoon per cup of all-purpose flour so as not to affect the total volume of your dry ingredients., Sift the ingredients above together in the bowl. Once they are well incorporated, you will be left with a substance you can use in place of bread flour.


The gluten in the new flour substitute will give the final product a denser, ""stronger"" bread than you would have otherwise. Don't be alarmed if your bread turns out with a slightly different texture than it had before.

",How to Make Bread from Scratch," This mixture is the first half of what will be used to leaven the bread. If you took the yeast from a yeast packet, be sure to save the rest for the second batch of leavening ingredients.






;
, By putting the yeasty mixture into the refrigerator, you slow down the fermentation process. This gives the dough extra time to absorb some of the gasses let off by the yeast (yielding a softer dough later on) and gives the bread an aged flavor. (You may think that ""aged"" doesn't sound good for bread, but it is.) Moreover, the extra time and hydration help to form the gluten strands that are so very important for bread dough.









To leaven, yeast needs to reproduce quickly (to produce the gasses inside the bread); for the best flavor/texture, however, it needs to reproduce slowly. By making half of the pre-ferment in a cool place, you can get the best of both worlds.

, This is the fast stage two of the fermentation process.









If you plan to knead the dough with an electric mixer, add this mix to a mixing container.

, If you’re using the mixer, knead on low for 2 to 3 minutes using the dough hook attachment.








,, The dough should be sticky, but not so sticky that you can't handle it. With a mixer, this should take 5 to 10 minutes on medium speed.









The thin sheet of dough is also known as the “bakers window.” This lets you know if the gluten is properly dispersed.

, A glass baking dish works well.









The hot water will do two things: warm the dough to let it rise faster and it keep the air inside the oven moist, preventing the dough from forming a dry skin on top.

, Allow to rise until doubled in size, approximately 1 to 2 hours.








, (This would be a good time to fold in any additions you may want, such as nuts or herbs.) Be sure to knead it using the proper technique:









Place it on a counter top or other working space.
Lightly dust your hands with flour, then press the dough out with your knuckles. Don’t squash or flatten it; simply spread it comfortably outwards.
First fold one side of the dough inwards toward the middle of the mass, then fold the other, (as if you were folding a tri-fold wallet). Repeat a second time.
Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let sit for another 10 minutes.
Flatten the dough again with your knuckles, then it in onto itself like you’re shaping it into a jellyfish.
Turn the dough over and squeeze the bottom together so that the top surface of the dough is smooth.
Place the dough back onto the counter and roll it gently between your hands. Do not grab the dough but allow it to move gently back and forth between your hands, moving in a circular motion. The point of this is to tighten up the skin of the dough ball as much as possible.

, Be sure to put the dish into the cold oven; terra cotta needs to heat and cool slowly and evenly or else it will crack.








, The cornmeal will help the dough slide off later. (A pizza peel will also work if you have one.)









Cover with a kitchen towel and allow to rise for 1 hour (or until you poke the dough and it quickly fills back in where you poked it). This is called “bench proofing” and is the final rising stage before dough is baked.

, This is optional but will ensure a nice, crispy crust.








, The standard shape is a square on top of the loaf, but you can do an X on top, slash lines, etc.









While it bakes, the bread will simultaneously expand and form a crust. If the crust forms a shell, the bread won’t be able to expand properly and will become dense. The slashes let the bread rise one last time in a situation where it can't expand in all directions.

, (This can vary depending on your oven.) Once the bread has reached an internal temperature of 205 to 210 °F (96 to 99 °C), remove to a cooling rack and allow to sit for 30 minutes before slicing.

Measure out wholewheat flour for your recipe.,
Add two teaspoons of vital wheat gluten per cup flour.,
Mix well.,
Add extra water to the wet ingredients.,
Let the bread rise less than normal.",How to Make Bread Flour2," The basic process for converting wholewheat flour to bread flour is basically the same as above. However, a few qualities of wholewheat flour make some minor differences necessary. To start, add the wheat flour to a mixing bowl.


Again, this is a one-to-one substitution for the bread flour in your recipe. If your recipe calls for three cups of bread flour, start with three cups of wholewheat flour (and so on).

, Wholewheat flour contains a substance called bran which weakens the effects of gluten. This means that it's necessary to add more gluten artificially than you would with all-purpose flour.This scales proportionally in the same way as in the section above. For instance, if you have three cups of wholewheat flour, you would add six teaspoons of vital wheat gluten.

, Sift the ingredients together in the mixing bowl. When they are well combined, the substance you have in the bowl will substitute well for bread flour. However, for the best possible results, a few more precautions are necessary. See the next steps.

, The bran and protein content of wholewheat flour tend to make it slightly more absorbent than normal flour. To compensate, add a little extra to the wet ingredients you're using for your bread. About two and a half tablespoons of water per cup of wholewheat flour should be plenty.To be clear, you'll want to add this water to the bowl where you're mixing the eggs, oil, milk, and so on. Don't add it directly to the flour or it will incorporate unevenly.

, When making bread, normally, you allow the dough to rise to about double its normal size.However, with wholewheat flour, you'll only want to allow it to rise to about 1 1/2 times its normal size. This is because wholewheat flour tends to make dough a little less flexible. If you let the dough rise all the way, it won't be able to support its full size and will ""deflate"" somewhat during baking."

, If you have a mature 12 year old girl, you probably don't want to have a 'My Little Pony' cake., Do they like My Little Pony or TMNT, or maybe it's their 50th (Black Balloon birthday)., There are many types of health problems that may require you to make a different kind of cake than you'd think - gluten intolerance, food allergies, diabetes, lactose intolerance, and so forth. You'll need to take this into consideration when making and preparing the cake, and make sure that there's never any cross-contamination with allergens and the cake ingredients.

There are also different eating styles that may or may not be due to health problems. Some people are vegetarian or vegan, and these styles will impact how you have to make the cake.
You may feel like you're being impolite by asking about the person's health problems. However, it's not a big deal. A simple, ""Do you have any special dietary needs?"" is all that it takes.

, If you are not talented at making or decorating cakes, consider asking for help from somebody who knows their way around cake decoration. Additionally, you may have to turn down a job offer. For example, if you don't know how to make gluten-free cakes, you may have to tell the person requesting the cake that you don't know how to bake gluten-free., If the recipient is planning to share it out, it is important to know how many people you are baking for.

Writing on the cake

,,,, Cakes made with butter will most likely last less than oil-based cakes., It should last for about week., Plastic wrap is not needed to store a frosted cake as the frosting is almost as a shield for the cake; it protects it from any air that floats like dust, pet hair, fuzz, and bacteria. Also, plastic wrap would mess up the frosting and mix together with the other frosting colors. Store your cake in a cake-keeper or flip a large bowl and cover it with that. It can last for about 4-5 days.

If your frosting includes heavy cream (whipped cream topping) or a fruit filling like strawberry it must stay in the fridge in order to stay off from bacteria.

, Sliced cakes are a little difficult to store and can be tricky, however it is possible. Remember as soon as you slice a cake, all the moisture leaves and it starts to become stale and hard. Try covering the cake with plastic wrap, especially the edges, to prevent that from happening. If you can, try applying frosting over the edges to protect any moisture from leaving. Sliced cake does not last for long, usually about 3-4 days., It doesn't matter if your cake is frosted, not frosted, sliced, and/or not sliced refrigerating is one of the best ways to store a birthday cake. It is recommended to do this during the hot seasons like spring or summer because a lot of heat and moisture can cause bacteria. For a cake that is not frosted, cover it well with plastic wrap. For a cake that is frosted, freeze the cake for about 15 minutes to let the frosting become a bit stiff. Your cake can last for about a week. When rooming your cake from the fridge, have it sit for about 10 minutes with room temperature or else it will be dry and dull. ., If you want your cake to last longer than a week, freeze it. A well-covered cake that is stored properly can last for nearly a month. When removing your cake from the freezer, have it thaw using room temperature."

If you can't find any candy melts, you can use white chocolate chips instead.

, Place the piping bag into the microwave, then heat it at 30-second intervals until the candy melts. Knead the bag between each interval. How long you do this for depends on the type of candy melts you are using; some melt quicker than others., Only cut off a tiny bit, or the melted candy will come out too thick. in the next step., Use the piping bag to outline your number with the melted chocolate. Next, fill the number in using a tight, zigzag motion. Make sure that there are no gaps visible., Here is where you can get really creative. You can cover the entire number with sprinkles, or just add a dash. For a textured number, match the color of the sprinkles to your chocolate. For a colorful number, use rainbow-colored sprinkles., Use the baking sheet to transfer the number to the fridge. Leave it there for 10 minutes so that the chocolate can harden., Once the chocolate has hardened, peel the number off of the wax or parchment paper. Set it down onto the cake so that it stands straight up, like one of those number candles."

Carefully place the macarons on each tier.,
Decorate your tiered macaron cake.,
Replenish macarons as they’re eaten.",How to Make a Tiered Macaron Cake," After you’ve mixed the two ingredients together, you should run it through a sieve. Dump a few spoonfuls into the sieve at a time, stirring it as it runs through the sieve. This will ensure that your mixture is incredibly powdery, which will made the top of your macarons very smooth. Otherwise, your macarons might be bumpy or cracked.You’ll be left with a sieve full of almond bits. You can pour those back into the almond meal bag, or snack on them while you work!;
, First and foremost, make sure that you are using room temperature eggs. Either pull them out of the refrigerator in advance, or submerge refrigerated eggs into warm water. Remove the egg yolk with a spoon or even with your hand, being careful not to break the yolk. Pour the egg whites in your mixer with the whisk attachment and begin whisking them until they are foamy., As you continue to beat your egg whites in the mixer, sprinkle in your salt and add your cream of tartar. Let those get fully blended into your egg whites. Then, pour in the sugar slowly. It’s important to slowly sprinkle the sugar in, rather than dumping it in all at once. This will help make sure the egg whites remain fluffy and light., Add more food coloring than you may think you need, so that the color of your mixture is actually a bit darker than you want your finished macarons to be. The color will fade as the macarons bake in the oven, and you want to make sure that the color doesn’t end up too light., Do not over mix it! This step is very critical. You need to find a happy medium, because over-mixing can result in flat macarons, and under-mixing can result in cracking. The batter should become smooth, but it should still feel fluffy. When you lift up your spoon, batter should drip off of it.This step might take a little bit of practice.

, First, line your baking sheets with parchment paper. Then, transfer your batter into a pastry bag with a tip that is half an inch in diameter. You can purchase pastry bags at your local grocery store. After your batter is transferred, you can start piping it onto your sheets., Pipe from the side, creating one solid mound. When you release the bag, lift your bag over the macaron, so that if any icing drips, it will drip onto you mound.

Carefully pipe out mounds of batter that are one inch wide. All of your macarons should be the same size.
Once you’ve filled your baking sheets, carefully pick up the tray from either side and hit it onto your countertop. This will release air left in the batter, and you’ll notice your mounds start to flatten out. You’ll even see air bubbles popping on the surface.

, This step is extremely important. When you let your macarons sit out on your counter before baking, they will become a bit more solid and tacky. This will prevent them from spreading out and getting flat in the oven. Let them sit on your countertop for about 20 or 30 minutes before popping them in the oven., Set the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, or 150 degrees Celsius. To ensure your macarons bake evenly, it’s best to only bake one tray at a time. This might make the process take longer, but you will be rewarded with smooth, even macarons. As you bake one tray, let the other trays sit out and get even more solid. This will only benefit your results!, Soften the butter to room temperature. After it feels soft, place it in the mixer and flip it on to a medium speed. Let it mix for about three to five minutes, or until it’s completely creamy., Once the butter is completely creamed, add the cane sugar. Pour it in slowly to help it blend more evenly into the butter. Increase the speed of the mixer from medium to high. Keep beating the butter and sugar together until it looks fluffy. This will take anywhere from five to seven minutes., Pour 1/4 a cup (59 mL) of milk into the saucepan, saving the rest of the milk. Add the flour and the vanilla extract, and whisk the mixture together. Make sure that everything is thoroughly mixed and there are no clumps. Turn the stovetop to medium heat, and pour in the rest of the milk gradually as it heats up. Don’t stop whisking this entire time.Continue heating until the mixture begins to boil.
As soon as it begins boiling, turn the heat down to low.
On low heat, keep whisking the mixture. Gradually, the mixture will start to thicken.

, After you’ve noticed your milk mixture thickening up, turn off the stove. Keep whisking even after it’s off the direct heat, because the heat from the saucepan will cause it to continue cooking for a few minutes. It’s important that you don’t let the mixture sit, or it can get lumpy and difficult to work with.After your mixture is smooth and thick, you can stop stirring and set it to the side. You will need to let it cool to room temperature before proceeding.

, Once the milk has cooled, it’s time to combine it with the butter and sugar mixture. Carefully pour it into the mixer, which should be set on low speed. Once you’ve poured all of the milk mixture in, increase the speed to medium. Let it keep running until it looks fluffy again, which should take anywhere from three to five minutes., The final step in your vanilla buttercream filling is – naturally – the vanilla! Once the filling in your mixture looks fully blended and fluffy, pour in the vanilla extract. Let the mixer keep running on medium speed for about a minute as it incorporates the vanilla. Turn off the mixer and you’re done!, After you’ve finished making the vanilla buttercream filling, it’s time to actually construct the macarons. Spoon the frosting into a pastry bag with a smaller tip (1/4 inch). With this tip, you’ll be creating smaller mounds on the finished macarons., Flip your finished macaron pieces over so that the flat sides are up. Carefully create mounds of filling on the flat side. Leave space around the edges of the macaron so that the icing can spread. Place the second macaron piece on top of the filling, applying a bit of pressure so the filling will flatten a bit., These are key to creating the look of a tiered cake. You can purchase a macaron stand online. Unlike other pastry stands, these are specially made to fit macarons and create that beautiful tiered look. A quick Google search will pull up options – you can find versions for closer to $10 and others for closer to $100. Explore your options! Each stand will also inform you how many macarons the stand will hold, so you will know how many to make.

You can find these tiered macaron stands on sites like Amazon, Etsy, bakery websites, and eBay. It’s helpful to check out reviews before making a purchase.

, If you’ve made several different colors, you can alternate colors on each tier. Otherwise, simply start inserting the macarons on their sides into the different levels. The advantage to using a macaron stand is that you only have to worry about creating the outside, visible row, rather than making enough macarons to fill the entire “cake.”, This part is optional, because a filled macaron stand is beautiful on its own. However, if you’re making this macaron cake for a wedding or other special event, it can be fun to add even more decoration. Add a few flowers around the base and top of the stand. You can even stick a few individual flowers in gaps between macarons, to add floral touches throughout the tiers., In order to keep your tiered macaron cake looking beautiful and full, it’s helpful to replenish the cake with new macarons as people eat. Keep a box of macarons nearby, and just pop new ones in any gaps. You’ll eventually run out, but that’s okay – it just means your macarons are a hit!"

, Measure all of the dry cake ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Use a whisk to combine the mixture. You'll need:2 cups (400 g) white sugar
1 3/4 cup (218 g) all-purpose flour
1 cup (100 g) unsweetened, Dutch process cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt

, Add 2 eggs, 1 cup (236 ml) of milk, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the mixing bowl with the dry ingredients.

Divide the batter between the two prepared pans.The cake batter will appear very liquid which is fine. This will just make your cake moist.

, Put the cake pans in the oven and bake them for 30 to 40 minutes. Insert a cake tester to see if they've finished baking. Once they're done baking, a tester should come out clean and the tops of the cakes should spring back a little if you press them in the center. Wear hot pads and take the cakes out of the oven.For the most even baking, try to put the cake pans on the same rack in the oven.

, Set the cake pans on a rack and let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Carefully turn the cakes out onto the wire rack and let them finish cooling completely.It's important to wait until the cakes are totally cool before frosting them. This will prevent the frosting from melting into or running off of the cake.

, Turn the mixer to low speed and gradually beat in 4 cups (500 g) of powdered sugar. Once it's been mixed in a little, you can add a few drops of green food coloring and turn the speed up to medium-high. Beat the frosting for one more minute, so it becomes light and fluffy. Stir in 2 ounces (60 g) of finely chopped semisweet chocolate.You can adjust the flavor and color of the frosting according to your taste.

, Place one of the cake layers on a cake stand. If the layer is uneven, you can use a serrated knife to cut it, so it's level. Dollop a scoop of the frosting on the layer and use an offset spatula to spread it evenly across the top. Set the other layer of cake on top and scoop more frosting on it. Spread the frosting across the top and sides of the cake.Store the leftover cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

, Put the cake pan in the preheated oven and bake it for 26 to 31 minutes. To test the cake, poke a toothpick or cake tester into the center of the cake. If the tester comes out clean, the cake is done. If batter sticks to the tester, bake it for a few more minutes and check it again.If you're using round cake pans, bake the cakes for 24 to 31 minutes, depending on their size.

, Wear oven mitts and take the cake out of the oven. Set the entire pan on a wire rack. Let it cool for 15 minutes while it's still in the pan. Then you can flip the cake out and onto the wire rack where it can cool completely.It's important to cool the cake completely, so the frosting won't melt off or into the cake.

, Scoop one 16-ounce (454 g) container of buttercream frosting into a mixing bowl and stir in 1/8 teaspoon of pure peppermint extract and 2 ounces (60 g) of mini-chocolate chips.

",How to Make Ukranian Honey Cake," Place 4 tablespoons (84 g) of honey, ¾ cup (150 g) of sugar, and 2 tablespoon (28 g) of unsalted butter in a medium saucepan. Heat the mixture on medium-low until the sugar melts completely, which should take 5 to 7 minutes.Whisk the mixture periodically as it’s heating to prevent the sugar from burning onto the bottom of the pan.;
, Once the sugar has melted, take the pan off the heat. While it’s still hot, mix in 3 large beaten eggs. Whisk the mixture vigorously to incorporate the eggs.Be sure to whisk the mixture constantly as you add the eggs to keep them from scrambling.

, When the eggs are fully mixed, add 1 teaspoon (7 g) of baking soda to the pan. Whisk the mixture so the baking soda is completely blended with the other ingredients.Continue whisking the mixture until there are no lumps.

, To finish the dough, use a spatula to gradually add up 3 cups (360 g) of all-purpose flour. You want to add just enough flour to give the dough a clay-like consistency that doesn’t stick to your hands.Fold in no more than ½ cup (60 g) of flour at a time to avoid adding too much.
Gently fold the flour into the mixture to avoid overmixing the dough.

, In order for the oven to be hot enough to bake the cake layers, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully.Be aware of what your oven does to indicate that it’s preheated. It will most likely beep or flash a light to alert you.

, Place the dough on a well-floured surface, and cut it into 8 equal pieces. You can move onto the next step right away because the dough rolls out best when it’s still warm., Use a rolling pin to roll out each piece of dough. Shape it into a 9-inch (23-cm) circle that’s approximately ⅛-inch (3-mm) thick.If you find that the dough is sticking to the rolling pin, sprinkle the top of dough lightly with flour.

, Once the dough is rolled out into thin circles, take a 9-inch (23-cm) plate and place it on top of the dough. Trace a knife around the dish to cut the dough into perfect circles. Be sure to save the dough scraps.Instead of a plate, you can use the bottom insert from a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan.

, Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper to keep the cake layers from sticking. Place one or two cake layers on the cookie sheet, depending on how many will fit.You can use a silicone baking mat instead of parchment paper if you prefer.

, Place the cookie sheet in the preheated oven, and allow them to bake until they are golden with little browning. It should take approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Repeat the process with the rest of the layers and dough scraps.Bake the dough scraps on a cookie sheet by themselves so you can spread them out and ensure that they bake evenly.

, Once all of the layers and scraps are baked, allow them to cool on a wire rack for 15 to 20 minutes. When the scraps are completely cool, crush them with a rolling pin or in a food processor to create fine crumbs.If you prefer a more rustic look for the cake, crumble the baked scraps with your fingers for coarser crumbs.

, Add 1 cup (240 ml) of heavy whipping cream to the bowl of a stand mixer. With the whisk attachment in place, beat the cream on high until stiff peaks form. It should take approximately 1 to 2 minutes.Make sure both the cream and bowl are chilled. That will make it easier to whip the cream.You can whip the cream with a handheld electric mixer or by hand with a whisk

, Add 32 ounces (920 g) of sour cream and 2 cups (220 g) of powdered sugar to a separate bowl. Mix well until they’re fully blended., Once the sour cream and powdered sugar are mixed, carefully add the whipped cream. Use a spatula to gently fold it in so the mixture stays light and fluffy.If you don’t plan to assemble the cake right away, refrigerate the frosting until you’re ready.

, Place one of the baked cake layers on your serving plate. Smooth 2 to 3 tablespoons (28 g to 42 g) of the frosting over the layer with a knife.It’s a good idea to poke holes throughout the layers before placing the frosting on them. That allows them to soak it up more easily.

, With the frosting in place on the bottom layer of the cake, set the second layer on top. Gently press down on it to ensure that there are no air gaps between the layers. Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons (28 g to 42 g) of the frosting over the top of the second layer.Don’t worry if some of the frosting comes out the side when you press down on the layers. You frost the sides of the cake too, so you’ll have a chance to smooth it out.

, With the second layer in place, repeat the process with the remaining 6 layers of cake. Remember to press down on each layer when you set it place so there are no gaps., Spread more frosting around the sides of the cake, so it’s completely covered.Don’t worry about getting the frosting perfectly smooth. The crumbs will hide any messy areas.

, Once the cake is completely frosted, dust it with the crumbs that you made from the baked dough scraps. You’ll need to press gently when you add them to the sides of the cake so they’ll stick., After you’ve added the crumbs, cover the cake in plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator to chill overnight so they cake has time to absorb the cream frosting.If you want to add color to your honey cake, dust some red currants in sugar and set them on top of the cake in an arrangement that you like.

Add flavor between layers.",How to Upgrade a Store‐Bought Cake," Go down to your local supermarket bakery and request a regular, unfrosted cake with no decorations or embellishments. From there, you can ice the cake with a specific person, theme or event in mind. Buying a premade base for your cake can save you the time and headache of baking it yourself, but will still allow you to have a hand in creating the finished product.If you don’t see any plain cakes on display, ask a bakery assistant if they have one you can buy.
Buying a unfrosted cake takes the most involved step, baking, out of the equation, leaving you to focus on decorating.;
, Another option is to select a cake that’s already been baked and topped with a coating of icing, but is free of any other decorative elements. That way, all you have to do is add a few extra components and you’re good to go. Just choose your preferred flavor and the type and color of the icing and get busy.Think of this as a blank canvas to incorporate whatever artistic flourishes you can dream up.

, When you’re really in a crunch for time, run to the store and grab a packaged cake as-is. Pick out one that matches the image you have in mind for the finished cake as closely as possible. Then it will just be a matter of making minor tweaks to take it from cookie-cutter to custom.Choose a cake with a theme befitting the occasion, or have the decorator write out a specific message for you.
Less is more if you plan to add your own accents later. Try not to remove existing decorations from premade cakes, or your could end up with a mess on your hands.

, Once you get the cake home, you can use simple frosting techniques to enhance its basic appearance. Pipe on words, designs or images of your choosing. Your cake might feature anything from a personalized birthday message to a colorful array of iced flowers and other embellishments.Fill a piping bag with icing, snip off the tip and use a steady hand and flowing cursive script to spell out names and messages.
To make your cake stand out, include a name, symbol or inside joke that has special significance.
Save some extra time by using premade icing as well.

, These most often take the form of little cardboard or plastic props that are ready to stick right into the top of your cake. You could also make your own out of party supplies or other materials that you have lying around your house, like party hats or noisemakers. Almost anything can be used as an improvised cake topper. You’re only limited by the scope of your imagination.For a simple yet celebratory display, hang a miniature banner between two thin wooden dowels, or blow up tiny balloons and tie them onto skewers with a little ribbon.Candles shaped like numbers and letters can be bought for cheap and are usually a big hit with partygoers. Use them to spell out slogans that are appropriate for the occasion.

, Press small toys or dolls onto the top of the cake to depict a scene. Ice and decorate the rest of the cake to match what’s going on in the tableau you’ve set up. This can give your cake a one-of-a-kind visual appeal, since you can put the dolls in any number of poses and configurations that you can think up.Fit zoo figurines onto the ends of skewers as a tribute to the animal lover in your life.Keep up with the figurines you use to make sure you don’t lose them, especially if they’re small or feature loose pieces. Don’t forget to remove the figurines before slicing and serving the cake.

, If you’d prefer to go with a tasteful, minimalistic design, purchase some dried edible flowers and sprinkle them around the top and sides of a plain frosted cake. The bright colors and subtle textures of the petals and blooms will do all of the decorative legwork. With only a few minutes of preparation, your cake will have all the stunning elegance of a fresh-cut bouquet.Flowers like lavender, hibiscus and daylilies are all edible and look wonderful when added to a plain or frosted cake.
Choose mild flowers that won’t overpower the flavor of the cake.

, The only thing better than a delicious cake is cake and candy together. Polka dot your cake with M&Ms, Smarties or another colorful treat, or seat some gummy bears in a ring around the top. Finding clever uses for candy can lend your cake more color, more sweetness and more playful imagination without the need for irritating cake decorating techniques. What’s not to love?Press fun-sized candy bars onto the outer edge of the cake, or crumble them up and spread them over the top.
Stick a lollipop into each piece as an added bonus for when the cake is all gone.

, One particularly crafty idea is to cut colored licorice twists into slices, then pull off small strips and combine them together to make candy flowers with a neat pop art look. You can use these flowers to adorn the area around the base of the cake. After you add a greeting or a bright frosted sun, you’ll have a festive confection perfect for celebrating spring and summertime events.Load up on packs of multicolored licorice. Use green sticks to make the stems, and slice yellow, orange, red or blue sticks to serve as the blossoms.
Slice the licorice thin so that it doesn’t make each bite of cake too gummy.

, Piping on details by hand eats up time, requires a steady touch and can easily turn into a disaster if you make a mistake. Take the guesswork out of it by arranging whipped meringue cookies around the top of the cake. Not only are they the spitting image of frosting, they’ll provide a delicate crunch that will make the texture of the cake more interesting.Meringue cookies typically come in pleasant pastel colors, making them perfect for birthdays, Easter celebrations, baby showers and springtime events.

, Those who are dedicated to coming up with a more elaborate fix can deconstruct the cake to its individual layers and spread on a tasty filling, such as fluffy ganache, peanut butter or fresh fruit and whipped cream. By doing this, you’ll be enhancing the flavor of the cake as well as the appearance. Layered cakes are rich, sophisticated and guaranteed to make an impression.Use fillings like preserves, custard or apple butter for a surprising twist on the classic layer cake.
Be sure to frost back over the outside of the cake after you reassemble it.

Choose a cake release spray.,
Shake the can and spray.,
Bake and release your cake.",How to Use Cake Release Spray1," Look for a cake release spray that contains flour and oil as it's main ingredients. You'll also notice stabilizers and propellants which will extend the shelf life of the spray and help it spray out of the can. You can also look for a cooking oil spray that doesn't contain the flour.If you use a cooking oil spray (like a canola or vegetable oil spray), avoid using it on nonstick baking pans. The oil will become sticky after baking on the nonstick surface.;
, Thoroughly shake the can of cake release spray for several seconds. This will help the product combine and ensure that the flour and oil are evenly distributed. Place your finger on the nozzle of the can and spray the entire surface of your baking pans.To avoid overspray, keep the can about 6 inches away from the baking pan while you spray.
Avoid spraying around an open flame or sparks. Baking spray from a can is highly flammable.

, Remove the baked cake from the oven and set a cooling rack on top of the cake and hold the sides of the cake pan along with the rack. Carefully lift the cake and rack up and over so the cake pan is upside down. Gently lift the cake pan up and away so the cake is left on the rack to cool.

Choose a liquid cake release product.,
Spread the liquid cake release mixture.,
Remove your baked cake from the pan.",How to Use Cake Release Spray2," Most liquid cake releases should contain some type of oil (like soybean or canola oil) and a thickener (like corn starch or flour). Many commercial cake release products will also contain preservatives and stabilizers to extend their shelf life.Look for a product that comes in a squeeze bottle. This will make it easier to squirt out and use in your baking.

, Squirt about a quarter-sized amount of liquid cake release mixture onto the bottom of your cake pan. Take a silicone brush or pastry brush with bristles and dip it into the cake release mixture. Spread the mixture over the entire surface of your baking pan. Ensure that you coat the bottom, the sides, and the inner edges of the pan.Don't worry about applying too much cake release mixture. You won't be able to see it on the baked and cooled cakes.

, Once you've baked the cake according to the recipe, remove it from the oven. Set a cooling rack on top of the cake and hold the sides of the cake pan along with the rack. Carefully lift the cake and rack up and over so the cake pan is upside down. Gently lift the cake pan up and away so the cake is left on the rack to cool.

If the frosting does come out the sides, simply wipe it away with your spatula., This allows the frosting to firm up so that you can cut the cake.If the cake keeps unrolling, wrap it in a sheet of plastic wrap.

, You can also use a 12-cup Bundt cake pan.

You can rub about a teaspoon of butter on the pan before you use it, as it will add an extra layer of depth to the flavor of the cake. You can also use shortening or dab just enough vegetable or coconut oil to evenly cover the pan. Both of these options will prevent your cake from sticking to the pan.Try not to use cooking sprays to grease your pan, if possible. These are convenient, but areas where the heat doesn’t burn the spray off can become sticky or pasty over time, meaning you’ll have to replace your pan sooner rather than later.Coat the greased cake pan with a couple of spoonfuls of flour, enough to create a thin dusting which will prevent the grease from absorbing into the batter when the cake is baking., You can do this in a mixer bowl. If you have an electric mixer, whisk on medium-high speed for 5 minutes., Do this in a medium bowl. Stir in vanilla., Place the saucepan over medium heat., Stir until the mixture is hot but not boiling. You can tell you have reached this sweet spot between hot and boiling when you see small bubbles start to form around the edges of the saucepan. That is your indication to reduce the heat to low.If the mixture does boil, simply lower the temperature immediately. Boiling milk will cause it to curdle, thus potentially affecting the texture of your cake. If you notice that the milk has curdled too much, it may be best to start again - melt the butter once more, then add the milk and vanilla. Otherwise, go ahead and use the milk - it is safe to do so., Do this slowly, alternating between adding egg mixture and adding flour mixture. Keep mixing throughout this process. When you have added both mixtures to the saucepan, pour the batter into the greased pan., Rotate the pan at least once during this hour. Check 15 minutes prior to the end of the hour to make sure your cake is baking evenly.

To test whether the cake is baking evenly, remove the cake from the oven and poke it in the middle with a toothpick. The toothpick should come out clean or with only a few crumbles. Batter on the toothpick means the cake needs to stay in the oven for longer.The cake should be golden when it’s ready.

Ensure that the pan is completely coated so the cake doesn't stick.Coating the pan is especially important if the Bundt pan has intricate details and places where cake could stick.;
, Take 1/4 cup (55 g) of finely ground pecans or pecan meal and sprinkle it over the inside of your greased Bundt pan. Turn and shake the pan so the pecans coat the pan evenly. The pecans will add a slight crunch to the cake and will give it a nice golden color. Set the pan aside while you make the cake batter.You can purchase ground pecan meal or make your own. Just process the whole, toasted pecans until they are ground into a powder., Measure out and place most of the light rum cake ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Beat them together on medium speed for 2 minutes, so they're completely combined. You'll need:2 cups (8 1/2 ounces or 240 g) of flour
1 1/2 cups (300 g) of sugar
1/2 cup (115 g) of unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup (130 g) of instant vanilla pudding mix, dry
2 teaspoons of baking powder
1 teaspoon of salt
1/2 cup (120 ml) of vegetable oil
1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk
4 large eggs

, Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a rubber spatula. Stir in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of light rum, 2 teaspoons of vanilla, and the 1/4 teaspoon of butter rum flavor. Beat the cake batter for another minute on low speed.The butter rum flavor is optional. Consider adding it for a robust flavor. Keep in mind that butter rum flavoring doesn't actually contain any rum.

, Spread the cake batter into the greased pan coated with pecans. Use a spatula to ensure that the batter is level in the pan. Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes. Stick a cake tester or skewer into the cake. If the tester comes out clean, the cake is finished baking.Take the cake out of the oven, but leave it in the pan while you make the syrup. You'll also pour the light rum sauce over the cake while it's still in the pan.

, Measure out and place the syrup ingredients into a medium-sized saucepan. You'll need 1/2 cup (115 g) of unsalted butter, 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water, 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of light rum.You can use salted butter. Just keep in mind that the sauce may have a richer flavor.

, Turn the saucepan on to medium-high heat. Stir and cook the sauce until it boils. Reduce the heat so it just bubbles lightly. Simmer the sauce for 5 to 8 minutes and keep stirring it. The sauce will thicken.It's important to let the sauce simmer so the sugar dissolves completely.

, Turn the heat off and stir 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla into the syrup. Use a long wooden or bamboo skewer to poke deep holes across the entire light rum cake.

The skewer should come out cleanly after poking the holes into the cake. If cake batter comes out with the skewer, the cake needs to cook longer.

, Take a 1/4 cup (60 ml) measuring cup or jug and fill it with light rum sauce. Slowly pour it over the cake so it goes into the holes and across the surface of the cake. Continue pouring the sauce over in 1/4-cup (60 ml) increments until all of the sauce is on the cake.Don't worry if the sauce goes onto the cake, instead of just in the holes. The cake will still absorb the sauce.

, Tear off a few sheets of plastic wrap and cover the soaked cake loosely. Let the cake sit overnight so it has a chance to soak up all of the light rum sauce. Keep the cake at room temperature. When you're ready to serve the cake, run a knife around the edges of the cake and the pan. Flip the cake onto your cake pan and slice it.If the cake is sticking to the pan, you can place it in a warm oven (350 degrees F or 175 C) for 5 to 10 minutes. This will liquefy the syrup so you can easily flip the cake out.

, Let the cakes cool off on a wire rack for 10 minutes first. Run a knife around the inside edges of the pans, then invert the cakes onto a flat surface. Let them cool off completely.

If you glazed the cakes, you do not need to chill them further; the initial 1 hour or so of chilling is plenty. Simply take them out of the fridge and remove them from their pans.

, Place the butter into a large mixing bowl. Add the grated lemon rind, thawed lemonade concentrate, vanilla extract, and cream cheese. Beat everything together on high speed until the frosting turns light and fluffy., Beat the frosting on low speed until everything is just blended. Do not over-mix the frosting., This will allow the frosting to firm up and make it easier tp spread., Place one of the cakes, glazed-side-up on a serving place.

Set the pan aside while you make the johnnycake batter., Place ½ cup (113 g) of softened butter and ¾ cups (150 g) of sugar into a mixing bowl. Use a stand or electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar together on medium-low speed.The mixture should lighten a little in color.

, Add 4 cups (400 g) of flour, ½ cup (120 ml) of water, ½ teaspoon of salt, and 2 teaspoons baking powder to the bowl. Stir the batter on low speed while you slowly pour in ¾ cup (180 ml) of milk.The batter should look thick and sticky at this point.

, Scoop the batter into the prepared baking pan. Spread it evenly with a spatula. Or, dust your hands with flour and press down gently on the batter in the pan, so it becomes level., Put the pan in the oven and bake the johnnycake for one hour.

4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
2 tablespoons sugar

, Use your fingers to rub in 1/2 tablespoon of cold butter until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs. Pour in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of whole milk and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water. Use your hands to stir the mixture into a shaggy dough., Sprinkle a little flour on a work surface and dump the dough onto it. Use your hands to knead the dough for about five minutes. The dough will be really sticky when you start, but it should become soft and elastic once you've finished kneading.Avoid adding too much flour or the johnnycake will become tough.

, Put the dough into a bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. This will keep a tough skin from forming on the dough. Let the dough rest in the bowl for one hour., Get a sheet pan out and dust it with flour. Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl of dough and scoop out enough dough to make a ball. The ball should be 2 to 3-inches (5 to 7.5-cm) in size. Roll it between the palms of your hand to round out the shape and set it on your prepared baking pan. Continue to portion out the rest of the dough into balls.You won't be baking the johnnycake on the sheet. The floured sheet is just where you'll keep the balls of dough until you're ready to shape and fry them.

, Get a deep frying pan or skillet out and place it on your stove. Pour canola or vegetable oil into the pan, so the oil comes about 1 to 2-inches (2.5 to 5-cm) up the side of the pan. Turn the heat up to medium.You'll know the oil is hot enough to fry the johnnycakes by carefully dripping a drop of water into it. When the oil is hot, the water will pop as it hits it.

, Take a ball of johnnycake dough and gently stretch it into a circle. It should be about 1/4 to 1/2-inch (6 to 12 mm) thick. You should use your hands to stretch the dough, but avoid simply pressing down to flatten the dough. Stretch the remaining balls of dough.Stretching the dough will develop the gluten in the johnnycake which will make it light and puffy.

, Place two or three of the johnnycakes into the hot oil and fry them until they're golden on the bottom. Check them after a minute and then flip them over, so they become golden brown on the other side. Use a slotted spoon to scoop out the fried johnny cakes and set them on a paper towel.You'll need to fry the rest of the johnnycakes in batches, but remember to let the oil heat back up in between batches.

Sprinkle about 1/4 of a cup of flour into the pan and shake it so that the inside is completely greased and floured.;
, If you have liquid coconut oil, pour 1 cup (200 g) of it into a large mixing bowl.

Set this mixture aside.If your coconut oil is hard, measure it out and melt it in a small saucepan on the stove over low heat. You could also microwave it to liquefy it.

, In a separate mixing bowl, place 3½ cups (440 g) of flour, 3½ teaspoons of baking powder, ¼ teaspoon of grated nutmeg, and ½ teaspoon of salt. Whisk the dry ingredients together for about 30 seconds. Set the dry mixture aside.Whisking the dry ingredients ensures that they absorb the wet ingredients evenly. If you don't have a whisk, try sifting the dry ingredients into your bowl and stirring them.

, Sprinkle half of the dry mixture over the wet mixture. Take a spatula and fold the dry ingredients into the wet. Use your wrist to make a circular motion as you mix the ingredients. Add the rest of the dry mixture and finish folding the ingredients just until they're combined.Avoid stirring the batter too much or your cake will be tough and lose volume.

, Pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan and use a spatula to smooth the top. Place the cake into the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour. The cake will be golden brown and a tester will come out clean when the cake is finished.Since Bundt pans come in a variety of styles, your cake may take more or less time. If you need to add more time, set your timer for 5 minute increments. Keep checking until your cake is baked.

, Remove the cake from the oven and leave it in the Bundt pan for 15 minutes. You can then flip it out onto a cooling rack to let it finish cooling completely. You can serve the cake immediately or glaze it with a topping of your choice.For an optional coconut glaze, toast 1/2 cup of flaked coconut and add 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 cup of water, and a pinch of salt.

While the mixer runs, add ¾ cup (155 g) of coconut oil, 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Keep mixing the ingredients until the batter is smooth.Since this recipe doesn't rely on butter or eggs for volume, you don't need to worry about over beating the cake batter.

, Divide the batter among your prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with an offset spatula and place the cake pans in the preheated oven. If you're using the 9-inch cake pans, bake the cakes for about 30 minutes. If you're using the 8-inch cake pans, bake them for about 25 minutes. Check to see if they're done before removing them from the oven.You can carefully touch the tops of the cakes. They should feel firm and spring back.

",How to Make Cake in a Can," Select a 15-oz (443 ml) aluminum can with a pop-top lid. Open this can at the bottom, leaving the pop-top in place.Make sure that the aluminum can is safe for baking. Avoid cans lined with a BPA coating since this may become toxic when exposed to intense heat.
Use a manual safety can opener for best results. You must make sure that the can opener does not leave a sharp edge around the base of the can.
Save the bottom lid of the can. You'll need it later.;
, Empty out the contents of the can and remove the paper label. Thoroughly clean and dry the entire can. Clean the bottom you removed from the can, as well.


Try to get all of the paper and glue off the exterior of the can.
In most cases, scrubbing the can with soap and hot water will be enough to clean it, but some cans may need to be soaked for several minutes of the previous contents stained the interior.
Rinse the can well to remove all traces of soap and dry it completely before continuing.

, Spray the inside of the can with nonstick cooking spray, completely covering the interior side and bottom.


The cooking spray should help the finished cake slide out of the can. If you want to take extra precautions, you can also flour the inside of the can and place a small round of parchment paper at the bottom.

, Consider placing the prepared can on top of a small baking sheet in case any of the batter overflows during the baking process.

, Place the egg white and sugar in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk well until combined.The resulting mixture should look grainy and slightly foamy.

, Pour the vanilla extract and melted butter into the egg white mixture. Use a mixing spoon and stir until combined.

, Add the flour, baking powder, and salt into the contents of the mixing bowl. Stir until the mixture appears evenly combined.


To help minimize the risk of lumps forming in the batter, consider sifting the flour into the mixing bowl instead of dumping it straight in. Gently fold these dry ingredients into the wet ones instead of haphazardly stirring them in.

, Pour the milk into the batter and mix well until smooth and thoroughly combined.


You may need to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula as you stir to ensure that the batter ingredients are evenly blended.

, Pour the batter into your prepared can. It should only fill roughly half of the can.


You can fill the can slightly above the halfway point, but if you've filled it three-quarters high, you've added too much to the can. The batter will expand as it bakes, and if you've filled the can with too much batter, the excess will likely overflow and make a mess., Place the filled can in your preheated oven and back for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cake appears golden brown and a skewer inserted through the center comes out clean.


Due to the depth of the cake, you'll need to use a skewer or knife to check for doneness instead of a toothpick. Make sure that the tip of the instrument reaches the bottom of the can.

, Remove the can from the oven and place it on a wire cooling rack. Allow the cake to cool completely before continuing.


If you do not allow the cake too cool off, it will be more likely to stick to the sides. You could have trouble getting the cake out of the can, and some of the cake may break apart and stick to the can as you slide the rest of it out.

, Once the cake has cooled completely, invert the can and let the cake slide out onto a plate or clean counter.


If the cake doesn't slide out of the can on its own, you may need to loosen it with a knife. Slide the knife in between the cake and the interior side of the can, then run it around the edge to separate it from the side.
As you tip the can upside-down, gently tap on the sides and bottom. The force of the taps may help loosen any remaining stuck portions, allowing the cake to separate and slide out.

, Use a bread knife to carefully slice off the rounded top of the cake. Divide the rest of the cake into two to four even, horizontal layers.Keep the layers as flat and even as possible when cutting them. If you plan to package the cake back in its can, sticking with only two layers might be the easiest option.
This step is only optional. If you don't want to create a miniature layer cake, you can leave the cake as one whole piece and work with it that way.
You won't be using the rounded top you removed, which means that you can use it to taste-test the cake.

, Wash out any bits of burnt cake using soap and hot water. Rinse and dry the can completely before continuing.

, If desired, you can spread a flat layer of sprinkles and other edible cake decorations in the bottom of your clean can.


If you choose to use candy decorations, make sure that you place them upside-down in the bottom of the can. When it comes time to enjoy the cake, the can will be opened from the other side, so anything placed in the bottom of the can will be viewed as the top of the cake.

, Squeeze or pipe prepared cake frosting into the bottom of the can, completely covering the sprinkles and other decorations.


Any prepared frosting will work for this project. You can buy special cupcake frosting that comes in a squeeze can, or you could simply spoon any commercial or homemade frosting of your choice into a pastry bag for the same effect.

, Carefully slide the first cut layer of cake back into the can, pressing gently so that it sticks to the layer of frosting spread across the bottom.


If you cannot reach all the way inside the can with your hands, you may need to use a spoon or similar utensil to gently push the cake layer inside.

, Squeeze or pipe enough frosting into the can to cover the surface of the first layer, then slide your next layer in over that. Repeat until you have inserted all layers of your cake.


It might be easiest to pipe the frosting onto each layer in rings. Use the tip of the piping instrument to help smooth and spread the frosting over the entire layer.
Gently press each layer of cake onto the preceding layer of frosting so that the layers stick together.
Use a thin layer of frosting in between each layer. If you use too much frosting, you may not be able to fit the entire cake back into the can.

, Place the bottom lid of the can back on and tape it securely in place using clear packing tape.


Use enough tape to create a secure, airtight seal.
Avoid using glue to reattach the lid. The glue could seep inside of the cake and mix into the cake, so it is a less safe option than tape.

, You can print your own label for the can or decorate the outside with stickers, washi tape, and other adornments.


Before decorating, you'll need to stand the can right-side up again so that the pop-top faces up. The taped portion should now lie at the bottom of the can.

, To eat the cake, open the pop-top and remove the lid. Eat the cake directly out of the can using a fork.


Since the seal is likely imperfect, you should open and enjoy the cake within a few days to prevent it from going stale or getting moldy.

",How to Make Butter Cake," Along with your ingredients for the cake recipe,you'll also need some utensils and equipment, including:


A hand mixer or stand mixer
Cake pans: one 9-by-13-inch pan, two nine-inch pans, or one Bundt pan
Grease or parchment paper
A large mixing bowl
A large spoon or paddle;
, For this butter cake recipe, you will want your oven preheated to 350 F (177 C). While you're waiting, grease your cake pans with butter, baking spray, or vegetable shortening. On top of the greased pan, sprinkle a pinch of flour to create a light dusting.


If you'd rather not used greased pans, you can instead line your cake pan with parchment paper.

, Add the butter and sugar to your mixing bowl. Beat the ingredients together with your mixer on low speed. Continue beating for five to 10 minutes.As the butter and sugar incorporate, increase the speed to medium, and finally to high for the last minute or two.
Creaming the butter and sugar together in this way will create a light and fluffy cake that has plenty of volume, because the process whips air bubbles into the butter.

, Crack each egg separately into a small bowl and beat it a little before adding it to the flour and sugar mixture. This will give you time to remove any shell pieces, and will prevent the mixture from curdling. Turn the beaters on low and have them running as you add each egg.You want the eggs at room temperature because a warm egg won’t decrease the final volume of the cake.
Continue beating the mixture until all the eggs have been incorporated and the mixture is smooth and yellow.

, Beat on low until everything is incorporated. Don’t overmix, as this will produce a cake that’s tough instead of fluffy., Once added, beat the mixture on low for about 30 seconds. If there is any unincorporated batter on the sides of the bowl, use the spoon or paddle to scrape it down.Increase the speed to high and continue beating for a minute or two.

, If you're making more than one cake, divide the batter evenly between the two pans. Use your spoon to wipe the sides of the bowl so you don’t waste any batter.

, There are a few ways to tell when your cake is ready, and they include when:


The cake springs back when pressed gently with a finger
The cake starts pulling away from the sides of the cake pan
A toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, Place the cake on a wire rack and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. After this time, remove the rack from under the cake and place it on top of the cake pan. Flip the cake pan over and let the cake slide onto the rack.Let the cake continue cooling to room temperature before storing or frosting.

, If you are going to be serving and eating the cake immediately, proceed with layering, filling, or frosting.


For a cake that will be used within the week, wrap it in plastic and store it in a cool, dry place on your counter.For a cake that will be used within three months, wrap it in plastic and store it in the freezer.

, There are many different types of frostings, icings, and glazes you can use to finish your butter cake, and a vanilla buttercream is a common and delicious choice. To make this frosting:Place 1 cup (225 g) of softened butter in a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat on medium for about three minutes.
Working in 1/2-cup increments, add 3 to 4 cups (345 to 460 g) of confectioner’s sugar (add closer to 4 cups for a firmer icing). When all the sugar has been incorporated, turn the beaters to high and mix for 10 seconds.
Add a pinch of salt and 2 teaspoons (12 ml) vanilla. Beat until incorporated.
Beat in 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) of milk or cream until the frosting reaches the desired consistency.

, This is a variation on a basic buttercream, but the brown butter adds a richness and nuttiness to the frosting. To make this frosting:On medium heat, melt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter (85 g) in a small saucepan. Stir constantly until the butter foams, bubbles, and turns a golden color. This will take about four to six minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.
In a mixing bowl, add butter, 3 cups (345 g) confectioner’s sugar, and 1 ½ teaspoons (9 ml) vanilla. Beat on medium speed, and slowly add 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) milk until you achieve the desired consistency.

, Chocolate is another great frosting type for a butter cake, and can add another dimension to the vanilla flavor of the cake. This recipe is similar to a vanilla buttercream, but you add chocolate and malted milk powder to the mix and use less vanilla.In a mixing bowl, add ½ cup (115 g) softened unsalted butter and 1 teaspoon (6 ml) vanilla. Mix on low to combine.
Continue mixing, and gradually add in 2 cups (230 g) confectioner’s sugar, ½ cup (59 g) cocoa powder, ½ cup (65 g) malted milk powder, and a pinch of salt.
One tablespoon (15 ml) at a time, add in 7 tablespoons (105 ml) of milk until the frosting is smooth, light, and spreadable.

, Citrus glazes also work well with butter cakes, and they are less rich than a buttercream frosting. You can use any citrus you want, or a combination, including orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit, or any other citrus you prefer. For the glaze:In a medium bowl, whisk or beat together 1 cup (115 g) confectioner’s sugar, ¼ teaspoon (the zest from a small wedge) orange zest (grated), and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of juice from a freshly squeezed orange. Whisk until all the ingredients are incorporated and you have a smooth icing.

, If you made a single round cake or Bundt cake and want to make a layer cake, take a sharp knife and cut the cake in half to separate the top and bottom into two layers.


If you baked more than one cake and are going to layer them, don’t cut them in half.

, Place the cakes in the refrigerator for about an hour before frosting it. This will make the cake stiffer, less delicate, and easier to work with., Place the bottom layer of cake on a cake plate. With a frosting knife or icing spatula (or a regular butter knife), spread a thin layer of icing on top of the first layer of cake. Refrigerate for 15 minutes before proceeding.If you want to add an extra element to your cake, consider adding a layer of fruit, jam, custard, or ganache on top of the icing.Raspberry, strawberry, and cherry are traditional fruit or jam choices to pair with cake.

, Carefully place the second layer of cake back on top of the first layer. With your frosting knife, apply a thin layer of frosting to the entire cake. This is called the crumb coat, and it will keep the final decorative layer of frosting clean and crumb free.If you made a Bundt cake, don’t forget to frost the inner well along with the outside of the cake.
Refrigerate the cake for 20 to 30 minutes before applying the final layer of frosting.
If you are using a glaze, drizzle glaze evenly over the top of the cake one spoonful at a time. Allow the glaze to drip down over the sides of the cake.

, Apply a thicker and even layer of frosting over the entire crumb coat. Use the back of the spatula or knife to even out the frosting and make the surface as smooth as possible.


For an added touch, sprinkle the top with fruit, coconut flakes, cocoa powder, or citrus zest.
Serve immediately, or cover with a lid until you're ready to eat.

The steamer basket should not touch the boiling water directly.
After reducing the heat, the water should remain at a simmer. Cover the pot with its lid to prevent the water from evaporating as you prepare the cake batter.;
, Coat an 8-inch (20-cm) round baking pan with nonstick cooking spray or shortening. Lightly flour the bottom and sides of the pan, as well.


Alternatively, you can coat the sides of the pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment paper.

, Combine the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Beat on medium to high speed for several minutes, or until the mixture is light and creamy., Add the eggs to the butter mixture one at a time, beating after each addition.


Make sure that each egg is thoroughly beaten into the mixture after each addition.
If you're using small eggs instead of large eggs, you'll need to use three instead of two.

, Add one-third of the flour to the batter and beat until combined. Add half of the milk afterward, beating again until evenly combined.


Repeat this procedure with the remaining flour and milk. Add one-third of the flour and mix it in, followed by the remaining milk. Finish by mixing in the last third of the flour.

, Drizzle the vanilla extract over the batter. Beat on medium to high speed until incorporated.

, Pour one-fourth of the batter into a separate small bowl. Set aside the remaining three-fourths for now.


The smaller portion of batter will be flavored with cocoa powder and the larger portion will remain vanilla flavored.

, Sprinkle the cocoa powder into the smaller batch of batter. Mix well by hand or with an electric mixer set to low speed.

, Pour the vanilla batter into the greased pan, then drizzle the chocolate batter on top.


Use a knife to carefully swirl the two batters together without mixing them. This act will create the marbled effect.

, Tightly cover the top of the cake pan with aluminum foil. Fold the foil under the bottom of the pan to hold it down.


The top of the pan must be covered tightly. Otherwise, excess moisture from inside the steamer can get into the batter and ruin the results.

, Place the cake pan in the center of the preheated steam rack. Cover the steamer and cook the cake for 30 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.Keep the steamer over medium heat and avoid lifting the lid as the cake cooks. Each time you lift the lid, some of the heat escapes, which may cause an increase in the overall cooking time.

, Remove the finished cake from the steamer and let it cool in its pan before turning it out onto a serving platter. Decorate as desired and enjoy.

You could also use specially designed slow cooker liners for an even easier clean-up.
Note that this recipe requires the use of a 2-qt to 4-qt (2-L to 4-L) slow cooker. If you use a smaller or larger slow cooker, adjust the recipe by proportion accordingly.

, Mix the flour, granulated sugar, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir until evenly combined.


These ingredients form the base of the actual cake batter.

, Pour the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla into the wet ingredients. Stir them into the dry ingredients until evenly combined.


The resulting batter may have a few small lumps, but use the mixing spoon to break apart any notably large lumps.
Keep stirring until you can no longer see any of the dry ingredient mix.

, In a separate medium mixing bowl, combine the brown sugar and 1/4 cup (60 ml) cocoa powder. Stir the hot water into the mixture, as well.


Combine the two dry ingredients first, followed by the hot water.
Continue stirring the mixture until it appears evenly combined and very smooth. Do not leave any lumps.

, Pour the cake batter into the slow cooker, then pour the pudding mix on top. Do not stir the two together.


Since the cake batter will be thick, you'll need to spread it over the bottom of the slow cooker with a spatula or the back of a spoon. Do so before topping it with the pudding.
Try to pour the pudding over the cake batter layer as evenly as possible.

, Cover the slow cooker and switch it onto its high heat setting. Cook the cake for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Do not remove the lid while the cake is cooking. Doing so will release too much heat and may increase the final cooking time.

, Turn off the slow cooker once the cake is done. Remove the lid and allow the cake to stand for 30 to 40 minutes before serving it.


Instead of serving this cake in slices, you'll need to spoon it out into serving dishes.

Mix the ingredients with a fork until combined.Not every mug is microwave-safe, so you should check yours before using it. An 8-oz (250-ml) microwave-safe ramekin would also work well for this recipe.
Try to break apart as many lumps as possible while stirring the ingredients together. A few small ones may remain, but most should be broken apart and mixed into the batter.
Ideally, there should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between the top of the batter and the top of the mug. If there's too much batter, consider pouring half of it into a separate mug.

, Sprinkle the chocolate chips into the batter. Stir and fold them into the batter until evenly distributed


You can omit the chocolate chips if you would prefer a plain yellow cake. Other additions, like small nuts or sprinkles, could also be used in similar proportions.

, Cover the mug with plastic wrap and microwave the cake on full power for at least 60 seconds, or until the center is set.


Microwaves that run on a lower power may need up to an additional 40 seconds of cooking time. If the center isn't set after the initial 60 seconds, continue to microwave the cake in 10-second intervals until done.
Note that a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean if the center has set.

, Remove the plastic wrap and decorate the cake with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, or powdered sugar, as desired. Eat the cake directly out of the mug.

Next, grease two 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pans with butter and lightly dust them with flour to prevent the cake from sticking.If you prefer, you can use nonstick cooking spray to grease the cake pans.;
, Add 1 cup (227 g) of softened, unsalted butter and 2 cups (400 g) of sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat the two together on medium for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture is light and fluffy.If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can use a handheld electric mixer to mix the cake batter.
You can also mix the cake batter by hand, but it will take more time and effort.

, Once the butter and sugar mixture is light and fluffy, mix 4 large eggs into the bowl, but add them one at a time. Continue mixing the batter on medium for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the eggs are fully incorporated., Add 3 cups (300 g) of sifted cake flour, 3 teaspoons (12 g) of baking powder, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt to a separate large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully combined.You can substitute all-purpose flour for the cake flour. However, for the best results, measure out 3 cups (375 g) of the all-purpose flour and remove 6 tablespoons (48 g). Replace it with 6 tablespoons (48 g) of cornstarch and sift the mixture 4 to 5 times to ensure that it’s light and airy.

, Once the flour mixture is blended, add it to the butter mixture alternately with 1 cup (237 ml) of coconut milk. Blend the mixture on medium-low until all of the ingredients are incorporated.Coconut milk is available in both cans and cartons at most mainstream grocery stores.
Be sure that you’re using coconut milk and not coconut cream, which has a thicker consistency.

, After the flour mixture and coconut milk are mixed into the batter, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of coconut extract and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of pure vanilla extract. Mix them in on medium-low until they are completely blended in., When the batter is fully mixed, carefully divide it between the two greased, floured cake pans. Use a rubber spatula to make sure that it’s spread evenly in the pans.It’s a good idea to tap the pans on the counter or table after you add and smooth the batter. That will get rid of any air bubbles so your cakes don’t fall.

, After you’ve poured the batter into the pans, place them in the preheated oven. Allow the cakes to bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the tops are a light golden brown.To be sure that the cakes are finished baking, insert a cake tester or toothpick into the center. If it emerges clean, the cakes are done.

, When the cakes are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes on a wire cooling rack.When they’re finished cooling, the top of the cakes should feel firm.

, After the cakes have cooled partially, run a butter knife or small offset spatula around the edges of the cakes to loosen them from the pans. Turn them out onto the cooling rack, and allow them to cool completely for at least another hour.It’s important to ensure that the cakes are completely cool before you frost them or the frosting may melt off.

, Add 8 ounces (225 g) of softened cream cheese, ½ cup (113 g) of softened butter, 2 cups (250 g) of powdered sugar, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of coconut extract to the bowl of a stand mixer. Cream the ingredients together on medium until they are fully blended.You can also use an electric handheld mixer to mix the frosting.

, When the cakes are cooled completely, place one of the cakes on a platter or plate. Apply a generous amount of frosting to the top of the cake, and use a butter knife or small offset to spread it evenly across the surface.To keep the frosting from getting on the plate, place several pieces of wax or parchment paper just beneath the edge of the cake, all the way around, to cover the plate before you frost it. When you’re finished icing the cake, you can simply pull the paper away and the plate will be clean.

, Once the frosting is spread over the top of the bottom cake, place the second cake on top of it. Use the butter knife or offset spatula to smooth frosting all over the sides of the cakes and the top of the second cake so the entire surface is covered., When the cake is completely frosted, garnish the top of it with some shredded, sweetened coconut. You can add as much or as little of the coconut as you like.If you like, you can press some of the shredded coconut along the sides of the cake as well.
You can toast the shredded coconut before you add it to the cake if you prefer.

, After you’ve garnished the cake with the shredded coconut, use a sharp knife to cut it into slices. Place the slices on plates, and serve.Tightly cover any leftover cake and store it in the refrigerator. It should keep for up 5 to 6 days.

Lightly dust the inside with flour, then tap out the excess.Consider using spring-form cake pans. This will make the cakes easier to remove.;
, You can do this in a mixing bowl using a handheld mixer. You can also do it in a food processor or in a stand mixer. #* If the butter is still too hard, consider cutting it into smaller cubes first., Beat the batter well after each egg you add. You do not want any streaks or swirls of egg yolk., In a small bowl, stir together the royal blue and violet gel paste food coloring. You can do this using a fork or a mini whisk. Once the color is even, stir in the cocoa powder. The violet food coloring will help tone down any green tones in your cake, giving you a nice, royal blue color. If you leave the violet food coloring out, your cake will be green-tinted.
You can leave out the violet food coloring, but your cake may end up looking more turquoise instead.

, Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined, and there are no streaks or swirls of color. Set the mixture aside when you are done., Do not add it into the sugar and butter mixture just yet. You will be adding it gradually alongside the buttermilk., Add in a little bit of the flour mixture first, stir, then add in a little bit of the buttermilk. Keep doing this until you use up all of your flour and buttermilk., Vanilla extract can sometimes alter the color of a cake. It should not be too noticeable, but if this really bothers you, opt for clear vanilla extract instead., Combine the baking soda and vinegar in a small bowl or cup first. The baking soda will fizz once you add the vinegar, which is natural. Once the fizzing has died down, stir the mixture into the batter., The cakes are ready when the tops spring back when lightly touched. Another way to test for doneness is to poke a toothpick into the center of the cake; if the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done.Try to bake everything on the same rack If you have a small oven, you may need to bake your cakes on separate racks. If you choose to do this, rotate them every 8 minutes or so, so that they all bake evenly.

, Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes first, then take them out of the pans. Chill the cakes in the fridge for at least 2 hours. The cakes must be completely cool before you frost them. If you frost them too soon, the icing will melt., The bowl needs to be big enough to fit the rest of your ingredients, including the butter and sugar., You only want to soften the crème, not cook it or melt it., You can do this using a medium speed setting and a handheld beater, a stand mixer, or even a food processor., Continue beating the mixture until the icing turn smooth. You are now ready to start frosting your cake., Make sure that the bowl is big enough to fit the rest of your ingredients, including the cream cheese, butter, and sugar., You only want to soften the crème, not cook it or melt it. About 15 to 20 seconds on high will be plenty., You can do this using a handheld beater, a stand mixer, or even a food processor., Do not overdo this, however, or the icing will lose its ""fluffiness."", This will help everything mix in easier and give you a smoother texture. Be sure the scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often so that everything mixes in evenly., If you do no like nuts of coconut, you can omit this step. Your icing is now ready to spread over your cake!, If your cakes are all relatively flat on top, you do not need to do this. If they have bumps, however, you may wish to trim these off with a knife or a piece of thread.Save the tops for munching on layer. You can also turn them into delicious blue velvet cake pops.

, If you trimmed the tops off of your cakes, make sure that you are using the untrimmed cake layer. The bump should be flat against the plate, and the bottom part should be sticking up.

To make clean-up easier: place four 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide strips of parchment paper or wax paper your plate to form a square. Place your cake on top, so that the strips are partly visible. They will help keep your plate clean while you decorate.,, If you trimmed your cake layers, place the cake cut-side-down. This will reduce the amount of crumbs that get mixed into the frosting. If the second layer goes on crooked, use your hands to gently center it before you add the frosting.

Once again, if your cake is dry, gently brush it with a pastry brush to get rid of any loose crumbs.
To prevent the second cake layer from breaking, consider picking it up using a large, offset spatula., Do not coat it with frosting yet. You can, however, brush the entire cake once more using a pastry brush. This will help get rid of any loose crumbs., You want to add just enough milk so that the icing becomes easily spread-able. The crumb coat helps seal in any crumbs, and makes your icing look smoother and neater. This is especially important considering your cake is blue and your icing is white.If you are short on time, you can move on to frosting the rest of your cake using an offset spatula.

, Use an offset spatula to coat the entire cake with a thin layer of the diluted frosting. Let the cake chill in the fridge for 15 minutes before adding a second coat.Once you have added the second coat, let the cake chill for another 15 minutes in the fridge. This sets the crumb coat., Do the top of the cake first, then the sides. For added texture, gently tap the top of the cake with the back of a spoon to great ""peaks.""

Consider placing the cake on a decorator's turntable. Spin the turntable as you frost the sides. This will make the coat more even.If you added parchment/wax paper strips under your cake, carefully pull them out once you are done.

, If you have any leftovers, cover the cake loosely with some plastic wrap, and store it in the fridge."

Finish and serve the cakes.",How to Make Bibingka1," Prepare four tart pans or ramekins by lining them with cut banana leaves.If you want the cakes to look as traditional as possible, bake them in 6-inch (15.25-cm) ramekins. You could use 4-oz (10-cm) ramekins, but the cakes will be thicker than usual and will also take longer to cook. Similarly, if baked in tart pans, the cakes will be a bit shallower than usual and may bake quicker.
You could also use a standard 8-inch (20.3-cm) round baking pan with a depth of 3 inches (7.6 cm) if you do not have a tart pan, ramekins, or ramekin-like miniature baking pans.The banana leaves are an essential aspect of this recipe if you want it to be as traditional as possible. They add to both the appearance and fragrance of the finished cakes.;
, In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined.


Most traditional recipes only use standard rice flour and do not used sweet or glutinous rice flour.

, In a separate bowl, beat the eggs lightly with a whisk. Add the sugar and beat again. Add the melted butter and beat once more.


Granulated sugar is used in most traditional recipes for bibingka, but for a slightly different taste, you could use brown sugar, instead.

, Alternate adding the flour mixture and coconut milk to the egg mixture, beating with a whisk after each addition. Only beat until the mixture is just blended, and avoid over-beating the batter.

, Divide the batter evenly amongst the four prepared pans, pouring it directly into the banana leaves.


Traditionally, you should lay slices of salted egg on top of each cake before baking it. Duck eggs are the most traditional, but salted chicken eggs will also work., Place the cakes on the top rack of the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cakes are cooked through.


Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of each cake. If it comes out clean, then the cakes are fully cooked.

, Switch the broiler on to low and broil the cakes for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the top of each cake browns.


Watch the cakes carefully during this time to prevent them from burning.
Note that this step is only optional. It will have very little bearing on the taste of the cake, but it can create a more appealing appearance.

, Remove the cakes from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. Brush them with additional melted butter, and if desired, sprinkle with additional sugar, grated coconut, and grated cheese. Serve while still warm.


You could eat the cakes out of the ramekins you baked them in, but for a better presentation, you should slide them out of their baking dishes before adding the butter, sugar, coconut, and cheese. Carefully tip each ramekin onto its side and gently slide the cake and banana leaves out. Place each cake on an individual serving platter and enjoy.

",How to Make Red Velvet Cake," Good bakers know that moving quickly and efficiently in the kitchen leads to better cakes and smaller messes. Measuring out ahead of time makes it possible., Use an electric mixer set to medium speed. Add the sugar along the edges and slowly work it in to avoid sugar splatter.

, Mix in well, keeping your beater moving. It is okay if you add them both at once, too.

, In a separate bowl, use a whisk to blend the food coloring into the cocoa.Fun Fact: The original red velvet cakes got their color because imported cocoa was actually red tinted. The food coloring came later., You can also mix the flour, salt, and baking soda in a separate bowl, adding at once. You can also add it all together into the batter one at a time, using the electric mixer to get a nice consistent batter.Add the flour slowly to avoid splatter. It can help to add it with the buttermilk.

, Just a splash is all you need -- it will give it a nice subtle tanginess., You want a thin, consistent batter with not chunks of flour or dry ingredients left. Want a little more red color? Add a few more drops of red food coloring., The cake should take roughly an hour to cook. When it is done, you'll know through the toothpick test -- stab the center of the cake with a knife or skewer-- if it comes out without still-wet batter on it, it's done.

, After 5 minutes, remove from the pan and let cool on a wire rack. Don't frost a hot cake -- the warmth with thin out the frosting and make it difficult, if not impossible, to add smoothly., You'll be whipping the butter and cream cheese up, but that only works if it is soft enough to whip! Set the two dairy products out for 15-30 minutes to get soft.


In a pinch, you can gently microwave them to speed things up, but keep it very brief. You don't want liquid., An electric mixer is best, as it will make quick work of the dairies, but a wooden spoon and whisk work well too. They don't have to be perfectly combined, just well mixed.

, Powdered sugar will want to poof and fly out as you mix it. To avoid a mess, add it in 3-4 parts, mixing almost all of the first part in before adding the second.

, Keep the mixer (or your mixing hand) going until the frosting is nice smooth texture. If you want to thin it out a bit so it spreads better, add 2 tablespoons of cold milk., Place a little pat of icing on the bottom of our plate or cake dish to keep the bottom layer from sliding around.Then frost it and stack another layer on top, frosting the top of that. Don't worry too much about the sides yet.


Do not try to frost the cake while it is still hot. Let it cool completely., Stack the layers up high, frosting between each layer with a 1/4"" of frosting or so, adding more to taste.

, For bakery quality frosting, keep the knife clean after every pass, using a little warm water to ensure your frosting knife applies the icing smoothly and evenly. Use big globs of icing at a time and don't try to spread it too thin. By working in small areas, not spreading too thin, and cleaning the knife regularly, you can get a quality frosted cake.


If you've got time, real pros will ""double frost."" Start with a thin layer of frosting everywhere -- it is okay if it pulls up crumbs. Then freeze the cake for 15 minutes, pull it out, and frost ""for real."" You'll be astonished how easily it goes on!,"

, Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small mixing bowl. Use a whisk to stir the ingredients and make sure they are fully incorporated.

, In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar using a hand or stand mixer, or by vigorously mixing the ingredients with a spoon or spatula. Keep beating or stirring the ingredients while you slowly add the egg whites to the mixture. Add the vanilla and milk and continue mixing until all of the wet ingredients are combined.

, Place half of the flour mixture into the large bowl with the wet ingredients. Use a spoon to stir it in, then add the other half of the flour mixture. Keep stirring until the flour is completely mixed in.

, Pour equal amounts of batter into six different bowls. Dye each bowl of batter a different color of the rainbow by pouring in a few drops of the six different food colorings. Stir each bowl of batter well, continuing to add more food coloring until the batter reaches the hue you desire.If you use gel food coloring, you only need a drop or two to achieve a rich hue. If you're using liquid food coloring, you may need to use several drops.
If you have a standard set of food coloring that comes with red, yellow, blue and green, create the extra colors by combining the colors you have. Make orange by mixing red and yellow, and make purple by mixing blue and red.

, Each layer must be baked in a separate cake pan. If you have six cake pans, go ahead and pour the bowls of batter into the different pans. If you have fewer cake pans, pour batter into the pans you have and reserve the extra bowls of batter to be baked when after the first round of layers is done.

, Place the cake pans in the oven and bake the layers for about 15 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean. Don't over bake the layers, as this could affect the brilliant rainbow colors; avoid letting the tops get brown.


When the layers are ready, remove them from the oven and let them cool.
Reuse the cake pans if you still have additional layers to bake.

, In a large mixing bowl, beat the powdered sugar, butter, cream, and vanilla on high, until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. If it seems too soft, add more powdered sugar until it becomes thicker and stiffer., Use a serrated knife to slice a thin layer from the top of each layer of the cake. Slicing off the slightly rounded tops that puffed up during the baking process will help the layers stack together neatly.

, Place the purple layer on the cake stand or plate that you'll be using to serve the cake. Use an offset spatula or icing knife to scoop a small amount of frosting onto the center of the cake. Spread it evenly across the surface of the purple layer, all the way to the edges. Add the blue cake to the stack and frost it using the same method. Repeat with the green, yellow, and orange layers, finishing with the red layer on top.


There's no need to use a scientific color order - create a rainbow using any color order you'd like.
Be sure to conserve enough frosting to finish by frosting the entire cake, rather than using most of it up between layers.

, Scoop frosting onto the top of the cake and spread it evenly to the edges. Use more frosting to cover the sides of the cake. Be sure to use plenty, so that the layers beneath are invisible. The brightly-colored interior of the cake will remain a surprise until the first slice is cut.

, Finish the cake with rainbow sprinkles or nonpareils, or use a contrasting frosting color to pipe a message across its surface.

,, Using the same recipe outlined above, make a white cake batter. Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet in another, then combine the two and beat until they are well incorporated.

, Put equal amounts of batter into six separate bowls. Use food coloring to dye the bowls of batter red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple.

, Use a small measuring cup to scoop some red batter into a a cake pan. Use a different cup to scoop some yellow batter into the same pan. The two colors can touch, but don't pour one directly on top of another. Continue scooping different-colored batters into the cake pan until you've used half the batter from all of the bowls. Repeat with the second cake pan and the remaining batter., Place the two cake pans in the oven and bake them for about 20 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean. When the cakes are done, let them cool completely before assembling the cake.

, Beat the powdered sugar, butter, cream and vanilla together until the frosting becomes light and fluffy.

, Use a serrated knife to cut off the rounded tops of the two cakes. Place one layer on the cake plate or stand you're using to serve the cake. Scoop frosting onto the cake and use an offset spatula or a frosting knife to spread it across the cake's surface. Place the second cake layer on top of the frosting. Finish frosting the cake by covering the top and sides.

, Add edible glitter, birthday candles, or other cake decorations as the final touch. The cake is now ready to serve.

You can also substitute a 14-ounce (397 can) of caramel flavored sweetened condensed milk for the plain sweetened condensed milk and the caramel sauce. It is usually a seasonal flavor, though, so you may not be able to find it year-round.

, When the cake has cooled slightly, use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke holes across the top of it. Space the holes as evenly as you can and make sure that they cover the entire surface of the cake.You can use the blunt end of any spoon or fork that has a round shape to poke the holes.

, After you’ve poked the holes in the cake, slowly pour the caramel mixture over it. Work slowly to ensure that you distribute the mixture evenly so it sinks into all of the holes.It’s often easier to pour the caramel mixture over the cake if you transfer it to a container with a spout, such as a measuring cup.

, Once you’ve poured the caramel mixture over the cake, place it in the refrigerator. Allow it to chill for approximately 10 minutes so the caramel mixture has time to set.It’s a good idea to tent some foil over the cake before you put in the refrigerator.

, After the cake has chilled briefly, remove it from the refrigerator. Use a spatula to spread a 12-ounce (340 g) can of chocolate frosting over the top of the cake.You can also use approximately 2 ½ cups (340 g) of homemade chocolate frosting.
If you prefer, you can substitute an 8-ounce (226 g) container of whipped topping for the frosting.

, When the cake is covered with the frosting, use clean fingers to sprinkle ½ cup (55 g) of chopped pecans and ½ cup (90 g) of mini semisweet chocolate chips over the cake. Spread them evenly across the entire surface of the cake.You can use full size chocolate chips to top the cake if that’s what you have in your pantry.

, After you’ve topped the cake with the nuts and chocolate chips, tent it with a piece of foil. Place the cake in the refrigerator, and allow it to chill for at least two hours.You can make the cake a day ahead and chill it overnight if you like.

, When you’re ready to serve the cake, pour approximately ⅓ cup (113 g) of salted caramel sauce over it. Use a knife to cut it into slices, and place it on plates to serve.You can use homemade or store-bought salted caramel sauce to top the cake.

A 9×13-inch baking pan is a good size to use.

, Take the red velvet cake mix that you made and carefully pour it into the baking pan. Let the pan fill up with the mix before leveling the surface of the cake with a spatula. Once you've used all the batter, you can put it in your preheated oven., Bake the cake until it's done. You can test the readiness of your cake by inserting a toothpick into it. If you can pull the toothpick out clean, it means that inside of your red velvet cake is done. Do not leave your cake in for more than 25 minutes or it may overcook., Use oven mitts or oven rags to carefully take your cake out of the oven. Letting it sit for 20 minutes helps the center solidify., Using the end of a wooden spoon, create holes across the surface of the cake. Make sure to space the holes out evenly. Space the holes two to three inches apart from one other. Go over the entirety of the cake until there are four or five rows of holes with four holes in each row., Add the condensed milk over the top of the cake so that it gets poured into the holes that you made. You can pour the milk directly from the can. This will add sweetness and smoothness to your red velvet cake. Spread the milk over the surface with a spatula so that there is an equal distribution., Cover your cake with a clear plastic wrap or tin foil and place it in the refrigerator.

",How to Make a Raw Cake1," Oat groats are the most basic, unrefined form of oats. Often referred to as fresh-picked or fresh-harvested oats, oat groats are most commonly given to livestock as feed. Oats in this form digest very slowly and have a very low glycemic index value.


Soak and dry the oat groats. Oat groats must be soaked overnight in order to be safely consumed by humans. Soaking the oat groats will begin the breakdown process of the gluten which makes oat groats easier to digest. Dry oat groats may cause indigestion or constipation. Note that the soaking and drying process will not affect the volume of the groats, but milling them will reduce the total volume by about half. If you have extra milled oat groats, you can save them in the freezer.
Spread the soaked groats on a fine mesh surface such as a mill-grade sieve with a 1⁄10 inch (0.3 cm) gap between sieve wires and allow them to dry completely. The drying process can take up to six hours.
Process the dried groats in a food processor until a fine powder is formed. This powder can be used as a thickening agent or a flour substitute in many recipes. Remember that it’s important to let the groats dry thoroughly to prevent clumping when you mill them in a food processor.;
, Add the salt, raw cocoa powder, dates and sprouted and milled oat groats to a food processor or blender. Process these ingredients until they are well incorporated. This forms the chocolate base of the raw chocolate cake.

, Slowly add the raw agave or maple syrup to the dry, chocolate ingredients. The addition of the syrup will form a sticky and moldable batter.


You can add more or less syrup until you have reached the desired consistency for your raw chocolate cake. If you are concerned with the sugar content of your cake, you can substitute water and a binder such as cornstarch for some of the syrup.

, Press the sticky batter into cupcake tins or cake molds to get the shape of the cake you want.


You might consider brushing the cake molds with coconut oil to prevent the batter from sticking.
Since this cake has no flour, it cannot be pressed into large cake molds. Molds that are fewer than 4 inches (10.2 cm) in diameter will produce the best cakes.
This cake batter can also be pressed into cupcake tins.

, The dough should be refrigerated for at least six hours.

, Combine a whole avocado with the raw cocoa powder, coconut oil and maple or agave syrup in a food processor. Coconut oil can be used in its solid form for a fluffier icing.


Blend these ingredients until they form a fluffy and rich icing. Because coconut oil is solid at room temperature, this icing can be made while the cake is refrigerating. The icing can sit at room temperature without losing its consistency.

If you don't like strawberries, you can use other types of soft fruit, such as bananas, blueberries, or mango., You can do this using an electric mixer, a handheld mixer, or even a food processor fitted with whisks., Beat the ingredients again until everything is evenly combined. If the whipped cream is still too wet, beat in some more powdered sugar; if the whipped cream is too dry, beat in some more cream., You won't need a lot; about a spoonful will do. This thin layer of cream will help hold your first layer of graham crackers in place.Consider using a glass dish. You won't be taking this cake out of the dish, so a glass dish will allow you to see all the different layers.

, If you are using a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters baking dish, you will need about 6 graham crackers.Make sure that you use enough graham crackers so that you can't see the bottom of the baking dish.

You can split some of the graham crackers into smaller pieces if you need to, but don't crumble them up.
If you plan to serve this at home, consider building this cake on top of a fancy serving platter., This will make it easier to measure the whipped cream out when you start making your layers. Simply divide the whipped cream between four cups or four small bowls., Don't worry about making the whipped cream layer perfectly smooth on top. Make sure, however, that it goes from edge to edge of the baking dish, and that it covers all of the graham crackers evenly.If you are building this on top of a platter, consider piping the whipped cream around the edges of the cake using a star-shaped decorating tip. This will make the cake look nicer.

, Take your strawberries, and start layering them across the top of the whipped cream. Place the strawberries close enough so that they touch, but not so close that they overlap., Use one-fourth of the whipped cream for each layer. You will have one last cup/bowl of whipped cream left over by the time you are done., You can smooth the whipped cream down using a rubber spatula, or swirl it around using the back of a spoon. For a fancier touch, put the whipped cream into a piping bag fitted with a star-shaped tip, and pipe little ""stars"" around the edges of the cake., You can leave the strawberries whole, your you can slice them for a different look., You will be drizzling the ganache over the top of the cake for that final touch. It is not completely necessary, but it will make your cake look and taste great. If you'd like to add a ganache drizzle, do the following:In a small saucepan, heat ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of heavy cream until small bubbles form.
Put the chopped chocolate into a small bowl, then pour the cream on top.
Wait a few minutes, then stir the mixture with a whisk.
Keep stirring until the ganache is thick and smooth.

, The easiest way to do this is with a spoon. You can also pour the ganache into a plastic squeeze bottle, and then drizzle it over the cake that way., The cake is ready when a knife poked into the center comes out with a few, soft crumbs; the knife should pass through the graham crackers easily."

Remove the cake(s) from the oven and let it cool completely.,
Decorate your cake.",How to Make a Quick and Easy Cake4,", Each brand of cake mix will be a little different, so the exact amounts will vary. You will be using the same measurements that your cake mix calls for, but you will be using different ingredients. This will make your cake taste more homemade., Read how much oil your cake mix needs—it is typically around ½ cup (115 grams)—then use that amount in butter instead. Cut the butter into cubes, then melt it in the microwave or in a saucepan over the stove. The butter will make your cake rich and flavorful.Vegan or want the cake to be fat-free? Try applesauce instead! You do not need to heat the applesauce., Most cake mixes call for about 2 or 3 eggs. This means that you should be using 3 or 4 eggs instead. Add the eggs in one at a time into the mixing bowl, beating with a whisk after each addition. Keep beating until the eggs and butter are well combined.

, Read how much water the box calls for, measure out some milk instead, then slowly pour it into your mixing bowl while stirring. The amounts may vary from brand to brand, but it is typically around 1⅓ cups (320 milliliters). The milk will add extra richness and flavor to your cake.You can also use hot water in place of cold/room temperature water if you are making a chocolate cake. This will bring out the chocolate flavor.For an even richer cake, use buttermilk instead.Vegan or can't have dairy? Try full-fat coconut milk instead., You may want to sift the cake mix first to break up any lumps or clumps. Keep whisking the batter until everything is well-combined; be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often.

, These extras are not necessary, but they can take your cake to the next level and make it taste as though it was made from scratch! Here are some ideas to get you started:

If you are making a white cake, add ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract.If you are making a chocolate cake, add in a handful of chocolate chips or chocolate shavings.If you are making carrot cake, add in some grated carrot for a hint of freshness.If you know that the cake is going to be very sweet, add ¼ teaspoon of salt and 1 to 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice. This only works for white or yellow cake mixes., Depending on the cake mix you bought, and the type of pan you are using, you will have enough to fill one or two pans. Every cake mix will be different, but here are some general guidelines:


With one box of cake mix, you can typically fill two 8 or 9-inch (20.32 or 22.86 centimeters) round cake pans.
With one box of cake mix, you can fill one 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) baking pan.

, Again, every type of cake mix will have slightly different baking times. The size of your pan will also make a difference. In general, however:


An 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) round cake will bake in 26 to 31 minutes.
A 9-inch (22.86 centimeters) round cake will bake in 24 to 29 minutes.
A 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) sheet cake will bake 26 to 31 minutes.

, Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes first, then invert it onto a plate, and let it finish cooling. The cake must be completely cool before you add frosting onto it.

, Cut the cake in half using a piece of thread or a bread knife, then spread some frosting or jam on the inside. Put the cake back together, then use a butter knife or off-set cake decorating spatula to spread more frosting on the top and sides of the cake."

Let it cool.",How to Make a Malteser Cake," Fill a pot with water and put it on to boil (if you have a double-boiler, you could use that instead). This way it will have boiled by the time you need it.;
, Grease the pan you will be putting the mixture in. This is a ""no-bake cake"", so use a glass dish/pan instead of a metal one. Although you don't have to grease the pan now, it is better to do it at the beginning rather than later, as the longer you wait to put your mixture into the pan, the more it will ""set"" and be harder to scoop into the pan.

, Put the 1/2 package of cookies into a bowl, then crush them using a rolling pin. The cookies should be crushed into a fine powder with no large chunks remaining.

, Measure out 100 grams of butter and put it in a separate bowl. Make sure that this bowl is made of glass so that it won't melt, and make sure it's big enough to fit comfortably inside the pot you're boiling the water in without falling inside (if you have a double-boiler, use that instead).

, Measure 200 grams of milk chocolate, then break up the bar into smaller pieces. Then add the chocolate to the bowl of butter.

,, Make sure that it sits comfortably, but doesn't fall in. Stir the treacle, butter, and chocolate until it has melted.

, Remove the treacle, butter, and chocolate bowl from the stove (use an oven mitten as the bowl will be hot), and put it on the counter. Gradually add the crushed cookies to the melted mixture, stirring the melted ingredients as you go.

, Add 1/2 of your package of Maltesers into the mixture, stirring it until they're evenly distributed in the mixture.

, Once everything has been mixed in, scoop this mixture into your pan, spreading it out as evenly as possible. Do this as quickly as you can, because the mixture will begin to ""set"" if you wait too long, and it will be much harder to scoop into the pan.

, Put the mixture in the fridge for 15-20 minutes or until it is no longer hot.

, Because the hot mixture will have caused the chocolate to melt off of the Maltesers you have already put in the mixture (they will have ""gone bald""), use the last half of the Maltesers to garnish the top of your cake, since the mixture has now cooled and the chocolate won't melt off of the Maltesers. This will give your cake more aesthetic appeal.

, Put your cake back in the refrigerator for another hour and a half. Once it has cooled, cut it up and enjoy!

Parchment paper will make it easier to lift the cake out of the pan and return it to the pan. You'll need to do this when you cool the cake and spread the chocolate milk mixture over it.;
, Measure your dry ingredients into a medium mixing bowl. Whisk or stir the ingredients together and set aside the dry mixture. You'll need:1 1/2 cups (180 g) flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 cup (75 g) cocoa
1/4 teaspoon salt

, Crack 4 eggs and separate the whites from the yolks. Place the egg whites in a large mixing bowl and whisk them until they begin to foam. Gradually pour in 1 cup (200 g) of sugar while you whisk the mixture on high speed. Keep whisking for 3 to 5 minutes.You can use a stand or hand mixer with a whisk attachment.
The mixture should become white and glossy once you've finished whisking it.

, Keep the mixer running on high speed and add the 4 egg yolks one at a time. Whisk the mixture for another 3 to 5 minutes, so the egg yolks are completely incorporated., Turn the mixer to low speed and add half of the dry mixture to the wet mixture. Keep mixing it until the dry ingredients are stirred in.Mixing the dry ingredients in stages will prevent lumps from forming in the batter.

, Slowly pour in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. The batter will thin out when you add the liquids. You may want to stop and scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl at this point., Stir in the rest of the dry mixture on low speed. You can continue to mix the batter for 3 to 5 minutes, so you don't see any pockets of dry ingredients and so the liquid is combined., Pour the batter into the prepared pan and tap it to release any trapped air. Bake the cake for 20 to 25 minutes. If you poke a toothpick into the center of the cake, it should come out clean once it's finished baking. Turn the cake upside down on a cooling rack, but let the cake cool for 10 minutes before you lift the pan off.Cool the cake completely before you assemble the chocolate tres leches cake. You can make the chocolate milk mixture while the cake is cooling.

, Open 1 can (14 ounces or 396 g) of sweetened condensed milk and pour it into a mixing bowl. Open 1 can (12 ounces or 354 ml) of evaporated milk and add it to the sweetened condensed milk. You'll also need to add 1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream and 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. Whisk the mixture until it's completely combined.If your cocoa powder contains lumps, you may want to whisk or sift it before adding it to the milks.

, Take a fork or toothpick and poke holes all over the top of the cooled chocolate cake. These small holes will help the entire cake absorb the chocolate milk mixture., Carefully lift the cake and place it back into the baking pan. Gradually pour the chocolate milk mixture over the top of the cake. Try to pour it evenly, so the entire cake absorbs the mixture.If you notice the milk mixture pooling in spots, you can use a spoon or spatula to spread the mixture across and into the cake.

, Wrap the pan with plastic wrap and put the cake in the refrigerator. It should chill for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Letting the cake rest allows it to soak up the chocolate milk mixture and become soft., Get out 4 ounces (115 g) of high-quality milk chocolate. Use a sharp knife to carefully chop the chocolate into fine pieces. This will help it melt evenly. Put the chopped chocolate into a medium bowl.If you want a less sweet frosting, consider using bittersweet or semisweet chocolate instead of the milk chocolate.

, Pour 3/4 cup (180 ml) of heavy cream and 3 tablespoons of water into a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium, so the liquids begin to bubble gently., Slowly pour the cream mixture over the chopped chocolate and let it rest for 30 seconds. Stir the mixture and let it rest until the chocolate is completely melted. Stir the mixture again., Put the bowl of chocolate cream into the refrigerator to chill for a few hours. You can even let it chill overnight before you want to make it. You should also stick the bowl of an electric mixer and the whisk attachments in the freezer to chill.Keeping your ingredients and equipment totally cold will help the cream whip up quickly with lots of volume.

, Pour the chilled chocolate cream into your chilled mixing bowl. Attach the whisks to your mixer and whisk the cream on high speed until it's light and fluffy. This should take a minute or two.Avoid over whipping the cream or it will thicken and become dense.

, Remove the chilled cake from the refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap. Dollop the milk chocolate whipped cream over the top of the cake and use an offset spatula to spread it evenly.

, You may want to use a mortar and pestle for this, but any type of pounding utensil is good.

, Follow the instructions that come with the jello package. The traditional color is clear, but you can use other colors.

, Make sure that there is enough to cover the bottom in an even layer. It should be about 1⁄3 inch (0.8 cm) in thickness at the least.

,, The idea is that you want the jello to mix with the fruits, without disturbing the layer of graham crackers.

, Since condensed milk is very sweet and sometimes used as a substitute for sugar, you should use it sparingly, and only for flavor.

If you used spring-form pans, you can simply open up the pans and take the cakes out. If you used basic pans, run a knife along the inner edges of the pan, then invert the cakes onto a plate., Melt the chocolate first, either in the microwave or over a double boiler, then fold in the rice crispy cereal using a rubber spatula. Keep mixing until the cereal is evenly coated with the melted chocolate., If you use the round cake pans, the rice crispy cakes will match your sponge cakes perfectly. If you choose to use a large pastry pan, you will need to chop it into smaller pieces in order to get it to fit on the round sponge cakes.

If you are using two cake pans, consider setting some of the rice crispy mixture aside on some wax paper, and then chopping it up. You can use it as a garnish later on.

, If you used the round pans, simply dump them out, and set them aside on wax paper. If you used a square or rectangular pan, dump the rice crispy out, then chop it up with a knife.

If you set some rice crispy mixture aside for the garnish, be sure to chop it up as well.

, In an electric mixer, combine the butter, melted chocolate, icing sugar, and milk. Start on a low speed, then gradually increase to a medium speed setting until the frosting turns light and fluffy.

If the frosting is too dry, add more milk. If the frosting is too wet, add more sugar. Beat the frosting well after each addition.

, Place the first cake down on a plate, and spread ¾ cup (45 grams) of frosting on top using an off-set cake decorating spatula. Top it off with the chocolate rice crispy. Repeat the cake, frosting, and rice crispy layer. Finish off with a final cake layer.If you chopped the rice crispy into chunks, you will need 1 cup (225 grams) per layer.
Trim the tops off of the cakes to make them flat, if desire. Save the excess cake to make cake pops, or eat them.

, When you get to doing the sides, consider spreading just a thin layer first, letting the cake sit in the freezer for about 15 minutes, and then spreading on the rest of the frosting. This thin, ""frozen"" layer is known as the ""crumb coat,"" and will help keep any loose crumbs in place.If you have any leftover rice crispy mixture, use it to garnish your cake."

Preheat your oven to 425ºF (220ºC).,
Spray four custard cups with baking spray.,
Place the cups on a baking sheet.,
Melt the butter and chocolate in the microwave for 1 minute.,
Add the remaining ingredients.,
Divide the mixture into the four cups.,
Bake the cakes for about 13 minutes.,
Let stand for 1 minute.,
Place the cakes on a plate.,
Serve.",How to Make Chocolate Molten Lava Cake,";
, The spray will make it easier to release the cakes from the cups when they're baked. You can also use molds or ramekins, for a fancier touch. You may even want to lightly dust the insides of the molds with white sugar. You won't be needing the cups for serving, so it doesn't matter if they don't look incredibly fancy. You can use a bit of butter instead of the baking spray if you choose.

, You can line the sheet with aluminum to catch any stray bits of chocolate that might drip onto it.

, Place the butter and chocolate in a large bowl and heat it up on high until the butter is completely melted. You can use semisweet chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, or even a mixture of the two, for a unique flavor. However, it's best to either use semisweet on its own or use a half and half mixture. Once the butter is melted, just whisk the mixture until the chocolate is melted, too.


You can also melt the butter and chocolate in a double-boiler over simmering water instead. A medium-sized saucepan will also do the trick.







, Now, stir in the powdered sugar until it is fully incorporated. Then, crack the eggs and whisk them in. (You can whisk the egg whites in a separate bowl first if you like.) After that, add the vanilla and the flour. (Just make sure not to use self-rising flour.) Stir the ingredients together until you have a nice, creamy mixture.








, You don't have to divide it perfectly. Just fill each of the cups to be about 3/4ths full until you've filled each of the four cups. You'll need to leave some room in the cups for the cakes to rise.








, This should take between 11-15 minutes. You'll know the cakes are done when the sides become firm while the centers are nice and soft. If you bake them too much, then your ""lava"" won't flow. The centers shouldn't be completely liquid-like, but they should still be soft. The tops should be puffed and a little bit cracked.

, Once you take the cakes out of the oven, let them sit for 1 minute to cool off and harden just a bit. Try to resist the temptation to eat them as they are.

, Now, use a knife or spatula to gently scrape the sides of the cups so the cakes are loosened from the cups a bit. Then, place a plate over the top of each cake and turn it over, so that the plate is under the cake as the cake falls out of its cup and is ready to eat. For best results, you should hold each custard cup down over the plate for 10 seconds before releasing each cake.








, These tasty cakes should be served warm so the ""lava"" is at its most delicious. They can be enjoyed on their own, but they'll be even tastier if you serve each cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and/or a healthy dose of whipped cream. You can also try the cake with coffee-flavored ice cream as well. For an added touch, you can sprinkle the cakes with powdered sugar and garnish each one with a few raspberries or kumquats.


If you want to prepare the batter in advance, you can store the filled cups in the fridge for a few hours after covering them with plastic wrap. Just wait at least an hour for them to return to room temperature before you bake them.

Serve the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake.",How to Make Chocolate Hazelnut Cheesecake1," Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (176 C). Place 1 cup (85 g) of graham cracker crumbs, ⅓ cup (50 g) of ground hazelnuts and ¼ cup (50 g) of packed light brown sugar into a food processor. Blitz the mixture to combine the ingredients. Pour in ¼ cup (55 g) of melted unsalted butter and ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract. Blitz the mixture to incorporate the butter.Since the graham crackers and hazelnuts are already ground, you won't need to process the crust mixture very much. The food processor just helps combine the crust quickly.;
, Grease or spray a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan with cooking spray. Dump the crust mixture into the bottom of the pan and use your fingers to firmly press it into the pan. Bake the crust for 7 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove it and let it cool while you make the cheesecake filling.You could also use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup to press the crumb crust into the pan.

, Turn the oven down to 325 degrees F (162 C). To make the ganache, place 6 ounces (170 g) of chopped semisweet chocolate into a mixing bowl. Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of heavy whipping cream into a small saucepan. Turn the heat on to medium, so the cream just begins to bubble a little. Remove the cream from heat and pour it over the semisweet chocolate. Whisk the ganache until it's smooth. Put it aside while you make the rest of the filling.You should whisk the ganache slowly, so the hot cream doesn't splash you.

, Let 1 pound (453 g) of cream cheese set out at room temperature until it's soft. Place it in a mixing bowl and use an electric hand or stand mixer to beat the cream cheese. Scrape the sides occasionally, so all of the cream cheese becomes fluffy. Slowly beat in ¾ cup (150 g) of sugar.If the cream cheese is cold, it will be difficult to beat and the cream cheese won't become light and fluffy.

, Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and add ½ cup (120 ml) of hazelnut liqueur to the cream cheese mixture. Beat the mixture until the liquid is combined. Add 2 large eggs, but beat them in one at a time on low speed.The cream cheese filling should now appear runny. It will thicken a little as you stir in the ganache.

, Use a rubber spatula to pour the ganache into the cheesecake filling. Beat the ingredients on low speed for about 30 seconds, so the chocolate is evenly distributed throughout the filling.If you prefer, you could stir the ganache in by hand. You may need to stir it longer to ensure that it's well combined.

, Pour the chocolate hazelnut filling into the prepared crust and bake it for 30 minutes. Leave the oven door closed and just turn off the oven. Leave the cheesecake in the oven for 30 more minutes.The cheesecake will finish cooking as it sits in the cooling oven. Avoid opening the oven door or the cheesecake may not set up properly.

, Take the cheesecake out of the oven and let it cool on a rack until it's at room temperature. Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate it overnight. When you're ready to serve the cheesecake, gently remove the outside band from the springform pan, so you can easily slice the cheesecake.You can garnish the cheesecake with cocoa powder and whole, toasted and peeled hazelnuts.

Drizzle the cheesecake with melted chocolate hazelnut spread.",How to Make Chocolate Hazelnut Cheesecake2," Place 10 tablespoons (140 g) of unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. While the butter melts, you can crush 1 10.6 ounce (300 g) package of digestive biscuits in a food processor until they're crumbs. Pour the melted butter into the crumbs and put the lid on the food processor. Blitz the mixture until the butter is incorporated.If you can't find digestive biscuits, you can use graham crackers. You may need to break up the sheets of graham crackers, so they fit in the food processor.

, Get out a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan with a removable bottom. Dump the buttery crumbs into the pan and spread them evenly. Use your fingers to press the crust firmly into the bottom of the pan. Put the pan in the fridge to chill.If you don't want to use your hands to press the crust, you can use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup.

, Let 18 ounces (500 g) of cream cheese come to room temperature. It should be completely soft. Place it into a large mixing bowl along with 2/3 cup (85 g) of powdered sugar. Use a hand or stand mixer to beat the cream cheese and powdered sugar on low speed. Once the sugar is incorporated, you can turn the speed to high and beat the mixture, so the cream cheese becomes fluffy.If you try to beat the cream cheese while it's still cold, the cheesecake filling will be lumpy.

, Pour 1 1/4 cup (300 ml) of heavy whipping cream cream into a large mixing bowl along with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Use electric mixer to whisk the cream on high speed for a few minutes, so soft peaks form in the cream.If you can, chill the mixing bowl and whisk attachments for about 15 minutes before you want to whip the cream. This will help the cream whip up faster.

, Use a rubber spatula to spoon the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mixture, so it's completely incorporated. Avoid stirring in the whipped cream or you'll lose the volume.To fold, hold the spatula and use a twisting motion with your wrist, so the whipped cream is gently combined with the cream cheese.

, Unwrap 15 hazelnut chocolates and use a sharp knife to carefully chop them into rough pieces. Set aside about two-thirds of the chopped chocolates to use for the garnish. Scoop the remaining third into the bowl with the cream cheese filling and gently stir the chocolates in.You can use hazelnut chocolates like Ferrero Rocher or even just chocolate covered hazelnuts.

, Use the rubber spatula to pour and spread the filling over the crust in your springform pan. Spread the top, so the filling is even. Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 6 hours.If you want to make the cheesecake ahead of time, you can make it a day in advance and chill it overnight.

, Measure 4 tablespoons of chocolate hazelnut spread into a small saucepan. Turn the heat on low so the spread melts within a few minutes. It should become runny. Turn the heat off and let the chocolate cool a little. Drizzle it over the cheesecake and chill the cheesecake until you're ready to serve it.You can also sprinkle the remaining chopped hazelnut chocolates over the cheesecake as a garnish.

Pour in the melted chocolate and whip once again until combined., When the praline has cooled thoroughly, place it on a chopping board and bash it up with a rolling pin. Then press a lot of weight down onto the rolling pin to crush the praline into small pieces. If it's at all soft or warm then this won't work!




, First mix the cognac and the milk, then take one half of the sponge cake and using a pastry brush, paint one side with milk mixture. Turn it over and do the same on the other side, then repeat with the other half of the cake., It's best to frost the cake on the plate or tray you will serve it on.

Sprinkle a ¼-ounce (7 g) envelope of active dry yeast and a pinch of granulated sugar over the milk, and let the mixture stand until it becomes foamy, which should take approximately 5 minutes.The milk should be between 105 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit (41 to 46 degrees Celsius).
If the yeast mixture doesn’t foam at all, throw it away and start over with a new packet of yeast.;
, Add ¼ cup (50 g) of granulated sugar, 1 large egg, and 1 large egg yolk to a medium size bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until the mixture is smooth.To separate the yolk, break the egg against a flat surface, such as the counter or table. Divide it into two halves over a bowl, and allow the egg to fall into the lower half. Transfer the yolk back and forth between the two halves, so the white drips into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolk back and forth until all of the white has been removed. Save the white for use in another recipe.

, Once the egg, egg yolk, and sugar are mixed, pour the yeast mixture into the bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully combined., Add ½ teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt and 2 cups 9250 g) of all-purpose flour to the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Mix on low briefly to just blend the two.You can mix the dough in a food processor if you don’t have a stand mixer.
You can mix the dough by hand with a wooden spoon and a dough cutter. However, it will take more time and effort.

, When the salt and flour are mixed in the stand mixer, pour in the egg mixture. Mix on low until the egg mixture is just incorporated, which should take approximately 30 seconds.Be careful not to overmix or you may wind up with tough babka.

, After the egg mixture is incorporated, replace the mixer’s paddle attachment with the dough hook. Add 7 tablespoons (98 g) of unsalted butter that’s been softened to room temperature and cut into pieces to the bowl, and beat on medium-low until the butter is fully mixed into the dough, which should take 8 to 10 minutes.The finished dough should be smooth, slightly sticky, and stretchy.

, Once the dough has come together, turn it out onto a floured surface. Use clean hands to knead it several times until it becomes even smoother and then form it into a ball.You may want to flour your hands lightly too, so the dough doesn’t stick to them.

, After you’ve kneaded the dough, butter a large, clean bowl and transfer the dough into it. Cover the bowl with a clean towel, and allow the dough to rise for 1 to 2 hours.After you place the dough in the buttered bowl, turn it over a couple of times. That will allow the dough to absorb some of the butter.
For optimal results, place the dough in a warm, draft-free location, such as inside an oven that’s not on, so it can rise more easily.
When the dough is finished rising, it should be approximately double in size.

, Once the dough has risen, punch it down with clean hands. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow it to chill for at least 4 hours.For the best results, refrigerate the dough overnight.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the babka, set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat. Next, butter a 8 ½-inch by 4 ½-inch (22-cm by 11-cm) loaf pan to keep the babka from sticking.If you prefer, you can grease the pan with non-stick cooking spray.

, Add 3 ounces (85 g) of finely chopped bittersweet chocolate, 2 tablespoons (14 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons (28 g) of unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon (12 ½ g) of granulated sugar, ¼ teaspoon (⅓ g) of ground cinnamon, and ⅛ teaspoon (¾ g) of kosher salt to a heatproof bowl. Toss lightly with a wooden spoon to ensure that the ingredients are mixed.You can substitute semisweet chocolate for the bittersweet if you prefer.
Chocolate chips can work in place of the chopped chocolate.

, Place the bowl with the chocolate mixture over a saucepan that’s full of water simmering on medium heat on the stove. Continue to heat the mixture until the chocolate and butter are melted, which should take 5 to 10 minutes.Stir the mixture periodically while it’s heating to ensure that the chocolate and butter melt evenly.
You can melt the mixture in the microwave if you prefer. Place the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat on medium power for 30 seconds. Stir the mixture, and return it to the microwave for another 30 seconds.

, After the dough is finished chilling, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a 22-inch by 12-inch (56-cm by 30-cm) rectangle, making sure that one of the long sides is facing you.If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can substitute a wine bottle, water bottle, or thermos.

, Once the dough is rolled out, use an offset spatula or a butter knife to spread the chocolate filling mixture over it. Make sure that you spread the filling all the way to the edges of the dough without leaving a border., When you’ve covered the dough with the chocolate filling, begin to roll the dough up like a jelly roll. Be that you’re rolling a long side of the dough away from you to get the right shape and size.Try to roll the dough as tightly as you can while maintaining the log’s thickness.
Pinch the ends of the logs shut to close them and keep the filling from leaking out.

, After you’ve finished rolling up the log, use a sharp knife to cut it in half horizontally. Arrange the two halves so they’re side by side and touching.Make sure that the long sides of the logs are still facing you.

, That creates the “X” shape that will allow you to form the twists for the babka., Take the two ends on one side of the “X” and twist them together twice. Next, grab the ends on the other side of the “X,” and twist them together twice as well.In the end, you’ll have a total of four twists.

, Once you’ve shaped the dough, carefully lift it from the floured surface and place it in the greased pan. Cover the pan with a clean towel, and allow the dough to rise in a warm spot for an hour to an hour and a half.If you prefer, you can cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight.

, Add 2 tablespoons (25 g) of dark brown sugar, the remaining 1 tablespoon (12 ½ g) of granulated sugar, ½ teaspoon (1 ¼ g) of ground cinnamon, and ⅛ teaspoon (¾ g) of salt to a medium bowl. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients together until they’re fully blended., Once the sugar and cinnamon mixture is blended, add the remaining 2 tablespoons (28 g) of melted butter to the bowl. Mix well until the butter is fully incorporated.You may find it easier to mix in the butter with a whisk rather than a spoon.

, After you’ve incorporated the butter, add 5 tablespoons (39 g) of all-purpose flour to the bowl. Use a fork to lightly toss the ingredients until moist clumps form.The streusel will have a slightly wet appearance when you’re finished mixing it.
If you aren’t planning to top the babka with the streusel right away, store it in the refrigerator until you’re ready to use it. Allow it to come to room temperature before sprinkling it on the babka, though.

, Add 1 egg and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream to a separate small bowl. Whisk the two ingredients together to create a light, frothy egg wash., Once the egg wash is mixed, use a pastry brush to apply to the top of the dough. Next, use your fingers to spread the streusel over the babka as evenly as possible.If you don’t have a pastry brush, fold a piece of parchment or wax paper into a strip and use it to paint the egg wash onto the dough.
You can omit the egg wash and streusel topping if you prefer.

, After you’ve sprinkled the streusel over the babka, put the pan in the preheated oven. Allow the babka to bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the top becomes golden brown.You can also test the babka’s doneness with a toothpick or knife. Stick it in the center -- it shouldn’t meet any resistance and should emerge clean when you pull it out.

, When the babka is finished baking, remove the pan from the oven. Place it on a wire cooling rack, and let it cool for 15 to 20 minutes., When the babka has cooled slightly, run a knife around it along the inside of the pan to loosen it. Flip the pan over to turn it out on the cooling rack, and allow it to cool for another 20 to 30 minutes before cutting it.The babka will stay fresh for 3 to 5 days at room temperature.
If you want to freeze the babka, wrap it in plastic wrap and then foil. It will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months.

Replace half to 3/4 of your all purpose flour with alternative flours.,
Replace the sugar with honey or agave nectar.,
Use dark chocolate in place of milk or semi-sweet chocolate whenever possible.",How to Make a Healthy Cake2," This fruit puree adds moisture like fat would, but cuts down on the calories and saturated fat. You can also replace it with plain yogurt.

Replace up to half of the fat content with bean puree. Use pinto beans for non-chocolate cakes and black beans for chocolate cakes. This substitution increases the fiber and protein of your cake, making it much healthier.
Replace a portion of the fat with vegetable puree. Pumpkin puree and sweet potato puree are excellent choices. You can use spinach puree for a small portion of the fat in dark chocolate desserts.

Remember to use unsweetened alternative milk, because many of the sweetened brands have large amounts of added sugar., You can use almond flour, spelt flour, quinoa flour or whole wheat flour. Grind your rolled oats in a food processor to serve as oat flour.

Cakes with airier textures should have less all purpose flour substituted. If your cake requires fine flour, you can buy whole wheat pastry flour for a replacement.

, These sweeteners still pack a lot of calories; however, they are more natural and have a lower glycemic index, so they are considered more healthy. If you use agave nectar, it is sweeter than sugar so you can use 3/4 of the sugar measurement.

Try reducing the amount of sugar in your cake. If you want to continue to use granulated sugar, you may be able to reduce the sugar by up to 1/3 of the measurement. A fresh cake will still taste sweet and airy with slightly less sugar.

, Look for chocolate with at least 70 percent cocoa and aim to go for an even higher percentage. Your cake will taste richer while adding antioxidants."

Fill in the top of the cake with the remaining glaze.,
Decorate the cake.",How to Make a Drip Cake," The best drip cakes are created from layer cakes. Try baking a triple layer cake with three round cake pans. You can choose any flavor you want. Strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate are all great choices for a drip cake with ganache glaze.You can also use a boxed cake mix to make your cake.;
, Once you bake the cake of your choice, let it cool completely. Make sure you let the cake cool at room temperature until it is cool to the touch. You should not feel any warmth coming from the cake. This should take about 20-30 minutes. Once the cake is cool, ice it.

You can use any type of icing, like buttercream or fondant.
You can also used store-bought icing.

, You will need to refrigerate the cake before you can cover it in dripping ganache glaze. Place the iced cake in the refrigerator and allow it to cool for at least 60 minutes., You can turn the ganache glaze for your drip cake into any color of the rainbow by adding food coloring to white chocolate. You can also go for a more traditional ganache glaze by sticking with milk or dark chocolate., Locate a medium sized bowl that is safe to use in the microwave, like a glass bowl. Place the chocolate in the bottom of the bowl. Pour the heavy cream over the chocolate., Place the bowl in the microwave. Microwave the ingredients for around 60 seconds. Remove the bowl from the microwave and stir the ingredients with a wooden spoon., After stirring the chocolate and cream, return the bowl of ganache to the microwave. Microwave for another 30 seconds, remove the bowl from the microwave, and stir. If the chocolate is not completely melted, heat for a second 30-second segment.The finished glaze should be runny, silky, and free from lumps.

, If you want to make a colorful ganache glaze, now is the time to add food coloring to the chocolate and cream. Try using a gel or paste in the color of your choice. Add the food coloring to the glaze by slowly squeezing the tube or by small spoonfuls. Keep adding the coloring bit by bit until you get the color you desire.You should only add food coloring to a white chocolate ganache glaze.
Do not use liquid food coloring as this will make the glaze too runny.

, It is important that your cake is quite cold when you glaze it. A cold cake will slow down the dripping process, helping to create a controlled drip environment. A warm or room temperature cake will allow the glaze to run over the cake too quickly, making a runny mess of your culinary creation., Start at the top of the cake, near the edge. Take a spoonful of glaze and slowly let it drip down the side of the cake from the top. You can also use a piping bag to create the drips. Create drips around the entire cake, spacing them about half an inch or 1.25 centimeters apart.Avoid dumping too much glaze on top of the cake as this can create a mass of unwanted drips.

, Once you have created the desired amount of drips along the sides of your cake, use the rest of the glaze to cover the top of the cake. Gently spoon the glaze on the top of the cake. Spread the glaze out after you apply each spoonful. Make sure the top is entirely covered with an even layer of the glaze.It's okay if extra drips form while you glaze the top of the cake.

, Add character to the cake by placing edible decorations on the top, or scattered around the base of the cake. For example, you can add colorful lollipops and candies to the top of a cake dripped in pink chocolate. Or try decorating a cake glazed in milk chocolate with peanut butter cups broken in half, chopped peanuts, and chocolate candies."

If you do not have a lot of time on your hands, you can use a pre-baked sheet cake instead. Click here to learn how to assemble the cake, here to learn how to prepare the icing, and here to learn how to decorate the petit fours.

A half-sheet cake pan is 12 by 16 by 3 inches (30.48 by 40.64 by 7.62 centimeters).;
, Pour the flour into a mixing bowl, then add the baking powder and salt. Stir together until evenly combined, then set aside., Pour the sugar into a large mixing bowl, then add the butter and shortening. Beat together until smooth, using an electric mixer or hand-held beater., Keep mixing with your electric mixer until everything is smooth and fluffy., Add half of the flour mixture into the sugar mixture, and beat well until combined. Stir in half of the evaporated milk. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture and evaporated milk., Gently fold the sour cream into the batter using a rubber spatula. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl., Check the cake for doneness after 25 minutes be poking a toothpick into the center. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is ready. If the toothpick has crumbs on it, bake the cake for 5 to 10 more minutes., Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes first, then carefully flip it over onto another sheet of parchment paper. Peel away the parchment paper from the bottom (if necessary), and discard it.

, You can do this using a cake splitting tool, a long knife, or a piece of thread.

If you are using a pre-baked sheet cake, check the thickness; you may have to split it into thirds instead.
If you are using a pre-baked pound cake, cut it into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) thick slices.

, Keep the top half of the cake on the cardboard, and set it aside for now. If you don't have any thin cardboard on hand, you can also use a thin cutting matt instead., You can also use a different type of jam, such as strawberry or blueberry. You could also use lemon curd. Try to use something tart or sour tasting; this will help balance out the overall sweetness.

If you split your pre-baked sheet cake into thirds, repeat this step for the middle layer.
If you are using a pound cake cut into thin slices, coat only half of the slices; reserve the other half for the top.

, You don't absolutely have to do this, but there is nothing wrong with extra frosty goodness. Make sure that the frosting goes from edge to edge, corner to corner.

Do not use your icing for this step; use buttercream frosting instead. Cream cheese buttercream or vanilla buttercream work especially well. You can use homemade buttercream or you can use store-bought buttercream.
If you split your pre-baked sheet cake into thirds, repeat this step for the middle layer.

, Hold the top layer over the bottom one, and line up one of the edges. Carefully slide the thin sheet of cardboard out from under the top layer, letting the cake fall into place. Use your hands to nudge the top layer into place, if necessary.

If you are using a pound cake, start playing the bare slices on top of the jam-and-frosting covered ones.

, Use an offset cake decorating spatula to spread a thin layer of frosting on the top layer of your cake. This will give you a smoother finish when you go to pour the icing on top. Do not cover the sides of the cake., Use a sharp knife to cut the edges off of your cake so that the corners are nice and sharp. Don't cut the cake into squares yet, however! Instead, use the parchment paper to lift the cake onto a baking sheet. Then, move the cake into your freezer. This will allow the cake to set up while you prepare the icing.
, Fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water, then place a heat-safe glass bowl on top. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the surface of the water. Also, make sure that the bowl is big enough to fit all of your icing ingredients., Make sure that the bowl is fitted, and that the stem can't escape. This will allow you to slowly melt your ingredients without fear of scorching them., Don't add the chocolate chips yet. If you aren't a fan of almond, you can use a different flavor instead, such as lemon or peppermint., At this point, you can turn down the heat on the burner; as long as there is steam, you will be fine. Keep stirring until the chocolate chips melt and everything turns smooth.Using white chocolate chips will allow you to change the color of the icing by adding in food coloring. If you don't care about the color and don't like white chocolate, you can use regular chocolate chips instead., Although not completely necessary, this can give your icing a lovely color! Keep in mind that a little bit goes a long way, so you won't need a lot of gel food coloring. Opt for light, pastel shades rather than bright or dark colors.

The food coloring will only work with white chocolate chips, not regular chocolate chips.
Do not use liquid food coloring, as this may cause the icing to ""seize"" and become grainy.


, You will be decorating your petit fours on this rack. The parchment paper will catch any excess icing. You can then melt the icing in your double boiler and reuse it.If you don't have any more parchment paper, you can use wax paper for this instead.

, Something between 1 and 1¼ inch (2.54 and 3.18 centimeters) would be ideal.You can also cut the petit fours into other simple shapes as well, such as hearts, circles, or rectangles. Make sure that your shapes are around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) however!, Make sure that you have some space between each square to allow the icing to drip through., Make sure that your pour the icing evenly, and that it completely covers the squares. You don't want to see any cake or filling at all. The icing should cover the sides of the petit fours in a smooth layer; you don't want any dribbles.

Don't worry if the icing layer looks thin. You can fix that in a moment.

, While you wait for the icing to set, take the excess icing off of the baking sheet below the cooling rack, and melt it in your double boiler. Pour the icing back over the petit fours as before. This will create a thicker layer.You only need to do this if your first layer is thin. If you can see bits of cake or filling, then your icing layer is too thin, and you should apply a second one.

, At this point, your petit fours are essentially done, but you can decorate them even further to match the theme of your party or event. A quick and simple decoration would be to pipe little rosettes on top of each petit four. You can also use sugar candy shaped like flowers instead, or drizzle melted, colored chocolate on top. Other popular designs include polka dots, strips, and bows."

",How to Cut a Cake with Fishing Wire," You may need to cut rather small pieces of cake if you have a large number of guests relative to the available cake.


Compare the guest count to the cake size and take note of how many pieces you will ultimately need to cut, then plan your cuts so that the number of pieces will slightly exceed the number of guests
Determine if you can cut the entire cake with fishing wire. In the event of a staggered layer cake you may need to disassemble the cake and before you cut it. For a traditional double layer cake, though, the fishing wire method will work well.;
, You can make two small guide marks on the top of the cake for each cut, one near each edge. Alternatively, you can embed a toothpick to mark the end of each planned cut.

, Use a spool of fishing wire that has not been in the tackle box, sitting in the garage or is dirty. This tool is ideal for slicing through cake, but you must use a new spool of wire.

, Loop the wire once around each index finger and stretch the wire until taut. Hold the wire over the cake in a straight, long line.


Position the wire to over your planned cut and bring the fully taut wire straight downward.







,,


Wipe the wire clean before each cut, though, for a cleaner cut.

",How to Cook Tres Leches Cake," Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 9 by 13 baking pan. You could also use a large round cake pan if you wish.






;
, Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients well.








, In a separate bowl, combine the oil, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Use a whisk or spoon to beat the ingredients. Add the eggs to the sugar mixture one at a time, beating until the mixture becomes light in color and foamy. Stir in the 1/2 cup of milk.








, A cup at a time, gently fold the flour mixture into the wet sugar mixture to create a sticky batter. Continue folding the flour mixture in until you can no longer see white bits of flour.









Don't overmix the batter at this stage, or the texture of the cake will be dense.
Use a spatula or wooden spoon for best results.

, Pour the batter into the lightly greased cake pan or baking dish. Place the dish in the oven and bake the cake for 30-40 minutes, or until it feels firm and an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes, until it comes to room temperature.







, Use a fork or skewer to pierce the cake all over the top. The holes will provide entry points for the sweet milk mixture.









Don't pierce so much that the top of the cake's texture looks bumpy.
Use a fork with thin tines or a thin skewer so you don't pull up crumbs as you poke holes.

, Combine the remaining milk with the sweetened condensed milk, the evaporated milk and the rum in a mixing bowl. Use a whisk to stir the ingredients together completely.








, Try to pour it evenly across the surface of the cake, letting it seep into the holes you made. Pour those combined ingredients over the cooled cake. Cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. The cake is now ready to eat or complete with a topping.








, This is a classic topping for tres leches cake, since the texture of the whipped cream is a great contrast to the cake. Place 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and 1/2 cup sugar in a mixing bowl. Whip the cream until it forms soft peaks. Spread the cream over the tres leches cake just before serving.









You can flavor the whipped cream with cinnamon, vanilla, lemon, or another favorite flavor.
Don't spread the whipped cream topping on the cake until just before you serve it; its texture will suffer if you let it sit out too long or try to refrigerate it first.

, Tart fruit is another popular topping for tres leches cake. Serve it either over the whipped topping or directly on top of the cake. Choose from among the following fruit combinations:









Strawberries and blueberries. Lightly crush the berries and sprinkle them with sugar. Let them sit for 15 minutes, then spread the topping on the cake.
Mangos and papayas. Thinly slice a mango and a papaya. Combine the slices in a bowl and sprinkle them lightly with sugar. Spread the fruit topping on the cake when you're ready to serve it.Peaches and cherries. Slice up a peach into thin wedges, and slice cherries into halves and remove the pits. Layer the peaches and cherries over the top of the cake in a pretty pattern.

Of course it's a good idea to have a general idea of what kind of artwork and/or exhibition you are going to see before your initial visit, but before you do extensive background research, it is advisable to visit the exhibition without too many preconceived ideas.,
Walk through the entire physical space to appreciate the exhibition as a whole, and get a sense of how it matches the curatorial goals.,
Chronicle your viewing experience with notes.,
Write a description of the exhibition (a visual inventory).",How to Write an Art Exhibition Review1," Absolutely read any material that the gallery or museum offers, and you may do a little more research after your visit, especially if the exhibition left you with questions about the artist or about the artwork. It is always important to give your reader information that will help them understand the art and your ideas about the exhibition. Do not include a full-blown biography of the artist. The life of the artist is only important if it has a direct effect on the art that you are examining, or if it affects the viewer's experience of the work. For example, you do not need to include where the artist was born unless the art work is about this place and it will help the reader understand the work better. Useful information can include the period in which the artist worked, major influences on the artist that can be seen in the exhibited work, and any personal information that helps to explain the style or subject matter of the art. Similarly, you'll want to include any information that is relevant (and significant) to specific art in the exhibition. Art is never created in a vacuum. It is important to understand the historical, cultural and social circumstances behind the creation and creator. This will help you better understand the intentions of the artist.;
,


After your initial walk-through, select a few works in the exhibition was primary examples to write about, and look at them very carefully. Pay attention to the larger composition and organization of each individual work, as well as the little details the become apparent upon close examination.

, Although you will not want to include personal musings and notes in the review itself, when you visit the exhibition it's a great idea to write down notes of your impressions and experiences. Jot down all that you think and feel when viewing the work or works, and use your notes when you write your analysis later. Think about the goals of the exhibition. It can be helpful to ask the following questions: Why are the works of art ordered or arranged this way?
Does a particular work stand out from the rest?
Is there a theme or a subtext to the exhibition?
Does the theme or thesis become obvious as I walk through the space?
How is this exhibition different from others I've seen?

, What did you see? What is there? How did it look? You will want to save your interpretations for later in the review. Write a clear description of the significant formal elements (elements of the form) of each work of art that you discuss (for example, colors, shapes, line, use of light and dark, space, etc.), and then describe the subject matter. Your goal is to help the reader imagine what the exhibition looks like. This sort of straight forward description can be useful for your own references as you reflect on your own experience. Write about distinctive features of the exhibition. Analyze the use of shading, colors, line, the medium, etc. Then look for iconographic and symbolic elements in the work. Answer the question ""What do you see?"" in a way that goes beyond just physical description."
"
Identify important themes.,
Critique the exhibition.,
If you can meet with a docent or curator, that's great.,
Another approach would be to interview a fellow attendee about their experience of the exhibition.,
Read other reviews on the exhibition.",How to Write an Art Exhibition Review2," Art historical scholarship can contribute. For example, if the exhibition features a Baroque artist, you should reference historical Baroque styles and content, and use appropriate terminology. , ""Criticism"" does not mean finding fault with your subject. Critical writing involves examining the evidence (visual or other) to make informed evaluations and conclusions. Your opinion is valid, but do not offer simple opinions before you have established evidence from your observations ad your analysis. Evaluate how effectively the artwork and the curatorial decisions (placement, viewing conditions, accompanying literature, etc.) communicate the thesis, or theme, of the exhibition. Consider subject matter and the artist's rendering of the subject matter. Engage the context of the works, and evaluate the exhibition in a nuanced way that highlights important themes.


It is not enough to simply say you like or dislike a work; you should be able to say why. It is fine to mention that a particular piece evokes a certain feeling as long as you are specific (what aspect of the work triggers that particular emotion?) At this point you can also consider how the display, lighting, and the arrangement, as well as the choice of work, contributes to the effectiveness of the exhibition.
Consider this as a persuasive argument and use evidence and research to back up your interpretation(s).

, This can help you look at the work and better understand its contexts, and this can also give you insight into the curatorial process and the ideas the were intended to be communicated by the exhibition. Museum/Gallery personnel may be able to offer insights into the exhibition or individual works that are not readily available, as well as the rationale behind the arrangement of the space and pieces. It is not necessary to speak with a Museum/Gallery staff member, or with a docent (docents are generally volunteers). Curators generally do not have time in their schedules to talk to visitors about their shows (although you may get lucky!). Besides, you need to remember that your review is not just a summary of the thesis and the creation of the exhibition -- it is the reviewer's job to look critically at the exhibition, from the point of view of a spectator. By all means search the internet or other current publications (newspapers, art magazines, etc.) to get an idea of what others have written about the exhibition. Most Museums and Galleries will issue press releases for upcoming exhibitions (and they will usually be happy to give you a copy). Press releases are good ways to learn what the curator(s) and sometimes the artist(s) want to communicate to people that visit the exhibition. An internet search can also yield public comments on a new exhibition, especially if it has been reviewed in online magazines, and all of that can help you formulate your own analysis and evaluation.

, This is a good way to see how your experience and insights compare to another viewer. Start with general questions and move on to more directed questions that address specific pieces within the exhibition.


For example, ""How often do you visit art exhibitions?"" A more directed question would be, ""What do you think is the most appealing aspect of this exhibition?"" ""Why is that?""

, After you're done writing your piece, you may want to stand back and see how your thoughts compare to others reviewing the exhibition. You will have to be careful that the ideas of the other reviewer do not overly influence your experience of the work, but many times they can include information that add to your own understanding. Make sure to cite any other reviews that you use (and any other published sources of information, beyond the exhibition itself).

"
"
Make sure the format of your review is correct.,
Know the genre you're writing within.The language should be appropriate.,
Know your audience.,
Make sure to cite your research properly.,
Finish early and let the work sit.",How to Write an Art Exhibition Review3," You will generally want to include an introduction paragraph with a thesis, sections about specific artworks in the exhibition, (including description(s), analysis, and then interpretation(s)), consideration of the space it is displayed in, and your own evaluations based on your analyses and interpretations. You will also want to include a concluding paragraph that wraps up major points and summarizes the review. If your teacher or professor gave a grading rubric for the assignment, make sure your work adheres to these standards including citation style, length, and subject requirements.

, Include meaningful adjectives and descriptions of the work. General adjectives like ""beautiful"" or vernacular expressions that relate to your personal reaction do not help the reader understand what is significant to your thesis. For example, unless you can properly and clearly explicate why it is beautiful, and what is significance about its beauty, the information is no useful to your reader (who may not agree, anyway!). Show that you took the time to understand and analyze the exhibition by choosing your words carefully. If this is a school assignment, most likely your teacher wants to learn more than whether it looked good to you or not.Understand the connotations of your words. Remember that you are writing about art and terms like ""classic"" can have time-period connotations and should be used carefully and appropriately.

, This is also important in the language that you use. If you are writing for an art history professor, chances are that they will not be impressed by jargon-laden, convoluted sentences. Rather, clear and precise language using appropriate terminology is generally what an art historian would want to read. However, if it is for a mainstream publication read by people without an extensive art history background, you will want to avoid jargon, and explain any discipline-specific terminology(that the public might not understand) within the text.

, Although reviews are not usually the same as academic essays, you will not want to steal the words of another reviewer or background information without proper credit. Your publication may have certain requirements, but generally footnotes are avoided and you should simply find an in-text way to make reference to where you are getting your information. , This can be hard if you are on a strict deadline, but planning accordingly can help your writing immensely. Generally it is a good idea to write your review and then set it aside for at least 24 hours before re-visting it.


This will help your writing and editorial process but can also help your evaluations. Perhaps you re-read a work after 24 hours and have come to a different analysis and conclusion about the exhibition. By making your writing a process, rather than a one-time sit down affair, you can get the best out of your work.

Some find these easier to keep track of, and they also fit inside your pocket for easy studying on the run.You can also buy a hole puncher and a binder ring for standard sized flashcards. Or, most office supply stores sell plastic cases designed to carry flashcards.;
, It’s helpful to use a few different colors on your flashcards. Coloring your notes helps key terms to stand out and be more memorable. Be sure to purchase a good black pen for the bulk of your writing., Reread your class notes or textbook so that you can pick out the key information you want on your cards. It won’t be helpful to cram a ton of information on each card. Try to be discerning in your choices to keep your brain less cluttered when studying.


If you're studying for a test, make sure you know what information is going to be covered on the exam. This way you won't waste time writing down facts that have already appeared on previous exams or might be on future ones.

, Go through your class notes and write down every fact that you plan to use on your flashcards in the most concise language possible.


Include information such as dates of important events, names of important figures and what they accomplished, and names and brief definitions of important theories.
This practice not only helps you focus the scope of what you'd like to include on your flashcards, but also aids in memorization. The repetition of rewriting the information a few times makes you more likely to remember it during your exam., For those who prefer computers to paper, you can now make flashcards online with certain websites such as https://quizlet.com/. Certain companies, such as Chegg Flashcards, also make apps for your phone so that you can study on the go. Check out http://appadvice.com/appguides/show/flashcard-apps-for-the-ipad for a list of the best flashcard apps.

, Flashcards aren’t textbooks. You don’t want to overload them with paragraphs of information. When you look at a flashcard, you should be able to absorb the information in a quick glance.


Flashcards are most effective if used for learning dates, vocabulary, historical events, scientific terms, and information that’s easy to memorize. Don’t use flashcards for in depth analysis.
If you’re studying WWII, for example, don’t try to use your tiniest handwriting to fill a whole card with an analysis on the events that caused the war. Instead, try breaking the information into smaller chunks on various cards with factual information such as: “In what year did World War II begin?” on one side, and “1937” on the other side.

, There’s only so much information your brain can absorb at once. To better retain information, only put one term on each card.


For instance, if you’re learning French, instead of putting “Hello, goodbye, and good evening” on the front side of one card and “bonjour, au revoir, and bonsoir” on the other, break these up into three separate cards with “hello,” “goodbye,” and “good evening” on one side, and “bonjour,” “au revoir,” and “bonsoir” on the other.

, Studies show that the most effective way to use flashcards is to make both sides of the card a potential starting point. This means that instead of having one side of a card be a question and the other the answer, you will need to make both sides of the card have unique information.


For example, say you’re trying to quiz yourself on the end of WWII. Instead of writing a card that has the question on one side: “What treaty signified the end of WWII?” and then “The Paris Peace Treaties” on the other, try rewording to “In 1947, this treaty caused the end of WWII” and then “The Paris Peace Treaties” on the other side. This way, even if you get the side with more information, you can fill in the “this treaty” with the correct information.

, Studies show that adding pictures to your flashcards will make them more memorable. It only takes our brain 13 milliseconds to recognize an image, which means that putting visuals on your cards will help you remember information faster.Make sure the image you choose correlates to the information on the card. For example, if you’re writing German vocabulary cards, don’t draw a picture of a rainbow next to the word for boy.
These don’t have to be great works of art! Even a small sketch that relates to the text will be a great trick for remembering information faster.

, Don’t overdo it when you’re creating a deck of flashcards. Your brain won’t be able to process too much information at once. Limit your deck to 20-30 cards that deal with related subject matter.


Even if you’re studying a subject that warrants hundreds of flashcards worth of information, try to break your deck into smaller units. For example, if you’re taking a class on Jane Austen, make a deck of 20-30 cards for each book that you read instead of randomly cramming information from all the books onto 100-200 cards., Repetition is key when trying to learn new information. Quiz yourself in the morning, afternoon, and evening to progress as rapidly as possible.Set an alarm on your phone for a few different times a day to remind yourself that it’s time to study!

, Having your cards accessible means that you can study at any time. Make sure your cards are either on a binder ring or in a case and pull them out at lunch, coffee breaks, on your walk home, or during any other downtime. , Flashcards are great because you can use them by yourself, but learning is usually more fun with a friend. Find a study buddy and go through the cards aloud together a few times a week. Studying with other people also tends to increase your motivation to succeed., Some people make the mistake of getting a flashcard right one time and then casting it aside. Don’t consider a flashcard completed until you can answer it correctly for two days in a row. Then, put it aside for a bit and move on to a new one, but be sure to come back to it in a week to refresh your memory., Simply reciting terms and definitions can greatly improve your chances of remembering them!"

Begin with Introduction section.,
Use section headings for the body of your paper.,
Include at least two supporting paragraph headings under each section heading.,
Create a topic sentence for each paragraph.,
Note at least two supporting points in each paragraph.,
End with a Conclusion section.",How to Write an Annotated Outline1," Your annotated outline should begin with an Introduction section, titled Introduction. Underneath the section heading, you should include one point each for:An attention grabbing hook to open your paper
A preview of the main points of the paper
Your thesis statement;
, The section headings should be labeled and ordered so they support your thesis statement. However, the headings can be as general or as specific as you’d like. The important thing is that your section headings relate directly to your thesis.For example, you may be writing a research paper about climate change on Mt.Hood in Portland, Oregon. Your thesis may focus on how the climate systems on Mt.Hood have been affected by climate change, specifically global warming and the effects of these changes. You may then create section headings like: The Geological Profile of Mt.Hood, The Climate Systems on Mt.Hood, The Recent Climate Changes on Mt.Hood via Global Warming, The Effect of Climate Change on the Local Economy, and The Effect of Climate Change on the Biology and Wildlife.
Do not go overboard on section headings, as the annotated outline should be concise and to the point. Most annotated outlines are no longer than two to two and a half pages long, with double spaces between each section.

, Each section heading should then contain at least two paragraph headings that support the points made in the section. You can have more than two paragraph headings in each section heading, as long as the information is relevant to your thesis statement.For example, under one section heading, The Geological Profile of Mt.Hood, you may include two paragraph headings: The Glaciers of Mt.Hood and The Forests of Mt.Hood.

, Each paragraph should have a topic sentence that reflects your thesis and supports the arguments made in the paragraph.For example, under one paragraph heading, The Glaciers of Mt.Hood, you may have this paragraph topic sentence: “The disappearing glaciers on Mt.Hood are clear examples of the effect of global warming on Oregon’s highest mountain.”

, You should have at least two supporting examples in each paragraph and a content summary that explains how the paragraph connects back to your thesis. Your supporting examples should be quotations and paraphrases from your research that support the paragraph’s topic sentence.For example, under the paragraph heading, The Glaciers of Mt.Hood, you may use one supporting example from a recent geological survey of the largest glacier on the mountain, Eliot Glacier, showing how the glacier is receding. You may then also use a recent geological survey of Palmer snowfields, which was downgraded from a glacier to a snowfield due to significant receding of the glacier.
Your content summary can be one to two lines that explain how the supporting evidence connects back to your thesis. For example: “The drastic receding of Palmer Glacier and the continued receding of Eliot Glacier both show how the rises in the Earth’s temperature have caused substantial glacial melting and the loss of at least one key glacial body on the mountain.”
You should then include a closing sentence that transitions from one paragraph to the next paragraph. This will help you ensure your paper flows well and moves effectively from paragraph to paragraph and section to section.

, Your annotated outline should then end with a final section titled Conclusion. Underneath the section heading, you should include one point for:A rephrasing of your thesis statement
Concluding details
A final line or clincher which reinforces your thesis

Make sure you have a page header.,
Use standard font.,
Double-space the text.,
Center the word ""Abstract"" at the top of the page.,
Begin the text of your abstract below.,
Include keywords below the abstract text.If requested, place a list of keywords on your abstract page on the line immediately following the actual text of your abstract.,
Write your abstract last.Since your abstract is a summary of your paper's contents, you should write it once the contents of your paper are finalized.,
Know which type of abstract you need to write.,
Ask yourself questions about your paper.,
Only include details used in your essay.,
Let the abstract stand alone.,
Do not comment on your findings.,
Avoid using the first person.,
Avoid abbreviations.",How to Write an Abstract in APA," The page header, also known as the ""running head,"" should be included at the top of every page.


A shortened version of your paper's title should be aligned to the top left of the page. The character count should not exceed 50 characters, including spaces and punctuation.
Every letter in the page header should be capitalized.
The page number should appear in the top right of the page. An APA abstract should be the second page of your paper, so the number ""2"" should appear in the corner.;
, Unless your instructor states otherwise, you should use 12-point Times New Roman font.


Some professors will also accept Arial font in 10-point or 12-point, but you should check with your professor before deciding to choose it.

, All the text on your abstract should be double-spaced.


""Double-spaced"" means that lines of texts are separated by a blank line.
Aside from the abstract, the entire paper should also be double-spaced.

, The word comes below the page header, as the first line of normal text.


The first letter of the word is capitalized, but the rest of the word is in lower-case.
Do not bold, italicize, or underline the word, and do not use quotation marks. The word should stand alone and in normal font.

, On the line immediately following the word ""Abstract,"" the first line of your actual summary should appear. Do not indent the paragraph.


Keep it short. A standard APA abstract is 150 to 250 words long and contained in a single paragraph.

,


Indent as though starting a new paragraph.
Type the word ""Keywords"" in italics. Capitalize the ""K"" and follow it with a colon.
In normal, non-italicized font, follow the colon with three to four keywords describing the paper. These keywords should each appear in the text of the abstract. Separate them with commas.

,


To reflect the fact that it is a summary, your abstract should use present tense when referring to results and conclusions and past tense when referring to methods and measurements taken. Do not use future tense.
Reread your essay before writing the abstract to refresh your memory. Pay close attention to the purpose, methods, scope, results, conclusions, and recommendations mentioned in your paper.
Write a rough draft of your abstract without looking directly at your paper. This will help you to summarize without copying key sentences from your paper.

, An abstract can either be informational or descriptive.An informational abstract states the purpose, methods, scope, results, conclusions, and recommendations included in your report. The abstract should highlight essential points in order to allow the reader to decide whether or not to read the rest of the report. Its total length should be about 10 percent or less of the length of the report.
Descriptive abstracts include the purpose, methods, and scope defined in the report, but not the results, conclusions, or recommendations. These abstracts are less common to APA style and usually fall under 100 words. The purpose is the introduce the subject to the reader, essentially teasing the reader into reading the report in order to learn the results.

, In order to write a thorough informative abstract, you should ask yourself various questions about the purpose and results of your work.For instance, ask yourself why you did the study, what you did, how you did it, what you found, and what those findings signify.
If your paper is about a new method, ask yourself what the advantages of the new method are and how well it works.

, The abstract exists to summarize your paper, so including information in the abstract not used in the paper is a little like false advertising.


Even if the information is closely tied to information used in the paper, it does not belong in the abstract.
Note that you can and should use different wording in your abstract. The information should be the same as the information in your paper, but the way that information is phrased should differ.

, The abstract should be dense and phrased in a way that allows it to be read alone.


Avoid phrases like, ""This paper will look at..."" Since the abstract is so short, you should cut straight to the facts and details of your paper instead of spending effort explaining their connection to your paper.
Do not rephrase or repeat the title since the abstract is almost always read along with the title.
The abstract should be complete on its own since it is often read without the rest of the paper.

, Report on your findings rather than commenting on them.


You can and should state your findings, but do not attempt to justify them. The paper itself should be used to justify your findings and provide additional support, not the abstract.

, Do not use ""I"" or ""we."" Instead, opt for neutral third person words like ""it,"" ""they,"" ""he or she,"" and ""one.""


You should also stick with active verbs more often than passive verbs.
For instance, the strongest statement for an abstract would be, ""research shows."" Avoid using phrases like ""I researched"" or ""it was researched.""

, While abbreviations and acronyms may appear in the text of the essay, they should not appear in the abstract.


Also avoid trade names and symbols.

Read over your research and identify the main sections of your paper.,
Finalize your thesis statement.,
Place your research and your thesis into an annotated outline.",How to Write an Annotated Outline2," With the structure of an annotated outline in mind, read over your research for your paper. Use a highlighter or a pen to identify the main section headings of your paper. Look at how you can break these section headings down into at least two supporting paragraph headings.You should also note any research that may be useful as supporting evidence for your paragraph headings. Identifying this before you dive into the annotated outline will save you time, as you will not need to flip through your research as you put the outline together.

, Before you put your research into an annotated outline, you should read over your thesis statement and ensure it is as clear and concise as possible. Your thesis statement will act as a roadmap for your annotated outline, so ensure that summarizes the main points of your research clearly.For example, your thesis statement for a paper on how the climate systems on Mt.Hood have been affected by climate change, specifically global warming and the effects of these changes may be: “Due to global warming, the local economy and the biology and wildlife of Mt.Hood are under threat and face possible extinction in the next fifty years.”
From this thesis, you may then create section headings that will back up your thesis, or your paper’s claim. For example: The Geological Profile of Mt.Hood, The Climate Systems on Mt.Hood, The Recent Climate Changes on Mt.Hood via Global Warming, The Effect of Climate Change on the Local Economy, and The Effect of Climate Change on the Biology and Wildlife.

, Once you have reviewed your research notes and finalized your thesis statement, you can place this information into the structure of an annotated outline. Your final outline on the effects of global warming on Mt.Hood may look like:

Attention grabber/ “hook”: “Oregon’s highest peak, Mt. Hood is known for its pristine snow and icy blue glaciers. But the most well known volcano in the state is at risk of becoming barren and dry in the next fifty years due to global warming.”
Preview of main points: “This paper will look at how global warming is negatively affecting the biology and wildlife on Mt.Hood, as well as the local economy that thrives on ski resorts and winter sports.”
Thesis statement: “Due to global warming, the local economy and the biology and wildlife of Mt.Hood are under threat and face possible extinction in the next fifty years.”


SECTION HEADING 1: The Geological Profile of Mt.Hood

Paragraph topic sentence: The Glaciers of Mt.Hood, “The disappearing glaciers on Mt.Hood are clear examples of the effect of global warming on Oregon’s highest mountain.”

Evidence/supporting point 1: Past receding of Palmer Glacier and downgrade to snow field, relevant quotations from sources.
Evidence/supporting point 2: Current receding of Eliot Glacier, relevant quotations from sources.
Content summary: “The drastic receding of Palmer Glacier and the continued receding of Eliot Glacier both show how the rises in the Earth’s temperature have caused substantial glacial melting and the loss of at least one key glacial body on the mountain.”
Closing sentence: “However, the glaciers of Mt.Hood are not the only threatened climate area on the mountain, as the biology and wildlife in the forests of Mt.Hood are also being drastically affected by rising temperatures.”

Review your research and identify the main sections of your paper.,
Choose primary references for each section.,
Do a final draft of your thesis statement.,
Place your research, your references, and your thesis into an annotated outline.",How to Write an Annotated Outline3," Keeping the structure of an annotated outline in mind, read over your research for your paper. Use a highlighter or a pen to identify the main section headings of your paper. Look at how you can break these section headings down into at least two supporting paragraph headings.You should also note any research that may be useful as supporting evidence for your paragraph headings. Identifying this before you dive into the annotated outline will save you time, as you will not need to flip through your research as you put the outline together.

, If you are including citations of your references in your annotated outline, you will need to identify your references first. Pay attention to primary references that helped you to form the main ideas in your paper. Highlight one to two primary references for each section of your paper.


You will then need to use MLA style or APA style to create a citation for each reference. You will use these references in your annotated outline as supporting evidence for each section.
You can also include additional information for each reference. This can be one to two complete sentences that sum up the main ideas in the reference and how they relate to a main idea in your paper.

, Before you put your research into an annotated outline, you should read over your thesis statement and ensure it is as clear and concise as possible. Your thesis statement will act as a roadmap for your annotated outline, so ensure that summarizes the main points of your research clearly.For example, your thesis statement for a paper on how the climate systems on Mt.Hood have been affected by climate change, specifically global warming and the effects of these changes may be: “Due to global warming, the local economy and the biology and wildlife of Mt.Hood are under threat and face possible extinction in the next fifty years.”
From this thesis, you may then create section headings that will back up your thesis, or your paper’s claim. For example: The Geological Profile of Mt.Hood, The Climate Systems on Mt.Hood, The Recent Climate Changes on Mt.Hood via Global Warming, The Effect of Climate Change on the Local Economy, and The Effect of Climate Change on the Biology and Wildlife.

SECTION HEADING 1: The Geological Profile of Mt.Hood

Paragraph topic sentence: The Glaciers of Mt.Hood, “The disappearing glaciers on Mt.Hood are clear examples of the effect of global warming on Oregon’s highest mountain.”

Evidence/supporting point 1: Past receding of Palmer Glacier and downgrade to snow field, relevant quotations from reference.
Reference: Pacific Northwest Regional Assessment Group, 1999, Impacts of Variability and Change: Pacific Northwest, JISAO Climate Impacts Group / NOAA. The PNW Regional Assessment Group looks at the history of Palmer Glacier and how its mass has shrunk over the past twenty years. This reference also explores how global warming contributed to the shrinkage of Palmer Glacier.
Evidence/supporting point 2: Current receding of Eliot Glacier, relevant quotations from reference.
Reference: National Assessment Synthesis Team / US Global Change Research Program, 2000, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, Cambridge University Press. This reference discusses how climate change is affecting the climate of the United States, including the affect on glaciers in the United States.

Use the same header from the rest of the paper on the Works Cited page.,
Put the author’s last name first, followed by their first initial (or initials) with a period.,
Include the date in parenthesis, and the title of the book in italics.,
Add the city and state of publication, followed by a colon, the publisher, and a period.,
Put the author’s last name first, followed by their first initial (or initials) with a period.,
Add the title of the article with sentence-case capitalization.,
Include the title of the journal in italics with title-case capitalization followed by a comma.,
Add the volume number in italics, followed by the issue number in parenthesis.,
Finish the citation with the page numbers of the article and the digital object identifier of the article.,
To cite a blog, start with the person’s name or screen name.,
Add the title of the blog with sentence-case capitalization.,
Finish the citation with the type of file in brackets and the blog’s URL.,
To cite a Wikipedia page, start with the title.,
Add “n.d” to indicate “no date”.,
Finish the citation with the date you accessed the page and the page’s URL.",How to Write a Works Cited Page in APA Style," If the source doesn’t have a named author, use the title to alphabetize that particular source.When using the title in the citation, skip over articles, such as “a,” “an,” or “the”.;
, Use 1-inch margins., To do this, highlight the Works Cited page with your mouse. Using the tiny triangles on the rulers at the top of the page, move the bottom one to the ½ inch indentation mark.When you’re done, the first line of every citation will be all the way to the left, while the other lines will be indented a half inch.

, Make sure the text is in 12-point font., Make sure to begin your Works Cited page on a new page., The header should have the page number and the title of the paper in all capital letters on the next line., For example, if the author’s name is Kelly Watson, it will appear as: Watson, K.

, APA uses sentence-case capitalization for book titles, meaning you only capitalize the first word after end punctuation.


So the citation will now look look like this: Watson, K. (1999). The biology of trees: Rings, leaves, and cells.


, You can find all of this information on the back side of the title page or sometimes in the library’s online catalog.The complete citation will now look like this: Watson, K. (1999). The biology of trees: Rings, leaves, and cells. Waco, TX: Burning Books.

, Follow their name with the date in parenthesis.


For example: Watson, K. (2000).

, However, because it is a journal article title, you don’t use italics or put it in quotes.


For example: Watson, K. (2000). Trees and their life cycles.

, This means you capitalize the important words, as well as the first and last word.


The citation will now look like this: Watson, K. (2000). Trees and their life cycles. Biology Anonymous,


, Most journals are divided by years, with each year being a volume. Within that year, each issue is numbered beginning with one.


The citation will now look like this: Watson, K. (2000). Trees and their life cycles. Biology Anonymous, 5(2),

, A digital object identifier or “doi” is a unique number assigned to online articles. If the database or article doesn’t have it listed, you can check to see if the article has one at http://www.crossref.org/.


APA does not require you to include database information, though you can if the article is difficult to find. Simply add “Retrieved from …” and the URL at the end.The final citation will look like this: Watson, K. (2000). Trees and their life cycles. Biology Anonymous, 5(2), 44-62. doi:9827423423

, You should follow this by the full date it was published in parenthesis.


For example: Watson, K. (2009, January 12).

, Sentence-case capitalization means you only capitalize the first letter of the sentence.


The citation will now look like this: Watson, K. (2009, January 12). Tree biology in everyday life.

, In this case, the type of file you accessed was a blog, which is referred to as a “weblog” in APA.


The final citation will look like this: Watson, K. (2009, January 12). Tree biology in everyday life. . Retrieved from http://www.treesforlife.blog/treebiologyineverydaylife

, There is no author of Wikipedia pages so don’t worry about including this.So, for example, if you are citing a Wikipedia page about oak, the citation would begin with: Oak.

, Wiki pages change constantly so there is no official publication date for the citation.


The citation should now look like this: Oak. (n.d.)

, The final citation will look like this: Oak. (n.d.) Retrieved November 23, 2014 from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak

""Indie"" is just a shortened name for ""Independent."",
Go buy yourself an Indie Album.,
Sit yourself down, and listen.,
Listen.,
Analyze.,
Finally, Vocalize.,
Write the Thing!,
Publish that Thing!",How to Write Reviews for Indie Music," The idea of independent music is the artist being autonomous, or they own their rights directly and just about all of their sales go directly to them. Indie is also a genre of music in itself, as it is a more ""artistic version of rock."" This makes it so the genre itself, and any independent labels are widely diverse in countless ways.;
, If you don't know where to find an Indie album. Just go to any store and ask about that genre, or just go rooting around through the Pop/Rock section. There's also TONS of indie music on streaming services like Rhapsody, and Spotify. You can buy directly from the artists at places like Bandcamp, Soundcloud, etc. One of the most popular places for any indie, or independent music is on the iTunes store.

, This is the most important step. But right now, don't sit there and over-analyze it, that ruins the review before you've even started it. When you hear pop music on the radio, most people don't immediately look to see if a certain instrument was being played well, or if the vocalist sounds like they were half awake or not. Listen to it as casually as you can, relax, open a book, or drink a coffee. This is that special one on one time you get with it.

, This is the bread and butter to writing the review, this is where you get to pick at those little things. First, listen to each track one by one, and form an opinion based off of that.

, Second, analyze those songs by listening to them again, this time think of a certain thing that you'll be listening to, or listening for.

, You don't necessarily have to speak, but the idea is to get your thoughts out there, either to yourself or a friend, because this will ingrain your opinion of the album in your head. It sounds odd, but it really helps to commit oath to memory instead of winging it trying to remember the whole thing.

, Yeah! This is the moment of truth, this is where you sit down and right down a detailed (or not detailed) opinion piece on the album. Always be sure to mention the artist's name, album name, and if you're talking about specifics parts of songs, them too. Be prepared to spend anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours writing it up, however long it takes to finish it.

, The last step. This is where you do the fun bit of putting your thoughts out there for curious others to see, or in most cases now, enraging the people who are very fond of it and want to complain about a certain tidbit that you said. If you're looking for a good site. I suggest Blogger. But there's also Wordpress, Tumblr, even Google+. There's a plethora of places, just pick one that's best for you.

Start with a question -- then make the answer your thesis.,
Tailor your thesis to the type of paper you're writing.,
Take a specific stance to make your thesis more powerful.,
Make the argument you've never seen before.,
Ensure your thesis is provable.",How to Write a Thesis Statement1," Regardless of how complicated the subject is, almost any thesis can be constructed by answering a question.Question: ""What are the benefits of using computers in a fourth-grade classroom?""


Thesis: ""Computers allow fourth graders an early advantage in technological and scientific education.""



Question: ""Why is the Mississippi River so important in Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn??""


Thesis: ""The river comes to symbolize both division and progress, as it separates our characters and country while still providing the best chance for Huck and Jim to get to know one another.""



Question: ""Why do people seem to get angry at vegans, feminists, and other ""morally righteous"" subgroups?""


Thesis: ""Through careful sociological study, we've found that people naturally assume that ""morally righteous"" people look down on them as ""inferior,"" causing anger and conflict where there generally is none.""

;
, Not all essays persuade, and not all essays teach. The goals of your paper will help you find the best thesis.



Analytical: Breaks down something to better examine and understand it.

Ex. ""This dynamic between different generations sparks much of the play’s tension, as age becomes a motive for the violence and unrest that rocks King Lear.""



Expository: Teaches or illuminates a point.

Ex. ""The explosion of 1800's philosophies like Positivism, Marxism, and Darwinism undermined and refuted Christianity to instead focus on the real, tangible world.""



Argumentative: Makes a claim, or backs up an opinion, to change other peoples' minds.

Ex. ""Without the steady hand and specific decisions of Barack Obama, America would never have recovered from the hole it entered in the early 2000's."", You should address a single issue in great detail so that your points can be fully supported in the body of the paper.Consider the following examples:


""While both sides fought the Civil War over the issue of slavery, the North fought for moral reasons while the South fought to preserve its own institutions.""""The primary problem of the American steel industry is the lack of funds to renovate outdated plants and equipment.""""Hemingway's stories helped create a new prose style by employing extensive dialogue, shorter sentences, and strong Anglo-Saxon words."", The best theses find a novel, exciting way to approach the topic. They're fresh and dynamic, which makes your essay fresh and dynamic.


""After the third and fourth time you see him beat himself, one finally realizes that Huck Finn is literature's first full-blown sadomasochist.""
""The advent of internet technology has rendered copy write laws irrelevant -- everyone can and should get writing, movies, art, and music for free.""
""Though they have served admirably for the past two centuries, recent research shows that America needs to ditch the two-party system, and quickly.""

, Do not come up with your thesis and then look it up later. The thesis is the end point of your research, not the beginning. You need to use a thesis you can actually back up with evidence.



Good Theses Examples:

""By owning up to the impossible contradictions, embracing them and questioning them, Blake forges his own faith, and is stronger for it. Ultimately, the only way for his poems to have faith is to temporarily lose it.""
""According to its well-documented beliefs and philosophies, an existential society with no notion of either past or future cannot help but become stagnant.""
""By reading “Ode to a Nightingale” through a modern deconstructionist lens, we can see how Keats viewed poetry as shifting and subjective, not some rigid form.""



Bad Theses Examples:

""The wrong people won the American Revolution."" While striking and unique, who is ""right"" and who is ""wrong"" is exceptionally hard to prove, and very subjective.
""The theory of genetic inheritance is the binding theory of every human interaction."" Too complicated and overzealous. The scope of ""every human interaction"" is just too big
""Paul Harding's novel Tinkers is ultimately a cry for help from a clearly depressed author."" Unless you interviewed Harding extensively, or had a lot of real-life sources, you have no way of proving what is fact and what is fiction.""



"
"
State your thesis statement correctly.,
Get the sound right.,
Know where to place a thesis statement.,
Limit a thesis statement to one or two sentences in length.Thesis statements are clear and to-the-point, which helps the reader identify the topic and direction of the paper, as well as your position towards the subject.

",How to Write a Thesis Statement2," A thesis statement conveys to the reader the points and/or arguments you wish to make in a paper.It serves as a road map by telling the reader the direction of your argument or analysis and how you will interpret the importance of the subject.In the most simple of terms, a thesis statement answers the question, ""What is this paper about?"" Additionally, a thesis statement


is an assertion, not a fact or observation.Facts are used within the paper to support your thesis.
takes a stand, meaning it announces your position towards a particular topic.is the main idea and explains what you intend to discuss.answers a specific question and explains how you plan to support your argument.
is debatable. Someone should be able to argue an alternate position, or conversely, support your claims.

, You want your thesis statement to be identifiable as a thesis statement. You do this by taking a very particular tone and using specific kinds of phrasing and words. Use words like ""because"" and language which is firm and definitive.


Example thesis statements with good statement language include:

""Because of William the Conqueror's campaign into England, that nation developed the strength and culture it would need to eventually build the British Empire.""
""Hemingway significantly changed literature by normalizing simplistic writing and frank tone.""



, Because of the role thesis statements play, they appear at the beginning of the paper, usually at the end of the first paragraphor somewhere in the introduction. Although most people look for the thesis at the end of the first paragraph, its location can depend on a number of factors such as how lengthy of an introduction you need before you can introduce your thesis or the length of your paper.,"
"
Pick a topic that interests you.,
Explore your topic.,
Know the type, purpose, and audience of the paper.,
Follow a rigid structure.,
Write down your thesis.Writing down a preliminary thesis will get you on the right track and force you to think about it, develop your ideas further, and clarify the content of the paper.,
Analyze your thesis statement once you think you have a final, or working, version.,
Realize that your thesis does not have to be absolute.",How to Write a Thesis Statement3," This must be the first step in writing your paper and your thesis statement because all direction of the paper will depend on what topic you are writing about. Unfortunately, you must ignore this step if the topic is decided for you.

, The goal of this step is to find a particular narrow subject in your topic which you can make an argument about. For example, take the topic of computers. There are many aspects of computers that can be expanded on such as hardware, software, and programming. However, vague topics like these do not make good theses. But something more narrow, such as the effects of Steve Jobs on the modern computer industry, allows for a much clearer focus.

, These are usually assigned by the instructor, but even if you get to choose them, you must understand that these will affect your thesis statement considerably. If you are writing a persuasive paper, your purpose will be to prove something to a specific group. If you are writing a descriptive paper, your purpose will be to describe something to a specific group. Each of these must be expressed in your thesis somehow.

, Knowing the basic formulas will not only keep your thesis within the acceptable length but it will also help you see how your entire argument should be organized. Your thesis should contain two parts:


A clear topic or subject matter
A brief summary of what you will say
Another way of looking at a thesis is as a formula, or a pattern, that comfortably holds your ideas:because .
Because , .
Although , show .


The last example includes a counter-argument, which complicates the thesis but strengthens the argument. In fact, you should always be aware of all counter-arguments against your thesis.Doing so will refine your thesis, and also force you to consider arguments you have to refute in your paper.

, You will be able to think about your thesis logically, clearly, and concisely.


There are two schools of thought on thesis timing. Some people say you should not write the paper without a thesis in mind and written down, even if you have to alter it slightly by the end. The other school of thought says that you probably won't know where you're going until you get there, so don't write the thesis until you know what it should be. Do whatever seems best to you.

, The point is to make sure you avoid making any mistakes that can weaken your thesis. To get a better idea of what to do and what to avoid, consider the following pointers:


Never frame your thesis as a question.The job of a thesis is to answer a question, not ask one.
A thesis is not a list.If you're trying to answer a specific question, too many variables will send your paper off-focus. Keep it concise and brief.
Never mention a new topic that you do not intend to discuss in the paper.
Do not write in the first person. Using sentences such as, ""I will show...,"" is generally frowned upon by scholars.
Do not be combative. The point of your paper is to convince someone of your position, not turn them off, and the best way to achieve that is to make them want to listen to you. Express an open-minded tone, finding common ground between different views.

, Consider it a ""working thesis"" that's subject to change. As you write your paper you may find that your opinion changes or that your direction has veered slightly. So make sure to continuously re-read your thesis, comparing it to your paper and making the appropriate changes so the two match. Once your paper is finished, go back to your thesis and determine if it needs another revision.

If you have worked as a college professor of mathematics, you might not know the best way to reach an audience of middle schoolers.
If you are writing for an audience that is unfamiliar to you, consider hiring a collaborator who is familiar with this demographic.
As you decide on a subject, consider which areas are underserved in modern education. Does your book fill a void in the market?;
, Textbook publishing is big business -- far more so than traditional book or magazine publishers. You will need to research what comparable books exist on the market and how are they priced.Define your Unique Selling Point. The USP defines what makes your textbook special. What does it offer that no other textbook offers? You will need to explain to publishers and other teachers (who might become your customers) why they should pick your book over others.

, You should find colleagues who have also published textbooks and get feedback from them. Did they use a traditional publisher or did they self-publish? How long did it take them to complete their textbook? What did they wish they had known at the beginning of the writing process?

, Most textbooks now come in ebook form; some are only available in this format while others also have a corresponding hard copy. You should consider how you will adapt your textbook for a digital audience.


Will you include a corresponding web site for the textbook where students can find practice test questions? Could you design fun games to help educate your audience (especially younger students)? Consider adding in these additional elements for the textbook.

, Writing a textbook can take a very long time -- sometimes, it will be years between the time you start to draft the book and the time it comes out into print. Are you prepared to invest this amount of time?


Are you passionate about your subject? If you are invested in the material you are writing on, then this will help you through the arduous task of publishing. If you just want to make a quick buck, you won't find much return on your time and efforts toward the project.

, Come up with a rough idea for how you will structure the book. You can ask yourself some of the following questions to help you:


How many chapters will you include? How will you divide specific topics between the chapters?
Will the chapters be independent from each other, or will students need to read one before they can move on to the next?
Will you arrange the chapters in ascending order of difficulty? By the time the student finishes the textbook, will they be prepared to move onto the next grade level in the subject?

, It is likely you won't be able to include every single piece of information relating to your subject in the book; rather, you will need to prioritize the most important content.


What are the goals of the course in which this textbook would be used? What skills should students leave the course having practiced? What should they know to prepare for the material in the next grade or class level?
How will your textbook correspond to standardized tests that students need to take during the school year? Consider finding examples of these tests to help guide your answer to this question.

, You might be tempted to work on each individual chapter until it's perfect before you move on the next. Avoid this, as it will slow you down.


Instead, write a complete draft of each chapter in the book. Once you have a full draft of each chapter, you will be able to better understand how they all work together and where you need to add more material or cut down on the length.
Create a set writing schedule and then stick to it. If you make a regular habit of writing your textbook (say, from 3:00-5:00pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays), you will be able to consistently get significant work done. Avoid writing erratically in large chunks of time.If you are working under a publisher's deadline, do not procrastinate. Give yourself plenty of time to complete the task at hand. Set weekly goals in the months leading up to your deadline.

, You don't want to put your students to sleep. Huge blocks of text might be difficult for students to process. You will need to visually break up the page, often with pictures, tables or other graphics.


You might find your word processor program (like Microsoft Word) is not very useful for including visuals alongside text. You should consider putting part of your draft in a layout program like Adobe InDesign, where you can keep images alongside text.Give yourself some time to play around with InDesign and learn the basic principles of it. This will come in handy if you decide to self-publish the book.
For any outside images or graphics that you include, make sure that you have permission to include them in your book. You could be sued for copyright infringement if you don't.

, You might find an editor who works for a textbook publisher, an independent editor, or a colleague who works in a similar subject matter. But you need to have at least one other pair of eyes on your work.


The editor will be able to help you find the best way to organize and clarify your content. She will also be able to assist in sentence-level improvements in grammar and word choice.

, When publishing a textbook you can either work with a traditional textbook press or you can self-publish. Traditional presses for textbooks include Pearson, McGraw-Hill, Cengage, W.W. Norton & Co., etc. If you work with one of these publishers, you will generally receive around 10% of the royalties for each book sold.Look up the ""Contact"" information on the publisher's web site. They will generally have guidelines for how to submit a book proposal or get in touch with an editor.
In order to get approved by a traditional press, you will need to provide the publisher with a book proposal. The book proposal will generally provide the title of the book and a 1-2 paragraph summary of each chapter. Make sure you clearly explain the content of your book and why it will be important for your target audience of students.
Make sure the book ""fits"" the publisher's list of books. Do they sell other books similar to yours? If they do, this is a positive sign because they won't have to spend extra money marketing a different item on their publishing list.With traditional presses, you will also have to sell the copyright of your work to the publisher; you will no longer have rights over the material once you sign a contract with them.

, Because publishing with traditional presses can sometimes be a competitive process, more authors have turned to self-publishing -- often with more profitable results.


Amazon.com recently entered the textbook publishing game. If authors sell their self-published textbook through Amazon for $9.99 or less, then the author will receive 70% of the royalties. This is a significantly higher rate than the 10% that is often offered by traditional presses.You could also make your textbook available for purchase through iBooks' textbook platform or through a personal web site.
With self-publishing, you often don't have to put together a book proposal and you can generally retain your rights to the material. However, it is harder to spread the word about your textbook to schools and universities.

, If you publish with a traditional press, they will handle the marketing of your textbook. But if you are self-published, you will most likely have to devise a marketing strategy on your own.

, If you are a teacher, your students are your most obvious customer base. Make your textbook a required part of your class and explain why you have created this textbook.


Try to keep your textbook at a significantly lower price than textbooks from a traditional publisher if you have self-published. You don't want your students or their parents to believe you are taking advantage of them.

, If you have used your textbook successfully in your classroom, then share this with your fellow teachers and researchers. Offer to share small lesson plans or worksheets from the textbook so they can get a sense of the book before they buy it.

, If there is a major conference in your field that happens every year, speak to the organizers about having a booth where you can sell your book to interested colleagues.


If there are popular bloggers in your field who have a wide audience, you might also ask them to review your book as a resource for their readers.

, You want to be able to show that other teachers and researchers have endorsed this book. This will add to your credibility as an author and to the value of the textbook.

Finished.

",How to Make a Raw Chocolate Cake," Oat groats are the most basic, unrefined form of oats. Often referred to as fresh-picked or fresh-harvested oats, oat groats are most commonly given to livestock as feed. Oats in this form digest very slowly and have a very low glycemic index value.


Soak and dry the oat groats. Oak groats must be soaked overnight in order to be safely consumed by humans. Soaking the oat groats will begin the breakdown process of the gluten which makes oat groats easier to digest. Dry oat groats may cause indigestion or constipation. Note that the soaking and drying process will not affect the volume of the groats, but milling them will reduce the total volume by about half. If you have extra milled oat groats, you can save them in the freezer.
Spread the soaked groats on a fine mesh surface such as a mill-grade sieve with a 1⁄10 inch (0.3 cm) gap between sieve wires and allow them to dry completely. The drying process can take up to six hours.
Process your dried groats in a food processor until a fine powder is formed. This powder can be used as a thickening agent or a flour substitute in many recipes. Remember that it’s important to let your groats dry thoroughly to prevent clumping when you mill them in a food processor.;
,


Add a pinch of salt, a half cup of raw cocoa powder, 1 and a half cups of dates and 2 cups of sprouted and milled oat groats to a food processor or blender. Process these ingredients until they are well incorporated. This forms the chocolate base of the raw chocolate cake.

,


Slowly add 6 tablespoons of raw agave or maple syrup to the dry, chocolate ingredients. The addition of the syrup will form a sticky and moldable batter.
You can add more or less syrup until you have reached the desired consistency for your raw chocolate cake. If you are concerned with the sugar content of your cake, you can substitute water and a binder such as cornstarch for some of the syrup.

, Press the sticky batter into cupcake tins or cake molds to get the shape of the cake you want.


You might consider brushing the cake molds with coconut oil to prevent the batter from sticking.
Because this cake has no flour, it cannot be pressed into large cake molds. Molds that are fewer than 4 inches (10.2 cm) in diameter will produce the best cakes.
This cake batter can also be pressed into cupcake tins.

, The dough should be refrigerated for at least six hours.

,


Combine a whole avocado with 1/4 cup of raw cocoa powder, 1/2 cup of coconut oil and 1/2 cup of maple or agave syrup in a food processor. Coconut oil can be used in its solid form for a fluffier icing.
Blend these ingredients until they form a fluffy and rich icing. Because coconut oil is solid at room temperature, this icing can be made while the cake is refrigerating. The icing can sit at room temperature without losing its consistency.

Critique structure, clarity, and logic, not the writer.",How to Write a Science Lab Report," You may have difficulty fighting the urge to procrastinate, but keep in mind that feedback and revisions can sometimes take up to a week. Having a rough version of your report at the ready a month in advance can save you from unnecessary stress and from having to turn in unpolished work.


You may have perform supplemental experiments/simulations, or repeat your initial experience after receiving your first round of feedback.
Feedback should go through the following stages ideally:


(a) Self-review and revision

(b) Peer review and constructive feedback

(c) Advisor/instructor review and feedback

;
, The goal of your experiment or the goal of proving or disproving certain hypotheses are essentially unimportant when you are writing a lab report. The data contained in it could be anything, and you may very well have to write lab reports in the future that seem silly or unnecessary. The goal of your lab report is to be read and evaluated by another person, like your instructor.It can help to remind yourself of this goal at the beginning of every section before you start writing.
When you finish a section of your report, read it through carefully and at the end of it, ask yourself: was that easy to read and understand? Did I succeed in my goal?

, The narrowest purpose of your lab report is to enable your seniors, advisors, and/or an evaluation committee to confirm your ability to consistently and clearly produce a report.But once you start devising and performing labs of your own, its quite possible that your peers or juniors will utilize it as a resource.


If you believe your paper might be of use to researchers in another discipline, like a social science, you may want to include definitions or explanations for the more technical jargon used in your paper.

, Take a piece of scrap paper and pencil and list the necessary sections of your lab report in order. Under each section, jot a few sentences that summarize what must be covered in that section.


Due to the fact that different instructors have different preferences, you should check your lab report handout or course syllabus to verify expectations for the order and content of your report.Most lab reports are organized, first to last: problem, hypothesis, materials, procedure, data, and conclusion.

, Technical aspects of your paper might require significant explanation. This may necessitate the use of subsections so that you can appropriately delve into and explain those nuanced aspects of your lab problem.


The organization of the body of your lab report will be specific to your problem/experiment.
You may also have a separate section for the statement of your design methodology, experimental methodology, or proving subsidiary/intermediary theorems in your report.

, The idea behind this style is that you should begin with the most important elements (the ""head"" points) and refine each of those all the way to the basic level.This can be divided into roughly three stages:


The section-level outline
The subsection-level outline
The paragraph-level outline

, This will give you a better idea of how to get from a blank page to a finished report.Begin with each of your section headings, leaving plenty of space between headings for subsection and paragraph-level information. Avoid being too wordy at this stage, the goal of your outline is to capture the flow and form of your report.


Bullet points are invaluable when you reach the paragraph level of your report. These will allow you to note important terms, phrases, and data that will need to be integrated with the text of your report.
Take special note, at the paragraph level, of important symbols, protocols, algorithms, and jargon.

, Use a unique bullet to indicate where an image must be integrated into your report.


You might also consider using using simple figures as a way of cutting down unnecessary wordiness.

, Highlighters can help you color code and coordinate sections of your outline with supplemental papers, like research, print-outs, and hand-outs. A colorful sticky note, on the other hand, can alert you to something you've forgotten or have yet to do, like making a graph from your data.

, These two items are the most visible parts of your lab report, and will therefore receive the most attention.A bland title or incomprehensible abstract can limit the impact your report has with your peers.


The title of your report should reflect what you have done and bring out any eye-catching factor of your work.
The abstract should be concise, generally about 2 paragraphs or about 200 words in length., Your abstract should contain the essence of your report. This can generally be conveyed by the following points, in varying amounts of detail, as is appropriate for your case:



(a) Main motivation

(b) Main design point

(c) Essential differences from previous work

(d) Methodology

(e) Noteworthy results, if any

, Nearly all reports should start with an introduction section. After the title and abstract, it is generally accepted that the introduction and conclusion are the second most widely read part of any given report. This section should answer the following questions:


What is the setting of the problem? This is, in other words, the background. In some cases, this may be implicit, and in some cases, this question may be merged with the motivation of your paper.
What is the problem you are trying to solve? This is also known as the problem statement of your report.
Why is your problem important? This is the motivation behind your report. In some cases, it may be implicit in the background, or even the problem statement.
Is the problem still unsolved? The constitutes the statement of past/related work, and should be conveyed succinctly., Since the introduction of your report is little more than a short summary of your lab in words, your outline can be an excellent guide your writing here. In many cases, the rest of your report will have the same, or a similar, flow.Each section of the body of your report can be thought of as an in-depth look at the points mentioned in the introduction.

, To prevent confusion and create a strong logical chain throughout your report, you should, if applicable to your situation, also consider answering the questions:


Why is your problem difficult to solve?
How have you solved the problem?
What are the conditions under which your solution is applicable?
What are the main results?
What is the summary of your contributions? This, in some cases, may be implicit in the body of your introduction. Sometimes it helps to state contributions explicitly.
How is the rest of your report organized?

, It is common to state that ""the reader who knows this background can skip this section"" at the beginning of this section.

, The key to writing this section is not overwhelming your readers with too much information.If you need to describe or explain specialty equipment or theory that is used, you should:


Describe the equipment or theory in a short paragraph.
Consider including a diagram of the apparatus for equipment.
Theoretical elements should be included in both natural and derived forms., If there have been similar experiments performed, or if you are expanding upon or applying a new approach to past research, interpreting how that research informed and directed your own will naturally highlight differences between your experiment and others. One possible placement is toward the beginning of the report, after your intro and background sections. Another idea is to place it in the end of the report, just before your conclusion. This is a matter of preference, and depends on the preferences of your instructor or, potentially, the following aspects:


A large quantity of work closely related to your work would likely be best closer to the beginning of your report. This will allow you to point out differences best.
Relevant work that is substantially different from your own is probably best toward the end of your report. However, this placement risks leaving your readers wondering about differences until the end of your report.

, It is common to have this as a separate section where you explain what makes your experiment novel. Here, you must try to think of dimensions of comparison with regard to other work. For instance, you may compare your lab in terms of:


Functionality
Performance
Approach
Note: each of these comparisons can be further distinguished by:


1. Functionality

2. Metric

3. Implementation

4. Etc.



, Although this may not be necessary in your particular case, many lab reports use graphics to juxtapose differences between your work and that of others. This helps to illustrate the differences between the two at a glance for your readers.


If you decide to use a chart, it is general convention that you include your own work in either the first or last column.

, The results section of your report will change according to the kind of lab you have performed, its goals, implementation, and so on. In this section, you will need to lay out all data from your experiment without making subjective comments or discussing opinions. Figures and tables should be used to organize your data as clearly and succinctly as possible.All figures and tables should be titled descriptively, numbered sequentially, and include a descriptive legend for symbols, abbreviations, etc.
The columns and rows of all tables and the axes of graphs should be labeled., If your lab has yielded abundant results, the important points in that data can be missed. Your readers will stand a better chance of remembering these if you include a summary of the indispensable information in a separate sub-section at the end of your results section.

, Even if your data has confirmed your hypothesis beyond your wildest expectations, the results section of your report should be objective. To ensure that your data and its purpose are both clear to your readers, you might ask the following questions:


What aspects of your system or algorithm are you trying to evaluate? Why?
What are the cases of comparison? If you have proposed an algorithm or a design, what do you compare it with?
What are the performance metrics? Why?
What are the parameters under study?
What is the experimental setup?

, This will require you to logically connect your results to existing theory and knowledge. Any improvements to technique or equipment that you may have realized over the course of your lab should also be included here.


Predictions are expected in this section, though these should be clearly identified as such.
Future experiments that might clarify your results should be suggested., If you state these explicitly, you can create trust and professional respect between you and your reader.

, For labs that are data heavy or incorporate highly complex principles, you might need to use your discussion section to speak on those results independently. Your conclusion should look at your results with regard to the entire experiment., It is generally accepted in academic communities that readers focus most attention on the title, abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a lab or academic paper. In that sense, this section is quite important.


Precisely and in as few words as possible, state the main findings of your lab.
Answer the question: How has the reader become smarter, or how has the world become a better place because of your work?

, This is the final section of your lab report, and is separate from your bibliography.Your section on literature cited should only include references that appear in your written report. You should alphabetize this list by author's last name, and then format the remaining information according to the source requirements., Though it might seem tiresome to you, having to slog through the report of another at the direction of your instructor, offering feedback and comments, this is an important part of the process.It is so important, in fact, that academic papers are rarely accepted until thoroughly peer reviewed.

, This is especially important if you are working with a group on a lab. Each member of the group, being a part of the lab, will likely be unable to critique the report objectively.


You might also make use of your campus writing center, if available. Here you can have a fresh set of eyes assess the quality of your report.

, Though not necessary, you can help your reviewer do the best job possible by providing him with a checklist of key points. For example, if you have a tendency to use too much jargon, you might include, ""clear jargon"" in your critique checklist. Other items you might want to highlight for your reviewer:


Title/abstract logical, understandable, and eye-catching?
All relevant questions answered in the introduction?
Overall structure of sections and subsections meaningful?
Differences between related/past work apparent?
Technical sections intelligible?
Figures/tables explained properly?
Use of terminology clear?
Symbols defined appropriately?
Results explained properly?
Technical holes/flaws?

, In some cases, you might have a difference of opinion from your reviewer. In other cases, your reviewer might give weak, questionable, or incorrect feedback. In still other cases, a reviewer can save you from making a critical error!Remember that your reviewer is taking time out of his day to read your report, and express your gratitude for his feedback.

, It can be easy to get carried away when making critique. Reviewers may even get frustrated with the state of a report, which can lead to personal comments. This can be offensive, and defeats the purpose of the peer review process, which is to improve the report, not make enemies.Try to keep your comments as impersonal as possible. Locate specific elements that can be isolated, targeted, and improved.
While taking feedback from a peer, take the comments on their technical merit and avoid being defensive.

Mix together the cream, sugar, and egg yolks in a saucepan.
If you haven't already toasted the coconut, do so prior to making the filling.
Heat the saucepan and cook the cream mix. It is really important to stir continuously or the base will burn - be sure to drag the spoon across the bottom of the saucepan as you stir. The mixture is ready once it thickens and sticks to the mixing spoon.
Pour the heated mixture over the coconut and pecans in the large bowl. Stir until the butter melts and runs through the whole mixture evenly.

Add the next layer and repeat the syrup and filling. When you reach the top layer, repeat.

, Once all the layers have been added, frost the sides together with the frosting, making it smooth and even., Pipe small wisps of frosting at even intervals around the outer edge of the cake. Add maraschino cherries in between each ""wisp"". Sprinkle toasted coconut and pecan pieces across the entire cake top. If wished, add chocolate shavings, but only the merest hint; don't overdo this.
If you don't want to pipe icing on, that's fine; just follow the layout of a circle of pecans around the outer edge, and sprinkle the toasted coconut as before (see introduction image). Add a hint of chocolate shavings as well, if wished.

",How to Make Slutty Brownies," To ensure that the oven is hot enough when it’s time to bake the brownies, set it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Next, line a 9-inch by 9-inch (23-cm by 23-cm) baking dish with parchment paper or foil, and then grease it with butter or nonstick cooking spray.Make sure you know how your oven indicates that it’s fully preheated. In most cases, a light will flash or a beep will sound to alert you.;
, Place 1 ¼ sticks (142 g) of unsalted butter, cut into pieces, in a small sauce pan, and heat over medium low heat until the butter melts. That should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes, but don’t try to rush the process by turning up the heat. Remove the pan from the heat once the butter has melted.It helps to stir the butter with a wooden spoon while it’s on the stovetop to make it melt more quickly.
If you’re in a hurry, you can melt the butter in the microwave. Cut the butter into pieces, place it in a microwave-safe dish, and microwave on high for 30 to 45 seconds or until it’s fully melted.

, Once the butter is completely melted, mix in 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar and ¾ cup (88.5 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder into the butter. Use a whisk to completely combine the ingredients., After you’ve blended the butter and cocoa mixture completely, mix in ½ teaspoon (3 g) salt, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) vanilla extract, and 2 large eggs. Whisk the mixture continuously to ensure that the eggs are fully combined.It’s a good idea to crack the eggs into a separate dish before adding them to the other ingredients in case one or both are rotten. You don’t want to ruin the entire batter by adding a bad egg.

, When the eggs are completely incorporated into the batter, add in ½ cup (62.5 g) all-purpose flour. Stir the batter until the flour is just combined, and set the batter aside until you’re ready to assemble the full brownies.Avoid overmixing the flour into the batter. It can lead to a tough, chewy brownie layer in your finished bars.

, In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine 2 sticks (227 g) unsalted butter that have been softened to room temperature, ½ cup (100 g) brown sugar, and ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar at medium speed. Beat the mixture until it becomes light and fluffy, which should take approximately 3 minutes.The best way to bring your butter to room temperature is to cut it into pieces and leave it out on the counter or table for approximately 30 minutes.
If you don’t have an electric mixer, you can mix the cookie batter together by hand. It will just take a little longer.

, Once the butter and sugars are combined, mix in 2 large eggs and 2 ½ teaspoons (12.5 ml) vanilla extract at medium speed. Beat the mixture until the eggs and vanilla are fully incorporated., After you’ve mixed all the wet ingredients together, it’s time to add the dry ingredients to form the batter. Turn the mixer to low, and add in 2 ½ cups (312.5 g) all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (6 g) salt, 1 teaspoon (5 g) baking powder, and 1 teaspoon (7 g) baking soda. Mix until the dry ingredients are incorporated.It may be easier to combine all of the dry ingredients in a separate bowl before adding them to the wet ingredients. Then add the dry ingredients in small batches so you can be sure that they’re completely blended into the batter.

, When the batter is formed, you can mix in the chocolate. With a spatula, fold in 2 cups (350 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips so they’re evenly distributed throughout the cookie batter.While semi-sweet chocolate chips are traditional in chocolate chip cookies, you can add any type of chip that you prefer. Try milk chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, or dark chocolate chips depending on your preference.

, Take your prepared pan, and press the half of the cookie dough into the bottom. Make sure to place the dough in as even a layer as possible.You can save the rest of the cookie dough for another use because you don’t want to make the cookie layer too thick. If stored in an airtight container, it will last in the fridge for up to 2 days and in the freezer for up to 6 months.

, With the chocolate chip cookie dough placed in the bottom of the pan, set a layer of Oreo® cookies on top of it. Lay as many cookies as necessary to cover the dough, but don’t overlap them. Gently press the Oreo® cookies into the chocolate chip cookie dough to keep them in place.It usually takes approximately 16 Oreo® cookies to cover the cookie dough layer.

, With the two cookie layers in place, add all of the brownie batter on top of the pan. Use a spatula to spread the batter over the cookie layers to ensure that it’s even., Place the pan in the preheated oven, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. To determine if the brownies are done, stick a knife in the center of the pan. If it comes out mostly clean, they’re baked through.If you stick a knife in the center of the brownies and it comes out covered with batter or crumbs, leave the brownies in the oven and check again in 5 minutes.

, While the brownies are particularly delicious when they’re still warm, you should allow them to cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting them. That will make it easier to slice them into 16 even bars with a sharp knife.If you want to serve the brownies warm, you can, but be aware that they’ll be messier when you cut them.

, To ensure that the oven is ready to cook the brownies when they're prepared, set it to 350 °F (177 °C) and allow it to preheat. Next, take a 9-inch by 9-inch baking pan, and spray it with nonstick cooking spray to prevent the brownies from sticking.You can grease the pan with butter instead of cooking spray if you prefer.
To make cleanup easier, you might want to line the pan with parchment paper or foil, and then grease it.

, Take an 18 oz. box (510 g) of brownie mix, and prepare the batter as laid out in the box’s instructions. In most cases, you’ll need to add eggs, water, and oil. Once the batter is prepared, set aside.You can choose any type of brownie mix that you like, but a basic fudge brownie mix is usually the best option.

, Open an 18 oz. package (510 g) of refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough, and use your fingers to create an even layer of the dough in the bottom of the pan..

, Open a 15.3 oz. package (434 g) of Double Stuff Oreo® cookies, and press them into the cookie dough to create an even layer without any overlapping.Spread the Oreo® cookies across the entire surface of the cookie dough, but don’t worry if there are gaps between the Oreos.
You won't need to use all of the Oreos. It typically takes approximately 16 cookies to cover the chocolate chip cookie dough layer.

, When the cookie layers are in place, spread the brownie mix over the them with a spatula to ensure that it’s even. Place the pan in the oven, and bake for approximately 45 minutes.You’ll know that they’re done when you stick a knife or toothpick in the center of the brownies, and it comes out clean with few crumbs.

, Once the brownies are finished cooking, let them cool in the pan for approximately 15 minutes. Use a sharp knife to cut the brownies into 16 even bars.

, To bake the brownies, you’ll need a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) pan. Grease the pan by spraying it lightly with nonstick cooking spray so the brownies won’t stick.If you prefer, you can grease the pan with butter or margarine instead.

, Add 8 tablespoons (59 g) of cocoa powder and 1 cup (225 g) of margarine that’s been melted to a large bowl. Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure that the ingredients are fully blended.You can substitute melted butter for the margarine if you prefer. However, keep in mind that your brownies may not be as fudgey.

, Once you’ve mixed the cocoa powder and margarine, stir in 2 cups (450 g) of sugar, 4 eggs, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract. Mix well until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.You may want to break the eggs into a separate bowl and beat them slightly before adding them to the cocoa powder mixture. That way, you won’t have to worry about ruining all of the batter with a bad egg and it will be easier to mix the eggs the other ingredients.

, After you’ve added the sugar, eggs, and vanilla to the cocoa mixture, add 2 ½ cups (360 g) of all-purpose flour and a pinch of salt to the bowl. Stir well to ensure that the flour is fully blended into the batter.It’s often better to add the flour to the batter a little at a time. That makes it easier to mix it in and prevent the flour from flying everywhere as you stir.

, When the flour and salt are fully incorporated into the batter, add 1 cup (125 g) of chopped nuts to the bowl. Use a spatula to carefully fold them into the batter.Adding nuts to the batter is optional. There will be nuts in the rocky road topping, so you may not necessarily want to add them to the brownies themselves too.
Walnuts are usually used in brownies, but you can use any nut that you like, including pecans and almonds.

, When the brownie batter is fully mixed, use a spatula to transfer it to the greased pan. Make sure to spread the batter through the pan in a smooth, even layer., Place the pan in the preheated heated oven. Allow the brownies to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they have a fudge-like consistency., While the brownies are baking, add 1 cup (175 g) of chocolate chips, 1 cup (125 g) of chopped nuts, and 1 10-ounce (284 g) bag of mini marshmallows to a medium size bowl. Mix briefly to combine the topping ingredients, and set aside.Use any type of chocolate chips that you like, including milk chocolate, semisweet chocolate, or dark chocolate. You can even do a combination of two or more types, as long as they add up to 1 cup (175 g).
Walnuts are the classic option for the nuts in the topping, but you can also use almonds or pecans.

, Once the brownies have baked for 20 to 25 minutes, take the pan out of the oven. Sprinkle the chocolate chip mixture over the entire pan as a topping.Spread the topping as evenly as you can over the brownies. That way, when you cut them, each square will have some topping on it.

, After you’ve covered the brownies with the topping, place the pan back in the oven. Let the brownies bake for another 5 minutes or until the marshmallows start to puff slightly.Keep an eye on the brownies to ensure that the marshmallows don’t burn at all.

, When the brownies are finished baking, take the pan out of the oven and place it on a wire rack. Leave the brownies in the pan, and allow them to cool for 15 to 20 minutes., Once the brownies have cooled fully, use a sharp knife to cut them into squares. Place the brownies on a platter, and serve.If you like, you can drizzle warm chocolate or hot fudge sauce over the brownies before serving.

, For the brownies, you’ll need an 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) or 9-inch by 9-inch (23-cm by 23-cm) baking pan. Line the pan with parchment paper that has some overlap on the sides to serve as a “handle” when you remove the brownies. Next, lightly grease the parchment paper with butter.You can substitute foil for the parchment paper if you prefer. Grease it as you would the parchment paper.
You can also grease the parchment paper with nonstick cooking spray.

, Add 4 ounces (113 g) of chopped bittersweet chocolate and ¾ cup (170 g) of butter to a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the mixture on high in 30 second intervals for 1 ½ to 2 minutes. Stir the mixture after each interval, and stop when it is completely melted and smooth.Be sure to work in no more than 30 second intervals. The chocolate can burn easily if you heat it for too long.
If you don’t have a microwave, melt the chocolate and butter in a double boiler on the stove. Place them in a heatproof bowl, and set the bowl inside a saucepan full of simmering water on medium or medium-high heat. Mix the chocolate and butter until they’re melted.

, Once the chocolate and butter are melted, add 2 cups (450 g) of sugar to the bowl. Stir well until it is fully incorporated.It’s usually easier to mix the sugar into the chocolate and butter with a whisk.

, When the sugar is fully incorporated, add 4 large eggs. Whisk the eggs in one a time, though, stirring until each one is just blended in.You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer.

, After the eggs are blended into the batter, mix in 1 ½ cups (360 g) of all-purpose flour. Gently stir the batter until the flour is just incorporated.Be careful not to over mix the flour into the batter. You may wind up with tough brownies.

, Once the flour is just blended into the batter, add 1 1-ounce (30 ml) of bottle red liquid food coloring, 1 ½ teaspoons (7 ½ g) of baking powder, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract, and ⅛ teaspoon (1 g) of salt. Mix the batter gently until all of the ingredients are just blended in.If you used salted butter in the batter, you can omit the salt if you prefer.

, When the batter is fully mixed, carefully pour it into the lined, greased pan. Use a spatula to spread the batter so it’s in an even layer., Place the pan in the preheated oven, and allow the brownies to bake for 40 to 45 minutes. You’ll know the brownies are done when you stick a toothpick in the center and it comes out with only a few moist crumbs stuck to it.If you don’t have any toothpicks, you can use a fork to test for doneness.

, When the brownies are finished baking, remove the pan from the oven. Place it on a wire rack, and allow the brownies to cool completely, which should take approximately 2 hours.It’s especially important to cool the brownies completely if you plan to frost them. Frosting warm brownies will cause the frosting to melt off.

, Add 1 8-ounce (225 g) package of softened cream cheese and 3 tablespoons (42 g) of softened butter to a medium bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat the two together on medium until the mixture is creamy and smooth.You can use a stand mixer to make the frosting if you prefer.

, Once the cream cheese and butter are blended, add 1 ½ cups (188 g) of powdered sugar and ⅛ teaspoon (1 g) of salt. Use the electric mixer on low to carefully beat the sugar and salt in.Powdered sugar is also known as confectioners’ sugar or icing sugar.

, When the powdered sugar and salt are fully incorporated, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to the frosting. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to gently mix it in until it’s fully blended., After you’ve allowed the brownies to cool for approximately 2 hours, use the excess parchment on the sides to lift the brownies out of the pan. Discard the parchment paper, and set the brownies on a plate or platter.If you prefer, you can leave the parchment paper under the brownies until after you frost them. That can help keep frosting smudges off your plate or platter.

, After you’ve removed the brownies from the pan, use a butter knife carefully spread the frosting over the top of the brownies. Next, take a sharp knife and cut the brownies into squares as large or small as you’d like.You can cut the brownies into squares first and then frost them. That allows you to leave some brownies unfrosted if you prefer.
To make the brownies more festive, you can sprinkle colored sugar or sprinkles over the top of the frosting.

Cut a large sheet of parchment paper and place it in the greased pan. You may need to cut slits in the corners so the paper fits snugly. Set the pan aside while you make the matcha blondies.If you don't want to use cooking spray, you can spread butter inside the pan and sprinkle flour over it. Shake the pan so the flour lightly coats the pan and dump out the excess flour.;
, Get out a large microwave-safe bowl and put 1 cup (230 g) of unsalted butter in it. Microwave the butter for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until it melts. Add 8 ounces (226 g) of the finely chopped white chocolate to the bowl and shake it a little so the chocolate sinks under the melted butter. Let the mixture sit for 1 minute.Ensure that the white chocolate lists cocoa butter as one of its first ingredients.

, Whisk the butter and white chocolate slowly until the white chocolate melts. Sift 1/3 cup (85 g) of matcha tea powder over the mixture and whisk it until the ingredients are smooth.If you don't have a sifter, just whisk the matcha in a small bowl for about 30 seconds before you sprinkle it over the melted butter and white chocolate.

, Get out another large mixing bowl and quickly whisk together 1 cup (200 g) of packed light brown sugar, 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 4 large eggs. Whisk for about 30 seconds.The mixture should be completely blended. It will look light and foamy.

, Transfer the melted butter, chocolate and matcha mixture into the large mixing bowl and whisk it all together. Slowly sprinkle 1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour over the batter. Use a spatula to gently fold the flour into the batter until you can't see the flour.To fold, use your wrist to make a twisting motion so the flour is carefully mixed into the batter. This will keep the volume in the batter.

, Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread the top so it's smooth. Bake the matcha blondies for 35 minutes. Test to see if they're cooked by inserting a toothpick or skewer into the blondies. If the blondies are done, the toothpick will come out clean.

Cut a large piece of parchment paper and place it in the greased pan. You could also use a cast-iron skillet. You won't need to use parchment paper or baking spray, if you use the skillet. Just butter it generously.Cut slits in the corners of the parchment paper to help it fit snugly into the pan.

, Get out a large mixing bowl. Place 1/2 cup (115 g) of softened unsalted butter or softened virgin coconut oil in the bowl. Add 1/3 cup (100 ml) of date or maple syrup. Use a hand or stand mixer to beat the mixture until it's thick and combined.If you don't have date or maple syrup, you can use 2/3 of a cup (133 g) of brown sugar.

, Crack 2 medium eggs into the sweetened butter mixture and add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Turn the mixer on low and beat the batter until the eggs are completely combined and fluffy. This should take about 3 minutes.Avoid turning the mixer on to high speed or the eggs could fly out of the bowl.

, In a separate mixing bowl, measure out and place all of your dry ingredients. Whisk the dry ingredients for about 30 seconds so the baking powder is evenly distributed. This will help the blondies rise properly. You'll need to whisk together:2 cups (140 g) of fine almond meal
1 teaspoon of baking powder
1/8 teaspoon of fine salt
1 ½ teaspoons of organic matcha green tea powder

, Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture in the large mixing bowl. Stir the ingredients well so the dry ingredients are incorporated.

",How to Make Nutella Brownies," Ensure that your oven will be at the right temperature when you’re ready to bake by preheating it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).Next, check that the oven rack is the middle position so the brownies will bake evenly.Make sure that you know how your oven indicates that it’s reached the preheated temperature. In most cases, there will be a beep or a light will flash to let you know that it’s reached the proper temperature.;
, Find a 8-inch by 8-inch (approximately 20-cm by 20-cm) baking pan to bake your brownies in, and line the bottom with a sheet of parchment paper. Allow the paper to hang over two sides of the pan. That will make it easier to get the brownies out of the pan when they’re done baking.You can use a 9-inch by 9-inch (23-cm by 23-cm) pan for the brownies, but don’t go any larger than that. You’ll likely wind up with brownies that are thin and overcooked.
If you don’t have parchment paper, you can line the pan with foil instead.

, While the parchment paper will cover the bottom of the pan, you want to make sure that the brownies don’t stick to the sides. Use some softened butter to grease the sides of the pan that aren’t covered by the paper.You can use non-stick cooking spray instead of butter if you prefer.
If you don’t have parchment paper or foil on hand, you can also butter the entire baking pan, including the bottom and sides, to keep the brownies from sticking.

, Place 1 cup (170 grams) semisweet chocolate chips, 1 ½ sticks (170 grams) unsalted butter that’s been cut into pieces, and 4 ounces (113 grams) chopped unsweetened chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the bowl at 20% power for 1 minute, and then remove the bowl to stir the ingredients. Repeat the process at 30 second intervals until the mixture is completely melted and smooth.Don’t try to melt the chocolate chips, butter, and chopped chocolate all at once. The mixture can easily scorch in the microwave. Make sure to work in intervals, testing at each break to see if the ingredients are fully melted.

, Once the chocolate and butter are completely melted, mix in ½ cup (150 grams) Nutella. Make sure to stir well to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined and the mixture is smooth.You don’t necessarily have to use Nutella brand hazelnut spread. Any hazelnut cocoa spread will work for the brownies.

, In a separate bowl, use an electric mixer to combine 3 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk and 1 ¼ cups (245 grams) granulated sugar at medium-high speed. Mix the ingredients together for approximately 3 minutes or until they become thick and fluffy., Add 1 teaspoon (approximately 5 mL) vanilla extract to the egg and sugar mixture, and mix well. Next, use a spatula to gently fold the nutella and chocolate mixture in with the eggs, sugar, and vanilla.Make sure that the nutella and chocolate mixture is completely cooled before you fold it in. If it’s still hot, it may start to cook the eggs.

, Finish off the batter by adding ¾ cup (96 grams) all-purpose flour, ¼ cup (25 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder, and ¼ teaspoon (approximately 5 g) fine sea salt to the nutella mixture. Use your spatula to fold the dry ingredients in until just combined in a thick batter.The batter doesn’t have to be entirely smooth. It’s okay if there are a few lumps.
Consider mixing in 1 cup (125 g) of toasted and chopped hazelnuts or 1 tablespoon (approximately 15 mL) of hazelnut liqueur to the batter if you want to deepen the hazelnut flavor of the brownies.

, Once of all the ingredients are combined, use the spatula to transfer the batter into your prepared pan. It will be extremely thick and sticky, so work slowly to ensure that it’s evenly spread., Place the pan of brownies in the preheated oven, and let them bake for approximately 35 to 40 minutes. You’ll know that the brownies are done when you stick a tester into the center of the pan and it comes out with only a few moist crumbs. Any thin skewer can work as tester, but a toothpick is usually the easiest tool to use.The edges of the brownies should be set when they’re done, though the center will remain slightly moist.
It’s best to under bake your brownies rather than overbake them. Take them out of the oven if you’re not entirely sure whether they’re done or you may risk burning them.
If you don't have any toothpicks or other thin skewers at home, you can stick the tines of a fork into the center of the brownies instead.

, You’ll probably want to cut into your brownies right away, but it’s important to allow them to cool first. Leave them in the pan for approximately an hour before cutting them. Let them cool for another hour on a wire rack before serving.Allowing the brownies to set for a couple of hours not only means a cleaner cut when you slice them, but it gives the flavors time to deepen too.

Heat the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it’s completely melted. Add the chocolate pieces. Continue stirring, and keep heating the mixture until the chocolate is melted and the ingredients are fully incorporated.When the butter and chocolate are melted, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside to cool.;
, In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until the three ingredients are combined, and there are no lumps in the powder.

Don’t add the sugar or espresso powder, as these will be mixed in with the wet ingredients.

, Crack the eggs one at a time into a separate large mixing bowl. Add the sugar, espresso powder, liqueur, and vanilla. With a hand mixer, beat the ingredients on medium speed until they're fully combined.

If you can't find espresso powder, use ½ cup (117 g) of instant coffee instead., Pour the cooled chocolate and butter mixture into the bowl with the wet ingredients. Mix on medium speed until incorporated. Pour in the flour mixture and beat again until you have a smooth and lump-free batter.


Stop as soon as the batter is smooth. Overmixing can develop the gluten in the flour, and this will make the brownies dense.

, Line a baking sheet that’s 13-by-9 inches (33-by-23 cm) with parchment paper. Cover the parchment paper with a thin layer of butter, cooking spray, or vegetable shortening. Pour the batter into the pan, and use a spoon to spread it out evenly., Preheat an oven to 350 F (177 C). When the oven reaches temperature, put in the brownies and bake them for 25 to 30 minutes. The brownies are done when the top sets and is no longer liquid. For chewier brownies, bake them for 35 to 40 minutes.Set the brownies aside to cool for 10 minutes in the baking dish.

, Turn the brownies out onto a wire cooling rack. Set them aside to cool to room temperature, about an hour. Cut the brownies into 1.5-inch (3.8-cm) squares. Transfer the individual brownie pieces to serving plates and garnish with chocolate-covered coffee beans if you like.For larger brownies, cut each one into a 2-inch (5-cm) square. That way, you'll end up with about 30 brownies.

, Take two cooled brownie squares and use your hand to crumble them into smaller bite-sized pieces. Transfer the brownie pieces to a bowl or dessert serving dish.If you cut your brownie into small squares, use between two and four brownie squares per affogato.
Traditionally, affogato is a dessert beverage made by drowning a scoop of ice cream in hot coffee.

, Scoop the vanilla ice cream onto the crumbled brownie pieces. You can also use gelato or frozen yogurt if you prefer. Then, pour the hot and freshly brewed shot of espresso over top of the ice cream.

To make an adults-only affogato, combine the espresso with a shot of coffee liqueur before pouring it over the ice cream.To make the espresso, you can use a commercial espresso machine, a stovetop espresso pot, or you can brew a small cup of very strong coffee.

, Once you’ve poured the espresso, top the ice cream and brownie with whipped cream. Sprinkle the chocolate shavings and chocolate-covered coffee beans on top of the whipped cream and serve the dessert with a spoon.For an extra-decadent dessert, drizzle some warm chocolate or fudge sauce over the whipped cream before garnishing it with the chocolate pieces and coffee beans., There are lots of things you can add to brownie batter to customize the flavor, add crunch, or change the brownie completely. Fold in up to a cup of your favorite ingredients right before baking. A few of the most popular brownie additions include:Chopped nut, such as walnuts, peanuts, or pecans
Chocolate chips
Crushed peppermint candies
Crushed cookie pieces
Mini marshmallows

, Brownies and frosting go together like peanut butter and jelly. Many brownies often come with a chocolate topping, but you can experiment with a variety of different frostings for your dessert, including:

Cream cheese icing
Orange frosting
Peppermint frosting
Caramel sauce
Marshmallow frosting

, Once you have a frosting for your brownies, you can get creative and put the frosting in between the brownies instead of on top! Frost the top of one brownie with your favorite icing, and then place a second brownie piece on top for a brownie sandwich.

Instead of frosting, you can also stuff a brownie sandwich with other toppings, such as peanut butter, jam, chocolate-hazelnut spread, marshmallow spread, or even ice cream.

, Brownies and ice cream are another classic combination, and you can use a freshly made brownie as the base for an ice cream cake. After baking and cooling the brownie, turn the dessert into a cake with this method:Spread 1½ cups (340 g) of chocolate or vanilla frosting over the uncut brownie
Freeze the frosted brownie for 30 minutes
Spread 6 cups (516 g) of your favorite ice cream evenly over the frosted brownie
Cover the cake
Freeze the cake for three hours
Garnish the cake with whipped cream and sprinkles before serving

, Brownies on a stick are a tasty and fun treat that’s perfect for birthdays, parties, and other celebrations. Bake and cool a batch of brownies, and transfer the cooled brownie to the freezer for 30 minutes. Remove the chilled brownie from the freezer and cut it into 12 to 15 squares. Insert a clean popsicle stick into the side of each brownie and freeze for another 30 minutes.

When the brownies are chilled, cover them with melted chocolate and sprinkles. Allow the chocolate to dry before serving."

Garnish the brownie before serving it, if desired.",How to Make Hot Chocolate Brownies2," Pour the hot chocolate mix and the flour into a 16-ounce (475-milliliter) mug. Stir the two together with a fork or mini whisk. You are using a large mug because the brownie needs room to rise as it cooks.


This recipe makes enough to serve 1 to 2 people. You can eat the brownie straight from the mug. If you'd rather serve it on a plate, lightly grease the inside of the mug first.

, Melt the butter ahead of time in the microwave or in a little saucepan over the stove. If you don't have any butter, you can use oil instead., Hot chocolate mix is already very sweet, but you can give your brownies extra flavor with ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract. Peppermint extract would also taste delightful. Be sure to stir it in well!, What's hot chocolate without marshmallows? The microwave will help melt marshmallows. If you don't have any marshmallows, or if you don't like them, you can skip this step.

, Set your microwave to HIGH, then cook the brownie for 60 to 90 seconds. The brownie will rise as it cooks, but then it will deflate slightly once you stop the microwave. Do not overcook the brownie, however; you want it to be gooey in the center.Place a paper towel or paper plate under the mug to catch any drips in case the brownie overflows.

, If you did not add any marshmallows, consider garnishing your brownie with other popular hot chocolate toppings. A swirl of whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed candy cane would taste delicious!


If you greased the inside of the mug, turn the brownie out onto a plate first, then garnish it.

Preheat your oven to 300ºF (150ºC).,

Pour batter into your pan(s) and place in the oven.,
Top as desired.",How to Bake a Pound Cake1," In your pan or pans (this recipe is quite large -- but pound cakes are perfect for a double-layer masterpiece), line them with cooking spray or butter; this prevents sticking. You could also sprinkle with flour (on top of the butter) or line with parchment paper.;
, Doing this all beforehand will make the baking process go much more smoothly. It also creates less of a mess!

, Make sure that each one is good and does not have blood in the yolks. Get out pieces of shell if necessary.

, Work or smash it with a wooden spoon until soft and of a creamy consistency -- hence the term. This step is very important; if you skip it, you may not get the consistency your batter needs to be. Gradually add sugar and continue to mix until thick and creamy.


This will be easiest if your butter isn't straight out of the fridge. Don't heat it up -- but do give it a few minutes to start nearing room temperature.

, If you don't like the taste of brandy, substitute it for some vanilla or alternate flavoring.


Mace is not pepper spray -- though that would make for an interesting pound cake. On the contrary, it comes from the shell of nutmeg; if you don't have it, nutmeg can substitute (but mace has a more intense flavor).
Add in the flour slowly. All at once and you'll be climbing (err, mixing your way to) an uphill battle. Add it in bit by bit.

, However, this is an estimate -- if you sense you're about to overbeat the mixture, stop. This is a fine line and if passed, your cake may not rise adequately.


If you're using an electric mixer, use the slow setting -- you want the air to circulate throughout the batter.

, Cook for 75 minutes, checking periodically. Some ovens cook unevenly or quickly -- if this describes yours, keep an eye on it.


If to be used for fancy ornamented cakes, bake 30 to 35 minutes in a dripping-pan.
Insert a skewer or toothpick to see if it's finished. If it comes out dry, it is. Lay it upside-down on a wire rack for it to cool and come out easily.

, Though it's delicious now, it's also great with a light dusting of powdered sugar and/or topped with strawberries or raspberry syrup. Anything slightly sweet will do the job nicely.


Another great way to eat pound cake is with your morning coffee or eaten with ice cream and chocolate syrup for a delicious desert.

Don't overbeat it! Once the batter looks finished, stop. You don't want it to lose any of its buoyancy.

, Or, of course, until it's finished. Insert a toothpick to the middle to see if it is -- if it comes out clean, you're clear for take off. Take it out of the oven and let it cool in the pan for 15 minutes or so.

A kitchen machine, such as a food processor, will get better results than using a hand mixer.

Best results will occur when mixing the flour and the baking agent in a separate bowl.

,,,,,, Should the mix be too sticky, make a roll of the mix in a coated paper (baking paper) and bake it on the paper in an oven pan. You will obtain a cake in the shape of a German loaf of bread.

,, This step is completely optional, but will add an extra kick to the flavour.


To make a rum-flavoured icing, combine 100 g powdered sugar with 2 tbsp. rum. Spread onto the cake. If the icing is too liquid, then add a spoonful of powdered sugar to obtain a higher viscosity. A flavourless icing can be made by using vodka instead; after the mixture hardens (15 minutes), the alcohol will be gone, and the resulting icing will be a thick cream-white coating, providing a good surface for an additional layer of chocolate, if desired.
For a chocolate coating, melt about 125 g of chocolate and spread onto the cake.
For a fat-free version with the taste of chocolate, use the flavor-free product and add a heaping tablespoon of cocoa powder. It will look as if covered in chocolate, but with less calories.

Let the dough rise again.,
Bake the bread.",How to Make Sourdough Bread," A ""starter"" is a slurry of flour and water, and it provides the vehicle in which your yeast will propagate. You need a high concentration of yeast to leaven your bread, so you have to get a colony going before you can start baking. Any glass or plastic container with a lid will work for a sourdough starter.









Canning jars are excellent, as are empty pickle or jam jars.
Be sure the jar is clean, so the started doesn't get contaminated.;
, Mix equal parts flour and water in a separate bowl (the amounts aren't important, as long as you mix enough to fill your jar most of the way). Stir until thoroughly blended. Pour the mixture into your starter jar, leaving just a little room for air.









Any type of flour will do, but remember that you need a good amount of gluten for your bread to rise properly (wheat, barley, and rye contain gluten).

, There will be plenty of yeast in your mixture already, as they are present in the air and in the flour. Yeast like 4 things in order to reproduce: warmth, darkness, water, and starch or sugar. You have now provided all of those things, so your yeast should begin to reproduce rapidly. Leave the jar (with the lid on) alone for 24 hours.









Room temperature is usually warm enough to provide the right conditions for yeast to grow. If your house is on the colder side, place the jar in a warm part of the kitchen.
Cover the yeast jar with a heavy cloth to keep it dark.

, Once a day, pour half of the mixture out and replace it with a fresh batch of a mixture of half water, half flour. Within a week, your starter will develop a bubbly froth and a pronounced sour smell. When this happens, your starter is done, and you are ready to bake.








, If you don't want to use the starter right away, park your jar in the refrigerator. Your yeast will stay alive in the cold, but they will remain in a state of sluggish dormancy. The starter can be left in the refrigerator indefinitely if you feed it once a week following the procedure outlined above.








, To do this, pour the entire starter into a mixing bowl and add equal parts flour and water to it, stirring to combine. The total amount of water you add should not exceed the amount of water called for in your bread recipe. 1 cup (236 ml) is a good amount for a loaf of bread. Cover the bowl with a towel, and let the yeast propagate for several hours. This process is called ""proofing."" The resulting slurry is called a ""sponge.""








, When your sponge is bubbly, you are ready to mix in the rest of your ingredients. Add a pinch or 2 of salt, and then gradually stir in flour until the dough holds together but is still sticky.









Flour varies in absorbency, so using exact measurements isn't nearly as useful as relying on your judgment.
You can mix the dough together easily using nothing but your hands and the mixing bowl.

, The yeast will work at different rates depending on conditions, so be patient. When your dough has doubled in volume, it's ready for the next step.









Dough rises faster when it's in a warm, dry place. If your kitchen is cool, turn on the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, tilt the door open a few inches, and place the bowl inside while the dough rises.
You can let the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight.

, Spread some flour on a clean countertop and place the dough onto it. Punch the dough down and massage it, continuing for about 10 minutes. Add flour when necessary to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands.









The dough should begin to look glossy and smooth. Keep punching the dough until the consistency looks right.
You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment instead of your hands.

, Form the dough into a ball and cover it with a towel. Allow it to sit and rise until doubled in volume. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius).








, When the dough has doubled in volume, place it on a baking sheet, in a loaf pan, or in a heavy pot, and put it in the oven. Let it bake for 45 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). Remove the bread when it's done and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before cutting it.

, If the bread is fresh or thick (1.5-2 inches thick), then it'll need a bit longer baking time (5-6 min).

, It will dramatically change color then. Don't burn it! If in doubt, check after a minute.

",How to Make Slow Cooked Peasant Bread," Place 3 cups (306 g) of all-purpose OR bread flour into a large mixing bowl along with 3/4 teaspoon of yeast. Put 1 1/4 teaspoons of salt in the other side of the bowl so it doesn't touch the yeast. Whisk the dry ingredients together until they're combined.Combining just the yeast and salt could kill the yeast, so it's important to keep them separate.;
, Heat 1 1/2 cups (350 ml) of water so that it's warm to the touch. Pour the water into the mixing bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a wooden spoon to stir the bread dough well. The dough should be tough to stir and it will look shaggy.Avoid using boiling or hot water which could kill the yeast.

, Once the dough is in a shaggy ball, spray the dough with cooking spray. Turn the dough over and spray the bottom side with cooking spray. The whole ball of dough should be covered with the cooking spray to prevent it from sticking to the plastic wrap. Tear off a sheet of plastic wrap and cover the bowl with it.If you don't want to use cooking spray, you can spread a little olive oil over the dough. Just dip a pastry brush in the oil and spread the oil all over the ball of dough.

, Lay a clean kitchen towel over the plastic wrap-covered bowl of dough. Place the bowl in a warm part of your kitchen and let it rest for 6 to 8 hours. This proves the dough and lets the yeast activate so the bread will rise. You dough should start looking bubbly and bigger after 6 hours.If you don't have a warm space in your kitchen, turn on your oven's light and place the bowl in the oven. Close the oven door and leave the light on. This will create a small warm space to prove the dough.

, Use a pastry brush to lightly oil a clean counter top or work space. Scoop the dough onto the counter. Fold the dough over itself so that the dough is folded in half. Place the plastic wrap back over the bowl and let it sit in a warm place for one more hour.This will knock any air bubbles out of the dough before it does its final prove.

, Once the dough is about twice as large as when you began proving it, you can shape the dough. Use your hands to smooth the dough into a round ball. The dough doesn't have to be completely smooth or circular since you're making a rustic peasant bread.Try to shape the bread as quickly as possible so you don't overwork the dough.

, Although most peasant breads are free-formed and aren't placed in a pan, you can bake the bread in a pan if you want a sandwich-loaf style. Place the bread dough into a loaf pan and set the loaf pan directly into the slow cooker.You won't need to place parchment paper into the slow cooker since the loaf pan will contain the dough.

, If you'd like to make a decorative mark on top of the peasant bread, use kitchen shears or a sharp knife to make slashes or cuts in the dough. This will also help steam escape from the bread as it bakes.If you choose not to cut slits, the bread may form a crack as it bakes to let the steam get out.

, Tear off a large piece of parchment paper and place it in a slow cooker that's at least 4-quarts in size. Set the shaped loaf of bread directly onto the parchment and press the sides of the parchment paper against the sides of the slow cooker. Put the lid on the slow cooker.You don't want the parchment paper to fall down onto the bread dough. This could cause the bread to get stuck in the paper as it rises and bakes.

, Turn the slow cooker on to HIGH and bake the bread for 1 to 2 1/2 hours. Your bread may take less time or more time depending on how large your slow cooker is. You should check the bread frequently to see whether or not it's finished cooking.Pay close attention to the bread the first time you make it in the slow cooker. Once you know how long it takes, you can just set the cooking time the next time you make bread.

, Insert a thermometer into the center of the bread after it's baked for one hour. If the temperature is between 190 degrees F (87 to 93 C), the bread is finished. The fully baked bread should also have a soft, but not spongy top. If you tap the bottom of the bread, it should be hard and sound hollow. Remove the bread and let it cool completely before you slice it.If the bread needs more time, continue baking and checking the bread every 30 minutes.

, Since the bread will not brown much in the slow cooker, you can broil it to give it a darker crust. Just remove the loaf from the slow cooker and set it on a rack below your broiler. Broil the top of the loaf for 3 to 5 minutes.The bread will brown quickly, so monitor the bread as it broils.

Add water to the dry ingredients.,
Add the oil.,

Knead the dough.,
Let the dough rise before baking.,
Allow to cool before enjoying.",How to Make Spelt Bread1," In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, yeast, and sugar. Then add the water and stir the ingredients to barely combine everything.


It’s important to be precise about the amount of water when you're working with spelt flour. Adding too much water will make the dough sticky and weak, while too little will make the dough dry and dense.You can replace the sugar with an equal amount of honey if you prefer.;
, When the flour and water just come together but don’t quite make a proper dough, add the oil. Stir in the oil with a dough whisk or wooden spoon. When the ingredients are mostly combined, knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together to make a smooth but wet dough.The entire mixing process, starting when you add the water, should take about four minutes. Any less and the protein won’t develop properly, but any more and the proteins will start to break down.The consistency of spelt dough isn't the same as with regular flour. Don’t be surprised if the dough has a stickier and pastier consistency than what you're used to., Cover the mixing bowl with a damp towel or a piece of plastic wrap. This will prevent the dough from drying out as it rises. Place the dough in a warm place away from drafts. Let it rise for about an hour, or until it doubles in size.


A good place for rising bread is in an oven that’s turned off, but with the oven light on.

, When the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a floured surface. Knead it with floured hands for about two minutes. Shape the dough into a loaf or a flattened ball and transfer it to a greased baking sheet or loaf pan.


For a heartier bread, you can knead in nuts and seeds at this point. You can add up to 1 cup (about 140 g) of nuts or seeds, such as walnuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and pine nuts., Preheat your oven to 425 F (218 C). Cover the dough again with the damp cloth or plastic and set it aside to rise for another 25 minutes.When the dough is ready, bake it for 35 to 40 minutes, until the crust is a light golden brown.
Before baking, you can brush the top of the dough with oil and sprinkle it with more nuts., When the bread is ready, remove it from the oven and transfer it to a wire cooling rack. Let it cool to room temperature or a little above before slicing and serving.


To keep leftovers freshest for a couple days, place the loaf in a paper bag and store it somewhere dry."

Fit another saucepan or glass bowl on top of the original saucepan, making sure the water doesn’t touch the bottom of the bowl or pan. Pour out some water if it’s touching.

Place the butter and 2 ounces (57 g) of chocolate in the top of the double boiler and heat it over medium heat. Whisk regularly and vigorously until the chocolate and butter are melted and fully combined.
When the ganache is melted, remove it from the heat and set it aside.

, In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt, cocoa powder, and 2.5 ounces (71 g) of the chopped chocolate. Use a whisk or wooden spoon to mix and combine the ingredients.You can use any type of chocolate for this bread, including milk, dark, or bittersweet.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the lukewarm water, the two lightly beaten eggs, and the honey. Make sure the water isn't above 100 F (38 C), or it will kill the yeast.

Instead of honey, you can also use sugar or agave.

, Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture and combine them with a dough whisk or wooden spoon. When the ingredients start coming together, spoon in the ganache and mix until everything is incorporated.

If necessary, use your hands to knead the bread a little in the bowl to incorporate all the flour.

, Soak a clean tea towel with water and wring it out to remove as much water as possible. Cover the bowl with the damp towel. Leave the dough for about two hours, which is long enough for it to rise and then collapse again.

After two hours, you can use the dough immediately or transfer it to the fridge for up to five days before using it. The dough will be easier to work with if you chill it first.If you do chill the dough first, allow it to warm up for about an hour and a half before making the bread.

, Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out until it’s about a half inch (1.2 cm) thick. Then, sprinkle the prunes and the remaining 2 ounces (57 g) of chocolate evenly over the dough.

Roll the dough up into a cylinder and knead it a few times to incorporate the filling into the dough.

, Grease the bottom and sides of a loaf pan with a generous layer of butter, and then sprinkle a thin layer of sugar over the butter. This will add some extra sweetness and prevent the dough from sticking. Transfer the dough to the loaf pan and set it aside to rise for an hour and a half.

This recipe makes about a 1.5-pound (454 g) loaf, so use a loaf pan that’s around 8.5 by 4.5 inches (21.6 by 11.4 cm).In the last 10 minutes of the rising time, preheat your oven to 350 F (177 C).

, In a small bowl, whisk together the last egg and the water to make an egg wash. Use a pastry brush to brush the top of the dough with the wash. Sprinkle the top with sugar.

Bake the bread for 50 minutes to an hour. The loaf is ready when the dough becomes firm.

, Remove the bread from the oven and turn it out onto a wire cooling rack. Allow it to cool until it’s safe to touch and eat, then serve warm with your favorite toppings, such as butter, jam, or nut butters.

To reheat the bread, cut off a slice and toast it before serving.

Gather your supplies and ingredients.,
Mix together your flour and water.,
Feed the starter again the next day.,
Repeat for about five days.,
Maintain the starter.,
Use your starter.",How to Make Spelt Bread3," It’s possible to make bread without buying yeast from the store. To do this, you have to make your own sourdough starter, which is a flour and water mixture that naturally attracts wild yeast. To make your own wild yeast sourdough starter, you'll need:About five days
Plastic or glass mixing bowl
Equal parts non-chlorinated water and spelt flour (you can also use all-purpose, whole wheat, rye, or other wheat-based flours)
Mixing spoon
Lid or plastic wrap

, Measure out 4 ounces each of flour and water. Combine them in the mixing bowl and stir vigorously to combine the two into a sticky batter or dough. Cover with the plastic wrap or the lid. Leave the plastic loose or the lid slightly off on one side to allow air flow.

Place the mixture somewhere to sit for 24 hours. Make sure the temperature stays consistent, and between 70 and 75 F (21 to 24 C).
Don’t use a metal bowl or chlorinated water, because they can both kill the yeast you're trying to grow.If you don’t have a kitchen scale, 4 ounces of flour is equivalent to ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons, and 4 ounces of water is equivalent to ½ cup.

, Add another 4 ounces of flour and water to your starter and give it another vigorous stir. Replace the plastic wrap or lid in the same manner as before, and return the bowl to its warm place for another 24 hours.

A good place for the bowl is on top of the fridge, where it’s slightly warmer and the temperature stays the same.

, By day three, your starter should have started to form a few bubbles, which are produced when the yeast converts the sugar in the flour to alcohol and gas. As the days go on, the starter will grow more and more bubbles, will grow in volume, and will take on a yeasty and slightly sour smell.Depending on the conditions in your home, the starter may take a few days longer before it’s ready to use.
In general, the starter is ready when it doubles in size since the last feeding. It will also be extremely bubbly, slightly frothy, and smell sour, yeasty, and slightly vinegary.

, To keep the starter going and ready to use, continue with the same process. Every day, remove half the starter from the bowl and feed it as usual. You can either use the portion you removed to make bread, or discard it.If you continue maintaining your starter in this way, you can keep it alive for years.

, Next time you make a loaf of bread, you can use the sourdough starter instead of packaged yeast to make the bread rise. To use the starter in a bread recipe, you can either:

Follow a recipe designed to use a sourdough starter.
Convert a regular recipe to sourdough. To do this, replace each tablespoon of yeast (one package) with a cup of sourdough starter."

Stir the mixture until the sugar and salt are dissolved, then sprinkle the yeast over the liquid. Stir gently, then allow the mixture to sit for about 10 minutes, or until the yeast starts to foam and produce little bubbles.






;
, Sprinkle the flour evenly over the mixture, rather than dumping it all in one place, as it will be easier to mix this way.








, Using the dough attachment on the mixer set to the lowest speed, or a wooden spoon and your own elbow grease, mix the dough until it is completely combined.








, If you're using a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, change the speed to medium and let it work the dough until you can see clearly that it pulls away from the bowl. Otherwise, knead the dough by hand for about 10 minutes, until it's no longer sticky and forms a smooth, elastic ball.









If the mixture is still gooey and does not pull away from the bowl, add a tablespoon of flour at time and keep stirring until the consistency is right.

, Grease a large bowl with the oil and put the dough in it. Cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit somewhere warm for an hour or two, until the dough has doubled in size.








, Grease a work surface with some oil and place the dough on it. Grease your hands as well. Set the dough on the work surface and roll it with your hands to form a thick rope Roll the dough into a think rope about the length of your forearm (the length from the tip of your middle finger to your elbow). Divide it into 8 more or less equal size pieces.








, To make the classic pretzel shape, arrange a length of dough in a u-shape. Cross the ends and press them into the two sides of the U. You can also break up the dough into smaller pieces and create mini pretzels, spears, or other fun shapes.









Make sure the ends are securely pressed or they will loosen later when you drop them in the boiling water.
If you're making hard pretzels, break the dough into about 24 pieces and create smaller shapes, like rods or twists.

, If you're making soft pretzels, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. For hard pretzels, you need only heat it to 350 degrees.

Store in airtight containers.",How to Make Panko Bread Crumbs," Panko bread crumbs are used for texture and absorbency, not flavor. A mild-flavored white bread is a common choice for this reason, but you can use anything on hand. The loaf should be a day or two old, dry enough to crumble apart but not completely stale.Cut off the crust from all sides.


""White panko,"" made from crustless bread, is the most popular kind. You can leave the crusts on to make ""tan panko"" instead.
If the bread is still fresh, cut off the crust and leave it to dry on the counter for a day.;
, The defining difference between panko and ordinary bread crumbs is panko's large, flaky texture. There are three ways to achieve this with home implements:


Push strips of bread through the shredding disc attachment on a food processor.Cube the bread and pulse in a blender once or twice, or until coarse. This is a less consistent method.
Grate by hand using the largest holes on your grater., Keep them in thin layers so they dry evenly without burning.

, Preheat your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150ºC). Once the oven is warmed up, put the baking sheets inside and set a timer for four minutes., Shake or stir the bread crumbs to move them around the pan.Panko crumbs are dry but never browned, so it's important to heat them as evenly as possible.

, Bake for another three or four minutes, then take them out of the oven. It's better to take them out too early than too late, although they are still usable if they brown a little.


If the breadcrumbs still feel soft after four or five minutes, turn off the oven and let them dry at a lower temperature as the oven cools.

, Allow them to cool for at least an hour. They will continue to dry out as they cool.If they're still soft after they reach room temperature, return them to the oven.

, Once completely dry, store the breadcrumbs in a dry, airtight container. They should last at least a week at room temperature, or six months in the freezer.The bread crumbs often last longer as long as they are kept dry, since bacteria and mold require moisture. As long as they don't smell or look different, they should be fine to eat. If they get soft, reheat them in the oven.

Heat the milk and butter over medium heat until the temperature reaches 120 to 130 degrees F (48 to 54 C).The butter won't melt completely. You're just warming the milk and butter which will help the yeast dissolve and activate.;
, Put 2 tablespoons of packed brown sugar and 1 envelope (2 1/4 teaspoons) of instant yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the warmed milk and butter mixture and stir to dissolve the brown sugar and yeast.If you don't have a stand mixer, place your ingredients in a large mixing bowl and use a hand mixer or large wooden spoon to combine them.

, Add 2 cups of the all-purpose flour and 2 teaspoons of salt to the mixing bowl. Beat the dough for 3 minutes so that the flour is completely incorporated. If the dough looks very sticky and continues to cling to the sides of the bowl, slowly add more flour to make the dough soft. It should start to pull away from the sides of the mixing bowl.Keep track of how much flour you add. Avoid adding more than 1 1/2 cups in total.
Add the additional flour in very small amounts (about 1/4 of a cup at a time). It's easier to add flour than remove excess flour from your dough.

, Flour a counter top or bread board. Scoop the dough onto the work space and knead the bread until it's smooth and stretchy. This should take about 8 to 10 minutes of kneading. To knead the dough, punch it down in the center, fold it in half and push it forward with the palm of your hand.


Continue the process of folding and pushing the dough. This kneading will activate the gluten in the bread and help your pretzel bread develop a good consistency.

, Grease a large mixing bowl and set your pretzel dough in the bottom. Cover the bowl and put it somewhere warm and draft-free to prove for one to two hours. Let it prove until it's doubled in size.


It's easiest to use a clear bowl. This way, you can keep an eye on how much your dough has risen.
If you can't find a warm spot to prove the dough, try placing it in your unheated oven with the door closed. Turn on the oven light. This should warm the oven enough to prove the dough., Get your oven heating and prepare your baking pan while you boil the pretzel bread. Turn the oven on to 400°F (204°C). To make the boiling solution, put 3 quarts (2.8 liters) of water and 3/4 cup (135 g) of baking soda into a large saucepan or pot over high heat. Bring the solution to a boil.


To prepare your baking pan, simply grease it lightly with shortening or butter.

, Remove your dough from the greased bowl and punch it straight down. Divide the dough into two large pieces and roll each into a smooth ball that is tightly packed. Place the loaves in the boiling solution for 1 minute. Turn them using tongs and boil them for 1 more minute. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove them from the solution.To evenly divide the proved dough, you can cut it in half using a sharp knife or a bench scraper.
Always use caution when handling boiling liquid. Use oven mitts when touching the handles of your pot.

, Set both boiled loaves on your greased baking sheet. Brush the beaten egg over the tops and sides of the loaves using a pastry brush. Take a sharp knife and score a cross in the top of each loaf. Bake the loaves for 15 minutes.You can leave off the egg wash, although your pretzel bread won't be as shiny or glossy after it bakes.

, After 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and bake the loaves for another 10 to 12 minutes. The pretzel bread should look brown. Carefully remove the baking pan from the oven.Take the loaves off of the sheet and let them cool on a wire rack.

Stir the dry ingredients until they're well mixed.If you don't have bread flour, you can use whole wheat flour.;
, Pour 1 cup plus 2 teaspoons (250 ml) of warm water into a small mixing bowl or jug and add 1 tablespoon of honey. Stir the mixture until the honey dissolves in the water and pour it into the bowl of dry ingredients. Use your spoon to stir the ingredients together. You should see a shaggy dough form.If the dough seems too dry to form a rough dough, you can add a few teaspoons of water at a time and stir it in. Rye flour absorbs a lot of water, so it may need a little more.

, Sprinkle a little extra rye flour on your work surface and scoop the shaggy dough onto it. Use the palms of your hands to knead the dough for about 10 minutes. The dough should become smoother (although not as elastic as dough made with white wheat flour).There are many ways to knead dough. For a basic way to knead dough, use one palm to spread the dough away from you. Fold the dough back to the center and turn it about 45 degrees. Use your palm to push the dough away again. Continue pushing, folding, and turning.

, Get out a large bowl and spread a little vegetable oil or cooking spray in it. Set the dough into the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Put the bowl in a warm spot and let it rest for one to two hours. The dough should double in volume.If you use a clear bowl for proving the dough, you can easily see when the dough has doubled in size.

, Once the dough has doubled, sprinkle a little more flour onto the work surface and scoop the dough onto it. Use your fist to punch the dough down, so any air trapped in the dough is knocked out. If you'd like to add caraway seeds to the dough, you can knead 1 teaspoon of the seeds into the dough., Get out a 9 x 5-inch (23 x 13-cm or 900 g) loaf pan. Sprinkle the pan with some rye flour and set it next to your work surface. Use the palms of your hands to shape the dough into an oval loaf. Set the loaf into the loaf tin., Spray some plastic wrap with cooking spray and cover the loaf pan with it. Put the pan in a warm place to prove one more time. Let the dough rest for one to one and a half hours more. The dough should double in volume again.The rye bread dough will develop flavor as the dough rests.

, Turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) once the dough has almost finished proving. Try to preheat the oven during the last 30 minutes of the proving time. If you wait until the dough has finished proving before you turn the oven on, your dough may over prove and collapse when it bakes., Once the dough has finished proving, take the plastic wrap off. Sprinkle the top of the loaf with more rye flour. Use a sharp, serrated knife to make a few shallow slashes across the top of the loaf.Slashing the bread will give the air a place to escape as it bakes. If you don't slash the bread, the bread may tear unpredictably as it bakes.

, Put the loaf of bread in the preheated oven. Bake the light rye bread for 30 minutes. The top should turn a dark brown. Remove the pan from the oven and tip it out of the pan. Let the bread cool for at least 20 minutes before you cut it.You can tap the bottom of the bread to test for doneness. If the bread sounds hollow, it's finished cooking.

Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast and 1 tablespoon of white sugar over the water. Set the mixture aside for 5 to 10 minutes. You don't need to stir it yet.The yeast, water, and sugar will look cloudy and foamy after it's rested.;
, Use a dough hook attachment or strong beaters to stir in 1 tablespoon of softened unsalted butter, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk, and 1 heaping teaspoon of salt. Keep the mixer on low speed and slowly mix in 3 cups (380 g) of bread flour. Keep kneading and mixing the dough for 7 to 10 minutes.The dough will begin to stick to the bottom of the bowl as it forms a sticky ball.

, Melt 4 tablespoons (55 g) of butter in a small bowl and stir in 1 pinch of salt, a handful of finely chopped parsley leaves, and 2 cloves of finely minced garlic. This will be the mixture you dip the bread into.Taste the herbed garlic butter and add more salt, garlic, or parsley according to your liking.

, Scoop the dough out of the mixing bowl and cut it into two portions. Take one portion of dough and cut the dough into round, bite-sized pieces. Dip the pieces in the herbed garlic butter and fill one 5.75x3-inch (14.6x7.6 cm) loaf pan. Repeat this with the other portion of dough and fill another small loaf pan.If you have leftover herbed garlic butter, set it aside to brush over the baked bread.

, Cover each of the pans of dough with plastic wrap and put them in a warm place. Let them rise until they've doubled in volume. This should take about an hour. and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C).If you want to prove the dough in the oven with the oven light on, just remove them after 45 minutes so you can preheat the oven.

, Remove the plastic wrap from the loaves and place the loaves in the preheated oven. Bake the bread for 30 minutes. The pull apart bread should turn a dark golden brown once it's finished baking. Brush the leftover herbed garlic butter over the bread before you serve it.Be careful when tipping the bread out of the loaf tins, if you've just brushed hot butter over the loaves.

Bake the dark rye bread.",How to Make Rye Bread2," Measure out 5 cups (500 g) of rye flour and remove a few tablespoons of the flour. Set this small amount aside for sprinkling over your work surface. Dump the remaining rye flour into a large mixing bowl. Add 1/2 tablespoon (10 g) of salt to one side of the bowl and put 3 1/2 teaspoons (10 g) of instant yeast in the other side of the bowl. Stir to combine the dry ingredients.You want to avoid placing the salt right on the yeast, or the salt could kill the yeast.

, Measure 1 1/2 cups (350 ml) of cool water and pour about 1 cup (240 ml) of it into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Add 4 teaspoons of molasses. Use your fingers or a rubber spatula to stir the mixture.If you don't have molasses, you could use black treacle.

, You should have about 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water set aside. Add a few tablespoons to the dough bowl at a time and mix the dough well in between additions. The dough should come away from the sides of the bowl once you've added enough of the water.You might not need to add all of the water to the dough. Avoid adding so much water that the dough becomes sticky and soggy.

, Spread a little olive oil on your work surface and scoop the shaggy dough onto it. Use the palms of your hands to knead the dough for about 10 minutes. The dough should become smoother (although not as elastic as dough made with white wheat flour).There are many ways to knead dough. For a basic way to knead dough, use one palm to spread the dough away from you. Fold the dough back to the center and turn it about 45 degrees. Use your palm to push the dough away again. Continue pushing, folding, and turning.

, Use your hands to shape the dough into a smooth ball. You can turn and tuck the dough until you've got a smooth ball with a small seam underneath.Since you won't bake this bread in a pan, it's important to get the dough into a tight free form ball.

, Sprinkle the inside of a large, round bowl with rye flour and set the ball of dough into it. If the ball has a seam, you should place that on the bottom of the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and set the dough in a warm place. Prove the dough for at least eight hours or overnight.Rye flour takes much longer to prove than wheat flour, but the dough should double in volume.

, About 30 minutes before your dough has finished proving, turn on the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C). Set a roasting pan in the bottom of the oven while the oven preheats. Once it gets hot, carefully pour enough boiling water to fill the pan half full.The roasting pan full of water will make steam in the oven. This gives your rye bread a better crust than if you baked it in a dry oven.

, Lay a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat on a baking sheet. Carefully turn the risen dough out of the bowl and onto the baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to make three deep slashes on top of the dough.You can do straight slashes or crosshatches. The slashes help steam escape from the dough as it bakes.

, Put the bread in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Since you won't be able to tell whether the bread is finished baking based on the color, you'll need to take it out of the oven. Turn the bread over and tap the bottom. Once the bread is cooked, it will sound hollow. If it doesn't, return it to the oven for a few more minutes.Cool the bread completely before you slice it.

Slice the bread and preheat the oven.,
Combine the cheese and garlic.,
Stuff the bread.,
Pour butter over the bread and wrap it.,
Bake the pull apart garlic bread.",How to Make Pull Apart Garlic Bread2," Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (175 C). Get out one 16 to 20-ounce (500 to 550 g) round loaf of artisan bread and use a bread knife to carefully slice the bread into rows that are about 1-inch (2.5 cm) wide. Turn the bread 90 degrees and cut rows across the bread. Avoid cutting all the way down and through the bread.Cutting rows that cross will make a grid-like pattern across the bread. This will make it easy to pull apart after it's baked.

, Place 1 1/2 to 2 cups (6 to 8 ounces or 170 to 226 g) of shredded cheese (like Monterey Jack, mozzarella, provolone, cheddar, or a mix) into a small bowl and stir in 2 cloves of finely minced garlic. You should also melt 1/4 cup (25 g) of unsalted butter and set it aside.If you'd like, you can also cook and crumble up bacon or sausage. Stir this into the cheese and garlic.

, Gently move the rows of bread apart and fill the gaps with the cheese and garlic. To make things easier, start by filling all of the rows extending from you. Then turn the bread 90 degrees and fill in all of the rows that now extend from you.You might want to ask someone to help you hold the rows of bread apart as you stuff the bread.

, Place the stuffed bread on a large sheet of aluminum foil. Pour the melted butter over the top of the stuffed bread and wrap the foil up and over the bread. Seal the aluminum foil shut so the loaf is tightly wrapped.Covering the bread with foil will help the cheese melt and will prevent the bread from drying out as it bakes.

, Put the bread in the preheated oven and bake it for 20 minutes. Carefully remove it from the oven and open the top of the foil. Return the bread to the oven for 10 more minutes. This will make the top of the bread crisp up and ensure that the cheese is bubbly. Remove the bread from the oven and serve it once it's cool enough to tear into.Consider sprinkling minced parsley or chives over the top for a bright garnish.

Set your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Next, grease a 8- or 9-inch (20- or 23-cm) cake or pie pan and set aside.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. Most models will beep and/or flash an indicator light to alert you that it’s reached the desired temperature.
You can use a springform for the cake if you’re worried about the sides sticking to the pan after baking.
Use nonstick cooking spray, butter, or margarine to grease the pan.;
, In a large bowl, cream together 10 tablespoons (142 g) of butter, ⅔ cup (132 g) of brown sugar, and ⅓ cup (66 g) of white sugar with an electric mixer on medium. Blend the mixture for 2 minutes or until the butter and sugars are fully combined.You can also use a stand mixer to make the cookie cake batter.
If you don’t have any type of electric mixer, you can blend the batter by hand with a wooden spoon. It will just take more time.

, Once the butter and sugars are fully blended, add an egg, another egg yolk, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla. Blend together on medium until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated, which should take 1 to 2 minutes., After you’ve combined all of the wet ingredients, you can add in the dry ingredients. Stir 1 ⅔ cups (208 g) of flour, ¾ teaspoon (3.45 g) of baking soda, and ¾ teaspoon (4.3 g) of salt into the batter. Mix on a low speed until the ingredients are just  combined.Be careful not to overmix the batter when you’re adding the dry ingredients. If you mix the flour too much, gluten can develop, which can make the finished cake chewy and tough.

, When you’ve mixed the dry ingredients into the batter, use a wooden spoon to stir in 1 cup (175 g) of chocolate chips minus 2 tablespoons (30 g). Set aside the extra chips for use later.You can use any type of chocolate chips that you prefer, such as milk, semi sweet, dark, or white chocolate chips. You may even want to use a combination of two or more types.
In addition to chocolate chips, you can mix chopped nuts into the cake batter. Walnuts are usually paired with chocolate chips, but you can add chopped pecans or macadamia nuts if you prefer.

, Once you’ve stirred the chocolate chips into the batter, carefully begin to press it into the greased pan. Make sure to create a uniform layer with the batter so the cake will cook evenly when you place it in the oven.It’s often easier to press the batter into the pan if you refrigerate it beforehand. A half hour to an hour can help, but you can even make the batter the night before and bake the cake the next day., When the batter is pressed into the pan, take the 2 tablespoons (30 g) of chocolate chips that you reserved and sprinkle them over the top of the batter. Gently press them into the batter to keep them in place.If you’ve added nuts to the cake, you can also scatter and press some of them into the top of the batter.

, Place the pan in the preheated oven on the center rack. Allow the cake to bake for approximately 22 to 25 minutes or until it turns a golden brown. When you remove it, set the pan on a wire rack and allow it to cool for 10 minutes., Once the cake is cool enough to handle, run a knife along the edges to gently loosen it from the pan. Next, use a large spatula to carefully lift the cake out of the pan and place it on a platter.If you’ve used a springform pan for the cake, you just have to unlock the sides and remove them from the pan to free the cake.

, While the cake is cooling, mix together 4 tablespoons (57 g) of butter, 2 tablespoons (12 g) of cocoa powder, 1 ¼ cup (156 g) of powdered sugar, and ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of vanilla in a medium size bowl. Stir until all of the ingredients are well blended.You don’t necessarily have to make a chocolate frosting for the cookie cake. Use your favorite buttercream frosting recipe for a simple vanilla frosting if you prefer. You can also use canned frosting in your favorite flavor if you’re short on time.

, Once the butter mixture is well blended, begin stirring in 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of milk. You only want to add as much milk as is necessary to make the frosting smooth.Whole milk works best for the frosting, but you can use whatever type you prefer.

, After you’ve finished mixing the frosting, place it in a piping bag that’s fitted with a decorative tip. Carefully pipe the frosting along the outer edge of the cookie cake in whatever pattern you prefer.Make sure that the cake has cooled before you pipe the frosting onto it. The frosting may melt otherwise.
If you don’t have a piping bag, you can place the frosting in a sealed plastic bag and cut the tip off one of the bottom corners. Squeeze the bag so the frosting emerges from the hole just as it would through the tip of a piping bag., To make the cake more festive for the occasion, use the chocolate frosting in the piping bag or a tube of decorating gel to write “Happy Birthday” or a similar message on the cake. If you’re using a piping bag, you may need to switch to a smaller tip when you’re writing.

, If you want a more colorful look for the cake, press some bright sprinkles, colored sugar, or dragees into the frosting. Colorful candies, such as M&M’s, also make ideal decorations for the cake.Shaved chocolate and mini chocolate chips are also fun decorations for the cake.

Preheating the oven is essential when making bread and other baked goods.., Crack the three eggs into a small bowl. Then use a spoon to carefully scoop up the yolks and place them in a separate bowl. Do this carefully, making sure that the yolks stay intact and that you don’t transfer excess egg white into the bowl of egg yolks.Use a spoon that is at least the same size as the egg yolk so that the yolk doesn’t break when scooped up.
Once you have scooped up the yolk, remove excess egg white clinging to the yolk by shaking the spoon very slightly from side to side. The egg white will fall away from the spoon, leaving just the yolk.

, Pour the egg yolks and 3 tablespoons (44.1 ml) of cream cheese into a mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon (14.7 ml) of honey or another sweetener if you wish. Use a whisk to stir the ingredients together until they are combined., Add ¼ teaspoon (1.2 ml) of cream of tartar to the bowl of egg whites. Begin to rapidly whip the mixture together with a fork or whisk. You can also use an electric mixer on a high setting if you want especially fluffy bread., Keep whipping the cream of tartar and egg whites together until the mixture forms stiff peaks, a few minutes or so if whipping by hand and around 1 minute if whipping with an electric mixer., After you thoroughly mix the egg white mixture, pour the egg yolk mixture into the egg white mixture, scraping the bowl if necessary to get all the mixture out., Use a spatula or large spoon to fold the ingredients together, lifting up the mixture from underneath, then folding it over on itself. Fold the ingredients until they are just blended.Folding as opposed to rapidly mixing or churning will keep the dough light and airy as opposed to dense.

, Spray two baking sheets with non-stick cooking spray or grease the sheets with butter. Greasing or spraying the baking sheets will stop the bread from sticking., Use a large spoon to scoop the mixture into 10 equal-sized portions onto the baking sheets. Try to make roughly round portions that are approximately ¾ inch (1.9 cm) thick and 4-5 inches (10-12.7 cm) in diameter., Place the two baking sheets in the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake the bread for about 30 minutes, until the tops are golden brown.Keep an eye on the bread. Some oven times vary, so be sure to pull out the baking sheets when the bread is golden brown on top.

, Once the bread has finished cooking, take it off the baking sheets and place them on a cooling rack. You can also put the bread on a plate or counter if you don’t have a cooling rack, though it may be denser if you don’t use a cooling rack., Serve the bread as soon as it’s cool enough to eat. When the bread is fresh out of the oven, it is crumbly and airy, similar to the consistency of a meringue. You can also eat the bread the next day; it will be chewier and denser, more similar to the consistency of regular bread."

Microwave on high for 20 seconds until the water is warm. Take the flaxseed out of the microwave and stir until it creates a sticky mixture.Flaxseed is a vegan alternative to egg. When combined with water, ground flaxseed becomes sticky and helps bind ingredients together much in the same way that egg does.
Warming the water helps the texture of the flaxseed become stickier.
If you can’t find pre-ground flaxseed, grind whole flaxseed in a spice grinder.

Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully combined.Coconut sugar is a slightly healthier sugar, as it contains less fructose than regular sugar. However, if you don’t have access to coconut sugar you can substitute cane sugar.
Make sure to use corn flour, not cornmeal. Cornmeal is coarser and makes for a different texture.

, In a small bowl, combine the white onion and the coconut milk. Stir to combine, then pour in the flaxseed mixture that you reserved and mix well.Make sure to shake the can of coconut milk before pouring, since coconut milk naturally separates.

, Pour the dry corn flour mixture over the flaxseed mixture, stirring continuously until the ingredients combine into a batter. Then cover the bowl of batter and place it in the fridge for an hour.Chilling the batter helps it become more cohesive and less sticky.

Add the chopped chocolate and the butter, and turn the heat to medium. Stir the butter and chocolate with a whisk until they melt. Do not add the chocolate chips just yet.


You can use bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate, or even a combination of both.The better quality chocolate you use, the better your brownies will turn out.
If you cannot find any unsalted butter, you can use salted butter instead; just remember to reduce the amount of salt later.
You will be mixing your batter in this bowl. Make sure that it is big enough to hold the rest of the ingredients.

, Once the chocolate and butter are melted, mixed together, and smooth, take the bowl off the saucepan and set it aside. Allow it to cool to lukewarm temperature before continuing.If you add the eggs too soon, the hot chocolate mixture will cook them.

, Add the sugar and vanilla extract first. Once they are evenly combined, add the eggs. Stir the mixture well after each egg you add.


If you are using semi-sweet chocolate, use 2 tablespoons less sugar., If you used salted butter, reduce the salt to just ½ teaspoon. Keep whisking until the flour is evenly mixed in and there are no lumps of clumps.

, The chocolate chips will give the brownies that extra, rich, chocolatey goodness. The walnuts are not completely necessary, but they will lend the brownies extra flavor and texture as well,

, Use a rubber spatula to help the batter spread evenly across the pan. If you need to, use the spatula to smooth down the top as well.

, You can check for doneness by poking a toothpick in the center. If it comes out clean, or if it has a few moist crumbs clinging to it, the brownies are ready. Once they brownies have baked, set them aside to cool off; leave them in the baking pan while they cool.

, Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in the cocoa powder and milk.

Stir 2 cups (400 g) of sugar into the melted butter and chocolate mixture.The foil should reach up and over the sides of the pan. This will make it easier to lift out the baked brownies.

, Get out 4 eggs and crack one into the brownie batter. Use a wooden spoon to beat the egg into the batter until it's incorporated. Add the remaining 3 eggs one at a time. Once the eggs are combined, stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.If you want to use a hand mixer, you can beat the eggs in one at a time on low speed.

, Measure 1 1/3 cups (166 g) of all-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda into a small mixing bowl. Use a whisk to combine the flour and baking soda.

",How to Make Double Chocolate Brownies," To ensure that the oven is hot enough for the brownies, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Keep an eye on the oven so you know when it’s finished preheated. Your oven will likely beep or flash an indicator light to alert you.;
, You’ll need a 9 x 13-inch (23 x 33-cm) baking pan for the brownies. Grease it lightly with butter, shortening or a nonstick cooking spray.While you’re going to place parchment paper in the pan as a liner, greasing it first ensures that the paper will stick to it.

, After you’ve greased the pan, cut a piece parchment paper to line the pan. It should be long enough to cover the bottom and two of the sides. Press it down in the pan so it sticks to the greased surface.If you don’t have parchment paper, you can substitute foil. However, you will need to grease the top of the foil so the brownies don’t stick to it.

, Add ¾ cup (75 g) of cocoa powder and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of baking powder to a large bowl. Stir the two together until they’re completely blended.If you’re out of baking powder, combine ¼ teaspoon (.5 g) baking soda with ¼ teaspoon (.5 g) of cream of tartar to add to the batter., When the cocoa powder and baking powder are fully mixed, stir in ⅓ cup (75 g) of melted butter. Blend the mixture until the butter is fully incorporated.For best results, use unsalted butter. However, if you only have salted butter on hand, just omit the added salt later in the recipe.

, Once the butter is incorporated into the batter, add ½ cup (118 ml) of boiling water to the bowl. Stir the mixture until it’s completely blended and smooth., When the boiling water has been mixed in, add in 2 cups (450 g) of sugar, 2 large eggs, and the remaining ⅓ cup (75 g) of melted butter. Stir well until the ingredients are fully incorporated.It’s a good idea to break the eggs in a separate bowl before mixing them into the bowl. That way, if one is bad, you won’t ruin all of the batter.

, Once the sugar, eggs, and butter are blended into the batter, add 1 ⅓ cup (167 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract, and ¼ (1.5 g) teaspoon of salt. Mix well until the ingredients are fully incorporated and the batter is as smooth as possible.If you usually make boxed brownies, this batter may be thicker than you’re used to. Don’t worry -- that’s the proper consistency.

, When you’re finished mixing the batter, fold in ½ cup (65 g) of coarsely chopped nuts and 2 cups (350 g) of semisweet chocolate chunks. Make sure that they’re fully blended throughout the batter.Walnuts and pecans are typically used in brownies, but you can use whatever type of nut that you prefer.
You can substitute other types of chocolate chunks, such as milk chocolate or bittersweet, for the semisweet chunks if you prefer.
If you don’t have chocolate chunks, you can use chocolate chips instead.

, Once the nuts and chocolate chunks are mixed into the batter, transfer it to the prepared pan. Use a spatula to smooth it into place so it’s in an even layer., Place the pan of brownies in the preheated oven, and allow them to bake for 35 to 40 minutes. You’ll know that they’re done when they are set and start to pull away from the sides of the pan.For the best results, bake the brownies on the center rack of the oven.

, Remove the brownies from the oven, and place the pan on a wire rack to cool. It should take approximately 30 minutes for the brownies to cool to room temperature. Cut them into squares, and serve.If you like, you can garnish the brownies with powdered sugar.

Use a piece of parchment paper to line the pan, making sure that two sides of the paper overhang the pan so you can easily lift the brownies out when they’re done.If you prefer, you can grease the baking dish with butter or nonstick cooking spray rather than lining it.

, Add ½ cup (115 g) of chopped, unsalted butter and 1 ⅓ cup (200 g) of chopped dark chocolate to a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat the mixture in the microwave on high in 15 second intervals until the chocolate melts completely.Be sure to stir the chocolate mixture after each heating interval so you don’t overheat the chocolate.
If you prefer, you can melt the chocolate and butter together in a double boiler on the stove top.

, Once the chocolate mixture is melted and smooth, add ½ cup (100 g) of sugar, ½ cup (100 g) of brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium with a handheld electric mixer until it is fully combined.If you prefer, you can use a stand mixer to prepare the brownie batter.
You can also mix the brownie batter by hand, but it will take a little more time and effort.

, When the sugars and vanilla are incorporated, add 3 large eggs to the bowl. Mix them in on medium-low one at a time, making sure that each is fully blended in before adding the next.You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer.

, After the eggs have been completely mixed in, add ⅔ cup (85 g) of all-purpose flour. Blend it in on medium-low until it is fully incorporated and the batter has a thick, smooth consistency.It’s a good idea to sift the flour before you add it to the brownie batter.

, When the brownie batter has reached the proper consistency, add ½ cup of chopped, mini creme eggs to the bowl. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the candy into the batter so the eggs are evenly distributed.You can use large creme eggs for the brownies, but you’ll need to chop them more than you do with the mini version.

, After you’ve folded the creme eggs into the batter, transfer it to the lined baking dish. Use a rubber spatula to smooth the top and ensure that the batter is spread in an even layer across the pan., Once the batter is spread evenly in the pan, place it in the oven. Allow the brownies to bake for 25 minutes or until they are partially set.The brownies shouldn’t be cooked through at this point, so don’t be alarmed if they are still fairly soft on top and jiggly in the center.

, After the brownies have baked for 25 minutes, remove them from the oven. Place 3 large creme eggs that have been cut in half across the top of the pan, gently pressing them down into the brownies. Return the pan to the oven and bake the brownies for 20 to 25 minutes more.Space the mini eggs evenly apart in the brownies and place them with the cream side facing up.
You can use mini creme eggs that are cut in half to press into the brownies. You’ll just need more of them to cover all the away across the top of the pan.
You’ll know the brownies are finished baking when they’re no longer jiggly in the center.

, Once the brownies are finished baking, remove the pan from the oven. Let the brownies cool completely for 30 to 45 minutes before cutting them into squares and serving.It’s important that the brownies are completely cool and set before you try to cut into them, so you may want to chill them in the refrigerator for an hour or two before slicing them.
Store any leftover brownies in an airtight container. They should stay fresh for 3 to 4 days at room temperature.

, You can do this using a handheld mixer, an electric stand mixer, or even a food processor. You can also do it by hand, but it will take longer. Keep mixing the butter and sugar until they are evenly combined.


To make the process go by faster, cut the butter into smaller cubes first.

, If you are using an electric mixer, set the speed to low, and add the eggs in while it is beating. Keep beating until the eggs are evenly mixed in.

, Pour in the vanilla extract and chocolate syrup, then stir it until everything is evenly combined. There should be no streaks or swirls of chocolate syrup.

, In a large mixing bowl, add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir them briskly together using a whisk or spoon.

, Keep stirring until everything is evenly blended together. Make sure that there are no lumps or clumps of flour. If there are any, use a whisk to break them up.

, This is not completely necessary, but it will add some extra flavor and texture to your brownies. For the chocolate chips, consider dark chocolate chips or semi-sweet chocolate chips., Use a spatula to help spread the batter evenly across the bottom of the pan.

, The brownies are ready when the center springs back if you press down on it lightly. Another way to check for doneness is by sticking a toothpick in the center. If it comes out clean, the brownies are ready.


If you are using a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) pan, bake the brownies for 35 to 40 minutes.If you are using a 10 by 15-inch (25.4 by 38.1 centimeters) pan, bake the brownies for 22 to 30 minutes., While the brownies are cooling, you can start preparing the frosting.

, Pour the milk into a medium-sized saucepan, then add the sugar. Cut the butter into smaller cubes, and toss it in. Cook the mixture over medium hear, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves.

, Stir the mixture often to prevent it from scorching or forming a skin on top.

, Keep stirring until the chocolate chips melt. If the chocolate chips are not melting at all, place the saucepan back onto the stove, and turn the heat on to low. Stir the mixture until the chocolate chips melt, then remove the saucepan from heat.

, The mixture will thicken a little as it cools. This will not only make it easier to spread, but also prevent it from soaking into the brownies.

, How much chopped walnuts you add is entirely up to you, but you still want to be able to see the fudge frosting.

, Pour the warm water into the well.

, Use a wooden spoon to incorporate it with the flour until you have a wet, sticky dough. You can use your hands instead of a spoon if you'd like. Mix the dough gently - over mixing it will cause the finished fry bread to turn out tough., When it's mixed, form it into a ball and place it in a greased bowl. Lay a clean dish towel over the top of the bowl and set it in a warm, dry place so the dough can rest for 10 minutes.The dough doesn't need to sit for longer than 10 minutes. It should be used within an hour or two and fried fresh. The fry bread won't taste as good if you let it sit overnight.

, Pull the dough apart into small pieces, and shape them into balls. Flatten the balls using the heel of your hand to make fry bread rounds about the size of tortillas.


Do not over handle the dough at this stage. Handle it only enough to create the shapes you need.
If you'd like, you can flatten the entire dough ball and use a cutter or knife to cut out individual pieces of dough.
As you work, lay the dough pieces on a plate and place a dishcloth over them to prevent them from getting dried out.

, Place a sizable amount of lard, vegetable oil or vegetable shortening into a cast iron skillet or frying pan. You need enough fat to rise up the side of the pan by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Melt the fat over medium-high heat. The fat should be heated to 350 °F (177 °C)., Put a small piece of dough in the pan to see if it's hot enough. The bread should sizzle and start bubbling immediately. Make sure it's hot enough before you start cooking the bread.

, Make sure none of them are overlapping, or the dough won't cook evenly.

, When the first side is crispy and golden brown, use tongs to turn the bread over and finish cooking the other side.

, The towels will absorb the extra oil as you finish cooking the bread., Fry bread is most delicious while it's still hot. Eat the fry bread straight from the pan or top it with one of the following toppings:


Honey and butter mixed together

, Whisk it to combine, or use a dough hook attachment on your mixer to stir it up.

,, Turn on the dough hook attachment at its lowest speed, or use a wooden spoon to mix the dough. Add water a few tablespoons at a time, mixing constantly, until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

, Allow it to absorb the water for a few minutes. This will make it easier to get the final flour/water ratio correct.

, Add additional water or flour slowly until the bowl is “clean,” without lots of bits of dough clinging to the sides. When you pinch the dough it should be just slightly sticky. If it seems too wet, add some more flour (try about ¼ to ½ cup) and process a bit more.

, Turn on the dough hook attachment to a medium speed. If you are not using a machine, you will need to knead about 10 to 15 minutes by hand to distribute the ingredients and develop the gluten in the flour. Flour your work surface and hands, then turn out the dough onto the surface and knead.

, Put the dough into a bowl 3 times larger than the amount of flour used. Oil the bowl with cooking oil, the place the dough in the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel. Set it in a warm area of the kitchen to rise.


The first rising will take a couple of hours, depending on how warm a spot the bowl is left in. You can let the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight if you prefer.

, After the dough has roughly tripled in volume, you should “punch down” the dough by poking it with your fingers to deflate it.

, Place it back in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set it in a warm area to rise a second time. When it has doubled in size, punch it down again.

, Three risings encourage smaller bubbles in the dough. If you want to speed the process or prefer a courser bread (more large bubbles), you can eliminate one or two of these risings.

, Cut the dough into two or three lumps and work on one lump at a time. Flour your work surface and hands. Roll out the dough into a rectangle about as long as desired for the baton (a shorter, wider loaf) or baguette (long and thin). Starting at one long edge, roll the dough tightly into the baton or baguette shape and pinch the seam when done.


Other shapes are certainly possible. A round loaf can be made by tucking the sides of the “lump” under to form a round, smooth loaf. A baguette is just a thinner baton.

, If you're using a cookie sheet, lightly oil and sprinkle with cornmeal; for holed sheets, lightly oil. You can fit two or three pieces on the same sheet.

, Cover the loaves on the sheet with a damp kitchen towel and let rise until roughly doubled in size. This should take about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the temperature in your kitchen.

,, Uncover the loaves and slit each loaf with a very sharp knife. (Artistic skills are helpful but not required). The usual pattern is a diagonal slicing about 1/2-inch deep and about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. More artistic types can create a “wheat sheaf” pattern.


A salty crust is something many eaters prefer. Two possible techniques are to paint the loaves with a mixture of 1 egg white, about 1 tablespoon of salt, and 1/4 cup or so of warm water; or spray the loaves lightly with some water and sprinkle on coarse salt.
For a really salty crust combine both approaches (paint first, then sprinkle).

, When the oven is hot, put the loaves on a middle rack. Spray some water into the oven to make a moist baking environment. You want a moist environment to encourage the dough to rise without splitting the surface (the slitting with a knife predefines where it should split) and to develop the crust.


Another technique is to put a pan of water on a bottom rack for the first 10 minutes.
If you have a gas oven, the moisture levels in the oven will be higher naturally than for an electric oven.
A real baker’s oven is ideal but they cost something like $12,000.

, Another spray with the water will also help with moisture and temperature.

, Remove the bread from the oven when the internal temperature is 190 degrees. Much cooler than this, the bread will be “doughy;” much hotter and it will be dry. You can measure the temperature with a thermometer.

, When cool, the bread can be eaten immediately. Some purists insist on tearing off chunks but it is OK to cut slices since many people seemed to mangle the loaf in the tearing process. Top with butter/margarine (savory) or a fruit jam (sweet), if desired. De gustibus non testutantum est – Latin: “One cannot dispute taste.”

",How to Make Gluten Free Bread," To have a gluten-free flour blend ready for your bread, mix the ingredients together before you start making the dough. Set aside.If you aren’t able to find potato flour at the store, you can use instant mashed potato flakes. Pulverize them in a blender or food processor several times to give them a light, flour-like texture.;
, This recipe provides enough for 2 loaves of bread, so you’ll need 2 pans for baking. It’s important to grease the pans before adding the dough to them or the bread may stick after baking. Take 2 8-inch (20-cm) bread pans, and spray them with a nonstick cooking spray.You can grease your bread pans with butter instead of the cooking spray if you want to add a buttery flavor to the crust. Vegetable, coconut, avocado, and canola oils can also be substituted for the spray.

, To activate the yeast, pour 2 cups (480 ml) of warm water into a bowl. Add 1 packet (approximately 2 tsp or 7 g) of active dry yeast to the water and stir the two together. Set the bowl aside while you ready the other ingredients.Warm water should be between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (38 to 44 degrees Celsius). You should be able to put your finger in it without discomfort.

, In a medium size bowl, mix together 4 cups (560 g) of the gluten-free flour blend, 1 tablespoon (22 g) xanthan gum, 1 tablespoon (15 g) gluten-free egg replacer, 2 teaspoons (14 g) salt, and ½ cup (34 g) powdered milk until well blended. Set the bowl aside., Attach the paddle attachment to your stand mixer, and combine 3 large eggs that are at room temperature, ¼ cup (57 g) of butter that’s been softened to room temperature, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of cider vinegar, and ⅓ cup (112 g) of honey. Turn the mixer to low, and mix the ingredients for approximately 30 seconds.You don’t necessarily need a stand mixer to make the gluten-free bread. You can use a handheld mixer or even stir the ingredients together by hand. The dough will turn out the same, but it will just take longer to mix it.
The mixture will still be slightly chunky when the 30 seconds are up. Just make sure that all of the ingredients are well incorporated.

, It’s easier to blend the dry ingredient mixture into the wet ingredients if you divide the dry mixture into two batches. Mix in half of the dry ingredients with the mixer set at a low speed until they’re just incorporated. Then add in the second half of the dry ingredients and mix for 30 seconds or until they’re blended in.Because there’s no gluten in the dough, you don’t have to worry about overmixing it as you would with traditional bread., After you’ve incorporated the dry ingredients, leave the mixer set at low, and slowly begin to pour the yeast and warm water mixture into the dough. Once you’ve added all of it, turn the speed up to medium-high and mix it for 4 minutes.When you’ve finished mixing the dough, it should look like extremely thick cake batter.

, When the dough is completely mixed, pour it into the 2 greased pans. Divide it between the two, and use a spatula to help spread the dough evenly in each pan.After the you’ve transferred the dough to the pans, dip your fingers in some water and use them to smooth the top of each loaf.

, Place the filled bread pans in a warm location, such as on a window sill, and cover loosely with greased plastic wrap. Let the dough rise for about 30 minutes to an hour, or until it’s just above the edge of the pans.If you don’t have plastic wrap on hand, you can loosely lay a towel over the bread pans while they’re rising.

, While the dough is rising, it’s important to preheat the oven so it will be at the correct temperature when it’s time to bake the bread. Set the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), and check that the rack is in the center position so air will circulate around the bread in both directions while it’s baking.Be sure that you know how your oven indicates that it’s fully preheated. It may beep or light up in a certain spot when it’s ready.

, Place the two pans of bread into the oven, centering them on the rack. Allow the loaves to bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the tops become a golden brown.Sticking a toothpick into a yeast bread won't help you determine doneness, so it’s a good idea to have an instant-read thermometer on hand when you bake it. The bread’s internal temperature should reach 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) when it’s finished baking.
When the bread is finished, it will pull away from the sides of the pan and have a firm feel when you touch it.

, When the bread is finished baking, remove the pans from the oven. Let the loaves cool in the pans for approximately 10 minutes. When they’re cool enough to handle, remove them from the pans and allow them to cool on a rack for another 45 to 55 minutes or until completely cool.For the best storage, slice the bread once it’s completely cool and store the individual pieces in plastic wrap. Keep it in the freezer, and you can take out slices whenever you need them., Once you master making gluten-free sandwich bread, you can try making different flavored breads, such as oatmeal maple or tropical. Start with the basic recipe and add your favorite flavors to customize the bread to your taste.For gluten-free oatmeal maple bread, mix 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of maple syrup into the dough and sprinkle ½ cup (45 g) of gluten-free oats over the dough in the pan before baking.
To make gluten-free tropical bread, combine the yeast with ½ cup orange juice that's been warmed to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (44 degrees Celsius) instead of water and combine with the rest of the dough ingredients just as with the basic recipe. Next, mix in 2 6-ounce cans of crushed pineapple with the juice into the batter before pouring it into the pans.
Create gluten-free pumpernickel bread by mixing 1 tablespoon (15 g) of cocoa powder,1 tablespoon (15 g) of dried minced onion, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of instant coffee, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of sugar, ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of caraway seeds, and 3 tablespoons (65 g) of molasses into the dough.,"

To make English Muffins:


Once the dough has risen, spray some Pam on the counter top and hands.,
Bake a loaf of English Muffin bread by following these steps:


An additional rising will give you a finer textured bread.,
Finished.

",How to Make English Muffins or Bread," Combine 2 1/2 cups of flour, one packet of yeast, and 2 cups of warm (90-110F) water in at least a 8 cup bowl. Mix with a spoon until it is a smooth batter. This will sit and ""cook"" for at least 4 hours during which time it will increase in volume a lot (hence the big bowl). Cover with some plastic wrap or a cloth and leave in a warm place (room temperature is fine).;
, Combine 2 cups of flour (we are up to 4 1/2 cups total so far), about half of the starter, a packet of yeast, and 1 1/2 cups of warm (room temperature to 100F) buttermilk in a very large bowl.Use a heavy-duty mixer such as a Kitchenaid to make the dough. Initially mix the batter until smooth using a spoon. Let stand covered in a warm room (just like the starter above) for at least one hour. This will increase in size but not quite as much as the starter did.

, Add the rest of the starter. You can mix this with a heavy wooden spoon or use the bread hook from your mixer. If using a mixer, assemble the bowl and hook in the mixer with the bowl in the ""down"" position (assuming your mixer has the ""lift"" feature). Start the mixer on the slowest setting and slowly raise the bowl. (If you raise the bowl too quickly, you will have flour flying all over the place!) Mix/knead until the bowl is clean (or relatively clean). Stop the mixer and give the dough a pinch -- it should be moist but not sticky. If it is too soft and sticky, you need to add some flour -- I suggest adding a 1/2 cup. I have never needed more than this extra 1/2 cup. Knead a bit longer to mix in the new flour.


It may not be necessary to hand knead. You can do some of the kneading by hand to make sure the dough is the right texture and has the right moisture content. Spray your counter top with some nonstick cooking spray. You can also spray your hands with nonstick cooking spray.
If the dough gets too sticky, sprinkle some more flour on the mass and knead some more. Again, I would not expect to use more than maybe 1/4 cup additional flour but let the dough dictate what is needed.

,, Roll out the dough until it is about 1/2"" thick. Cut circles of about 3 1/2"" to 4"" from the dough and put these on a cookie sheet (Pam or some cornmeal will keep the dough from sticking to the sheet).
Cover with a cloth and let sit about 45 minutes. You don't want them to be too thick or it will be more difficult to cook them.
Heat a griddle or frying pan. To cook, heat a large griddle or frying pan on the stove until it is about 300 degrees F (a drop of water will sizzle on the surface). Sprinkle the griddle with some more of the cornmeal. Transfer some of the dough circles to the griddle and cook about 10 minutes while turning them every couple of minutes. They will get fairly brown on both sides. You can tell when they are done best by sticking a thermometer into the side of a muffin -- when it reads about 180F, they are done. Remove them to a rack to let them cool and cook the rest of the muffins. A tip for too-thick muffins -- if they are brown and you think they will burn before getting to 180F internally, put a few (maybe up to 6) in the microwave for about a minute and check the internal temperature. If you don't get the internal temperature to about 180F, the insides tend to be a bit doughy.
Cool the muffins to room temperature. Once cool you can put them into plastic bags, suck out the air, and seal. These muffins have no preservatives -- not even any butter or oil. Hence, they must be refrigerated or frozen but wait until they cool to do this. You can store English muffins for about 4 days on the kitchen counter. Bagging before they cool will result in soggy muffins!
Prepare the English Muffin for eating. Eating is the last step! To split an English muffin, you use a dinner fork and drive it into the sides of the muffin with the tines parallel to the faces of the muffin and about half-way between the faces. Do this all around the muffin and you should be able to separate the halves easily. If you buy ""fork-split"" muffins in the store, this is approximately what happens in the factory. You can simply cut the muffin in two, but the fork splitting results in a rougher texture that holds more butter, preserves, etc. Toast the two halves -- if your toaster has a ""bagel"" setting, use this to toast only the inside of the muffin since the outsides are already ""toasted"" from cooking. A broiler is great for toasting many muffins at once.

, For loaves, I usually do one extra rising. For ""country style"" bread, skip the additional rising.
Butter the pans.
Divide the dough into three equal lumps. A scale is handy but not required. Form each lump into a loaf shape -- roll the dough out into a roughly 12""X12"" rectangle, fold from the top and bottom to the middle and fold again down the middle. Pinch the edges together and put the crease bottom-down in the buttered pan.
Cover the pans with a damp towel and let rise until roughly doubled (45 minutes or so). Preheat the oven during this time.
Bake at 375 °F (191 °C) for about 30 minutes. For the first couple of minutes and immediately after inserting the pans into the oven, spray the oven (right on the bread is fine) with water mist. This will help with the early rising during baking.
Use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature of the bread after about 20 minutes and bake until the bread's internal temperature is 180 °F (82 °C).
Remove bread from the oven to cool. You can brush melted butter on the bread, if you like.

Preheat the oven to 350 F or 180 C. Melt the butter in a saucepan.,
Combine the white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.,
Cut a shallow hole in the center of each biscuit with a small, sharp knife.,
Dust or sprinkle a little of the sugar mixture onto the tops of every biscuit.,
Drizzle a little of the cooled melted butter onto every biscuit in the individual wrappers, making sure ""not to overcoat"" each biscuit.,
Bake the friendship fairy bread in the oven for about 5-8 minutes or until the sugar has melted onto the biscuits.,
Combine powdered sugar, lemon juice and water in a bowl.,
Drizzle the icing onto the fairy bread cups.",How to Make Friendship Fairy Bread1," When the butter is melted, set it aside to cool. It is important that you cool the butter before working with it because you do not want the sugar to melt too fast - you want it crystallized on the top of each biscuit.;
, Flatten or roll out the buttermilk biscuits, making sure to lay them on a flat surface.


This step is optional, but if you want to take this recipe to the next level, do not skip this step! If you do choose to skip this step, bear in mind you will still have to make the sugar mixture.

, Fill the biscuit holes with a small amount of the sugar mixture, then cover the holes with the biscuit center that was cut out.

, Using a muffin tray lined with cupcake wrappers, place about one or two biscuits (or three or four depending on the size) inside every wrapper.

, Sprinkle on the remaining sugar mixture if there is any left. In the case where you have run out of the sugar mixture, sprinkle on some cinnamon instead.

, Take the fairy bread cups and leave them on a wire rack to cool. Do not leave them inside the muffin tray - it will be harder to cool.

, If desired, you can add a few drops of food coloring. The consistency of the icing should be runny, but not too runny where it is like water. It should be opaque as well.


You can omit the lemon juice and use other extracts as well. If you want to keep your icing plain, it tastes great that way too. You can also substitute water for milk! Use less milk though, because it is richer. However, it is entirely up to you.

, Lastly, sprinkle some 100s and 1000s to complete the fairy bread cups. You can wait until the icing has set to serve them, or you can eat them immediately.

Bake the pretzels.",How to Twist a Pretzel," Place the pretzel dough on a floured surface and use the palms of your hands to roll it back and forth against the counter top. Push the dough outwards as you roll until you achieve the desired length.









Pretzel dough tends to shrink back on itself after rolling, so a good technique is to roll it partway, then leave it to rest for a few minutes before rolling again.
The ideal length is between 18 and 20 inches -- this will give you nice, large pretzel.;
, On the floured surface, form the length of dough into the shape of the letter U.









Once you've done that, pick up the two ends and twist them around each other twice (as seen in the image).

, Take the twisted section of pretzel and fold it over until the ends meet the bottom of the U.









Imagine the pretzel is a clock and attach the ends to the points where the numbers 5 and 7 would be, by pinching them firmly into the dough.
If you're having trouble getting the ends to stick, use a little water or milk to press them into place. You now have a simple, neatly folded pretzel, ready to bake!, Use the palms of your hands to roll the dough into a long, thick strand, about 18 inches (45.7 cm) long and as thick as a cigar.

, Lift the pretzel stand off the counter, holding the ends about one foot away from each other. Your left hand should be slightly higher than your right.

, Use your right hand to gently flick the dough in a lasso movement, so the dough twists around itself.









Only allow the dough to twist around itself twice -- you can stop the twisting by laying the dough on the counter top.

, At this point, you should still be holding one end of the pretzel dough in each hand.









Fold the twisted part of the pretzel over and attach these ends to the curve of the pretzel, at the points where 5 and 7 would be on a clock., Take a piece of pretzel dough and use the palms of your hands to roll it out into a long strand, about 18 inches (45.7 cm) in length.








, Fold the length of dough in half, then twist the two pieces around each other before pressing the loose ends together.








, Then pass the joined ends through the loop at the top. Press down on the dough to secure the twist.








, When you're done, you should have between 8 and 12 pretzel twists. These provide thicker, doughier soft pretzel pieces than the classic pretzel shape.







, To make the perfect soft pretzels at home, you will need the following ingredients:


1 1/2 cups of warm water
1 tablespoon of sugar
2 teaspoons of kosher salt
1 package of active dry yeast
4 1/2 cups (or 22 oz) of all-purpose flour
2 oz of unsalted butter, melted
2/3 cup of baking soda
1 large egg yolk
Coarse salt, for sprinkling

, In a large bowl, mix the warm water, sugar and kosher salt. Sprinkle the packet of active dry yeast on top and leave the mixture to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, until it turns foamy.








, Add the flour and melted butter to the yeast mix and mix til combined. Keep mixing until a smooth dough forms, which pulls away from the sides of the bowl.








, Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and grease the bowl with vegetable oil. Return the dough to the bowl and cover with cling wrap. Leave the dough to sit somewhere warm until it doubles in size -- this should take about 50 to 55 minutes.








, Combine the baking soda with 10 cups of water in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Use this time to prepare two baking sheets -- line them with parchment paper and grease lightly with vegetable oil.








, Divide the dough into eight equal pieces and use one of the methods described in the sections above to twist the pretzels into shape.








, One-by-one, dip the pretzels into the boiling water for 30 seconds at a time. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to remove them from the water and place them on the prepared baking sheet.








, Mix the large egg yolk with a tablespoon of water, then lightly brush a little egg mixture onto the surface of each pretzel -- this will give them a nice, deep brown color once baked. Sprinkle each pretzel with a little coarse salt.








, Bake the pretzels in an oven preheated to 450 degrees for 12 to 14 minutes, until they are dark, golden brown in color. Transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool slightly before eating."

, This recipe will make enough butter for 16 slices of bread; you may have some butter left over, or you may have to make more.

, Scoop the butter onto the bread slices first, then spread it around with a butter knife. Only butter one side of each slice of bread., This will give the butter time to solidify, and prevent it from sticking in the next step., You can fit two slices into one quart-sized (liter-sized) freezer bag.Do not cram the slices into the bags. They should not stick, but if you are worried about it happening, you could put a sheet of parchment paper, freezer paper, or wax paper between them.

,
Finished.

",How to Make Friendship Fairy Bread2," You could keep the bread as it is, in squares, but for a more impressive looking snack, slice the bread into triangles. Set aside.

, To the side, have your butter, jam and 100s and 1000s ready as well. Don't forget to include two knives - one for the butter and one for the jam.

, Take one slice of bread, and spread either butter or jam on the top. Then, spread a bit of jam onto the plate; it will help to stick the first slice of bread. 'Glue' your first triangle of bread onto the spot where you smeared on the jam.


To make your snack more impressive (as mentioned earlier), smear the jam in two areas. This way, you will have two triangular stacks that when pressed together, form a square.

, Repeat with every slice of bread - spread some jam onto a slice and stick it on. Spread some butter on a slice and stick it on. Continue this, remembering not to put any 100s and 1000s just yet, until there is one last piece of bread for each stack (you will have two pieces of bread).

, Stick them on, and sprinkle on the 100s and 1000s. Now, your two triangular fairy bread stacks should form a square. Go ahead and press them together to form a square, if you haven't already.

, Do not coat thickly - only a small amount will do. Pour a handful of 100s and 1000s into your hand and press onto the sides of the stack, coating it with a 100s and 1000s shell.

, Then, stand back and enjoy your marvelous creation!

Next, line the bottom of two 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pans with parchment paper and lightly coat them with butter and flour.You can use nonstick cooking spray instead of the butter to grease the parchment paper if you prefer.;
, Add ½ cup (113 g) of softened butter and 1 ¼ cups (250 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Use a handheld electric mixer to beat the two together on medium until the mixture is light and fluffy, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.You can mix the cake batter in a stand mixer if you prefer.
You can mix the batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort.

, Once the butter and sugar are creamed together, add 3 large eggs to the bowl, one at a time. Completely mix each egg in on medium speed before adding the next.If you prefer, you can use egg substitute in place of the eggs.

, When the eggs are fully incorporated, add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla extract. Blend it in on medium until it’s fully incorporated., Add 2 cups (250 g) of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons (8 g) of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt to a separate large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully blended.If you prefer a lighter, more airy cake, you can substitute cake flour for the all-purpose flour.

, After you’ve combined the dry ingredients, mix them them into the butter mixture alternately with 1 cup (237 ml) of milk. Beat the mixture on medium-low after each addition until the batter is fully blended.2% or whole milk works best for the cake.

, Once you’ve finished mixing the cake batter, divide it equally between the two prepared pans. Use a rubber spatula to spread the batter evenly throughout the pans., After you’ve poured the batter into the pans, place in the preheated oven. Allow the cakes to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and firm on top.You can be sure that the cakes are finished baking by sticking a cake tester or a toothpick inside the center. It will emerge clean when the cakes are done.

, When the cakes are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Place the pans on a wire cooling rack, and let the cakes cool inside for 10 minutes., After the cakes have cooled for several minutes in the pans, run a butter knife around the sides to loosen the cakes. Carefully turn them out onto the cooling rack, and let them cool completely, which should take approximately 30 minutes.It’s important to cool the cake completely so the frosting doesn’t melt off when you ice the cake.
Be sure to remove the parchment paper liners if they stick to the bottom of the cakes.

, To get the right consistency for the frosting, it’s important to chill your tools. Place a large bowl and the beaters from your handheld electric mixer in the freezer and allow them to chill for about 15 minutes.If you’re using a stand mixer, place the wire whisk attachment in the freezer with the bowl to chill.
If you’re mixing the frosting by hand, place a wire whisk in the freezer to chill with the bowl.

, Once the bowl is chilled, add 8 ounces (225 g) of softened cream cheese, 1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar, and 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla extract to it. Beat the ingredients together on medium until the mixture is smooth., When the cream cheese mixture is fully blended, gradually add 2 cups (473 ml) of heavy whipping cream to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium until firm peaks form.Make sure that the cream is extremely cold when you add it to the butter mixture.

, Once the frosting is completely mixed, divide it between three bowls. You’ll leave one bowl white, add blue paste food coloring to a second, and tint the third bowl pink. The amount of frosting in each bowl will depend on whether you’re using icing or candy to reveal the gender of the baby.If you are using icing to reveal the gender, tint 1 ¼ cups (283 g) of frosting blue for a boy or pink for a girl. Tint ¼ cup (57 g) in the other color, and leave the remaining frosting white.
If you are using candy to reveal the gender, tint ¼ cup (57 g) blue, ¼ cup (57 g) pink, and leave the rest of the frosting white.

, Set one of the cakes on a serving plate, and pipe all along the edge with white frosting. Next, spread 1 cup (226 g) of frosting in blue for a boy or pink for girl inside the circle.If you don’t have a piping bag, you can simply spread some of the white frosting around the edge of the cake with a knife or offset spatula. Using the white border is just to ensure that the colored frosting won’t be visible outside the cake.

, After you’ve covered the top of the first cake with the gender-appropriate frosting and a white border, place the second cake on top. Spread the remaining white frosting all along the top and sides of the cake., Once the cake is fully covered with white frosting, decorate it with the remaining blue and pink frosting. Pipe the colored frosting in dots, flowers, or stars around the cake in whatever design you like.A #8 tip on your piping bag is ideal for adding pearl shapes around the cake.
A #12 tip on your piping bag is ideal for adding dots to the cake.
A #4 tip on your piping bag is ideal for writing a message on the cake, such as “It’s a …”
If you don’t have a piping bag, you can put the frosting in plastic bags, snip off the corner, and pipe simple dots and swirls with it.

, Place one of the finished cakes on a serving plate. Use a large serrated knife to trim off the rounded top of the cake so it’s flat and the second layer can rest evenly on top.To ensure that the frosting won’t get on the serving plate, place several pieces of wax paper beneath the first layer all the way around the cake. If any frosting falls off the cake as you work, it will drop onto the paper, which you can pull away when you’re done icing it so the plate remains clean..

, After you’ve flattened the first layer of the cake, use a large, round cookie cutter or a tupperware lid to serve as a stencil so you can cut a hole in the center with a knife. Remove the cake for the hole and set it aside.The round item that you use as a stencil should be at least 4-inches (10-cm) in size.
The cake that you remove from the center hole can serve as a tasty snack for yourself or friends and family.

, Once you’ve removed the cake from the center of the first layer, use some of your white frosting to ice the remaining edge all the way around. Next, use approximately 2 cups (406 g) of pink or blue chocolate candies in the gender-appropriate color to fill the hole.While you want to completely fill the hole with candies, don’t allow them to overflow onto the edge of the cake.

, When the center hole is filled with the candy, set the second cake layer on top of the first. Use the remaining white frosting to cover the top and sides completely., After you’ve covered the entire cake with white frosting, use the pink and blue frosting to garnish the cake. Pipe it on in whatever shapes you like, such as flowers, dots, or stars.If you don’t have a piping bag, you can put the frosting in plastic bags, snip off the corner, and pipe simple dots and swirls with it.
You can also use blue and pink chocolate candies to decorate the cake.

, To do this, just dip your finger in a small bowl of cool water and run it around the edge of each dumpling wrapper before you seal it closed.

, There are a variety of ways to seal the dumplings, depending on your level of expertise. For the basic seal, just fold the dumpling into a half-moon shape and press it closed. Here are some other ways to seal the dumplings:The double pleat: fold the dumpling in half and press the top closed. Then, use your thumb and index finger to fold a pleat into one side of the dumpling, and then fold an inverse pleat on the other side, pressing it firmly to seal it.
The multiple pleat: to do this, fold the dumpling in half, but don't press it closed. Instead, use your thumb and index finger to fold pleats into the side of the wrapper that's facing you. After each pleat, pinch it closed against the back half of the wrapper. This way, you'll be ""zipping"" the dumpling closed.
The gathered pouch: just gather the sides of the dumpling around the filling and then pleat the top closed like a pouch. Then, pinch the opening to the seal.

, If you want to freeze the dumplings, then you should place them on a baking sheet without letting them touch and then place them in sealed freezer containers once they're frozen solid. They'll last in the freezer for at least three months. Read on to find out how to cook the dumplings.

If they're frozen, steam them for 7-8 minutes., To pan-sear dumplings, you'll be essentially making pot stickers. To do this, just film a skillet with a tablespoon of oil and warm it over high heat. Once the oil is simmering, after a minute or so, place the dumplings on the pan so they fill the pan without touching. Cook the bottoms of the dumplings until they've turned golden and brown. Place 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml). of water in the pan, cover it, and reduce it to low.Cook the dumplings for 3-5 minutes if they're fresh.
Cook the dumplings for 6-8 minutes if they're frozen.

, To boil the dumplings, bring a pot of water to a boil and place the dumplings in the pot. Stir them so that they don't stick together. Then, add 1 1/2 cups of cold water and wait for the water to return to a boil. Repeat this process one more time.

",How to Bake a Cake2,"


3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup buttermilk or sour cream

,, You can use a round standard cake pan, a square baking dish, a loaf pan, a bundt cake pan, or whatever you have on hand. Make sure to grease it well with butter or cooking spray so the cake won't stick to the pan when it's baked.

, Place the butter, eggs, vanilla extract, sugar, and buttermilk in a bowl. Use a whisk or a hand mixer to blend the ingredients well.


The ""wet ingredients"" in cake recipes are generally those that have moisture. Sugar is often listed as a wet ingredient, too, even though it isn't actually wet.
The wet ingredients are usually mixed first in a large bowl. The dry ingredients are mixed separately and added later.
It's important to follow instructions regarding the texture of the butter in cake recipes. If you use melted butter where softened butter is called for, the cake could come out ruined. In this case the recipe calls for room temperature butter. You can plan ahead by setting the butter out while you get the rest of the ingredients ready, so it has time to come to room temperature.

, Place the flour, salt, cocoa powder, and baking powder in a small bowl. Stir them together until they are well incorporated.

, Beat the mixture on low until the batter comes together and no white bits of flour remain.

, Use a spoon or spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl so every bit of batter makes it into the pan.

, Check the cake's progress every so often to make sure it doesn't burn. The cake is ready when a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, rather than coated with batter.

, Set it on the counter and let it cool for about 5 minutes before handling it.

, Use whatever plate you're planning on using to serve the cake.

, If you try to add frosting to the cake while it's still warm, the frosting will melt and run off the sides. Make some chocolate buttercream frosting or plain buttercream frosting, or any other kind of frosting.

, Be sure to have the correct size or shape of the pan. Bundt cakes require bundt pans, while others can be baked in a variety of sizes. Grease pans to avoid sticking. Use about a half of tablespoon of butter or vegetable shortening on a paper towel and rub the inside of the pan. Sprinkle about a tablespoon or two of flour on top. Flour the pans on the sides to help the cake adhere to the sides as it bakes. This will ensure that the top is flatter, which is important for layered cakes. Shake and dump out any excess flour and set the pans to the side.

,, Most cake recipes begin combining dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, cocoa, etc.), then adding wet ingredients (eggs, oil, and milk). Be sure to take special prerequisites such as sifting, whisking or beating, and packing before adding to the main bowl.

, Some recipes can be mixed with a stand or hand mixer. Be cautious as steps can instruct to fold in flour or other ingredients with a rubber spatula. While mixing, stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula or spoon to ensure that everything is mixed thoroughly.

, Fill the pans 2/3 of the way full, as the cake will rise during baking. Gently tap the cake pan on the counter top to release any large air bubbles in the batter.

, Do not allow pans to touch each other or the oven wall.

, If there's a time range, use the median or middle number (bake it for 35 minutes for a range of 34 to 36 minutes or 53 minutes for a range of 50 to 55 minutes). Using the median will ensure that the cake won't under or overcook. Resist the urge to open the oven door during baking, as the heat will escape and may cause the cake to cook unevenly. If applicable, turn the oven light on and view through the oven window.

, Gently insert a toothpick or wooden skewer in the center of the cake. If it comes out clean or with a few small crumbs on it, the cake is done. If not, place it back in the oven for another 3-4 minutes. Keep testing for the same amount of time until you get the correct result.

, Run a butter knife around the pan edges to loosen the sides. Place the wire rack over the top of the pan, invert it, and tap it lightly to remove the cake.


Let it cool completely before decorating since the heat will melt frosting and icing. Frost and decorate as desired.

Then, place the cherries in a jar or bowl and soak them in the kirschwasser overnight.Cherries should decorate the outside rim of the cake. You can also put as many or few in the middle of the cake as you wish. Keep out at least 10 cherries to decorate the cake.;
, Coat the bottoms of three 9-inch round pans with parchment paper circles.


Parchment paper is a grease and moisture resistant paper used when baking. It helps the cake not stick, which can sometimes happen when greasing a pan. Cakes will easily separate from the pan without leaving any residue behind., Add flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt together. Sift into a large bowl. Set it aside for now.

, Creaming is a type of mixing method. Using a hand or stand mixer, beat the shortening and sugar on low until it is creamy. Then, mix on high until the shortening and sugar is frothy and fluffy.Whip in eggs and vanilla, mixing well.


These ingredients should be mixed together in a large bowl. You will add the other dry and wet ingredients to this mixture.

, Pour a small amount of the flour mixture into the shortening mix, then add a small amount of buttermilk. Alternate adding the flour and buttermilk until combined.


Alternating dry and wet ingredients helps keep the airy quality of the batter. When you mix egg, butter, and sugar mixtures into a frothy foam, it produces air bubbles. Gradually adding the dry ingredients keeps the air bubbles from popping. Dumping in ingredients makes dense desserts., Pour batter evenly into the three lined pans. Place in the oven for approximately 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.

, After removing the cake from the oven, let it cool. When the layers are cool, remove from the pan and place on a cooling rack or a platter. Detach the paper.

, Use a toothpick to make small holes in the top of the layers. Remove the cherries from the kirschwasser, and pour the kirschwasser evenly over the three cake layers.

, In a bowl, beat the butter until light and fluffy. Add the confectioners sugar, the salt, and coffee. Whip until velvety. If the texture is too thick, add a couple teaspoons of cherry juice or kirschwasser.

, Place the bottom cake layer on a cake plate. Spread 1/2 of the filling over this layer. Top the filling with cherries. Place another layer on top. Cover this layer with the remaining filling, cover with cherries, and place the final layer on top of this.


Cut the cherries in half or into smaller pieces. This makes them easier to eat, and ensures they spread evenly between the layers.

, Allowing the cake to stand for a day or two lets the kirschwasser soak into the layers properly.Make sure to cover the cake to keep it fresh.


This step is not mandatory. However, for a more authentic flavor, let the cake soak for a day or two.

, In a mixing bowl, whip the cream to stiff peaks. To do this, use a hand mixer and start on a low setting, and slowly increase the speed as bubbles form and the cream thickens.Continue mixing on high, until the cream forms stiff peaks.


You know the mixture has stiff peaks when you remove your mixer and the cream holds its shape. The cream will be heavy and thick.Use a bowl large enough to hold the icing. Try a bowl with high sides to avoid spillage.
This step should be done the day you plan on serving the cake.

, Add the dry milk and confectioners sugar to the cream, and gently fold. Add the vanilla extract and kirschwasser. Continue folding until everything is combined.


To fold, start at the back of the bowl and place the spatula into the batter until it hits the bottom of the bowl. Lift the batter over the top of the top ingredient. Then, turn the bowl a quarter of a turn and repeat. This method will gently mix the ingredients together., With a rubber spatula, cover the top and sides of cake liberally with the icing. Line the top edge of the cake with whole cherries.

, Take a block of dark baking chocolate out of the refrigerator. Hold it with a paper towel and use a vegetable peeler to slice chocolate from the bar. The chocolate should curl up in thin shavings. The chocolate curls should be paper thin.Make sure the chocolate is cold; otherwise, it will not shave properly.
You can also place the desired number of cherries on the top of the cake amongst the chocolate curls.

Parchment and wax paper is a great alternative to using sprays or butter to grease the pan. It is moisture and grease-resistant, so cakes are removed from the pans without sticking.

, Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Combine until well blended.

, Place eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla in the bowl with the dry ingredients. Beat with an electric mixer until well blended., Pour batter into the two lined pans. Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 35 minutes. Check to see if the cake is done by inserting a toothpick or fork into the center. If it comes out clean, the cake is finished.

, After taking the cakes out of the oven, let cool for around 10 minutes. Then, remove the cakes from the pans and place on wire cooling racks until they are completely cooled.

, Place the whipping cream in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer and beat on a low setting, slowly increasing the speed as bubbles form and the cream thickens. When the cream has thickened, gradually beat in the powdered sugar until stiff peaks form.Stiff peaks have formed when the cream holds its shape when the mixer is removed. The cream will be heavy and thick., In a smaller bowl, mix the cherry pie filling and almond extract., Using a large, serrated knife, cut each layer in half, making 4 layers in all. Place a layer on a cake plate, with the smooth side up. Spread 1/4 of whipped cream onto the cake, then add 1/4 of the cherry mixture on top. Top with another layer, smooth top up. Repeat until you have a layer of whipped cream and cherries between each layer of cake.


Spread only within an inch of the side so it does not spill over.

, Spread the rest of the whipped cream over the top and sides of the cake. Pour the remaining cherry mixture on the top. Sprinkle with sliced almonds.

, Pour the batter into the two greased cake pans. Bake for thirty minutes, or until a toothpick is inserted into the middle of the cake and comes out clean.

, Remove the cakes from the oven when done. Let cool for about 15 minutes. Then, transfer cakes onto a wire rack. Loosen the edges of the cakes with a knife before trying to remove them. Let cool completely before frosting.

, Pour the can of cherries into a strainer or colander over a small saucepan to separate the cherries from the syrup. Over medium-high heat, bring the syrup to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer until reduced. This should take approximately 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the lemon juice.If you wish to add alcohol, you can also stir in kirschwasser or rum. Set aside. Allow to cool completely before adding to the cake.


This step should be completed while the cakes are baking or cooling. This will give the syrup enough time to cool before you put it on the cake.

, Cut the cherries in half or into small pieces. Place them into a bowl and add 2 tablespoons of the syrup. Stir together.

, Using a serrated knife, cut the two cakes into four layers. Use a toothpick to poke holes into the smooth side of the cake. Drizzle 1/4 cup of the cherry syrup over the tops of the layers. Make sure to sprinkle where the holes are so the syrup will soak into the cake.

, Place a layer on a cake plate, smooth side up. Spray 1/4 of the can of whipped cream onto the cake, then spread with a rubber spatula. Pour 1/4 of the cherry syrup evenly over the whipped cream. Use a slotted spoon to spread 1/4 of the cherries over the filling. Leave the syrup in the bowl. Place another layer of cake on top, smooth side up.


Repeat this step for the remaining layers.
Make sure to only spread the filling within an inch of the sides. You don't want the filling spilling over.
If you don't want to use a can of whipped cream, try Cool Whip instead.

, Using the rest of the whipped cream, frost the outside of the cake. On top of the cake, pour any remaining cherry syrup over the whipped cream. Line the edge of the cake with the remaining cherries. Make sure to space them evenly apart. Sprinkle dark chocolate chips on the top of the cake and along the sides.


If you would like more whipped cream topping, buy 2 cans instead of 1. If you would like more cherries and cherry syrup, use 1.5 or 2 cans instead of 1.

, Set the oven to 350 F (177 C). With vegetable shortening, grease the bottom of the two cake pans to prevent the batter from sticking.


You don’t have to grease the pans if you're using non-stick products.

, Measure the flour, salt, and cocoa into one of the medium bowls. Whisk or stir the ingredients together.


Do not add the sugar to the dry ingredients, as it will get creamed with the wet ingredients.

, In the second medium bowl, combine the sugar and oil. Beat the mixture with the electric beaters on medium speed until the two are completely incorporated.


Add the eggs, one at a time, followed by the food coloring and vanilla. Beat the mixture until all the ingredients are combined and the black food coloring is evenly distributed.Use a whisk if you don’t have electric beaters.

, Pour about a quarter of the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and beat on medium speed. Gradually add the rest of the dry ingredients. When everything has been combined, beat on medium speed until the batter is smooth and even.


Don’t overmix the batter, as this can develop the gluten and make the cake denser and less fluffy.Scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary to make sure everything gets incorporated.

, Combine the vinegar and baking soda in a small bowl. Mix them together, and give the mixture a moment to stop fizzing.


When it calms down, add the baking soda and vinegar mixture to the batter and beat it just long enough to combine everything., Divide the batter evenly between the two cake pans.

If you don't have non-stick spray, grease the pan with oil or butter and then dust it with a little flour.;
, Place the flour and cocoa powder in a sifter. Sift them together into a large mixing bowl. Make sure to get rid of any clumps.

, Place baking soda, sugar, and salt in the mixing bowl. Use a whisk, spatula, or fork to mix well. Make sure no clumps remain in the mixture. If there are clumps, run all the ingredients through a sifter again.


Try using cane sugar instead of granulated sugar. They can be substituted exactly for white sugar in recipes., Carefully add the oil, vinegar, vanilla extract, and water to the dry flour mixture. Mix the wet and dry ingredients with a hand blender until there are no more lumps.If you want to use an alternative to vegetable oil, try coconut oil or sunflower oil.For a variation, substitute coffee instead of water. Or try adding 1/4 tsp of coffee granules to the wet ingredients., Pour the batter into a pre-greased 9"" x 9"" (525 cm2) baking pan, 2"" (5 cm) deep. Bake the cake at 350ºF (180ºC).


If you have not done so before this step, grease the pan with non-stick spray. You can also line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper to keep the cake from sticking.
Keep an eye on the cake as it bakes. Insert a toothpick or fork into the center to check the cake's progress. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready.
The time may vary for each oven or for each pan. Adjust your baking time accordingly.

, When the cake is complete, remove the pan from the oven. Let the cake cool for about 5 minutes. After the cake has cooled, remove the cake from the pan and place on a wire cooling rack.


To ensure that the cake comes easily from the pan, use a butter knife to lightly run along the edges of the cake. Make sure that the edges are all loose before you flip it.
If you are afraid you might drop the cake while flipping, place the serving plate over the top of the baking pan before you flip. Gently remove the cake from the pan after you have flipped it over.
If the pan is still hot when you flip it, make sure to use oven mitts so you don't burn your hands.
If you want to apply frosting, let the cake cool completely. Otherwise, serve with a dollop of non-dairy whipped cream or chocolate sauce. Or eat it without icing!

, Gather 2 cups of dark chocolate chips and 1 cup of whipping cream. Make sure the chocolate is broken into smaller pieces. Place the ingredients in a microwave safe bowl.Microwave for 1 minute. After 30 seconds, stop the microwave, remove the bowl, and stir. Start the microwave again. When the minute is up, remove the bowl and stir.
Keep microwaving in 15-30 second increments until the chocolate is completely blended, smooth, and completely free of lumps.

, This icing contains no milk products. Gather 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, and 1/3 cup of water.Begin by sifting the powdered sugar into a bowl to rid it of any lumps. Make sure the powdered sugar is completely smooth before continuing.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the ingredients together. Add the water to the mixture slowly to thicken. Too much water can make it thin; if the icing is too thick, just add water until it is to your desired consistency.

, For this icing recipe, gather 1/3 cup of unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 cup of powdered sugar, and 1-2 tablespoons of milk.The butter should be softened before making the frosting. To soften the butter, remove the butter from the refrigerator 30-60 minutes before you begin. This should allow it enough time to reach room temperature and soften. If it starts to melt, place it back in the refrigerator.Sift the powdered sugar before starting. Pour the sugar into a sifter and sift into a large bowl.
Place softened butter in a large bowl and stir until it is a smooth consistency. Sift the cocoa powder onto the butter, then fold until combined. To fold, start at the back of the bowl and place the spatula into the batter until it hits the bottom of the bowl. Lift the batter over the top of the top ingredient. Then, turn the bowl slightly and repeat. This method will gently mix the ingredients together.Sift in half the powdered sugar. Fold the batter until completely mixed. Then add the rest of the sugar and fold until the batter is blended and smooth.
You can change the consistency of the icing by adding milk. When you are finished with the icing, it should spread easily on the cake.

, After you have made one of the frosting recipes, spread the frosting over the cake. Make sure the cake has fully cooled before icing. If you try to ice the cake before it is cooled, you could end up breaking the cake apart.

",How to Bake a Black Cake2," Black fruit cake is a popular West Indian cake that’s often made for Christmas, and dried fruit soaked in alcohol is one of the main ingredients. The fruit must be soaked for at least a couple hours, but some people prefer soaking it for months before making the cake.


Cut the prunes into quarters, and place them into a medium mixing bowl along with the raisins, currants, and mixed peel. You can substitute or add in dates (pitted and quartered), dried cherries, or any other dried fruit you like as well.Mix the cherry wine and rum in a small bowl. Pour one cup of the wine and rum mixture over the fruit. You can also add a few dashes of angostura bitters to the mix.Cover the remaining alcohol and set it aside.
Stir the fruit and alcohol, cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap, and let it sit overnight. You can also let the fruit soak for a few days or weeks leading up to your baking.If you let it soak for longer than overnight, give it a stir every few days.

, When it comes time to make the cake, you will need to gather your ingredients, preheat your oven to 280 F (138 C), and collect your baking supplies. You will need:Two greased eight-inch baking pans lined with parchment paper
Parchment paper
Electric beaters or a stand mixer
A spatula and mixing spoon
Food processor
Whisk
Mixing bowls: one small, one medium, and one large
Toothpicks
Ladle

, Pour the fruit and alcohol it was soaking in into the food processor or blender. Pulse the fruit for about two to three minutes, until the fruit becomes a coarse paste and there are no chunks left.Add a few extra splashes of the wine and rum mixture if necessary to loosen the fruit.
Puree the fruit in a few separate batches if your food processor isn't large enough to handle the entire quantity at once., Add the butter and sugar into the large mixing bowl or the bowl of the stand mixer. Cream them together on medium for five to 10 minutes, until the mixture becomes smooth and fluffy.One at a time, crack each egg into the small mixing bowl and give it a whisk. Then add each egg to the butter and sugar mixture and continue beating until all the eggs have been incorporated., Combine the flour and cinnamon in the medium bowl. Then, add them to the wet ingredients in three separate batches, mixing on medium speed until the flour is completely incorporated.


Add in the vanilla and almond extract, and beat the mixture until everything is combined and the batter is smooth. If necessary, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spoon and give the batter one final stir., Once added, use a spoon to fold them into the batter until the fruit is evenly distributed. Then, add the baking powder and mix just enough to combine. Divide the batter evenly between the two cake pans and get them into the oven immediately.Browning is a burnt sugar sauce that’s often used in West Indian cooking. It has a similar consistency to molasses, and can be found in West Indian grocery stores., Bake them for 45 minutes before checking on them. Keep a close eye on the cakes after 45 minutes, because you will have to stick around and continue smelling the air to make sure they aren't burning.


The cakes may need up to 70 minutes. They are ready when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean., Remove the cakes from the oven when they have finished baking. Set them aside and allow them to cool to a little above room temperature.


While the cakes are still warm, poke several holes into the tops with a toothpick or skewer. Ladle 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of the rum and wine mixture over the cakes.
When the cake is room temperature, cover it with plastic wrap or place it into a lidded cake tin and leave it over night.
In the morning, poke more holes into the cake and ladle another 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of the rum and wine mixture over it. Repeat again that same evening.

, After the final ladle of rum and wine, the cakes are ready to serve. Be careful that nobody plans to drive after eating a piece, as the alcohol content is much higher than with regular cakes!


Store leftover cake in a sealed container, lidded cake tin, or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.
Add more wine and rum mixture before serving leftovers if the cake is starting to dry out.,"

",How to Make Cake Batter Brownies,";
, Using a pastry brush, spread melted butter over your baking pan.

, In a mixing bowl, stir the cake mix, egg, and vegetable oil together with a rubber spatula or whisk. Take caution not to over-mix as this causes your brownies to be rubbery.

, Milk is the key ingredient to this recipe, because the amount you put will determine the moistness of your brownies. Too much milk will cause the brownies to come out tasting more like a cake. Mix again with the rubber spatula. The batter should be slightly thick but still liquid.

, The tasty and colorful part! Pour both ingredients in your batter and mix until well-combined.

, Scrape any remaining batter with a rubber spatula. Lightly sprinkle some more sprinkles on top.

, The edges should be brown when your brownies are ready.

, This step is extremely important and should not be skipped. Immediately after you take your brownies out, do not slice them, instead give them the time to cool. Your brownies should still be slightly gooey right after they come out of the oven.

, Use a knife to cut the brownies into squares. They are ready to serve.

Place the mug on a plate in the microwave.,
Microwave the brownie for 60 seconds.,
Eat the brownie when it is cooked to your liking.",How to Make Brownies in a Mug1," It shouldn't have any metal on it. In general, a simple, unadorned ceramic mug is going to work the best., Take the dry ingredients and blend them up well. Use a fork or a small whisk just to make sure they are evenly mixed and there are no large chunks.

, Don't worry if it doesn't completely mix in just yet -- you've still got the oil to add.

, You can use just about any cooking oil, but you want something that doesn't have a strong flavor. Vegetable and canola are often the best bets, but a light olive oil will do as well. You could even use coconut oil or butter, though you have to melt it before mixing it in., A fork or small whisk will do. Just mix it up until you see no more chunks of flour and cocoa. You want a nice, smooth batter., Depending on the size of the mug and the strength of the microwave, the brownie may spill over a bit when cooking. Place a plate under the mug to make your life easier during clean-up.

, Some brownies take a little less, some a little more. Start with 1 minute, then check the brownie with a fork to see if it hit your desired consistency. You can then keep cooking and checking in 30-second intervals until you have your perfect brownie.The consistency will be slightly molten and gooey, unlike a traditional brownie. Don't worry if it seems a little ""wet,"" this is by design., There is no reason you couldn't eat the batter raw, other than it wouldn't taste very good. So if you want a gooey, wet brownie, take it out a little early. If you want something firmer and more cake-like, add an extra 20-30 seconds to the timer. You can customize it however you like.

Whip in one egg for a richer brownie.,
Substitute brown sugar for granulated sugar to get a moister brownie.,
Add a pinch of spice.,
Toss in some chocolate chips before cooking for gooey chocolate chunks.,
Try out a handful of chopped nuts.,
Add a teaspoon of instant coffee for a Mocha Mug Brownie.",How to Make Brownies in a Mug2," Eggs provide a richer, thicker consistency, much more like a traditional brownie. To make sure it is cooked all the way, it is best to beat it before adding to the brownie mixture. Mix it in with the wet ingredients before combining with the dry.If you like your brownies moist and gooey, add at least 30 seconds to your planned cooking time to ensure the egg cooks. You just want the finished brownie to be firm.

, This generally keeps the brownie a little wetter. Classic white sugar, however, may make the brownie rise a little higher., A little dash of cinnamon goes great with chocolate. You can go even further with a quick dash of nutmeg, allspice, and or ground cloves for a winter spiced brownie. Even pumpkin spice mix can be delicious. You only need, however, a tiny bit of spice -- under a half teaspoon. It will go a long way.

, A few well-placed chocolate chips will melt partially while cooking. Use whatever chips you want -- dark, milk, white, etc. -- and simply fold them in after you've stirred up all the other ingredients.

, You'll only need a 1/4 cup or less. Toss them in after you've mixed up all the other ingredients and give them a quick stir to mix them in.

, Looking for a little kick? A quick dash of instant coffee will add a ton of flavor and touch of caffeine to get you going.Looking for even more coffee flavor? Use pre-brewed coffee instead of water in the batter."

",How to Make Brownies in the Microwave1," Smaller servings of microwave brownies can be made directly in a mug, but because you are working with such a large amount, you'll need to mix it in a separate bowl first.


If you are vegan, mix 2 tablespoons (14 grams) of flaxseed meal with 5 tablespoons (74 milliliters) of water in a small dish. Wait 5 minutes for it to thicken, then add to the recipe.If you are using the vegan option, consider adding ½ to 1 teaspoon (2.5 to 5 grams) of baking soda as well. This will help make the brownies more tender.;
, Melt ½ cup (115 grams) of butter before adding it to the bowl. The melted butter will help the ingredients mix together better, giving you a denser brownie in the end., Use a fork to break up any lumps, clumps, or chunks. Mixing these two ingredients separately will help them mix into the rest a little more evenly.

, There should be no lumps, clumps, or chunks when you are done. Be careful not to over-mix, however, or your brownies will end up too tough and chewy.


Consider adding 1 cup (125 grams) of chopped walnuts for a meatier texture.If you don't like walnuts, you can try another type of nuts, such as pecans or pistachios.

, The ideal size to work with is 8 by 8 by 2 inches (20.32 by 20.32 by 5.08 centimeters). For extra texture, scatter ½ cup (90 grams) of chocolate chips or chunks on top of the batter after you have poured it., After every minute, you will want to pause the microwave and rotate the baking dish. Keep cooking until there is a 1¼ inch (3.18 centimeters) wide moist spot in the center.


Cooking times will vary depending on the strength of your microwave. A 1,100-watt microwave will cook brownies in about 3 to 4 minutes., Don't worry if the top looks moist. The brownies will continue to cook on the inside even after you take them out., You can serve them as they are, or with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or hot fudge. If you love coffee, you might like your brownie with a scoop of coffee ice cream.

, (23 x 23 cm.) baking tray about an inch deep. You can also line the pan with aluminum foil, if you like.

, While this is melting, complete the next two steps. It should take about a minute or two for the butter to melt. It'll melt faster if you start off with it at room temperature.

, Pour the sugar and eggs into a medium-sized bowl and stir the ingredients together until they're fully incorporated. This should take about a minute. You can use a wooden spoon, a whisk, or even an electric mixer to stir the ingredients together.

, Now, pour these ingredients into a separate bowl and stir them until they are fully incorporated.

, Then, stir until the butter is well mixed in. This will make a nice, light yellow, creamy mixture.

, Just pour the ingredients into a sieve and gently shake it to let the air in while the cocoa mixture falls down into the egg mixture. You can even lightly scrap a fork along the bottom of the sieve to help sift the cocoa mixture.

, Now, you can mix in the chocolate chips into the rest of the ingredients. You can use regular chocolate chips, or cute mini chips if you prefer that. If you're feeling adventurous and want to mix things up, you can also go for the white chocolate chips. , Now that the tray is greased, it should be all ready for you to pour in the mixture. Use a flat plastic mixer or knife to even out the mixture. It doesn't have to be perfectly even, but try to distribute it around the pan as evenly as you can so that the brownies are of even height throughout. , After 25 minutes, keep checking on the brownies to make sure they don't burn. You can even clean up while you're waiting for your brownies to cook. If you hang around the kitchen while the brownies begin to harden, you'll be craving this sweet treat even more!

, Wait at least five minutes for the brownies to cool. This will also give them time to harden a bit. If you cut into them when they're still cooling, it'll be harder to cut them cleanly.

, You can cut tiny pieces, so you can devour them in one bite each. You can also cut larger brownies, so each portion is nice and hearty. It's up to you -- if you're making them for a large event, then the smaller, the better. But if you're just cooking for yourself and a few friends or family members, why not cut them to be a little bigger?


You can even top them with confectioner's sugar for an extra sweet taste.

, (2.5-5 cm.) of water into a medium saucepan. Heat up the water until it just reaches a simmer.

, Make sure the bowl is heat-safe. Stir the ingredients together until they're fully incorporated. You should rest the bowl over the simmering water to heat up the ingredients a bit and to make it easier to combine them and make the mixture nice and creamy. Continue to stir the ingredients until the mixture is nice and warm. Don't worry if it's still a little chunky; it'll get smoother after you add the flour and eggs.

, It should still be warm, but not hot, when you're ready to use it again.

, Use a spatula or wooden spoon to add the vanilla, which will impart a unique flavor to the brownies.

, Now, add the eggs to the mixture one at a time. Stir in the first one completely before you stir in the second. This should help the mixture become smoother.

, Now, stir the flour until you've fully incorporated it. This should take another minute or two at least. Your batter will be pretty thick, probably thicker than you're used to when you make brownies -- this is where the fudge-factor comes in.

, Stir in the walnuts, pecans, almonds, or any other kind of nuts you want to use. This is optional, but adds a nice kick to the brownies.

, Make sure to spread it evenly into the pan to create brownies that are all about the same thickness.

, After 18 or so minutes, start checking on the brownies. When they're ready, you should be able to put a toothpick into the center, making it come out nearly clean. If they aren't ready, even after the time limit, then keep baking them.

Make the most of your time while your oven heats by moving on in this recipe and preparing other parts of it. If your kitchen is especially hot, or if it is a particularly hot day, this can increase the temperature of your oven. In instances like these, use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature before baking.;
, Follow the directions on the box of your brownie mix for best results. In most cases, this involves mixing together oil, water, eggs, and brownie mix in a bowl with a whisk. Beat the mix thoroughly until it is smooth and consistent throughout.If you don’t have a whisk, you can use a fork in place of this kitchen implement, or you can improvise a whisk with chopsticks.

, Coat the baking sheet with thoroughly with a non-stick cooking spray. Position the bowl with the prepared mix over the baking sheet. Use a wooden spoon or similar kitchen implement to push the brownie mix onto the sheet.


You may need to use your wooden spoon to spread the brownie mix. The mix should be of even thickness., At this point, your oven should be finished preheating. Insert the baking sheet into the oven. Bake the brownies for about 28 to 30 minutes. When the edges are firm and the middle of the baked batter is set, your brownies are done baking. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool for one hour.A hot pan can cause heat damage to your counters and tabletops. Be sure you use potholders to prevent heat damage to your home.

, Use a knife to remove the hard edges of the brownie. These can be thrown away, eaten as a snack or desert, or used for another purpose. With your clean hands, crumble the remaining brownie into a large bowl.


Alternatively, crush up the hard edges into chunks. When you dip the brownie pops into chocolate later in the recipe, sprinkle these chunks onto the brownie pops for a richer brownie pop., Line a clean baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Use a cookie scoop to ball the brownies. Alternatively, use melon baller, ice cream scoop, or your clean hands. Place the balled brownie onto the lined baking sheet. Insert a lollipop stick into each balled brownie.


If using an ice cream scoop, be careful not to scoop too much of the brownie with it. Doing so may make pops that are too large to be supported by the lollipop stick., Freezing the brownie pops will help them maintain their shape while being dipped into chocolate. Failing to do so could result in your balled brownies breaking apart while adding the chocolate coating. Insert the pan with your balled brownie pops into the freezer for at least 2 hours., Add your dark chocolate to a microwave safe dish. Heat the chocolate at ½ power for 1 minute, then mix the chocolate. Continue heating the chocolate in the microwave 30 seconds at a time, stirring in in between heating intervals, until the chocolate is melty and smooth.


Heating the chocolate for a long interval will likely result in it bubbling. This could result in the inside of your microwave getting splashed with chocolate., Remove your brownie pops from the freezer. Dip each pop into the melted chocolate, then return them to the lined baking sheet. Insert the coated pops into the freezer and serve them when ready.


You may need to use a spoon to completely cover the pops in chocolate. Allow excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl to prevent the coating from overpowering the brownie.
If you’ve saved the hard edges of your brownie, crush these up now and sprinkle the hard brownie dust/crumbles over the chocolate coating while it’s still soft.
Your chocolate may thicken while your coating your pops. If this happens, return the chocolate to the microwave and heat the chocolate at short intervals until it is sufficiently melty., Before the chocolate coating has hardened, sprinkle chocolate chips onto the brownie pops. Mini chocolate chips work well for this. Alternate between white, dark, and milk chocolate chips to create variety in your pops.


Normal or large sized chocolate chips may not stick well to your brownie pops.

, While the chocolate coating is still sticky, sprinkle nuts over the pops to coat them. Full-sized nuts may not stick easily to the brownie pop coating. Use a food processor or a knife to chop the nuts into small pieces, and sprinkle these over your brownie pops.


So that people with nut allergies can still enjoy your brownie pops, separate the pops in half. Sprinkle nuts on one half and keep the other plain. Keep the two separate to prevent cross contamination.

, Finely shredded coconut should easily stick to the coating while it is still soft. You may only want to coat a portion of your brownie pops in coconut shavings. Some individuals may not like this topping.

, Sprinkles are an ideal topping for brownie pops. They’re small enough that they’ll stick to the chocolate coating with little effort, so long as the coating is still sticky. Dust the brownie pops with sprinkles as desired.


Alternatively, fill a small mixing bowl with sprinkles. After dipping the brownie pop in chocolate, allow excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl with melted chocolate. Roll the coated brownie pop in the sprinkles to cover it with them."

Stir the flower and salt together.,
Cut in the butter.,
Add the milk and water.,
Form your loaf.",How to Make Damper1," To start, use a whisk or a fork to stir together the flour and salt. Keep stirring until you have an even mixture free of lumps. This should not take long as you do not have a lot of dry ingredients., If you have a pastry blender, use this to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. If you don't, you can simply use your fingers. Make sure you wash your hands first.Use the pastry cutter or your fingers to gently mash the butter into the flour.
Do not expect the butter to mix like it would if you were, say, creaming butter and sugar. There is not enough butter to mix completely with the flour. When you're done cutting in the butter, your dough should resemble fine crumbs., Use a spoon to carve out a small well in the center of the flour mixture. Gradually pour in your milk and water into the center of this well. Use the spoon to stir the flour, water, butter, and milk together.Keep stirring until you have an even mixture. When you're done, everything should be mixed uniformly together. You should be able to easily handle and form the dough.

, Lightly dust a surface, such as plate or cutting board, with flour. Set your dough in the center of this surface.Wash your hands then then form your dough into a loaf. You want to form a circular loaf of bread that's about 8 inches across.
Take sharp knife. Use it to cut a criss-cross pattern across the top of your loaf of bread.

Fill the muffin tins.,
Bake for 22 to 27 minutes.,
Let cool.",How to Make Brownies Without Eggs1," Preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC). Grease eight muffin tins with cooking spray or line them with parchment. Compared to a baking pan, the muffin tins will help the brownies cook more evenly, instead of leaving them gooey in the middle.;
, Grind the seeds in a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle until they form a fine powder. Measure 2 tbsp (10 mL) of the ground flax seeds for the next step. If you're grinding a larger batch in advance, store the rest in an airtight container in the freezer.


Do not buy pre-ground flax seeds. Flax oil turns rancid quickly once the seeds are ground., Take the ground flax seeds and stir it into 5 tbsp (75 mL) water. Set aside to rest for at least five minutes while you move on to the next step. This will thicken into a binding gel roughly equivalent to two eggs., Stir together the following ingredients in a large bowl: ¾ tsp (3.5 mL) baking powder, ½ cup (120 mL) cocoa powder, ¾ cup (90g) all purpose flour, ¾ cup (150g) sugar, and ¼ tsp (1 mL) salt.


Dutch processed cocoa powder will create a denser brownie with a more intense chocolate flavor.Natural cocoa powder (anything not labeled ""Dutch processed"") is a safer bet, since vegan brownies already tend to be denser than recipes that contain eggs.

, Pastry flour should have an even more significant effect., Stir together 7 tbsp (100g) margarine, ¼ cup (40g) semisweet chocolate chips, and 1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla extract. Microwave for 30 seconds at a time, stirring well after each interval. Stop once the ingredients are mostly melted, usually after about 2 minutes.A few lumps of chocolate are fine.

, Stir the flax mixture into the wet ingredients, then mix in the dry ingredients in stages until fully combined. The batter may be thicker than you're used to with normal brownie recipes.

, Scoop the batter into the muffin tins, pressing down with a spoon to smooth it out. Leave a little room at the top for the brownies to rise.

, Bake on the middle rack of the oven. After the 22 minute mark, test with a toothpick or fork. When it comes out with just a few crumbs, the brownies are done. These brownies do not burn easily, but overcooking them can make them dry and crumbly.

, Wait at least ten minutes for the brownies to cool, or they'll collapse when you try to remove them. Once cool, remove all the brownies before they harden onto the pan.

Serve the warm crumpets with your topping.",How to Make Crumpets,";
, Stir in the remaining lukewarm water.

,, This will take around one to one and a half hours.

, Then, cover the bowl again and let stand for 15 to 20 minutes.

,,,


Remember: the amount of batter you will need to make a crumpet depends on the size of your crumpet ring. Aim to get the crumpet to a thickness of about ¾ of an inch.

, If holes do not form on the crumpet-to-be, add a little more warm water - one tablespoon at a time - to the batter in the bowl and try again. If the batter is too runny and leaks out under from underneath the ring, work in a little more all-purpose flour and try again. Once the batter is at the right consistency, cook the crumpets in batches of three.

, When the crumpet's top is covered with holes (this should take around seven minutes) it is ready to be flipped. To flip a crumpet, remove the ring using tongs, and then flip the crumpet with a spatula.

, Remove the crumpet from the griddle.

, You can go for a hot topping - like melted cheese or butter - or something colder like jam, or marmalade. If you're making the crumpets for more than just yourself, it's a good idea not to put the toppings on the actual crumpet but let the other people serve themselves - not everyone may enjoy marmite covered crumpets, after all.

, Blend extra-firm, silken tofu in a blender or food processor until there are no chunks or signs of graininess. You'll probably need to add a little of the melted butter or a little water to get it to blend smoothly.Blend in pulses to avoid overheating your blender.


You'll need approximately 10 grams of solid tofu to make ½ cup (120 mL) liquid tofu.

, Stir ½ cup (120 mL) cocoa powder into the butter until it dissolves. Next, stir in 1 cup (200g) sugar until lit forms a thick mixture.

, Gradually stir in ½ cup (120 mL) pureed silken tofu, 2 tsp (10 mL) vanilla essence, and ¼ tsp (1 mL) salt. Finally, mix in ½ cup (60g) flour until the batter is homogenous.


Optionally, stir in ½ cup (120 mL) chopped nuts as well.

, Grease an 8"" x 8"" (20 x 20 cm) pan, or line with parchment paper. This is a thick batter, so you'll need to spoon it onto the pan instead of pouring it. Spread the batter with the back of a large spoon until it's pressed against the edges and has a smooth surface.

, Even if the brownies don't seem completely cooked, you may want to remove them at this point to prevent the surface drying out. The brownies will continue to cook for a short time after they are removed.

, It can take two or three hours before the pan cools down. The brownies may fall apart if you try to slice them while the pan is still hot. To speed up the cooling, place the pan on top of a sturdy wire rack.

Start with a box of brownie mix.,
Replace the eggs with simple substitutes.,
Consider adding a rising agent.,
Try a quick brownie mix recipe instead.",How to Make Brownies Without Eggs3," If you're avoiding eggs for dietary reasons — and not just because your fridge is understocked — check the brownie mix ingredients first. Some brownie mixes contain whey or other dairy products not suitable for vegans. Less commonly, some brands include egg whites.

, The easiest option is to follow the recipe printed on the box. For each egg in the recipe, replace it with one of the following:


1 tbsp (15 mL) finely ground flax seeds, mixed into 3 tbsp (45 mL) water and allowed to thicken for five minutes.¼ cup (60 mL) plain nonfat yogurt (or soy yogurt for a vegan recipe)An egg replacement product, available at health food stores

, Eggs are complex ingredients. While most egg substitutes can replace the moisture and the ability to hold the batter together, they do not form the same foaming structure that eggs do. Try adding ½ tsp (2.5 mL) baking powder to the mix to create a slightly airier batter and avoid a dense, collapsed brownie.


This is a ballpark figure, since brownie mixes come in many different recipes. You may need to experiment with adding more.

, If you don't want to worry about all these egg substitutes, you can skip the recipe on the box and go with a two-ingredient recipe instead. Here are a couple options which may sound strange, but which end up working pretty well:


Open a can of black beans (~15 oz). Drain and rinse well to reduce salt, fill can with water, and blend until you don't see any bean skins. Mix with a box of brownie mix (~20 oz) and bake on a greased pan until a toothpick comes out mostly clean.Combine a can of pumpkin puree (~15 oz) with a box of brownie mix (~20 oz).

, The best type of bread to use for this is something that is slightly stale with a thick crust, such as: boule, ciabatta, and sourdough.Try to make your pieces about ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) wide.You can remove the crust if you want to, but many people choose to leave it on for texture and variation. Here are some ways you can cut your croutons:If you want standard croutons, cut the bread into slices first, then into cubes.
If you want something rustic, simply tear your bread into small chunks.
If you want French croutons, cut a baguette into ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) thick slices.

, If you want something simple, a teaspoon or two of salt will do. If you want something more flavorful, try adding some fresh or dried herbs.


If you wish to make Parmesan cheese or fresh herb croutons, hold off on the cheese/herbs for right now; you will add them later., Keep tossing until the bread pieces are evenly coated.If you are making French croutons, use a pastry brush to lightly coat each side with the oil mixture instead., Make sure that the croutons are not touching, or they may end up soggy. If you can't fit all of the croutons onto one baking sheet, divide them between two baking sheets. If you have a small oven, you will need to bake the croutons on different levels, then rotate the baking sheets after 5 minutes so that they bake evenly.

, Depending on how stale the bread was and the size you made the pieces, your croutons may be done after 10 minutes.If they aren't, toss them again, and bake them for another 5 minutes or so. Some croutons may take up to 20 minutes, especially if you like them extra-crunchy.If you are making French croutons, use a spatula or a pair of tongs to flip the croutons over.

, You want the bread pieces to be in a single layer. If you have small skillet, it might be a better idea to do this in several batches, otherwise the croutons might end up soggy., If you are using unsalted butter, you can add a pinch of salt at this time.

, Avoid stirring the bread during this time. You only need the bottom side to turn brown. Once it turns brown (or a light-golden color, if you prefer), you are ready for the next step.

, Once the bread pieces start to turn brown, use a metal spatula to turn them over.

, Decide which category you fall into. Here is how to tell what type of brownies the recipe makes:


Brown sugar, butter and egg yolks suggest it will be fudgy.
Egg whites and flour suggest it will be cakey.

, Gluten is present in all wheat flour but usually only activated by kneading. Shift flour for a lighter texture to your brownies. While taking care to mix lightly, ensure that the flour is evenly distributed through the mix to avoid powdery, floury mouthfuls.

, It is important to stick to the right temperature, baking tray and quantities because brownies are very delicate.


Find a recipe similar to the brownies you wish to create. For example, if you wish to added dried cranberries to your brownies, find a recipe that includes currants or raisins and substitute the cranberries for those ingredients.

, Don't worry about greasing the pan, as long as you can lift out the brownies you will be fine.

, Eggs, butter and other ingredients will mix into the batter better at room temperature. Mixing in melted butter also creates the risk of spoiling the chocolate, so take it out an hour before you need it. , Using a food processor or electric beater will make the mixture stodgy and increases the incorporation of air. For dense and fudgy brownies, use a wooden spoon. , Add some cocoa powder or chocolate chips for a bigger flavor kick. You could even add some vanilla extract for even more flavor.

, Place the tray of raw brownie mixture into the refrigerator and allow it to chill for a few hours, so when the brownies bake, it will make the center fudgy with crispy edges. , There is nothing worse than a dry brownie.


Use parchment paper: Using paper underneath can not only help with the brownies not sticking, but avoid over-browning on the base. Ensure the mixture is even. In order for brownies to cook consistently, the mixture must be level. Use a spoon dipped in hot water to spread out the batter neatly.
Take out when still soft. Brownies firm as they cool, so toothpicks should come out moist.
Cook to the right consistency. Brownies should be firm and sticky. To check, when you put a skewer it should come out with moist bits.
Cook them for longer. Cook them for an extra ten minutes for a crunchy crust.
Get to know your recipe: Sometimes it just takes experience to make a perfectly cooked brownie.

, Dried and fresh fruits work well, but stick to combinations you know such as cherries, prunes, pears, raspberries, raisins or dates.

, Nuts provide add a delicious, crunchy flavor bite to brownies. Toast and chop up a handful of your favorite variety and add it to the mix.

, Use your imagination and get inspiration for your other favorite sweet treats to come up with a unique brownie flavor. Here are some delicious twists to try:


Rocky Road: Combine shredded coconut, glacé cherries, marshmallows and peanuts into the brownies.
S'mores: Add some marshmallow topping and broken graham crackers on top for an authentic campfire experience.
Peppermint: Throw in some hard, crushed peppermint lollies with the batter and then spread some green peppermint icing on top.
Chai: Stir in cardamom and ginger into batter, then press on melted marshmallows, butter, pepper and crisp rice cereal.
Popcorn: Stir in roast peanuts into batter and press caramel popcorn on top.
Peanut Butter: Stir in peanut butter and top cooked brownies with creamed peanut butter, then top with banana chips.

, Spices like cinnamon, ginger, chilli and chai spices work great.

, Half the mixture, add a filling and top the remaining mixture. Caramel, peanut butter and cream cheese work well.

, Adding coffee to brownies really brings out the chocolate flavor. Just add a few tablespoons of freshly brewed coffee.

, Add a few of your favorite chocolates and pour the remaining batter on top.

, Throw some into the batter, then splash some on top. Try chocolate liquor, Bailey's Irish cream, or use peppermint schnapps.

, Work in some jam, peanut butter, cream cheese or whatever you can think of into the prepared batter. Use your common sense, condiments like salt, pepper and ketchup do not taste good with brownies.

, Invent new flavor combinations or put in additions you know already go well with chocolate, for example, pretzels or bacon.

, Brownies aren't diet friendly, but here a few recipe alters to help your waistline:


Use different flours. Most recipes call for white flour, but since they don't need to rise, substitute healthy alternatives such as wholemeal and spelt.
Use cocoa power. Find a recipe which uses cocoa powder instead of chocolate, cocoa powder is much less sweet, but still provides a strong chocolate flavor.
Use dark chocolate. Aim for a minimum of 75% cocoa in the chocolate, it means the chocolate will have less sugar and a stronger chocolate taste.
Add healthy additions. Most people add chocolate chips and caramel, but be bold and add something healthy such as nuts, dried fruit and fresh fruit.
Substitute unhealthy ingredients. Cut down the sugar and replace it with some fruit or try oil instead of butter.

, You could even put them in the freezer for a few minutes to make them even firmer to cut.

, Place the brownies in the fridge or briefly in the freezer for a more fudge-like slice.

, Putting brownies in the microwave for half a minute will make them soft and piping hot.

, Try giving them to dusting of cocoa, a touch of salt, a coating of icing sugar. You could also top hot brownies with chocolate chips and let them melt on or cover the brownies with your favorite frosting.

, Try serving with melted white chocolate, ganache, maple syrup or thick caramel sauce.

, Slice a brownie in the middle and add ice cream in between.

, Chop up a few brownies into chunks and add them into ice cream, cheesecake or even more brownie batter.

, Brownies are finger food, but when added to cream, berries and roasted fruits, this becomes a third course.

, In a separate, smaller bowl, combine ½ stick (57 g) of butter that’s been softened so it’s almost melting with 1 to 2 cloves of minced garlic. Blend together until the mixture is smooth.To soften the butter, cut it into small pieces and place it in a microwave-safe bowl. Start heating it at 10% power in the microwave for intervals of 20 seconds until it just starts to melt.If you don’t have fresh garlic, you can substitute for the cloves with ⅛ to ¼ teaspoon (approximately 1 g) of garlic powder., Once the butter and garlic are combined, stir them into the cheese mixture. You’ll wind up with an extremely thick paste-like texture, but blend well so all of the flavors are combined.A wooden spoon or a spatula works best for mixing the butter mixture and the cheese mixture together.
You can add other toppings to the cheesy bread’s spread, such as chopped black olives or chopped artichoke hearts.

, After you’ve combined the topping ingredients, make sure that your oven is ready for the bread. Preheat the broiler in your oven. In most cases, the broiler heating element is at the top of the oven, so place the oven rack in the highest position.Most broiler controls are separate from the oven temperature settings, so make sure that you set your oven correctly.

, Take a loaf of long crusty bread, such as Italian or French, and slice it in half lengthwise. Line a cookie sheet or baking pan with foil, and place the two halves of the bread, crust side down, on the sheet. Use a spatula to spread the cheese mixture over both pieces of bread until completely covered.You can use any type of bread that you like. Just make sure that it’s thick enough to support the weight of the topping spread.

, When both slices of bread are covered in the cheese spread, place the cookie sheet under the broiler. Allow the bread to broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese melts and starts to brown.It usually helps the broiling process if you leave the oven door slightly ajar while you broil the bread. Check your oven’s instructions to see if that’s recommended for your model.

, Once the bread is finished broiling, allow it to sit for approximately 5 minutes or until it’s cool enough to handle. Use a bread knife to slice the two halves into pieces for serving."

Grill for approximately 10 minutes.,
Let the bread cool before cutting it.",How to Make Cheesy Bread2," To ensure that your grilled cheesy bread cooks properly, it’s important to preheat the grill. Set the temperature gauge to medium high heat. It usually takes 10 to 15 minutes for the grill to reach your desired heat, so plan ahead.Make sure to keep the grill’s lid closed while you’re preheating. That will allow it to reach the right temperature more quickly.

, Take a loaf of long, crusty bread, such as a French baguette, and cut it half lengthwise with a bread knife. Spread 4 tablespoons (57 g) of softened butter over the two pieces, and then sprinkle with 2 garlic cloves that have been minced.The best way to soften butter is to set it out at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

, Take the bottom piece of bread, and cover it with ½ cup (50 g) mozzarella cheese and ½ cup (50 g) fontina cheese. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil over the cheese, and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) red pepper flakes.If you don’t like the heat that comes with red pepper flakes, you can omit them or replace them with another seasoning, such as parsley or green onion.

, Place the top piece of bread over the cheese-covered bottom as if forming a sandwich. Take a sheet of foil, and wrap the entire loaf of bread so all of the ingredients are contained inside., Place the foil wrapped bread on the heated grill, and allow it to cook until the cheese melts and the bread becomes toasted. That usually takes about 10 minutes.Be sure to check the bread often. It’s okay if it gets a little charred, but you want to avoid allowing it to actually burn.

, When the bread is finished grilling, allow it to sit in the foil for a minute. Next, unwrap the bread and allow it to cool for about 5 minutes or until you can handle it comfortably. Use a bread knife to slice the loaf crosswise for serving."

Set it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) to preheat.Pay attention to your oven so you know when it’s reached the right temperature. It should beep or turn on an indicator light when it’s fully heated.

, Take a loaf of bread, and use a bread knife to slice it horizontally and vertically in a checkerboard pattern without cutting all the way through the bread. The goal is to create 1-inch (2.54 cm) cubes across the top of the bread that are still connected to the bottom so the loaf remains intact.You want to choose an artisan bread that has a crunchy crust and some holes in its interior. Round loaves typically look more impressive, but you can also use an oblong-shaped batard or a flat loaf of ciabatta.
If any pieces of bread come loose while you’re cutting, don’t worry. Just stick them back inside, and once the cheese melts over them, no one will be able to tell that they’re loose.

, In a bowl, toss together 1 ½ to 2 cups (150 to 200 g) of Monterey Jack, mozzarella, provolone, swiss, cheddar, or some combination of cheese with your chosen mix-ins. You can add ½ cup (50 g) chopped green onions or chives, ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) red pepper flakes, ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) chili powder, and/or 1 cup (80 g) cooked, crumbled bacon or sausage, depending on your preference.While one of the cheeses that you use should be a melting cheese, such as mozzarella or swiss, you can also add in cheeses that don’t melt as easily, such as blue cheese or brie.

, When you’ve mixed the cheese and your other fillings, begin placing the mixture in the sliced bread. First add the cheese between the vertical cuts, and then add it between the horizontal cuts.It can help to have someone hold the bread cubes apart while you stuff the cheese between them.

, Transfer the stuffed bread to a piece of foil, and drizzle the top of it ¼ cup (57 g) unsalted butter that’s been melted. Work slowly so you can be sure to spread the butter evenly over the entire loaf.It’s usually easiest to melt the butter in a microwave. Cut it into pieces and place them in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave it on medium (50% power) for 30 second intervals until it’s completely melted., Fold the foil around the bread, so the entire loaf is tightly wrapped. Place the bread in oven and bake for 20 minutes. Unwrap the top of the bread and allow it to bake for another 10 minutes, or until the cheese melts completely and the top of the bread is toasted.Don’t remove the foil from the bread entirely, or cheese may wind up melting onto the oven rack and bottom.

, When the cheese is completely melted, remove the bread from the oven. Remove the foil, and place it on a plate. Serve to your guests while it’s still hot. There's no need to cut it because they can just pull at the individual cubes to tear off their piece(s)."

Pour the scalded milk on top of the dry ingredients, then stir or whisk the contents together until smooth.To prepare the scalded milk, heat it on the stove or in the microwave until small bubbles form around the edge of the dish. Steam may develop, but you should not allow the milk to reach a rolling boil. Allow the milk to cool to a lukewarm temperature before adding it to the dry ingredients.;
, Cover the jar and let it stand for 8 to 12 hours in a warm place away from any drafts.


Ideally, the starter should be kept at a temperature around 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).
Place the jar in your oven with the heat off, but turn the oven light on. Note that you may need to turn the light on up to two hours ahead of time to get the oven adequately warm.
Alternatively, try wrapping a kitchen towel around the jar and placing it in a paper bag. Keep the wrapped jar in the warmest part of your kitchen., Once the starter develops bubbly foam and a pungent fermented odor, transfer it to a medium mixing bowl. Add the 2 cups (500 ml) of warm water and 1-1/2 cups (375 ml) of flour, then stir until smooth.


At this stage, the starter should have the consistency of a thin pancake batter.

, Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap and return it to the warm place used previously. Allow the starter to rise for another 2 hours.


The starter needs to maintain the same warm temperature it previously had. It should bubble and nearly double in volume.

, Transfer the starter to larger bowl, then add 1 cup (250 ml) of warm water and about 2-1/2 cups (425 ml) of flour. Mix the ingredients until a stiff dough forms.


You may need to vary the amount of flour by 1/2 cup (125 ml) either way to achieve the right consistency.
Knead the dough in the bowl until it becomes soft and elastic.

, Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a small loaf pan with cooking spray, then shape the dough into a loaf and set it inside.


Use an 8-1/2 inch by 4-1/2 inch (21.5 cm by 11.5 cm) loaf pan.

, Return the dough to the previously used warm spot and allow it to rise for another 3 hours, or until it climbs about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) above the top of the pan.


Near the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).

, Place the pan in your preheated oven and allow the bread to bake until it turns light golden brown in color.


Note that the bread typically won't rise much as it bakes.
If you gently tap on the outer crust, the bread should have a slight hollow sound once it's ready.

, Remove the bread from the oven and turn it out onto a cooling rack after about 5 minutes. Serve the bread once it becomes cool enough to handle.


You should be able to stare this bread at room temperature for about a week or in the refrigerator for two weeks. You can also freeze it for long-term storage.

Serve.",How to Make Bread Without Yeast2,"


If desired, you could lightly coat the baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray instead of using parchment paper. Aluminum foil can be used, as well, but the bottom of the bread may brown quicker with foil.

, In a large mixing bowl, stir the five ingredients together until evenly mixed.


You can substitute half to all of the oil with melted butter if you prefer the taste. Other cooking oils, like canola oil, may also be used instead of standard vegetable oil.
Press on the yolk of the egg with the mixing spoon to break it before mixing the ingredients. Doing so will make it easier to blend the yolk into the rest of the mixture.

, Add the flour to the rest of the ingredients 1 cup (250 ml) at a time, mixing well after each addition to fully incorporate the flour. Continue until you've blended in at least 4 cups (1 L) of flour, then knead the flour in the bowl until it forms a stiff, cohesive, and elastic dough.


Bread flour and all-purpose flour will both work for this recipe, but note that bread flour will create a denser product.
You can add up to 5 cups (1.25 L) of flour total if the dough seems too sticky with less, but adding too much can make the dough too dense.

, Then, separate each half in half again, forming quarters. Divide each quarter into three equally sized balls.


Alternatively, you can separate the dough into three or four large portions and cut these portions down to size after rolling the dough flat. Either option will work, so stick with whichever feels easiest for you.

, Pat each ball of dough in between your hands, forming it into a flat patty. To make the dough even thinner, roll these patties out using a lightly floured rolling pin.


Your hands should be lightly coated with flour, oil, or cooking spray before you handle the dough. Otherwise, the dough will likely stick to your fingers, creating a mess.
If working with large portions instead of individual portions, you'll need to use the rolling pin.
Ideally, the dough should be rolled out to a thickness of about 1/4 inch (6 mm), but you can leave the dough as thick as about 3/4 inch (2 cm) if desired. Note that thicker bread requires a longer cooking time, however.

, Using the tines of a regular fork, poke even rows of holes across the surface of each dough portion, leaving no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between rows.


If you left the dough in large portions, use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to divide the dough into about 12 evenly sized rectangles at this time.

, Bake the bread for about 10 to 11 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges and over the surface.


If the bread is 1/4 inch (6 mm) thin, it should be ready within 10 to 11 minutes. For bread 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick, bake it for about 13 to 14 minutes. Bread as thick as 3/4 inch (2 cm) may need 15 to 20 minutes.
Watch the bread carefully as it bakes. If it cooks for too long, it can easily become hard and unpleasant.

, Remove the finished bread from the oven and transfer it to wire racks until cooled to room temperature. Enjoy it while it's fresh for the best flavor.


You should be able to store this bread in an airtight container or plastic bag for several days.

Serve.",How to Make Bread Without Yeast3," Meanwhile, prepare a 9-inch by 5-inch (23-cm by 13-cm) loaf pan by lightly greasing the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray or shortening.


Alternatively, you can use two 8-inch by 4-inch (20-cm by 10-cm) loaf pan. Make sure that the total loaf pan volume can hold 8 cups (2 L).To further prevent sticking, consider lightly dusting the bottom of the pan with a little flour after greasing it.
You may also use parchment paper, but using aluminum foil since the foil can cause quicker browning and uneven cooking for this recipe.

, In a large bowl, mix together the flour and sugar until evenly combined.


Depending on your personal sense of taste and the lemon-lime soda used, you may need to alter the amount of sugar. If you have a notably sweet soda or prefer blander bread, cut the sugar back by 1 Tbsp (15 ml). If you have a mild soda or strongly prefer very sweet bread, consider adding another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sugar.

, Lightly knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together.


Note that the dough will likely be somewhat lumpy.Do not attempt to knead out all the lumps since over-mixing the dough can cause problems with the finished texture.
For a blander bread, consider using club soda instead of lemon-lime soda.
You can experiment further by using different flavors of carbonated soda, but each different flavor will have a different effect on the final taste of the bread.

, Transfer the dough into your prepared loaf pan. Use your hands to spread it out evenly over the entire pan. Pat on the top surface to flatten it out.


If using two loaf pans instead of one, evenly divide the dough between the two.

, Place the filled loaf pan in the oven and bake the bread until the top turns light golden-brown. This will usually happen after 45 minutes, but some ovens may require additional bake time.

, Remove the finished bread from the oven. After 10 minutes, remove the loaf from the pan and allow it to continue cooling on a wire rack. Enjoy slightly warm to room temperature.


The finished bread will be somewhat crumbly and chewy, with a flavor somewhat reminiscent of homestyle biscuits. You can slice it thin or thick.

In a mixing bowl, or the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients to make a dough; everything but the egg wash and the optional ingredients -- you don't want to knead your mix-ins to a pulp!,

Voilà!",How to Make Brioche," Mix slowly for at least 10 minutes or until it is smooth and elasticized. The dough will be very weak and moist. For a brioche, weak and moist is exactly how you want it.


This is quite a wet dough, so a mixer makes the job easier; however if mixing by hand, mix everything in the bowl except the butter until it comes together and tip it onto a clean surface. Crumble the butter onto the dough and using the heel of the palm of your hand, gently push the dough and butter together until the dough is formed. 
Fold the dough like you would make a book fold in puff pastry will give a little extra strength to the dough, but it will remain a very soft dough.

Refrain from adding extra flour to make it come together quickly as that will reduce the quality of the loaf - a little light dusting of the surface is ideal.

;
, To proof a dough basically means to coat the dough in oil, cover it with plastic wrap or a wet cloth and let it sit to rise in a warm place.

, Punch holes in it to deflate it, and knead it again for just a minute or two, lifting a section of the dough and then letting it fall back.


Add any optional flavourings at this stage. Zest of an orange can add tang to your bread that nicely compliments the sweetness. Cranberries, chocolate chips, or nuts work well, too. A plain brioche is definitely a classic, c'est très Français!


, This is the second rising stage, and you want it to reach double in size once more. This may take up to 8 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator. Brioche has been known to rise swiftly or very slowly, depending on the warmth of the dough and freshness and variety of the yeast. To be safe, refrigerate the dough overnight.


Use a covered container -- cover with either plastic wrap, a wet cloth, or both.
After this stage, you can freeze your dough if you need to use it at a later date. Just wrap it up tightly in plastic wrap and place it in the freezer. The sooner you use it, the better it'll be.

, If your oven cooks over or under, be sure to adjust -- an overcooked brioche is not a friend to your palette.

, To eliminate any need for clean up, line your tin with wax paper -- it also eliminates sticking and tearing; the dough will be very tender. Due to the high moisture content, its usually best to bake in a tin, such as the traditional brioche mould, although if you bake on a lined biscuit tray, shaping the dough into small balls or a ring (like a very large bagel) is recommended.

, Lightly brush the top of the loaf with the mixture until it's covered in a light film of liquid. This will make your brioche look like restaurant fare --it will be golden and beautiful when it has been baked.


If you want a richer egg wash, use heavy cream instead of milk.

, Check with a skewer like you would test a cake when you think your brioche is finished. Learn how to test completion here: test a cake to see if it is done. The dough will make a dark red-brown crust; if this is undesirable, cover loosely with foil after the crust has formed to prevent it from browning any further.

,


Brioche is best served warm, or cold with jam or butter, tea, coffee or hot chocolate. But it's still delicious plain and remains fresh for a few days! Keep it in an air-tight container for storage.

,, If you have a mini brioche tin, even better. Since brioche is so tender, make sure you grease all sides. A baking pan also works; just make sure your rolls have enough room to rise and expand.

,


Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the tops of the brioche rolls. Using cream instead of milk will give you a creamier, richer glaze, but milk is just fine.

, Using kitchen scissors, cut small snips into the dough to decorate it. This is optional, of course! Standard rolls will be just as tasty.


If you'd like, top each roll with a pinch of fleur de sel.

, You'll know they're done when the tops spring back and it sounds hollow when you tap it. They should also be deep golden on top and lighter on the bottom. If you're unsure, stick a toothpick in one and if it comes out clean, you're good to go.

, Give your rolls 5 or so minutes in the pan to cool down, then remove them onto a wire rack to finish cooling. If you're not going to be eating them right away, store them in an air-tight container.

, Brioche can be complimented well with a cup of cocoa, tea, or coffee and can be enjoyed with just about anything -- but it's truly tasty just by itself.

Prepare your bread dough.,
Shape bread according to the following methods and bake accordingly.",How to Shape and Decorate Bread Before Baking1," If you are making the dough from scratch follow this basic method: Mix the sugar, water and yeast together and allow to sit for 5 minutes for the yeast to activate. If it doesn't, the yeast may be too old so a fresh sachet should be added to fresh water and sugar. Once the yeast is active, mix with the flour and salt and knead heavily (no need to be gentle) for 5–10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and when the dough is pulled, it is smooth and elastic.


Allow to prove at least one hour in a warm place. Once doubled or tripled in size, deflate the dough; punching or flattening it and then kneading again for a few more minutes to distribute the yeast.
If using a mixing machine, follow the same method. A food processor work fine, but ideally mix the dough by hand and then process in batches so as not to overfill and overload the processor.
If the dough is too wet, add a little more flour. Flour absorbency varies according to variety and time of year.

, For best results, use a pizza stone or line your oven tray with unglazed thick terracotta tiles, preheating the oven to around 220C / 435F before baking.


Keep a close eye on the bread while it bakes as all ovens vary. If it browns too quickly, turn it down, but ideally you want a nice russet brown crust for good flavour.

Recognize unleavened bread's importance as an element of Passover in the Bible.,
Celebrate Biblical history with your unleavened bread by recognizing the seven Days of Unleavened bread.,
Finished.

",How to Make Unleavened Bread2,"


The day after the Passover became the First Day of Unleavened Bread, the beginning of seven Days of Unleavened Bread. The first and seventh days of this stretch were considered holy, and believers would congregate and give offerings to God.

,


This period of time was so sacred that the Israelis had to rid their homes and properties of any leaven during the time. Those who considered themselves people of God were required to eat unleavened bread every day of the seven-day stretch.

Divide the dough into two halves.,
Roll out the dough.,
Proof the dough until doubled in size.,
Bake the Bread.,
Transfer the loaf into the oven (you may slide it onto a flour lined tray or baking peel) and splash a little water in the oven bottom to generate steam.",How to Shape and Decorate Bread Before Baking2," Press the dough with the heel of your palm into a rectangle roughly 20-25cm or 8-10 inches long. Fold this dough in half (width-wise) and press to seal. Fold again in half to make a long loaf. Find the seam and pinch it shut if it seems open.;
, Using your palms, start at the middle and roll the dough outwards. The bread should end up a little fatter in the middle and thinner at the ends. The seams should be well sealed, otherwise pinch them shut again.


The loaf should be about 40-50cm or so long, ideally longer if your oven may permit its size. In practice, do not roll out a loaf bigger than you can bake.

, Use a floured linen or cotton tea towel, or use a baguette mould. If using a cloth, place the loaf seam side up (so the good side is face down) and pleat the cloth to support the bread and leave in a warm place. Repeat with the other half of the dough if desired or make other shapes.


To apply sesame seeds, poppy seeds or other grains (which are not traditional on French style Baguettes, mist the top of the dough with a spray bottle of water and roll the baguette gently into a tray that has the seeds spread into it before you place it on the cloth or baking tray. This gives a more even coating than sprinkling by hand.

, When it has proofed and ready to bake, gently turn the bread over (so it is now good side up) and use a sharp razor blade to slash the bread very gently on a regular diagonal pattern 4–5 times.


Kitchen knives are typically too blunt to do this well. Cut only a millimetre or so into the bread.

, Close the door quickly and bake 20-25 minutes, turn off the oven but leave them in for another 10-15 to further form their crust.


You may also use this method to make a long very thin loaf, which you may then cut up (or divide the dough up into smaller loaves) to make thin bread sticks like the Italian grissini loaves.
You may also divide the 1kg dough into 10 portions and follow the same method to make hot dog rolls, or from hot dog rolls, press the two ends together to make a loop like a bagel.

Make the loaf.,

Bake for 40–45 minutes.",How to Shape and Decorate Bread Before Baking3," Follow the same method as Baguettes up to when the rectangle is rolled out and folded in half, once.

, Turn the cylinder of dough over and pinch the seam and gently roll with your hands from the middle out to make a shorter and fatter loaf. To make a Vienna loaf shape, the bread should be noticeably fatter in the middle and this is done using very light pressure applied to the ends of a round loaf so it makes an oval shape.

, Leave the bread seam side up for undecorated breads for at least an hour, or until doubled in size. Slash or carve an attractive pattern into the bread with a razor and bake.

, Follow the same method as baguettes, splashing a little water into the oven to generate steam. When cooked, the bread should be lightweight and sound hollow when tapped at the base. Leave in the switched off oven to further crisp if desired.

"
"
Gather the dough.,
Proof until doubled in size.,
Bake for 35–40 minutes.",How to Shape and Decorate Bread Before Baking4," Split in half to make 2 loaves or make 1 large loaf. Press the dough ball flat on the table in a round shape and form into a nice circle using one of the two methods:


For Beginners, its easier to start folding the edges of the dough and pressing them into them middle, turning and pleating the dough as you go. Once all the edges are pressed in, you typically will have a nice round loaf. Grip the centre seams and pinch them, then roll or rock the ball around the bench top to round the loaf's edges. The pinched side will end up the bottom of the loaf, so the good side is face down in this method.
For more practiced bakers, gather the dough and place your hand to the side of the dough, palm facing the dough. Press the side of the ball with the edge of your hand and press down, pushing it forward. The dough should rotate as you do this. With this method it stretches the dough after several repetitions into a nice round shape, with the good side up.

, With this bread, you may do a wide range of decorations with a razor, such as a spiral from the outside into the centre, diagonal slashes, diagonal slashes coming inwards like a vortex, a cross, a chequerboard, or a flower shape - such as on Galette Des Rois - or anything you desire.

, Tap the base of the load and it should sound hollow when cooked. If the dough feels heavy, leave it in the cooling oven for another 10-15 minutes.

"
"
Gather the dough.,
Roll each third into even Baguettes.,
Make a plait with the bread.,
Proof until doubled in size.",How to Shape and Decorate Bread Before Baking5," Split in half to make 2 loaves or make 1 large loaf. From this stage, cut each portion into 3 pieces. It's best to use a scale and calculator for best accuracy to ensure each portion is equal.


You may also divide it into 4 for an even more attractive plait, but it's better with the big 1kg loaf to be made into a 4-plait.

, Gather the three together and pinch at one end, if desired you may tuck this seam underneath the finished plait.

, This is just like plaiting hair, otherwise you may look at the three portions as a simple pattern, folding one strand over another: ABC, BAC, BCA, CBA, CAB and so on until you run out of dough.


You may mist with water and dip in seeds if you wish, or use an egg wash for an attractive finish.

, Ideally on a floured cloth or the baking tray. Bake 30-35 minutes for the smaller 500g loaves.


You may also plait small rolls for an attractive finish, or even more attractive is to fold the plait in on itself to make a loop. Flatten the roll slightly and allow to proof.

"
"
Prepare the portions.,
Make the rolls.,
Decorate as desired.,
Bake for 10-15 minutes.",How to Shape and Decorate Bread Before Baking6," Divide the 1kg dough into 10 balls for large rolls, or 13-15 balls for dinner rolls. Ideally use a scale and calculator to divide the dough weight to get even sizes.

, Press the dough ball flat on the table in a round shape and form into a nice circle using one of the two methods:


Like the round loaf above, press the dough portions flat and pinch or press the edges into the middle. Once completed, pinch the centre and rock or rotate the ball on the benchtop to make a nice round finish. The roll is turned over so the more untidy pinched part will be the bottom of the roll.
For more practiced bakers, press the dough flat with the palm of your hand and rapidly roll the ball around with some pressure. What should be happening is the outsides of the dough will be pulled inwards and around in your palm and as you keep rolling in a tight circle, it will make a nice shape. Lighten the pressure as you go, but with this method it is a practice to develop - if the dough is to soft it doesn't always work, too tight and the dough ends up tough and needs longer to proof.

, You may dip in seeds or grains as per the Baguette method and / or slash them as per the round loaf. You may also snip the edges vertically with scissors around the edges for a more crusty roll, which will look similar to an artichoke flower if you snip all the way around. Place them directly on the baking tray to proof, or on a floured cloth from which you can later transfer to a hot stone. Proof until doubled in size. Also splash the oven with water if you desire a crisp crust.

, The rolls should be golden and hollow when tapped.

Prepare the portions.,
Roll each ball into little baguettes about 15cm / 6 inches long.,
Decorate as desired.,

, Pick up one end in your thumb and fingers and wrap the other end around your fingers, going away from you. The dough end should now be tucked underneath the loop to form a simple knot. This is similar to tying a knot in a balloon.


You may also roll the dough thinner, and tie a double knot, reef knot or any other form such as a pretzel which is also attractive.
Another variation is to pick up the dough ""sausage"" in the middle and then twist the two halves around each other like you would make string or twine, then tuck the exposed ends underneath to make a round knot shape.

, You may dip in seeds or grains as per the Baguette method. Place them directly on the baking tray to proof, or on a floured cloth from which you can later transfer to a hot stone. Proof until doubled in size. Also splash the oven with water if you desire a crisp crust.

",How to Shape and Decorate Bread Before Baking8,"


A Benetton is a basket usually made of willow cane, but can also be of other woven canes and can be round or long. They are sometimes, but not always, lined with a cloth so the Benetton must be well floured before use to prevent sticking. The basket should be at least twice the size of the dough you put in, preferably 2.5 times.
Benetton s can be sourced from artisan or professional bakery stores, but its usually easiest to buy them online. You can use unvarnished and unpainted wicker baskets that are sourced from thrift or craft stores as long as they have minimal gaps between the canes. Scrub them clean before use and dry them. Then flour them before use.

, Ideally a batard style is easiest, but mould the dough according to the shape. Place the bread seam side up (so the good side is down).

, Invert the Benetton & bread onto the hot stone or baking tray, and lift the bane ton off vertically. The ""good side"" should be up. Further decoration is usually unnecessary as the wicker cane and flour leaves a pattern in the dough, but you may add some slashes with a razor to add extra details.

Prepare your loaf or rolls from the above methods.,
Apply your stencil after the bread has proofed.,
Bake the bread as per your recipe.

",How to Shape and Decorate Bread Before Baking10," Stencils can be very easy to make from ordinary household objects to personalise your loaf. Mist the dough with water and then the stencil can be applied or held above the bread. Flour or other toppings (such as seeds, spices etc) may be sifted or sprinkled through it to leave a pattern or a silhouette. For example:


A baking rack has slots and bars, where cake cooling racks can be diamonds, squares or a spiral. When the rack just gently touches the bread and flour is sifted over, it will leave the pattern in flour on the bread when the stencil is removed.
You may also cut one out of baking paper to make a letter or shape.
You may use cutlery like a wooden spoon to leave a silhouette, or even your hand.

, If you add it before, it may end up warped or at best unexpected patterns will arise.

Bake the bread and invert it onto a plate.",How to Make Cheesy Monkey Bread2," Get out a large mixing bowl. Melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter in the bowl and add 1 cup (240 ml) of warm milk and 1/3 cup (80 ml) of warm water. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon of instant yeast until the sugar and yeast dissolve.The sugar will help feed the yeast, so it activates and foams a little.

, Get out another mixing bowl that you can fit into a stand mixer. Place 3 1/4 cups (406 g) of all-purpose flour in the bowl along with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. Turn the mixer on low speed and gradually pour in the liquid mixture. Turn the speed up to medium and beat the dough for 6 to 7 minutes.The dough should become smooth. If it's still sticking to the sides of the bowl, you can add a tablespoon of extra flour at a time until the dough forms a shiny ball.
If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can beat the dough in a large bowl with a wooden spoon. It may just take longer for the dough to come together.

, Sprinkle some flour onto your work surface and dump the dough out onto it. Knead the dough (turning and folding the dough with your palms) for about 5 to 6 minutes. The dough should become smooth and elastic. Rub a little vegetable oil along the inside of a large bowl and place the ball of dough in it. Turn the ball, so it's coated with the oil. Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm place to prove. Let it set for 1 hour.The dough should double in volume, so you'll need to put it in a large mixing bowl.

, While the dough proves, grate 3 cups (300 g) of cheddar cheese. Put 2 cups (200 g) of the cheese into a prep bowl and set the other cup (100 g) of cheese aside. Mince 4 scallions and add it to the prep bowl with the 2 cups (200 g) of cheese.You'll use the reserved cheddar cheese for sprinkling over the top of the monkey bread.

, Once the dough has doubled in size, sprinkle more flour on your work surface and dump the dough onto it. Use your hands to form the dough into a 10-inch (25 cm) square. Spread the cheese and scallion mixture across half of the dough. Fold the other side of dough over the filling and use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a square. Cut the dough into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces.You can use a sharp knife or a bench scraper to cut the dough into even pieces.

, Get out another small bowl and melt 8 tablespoons (113 g) of unsalted butter in it. Stir in 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. You should also spread a Bundt pan with a few tablespoons of softened butter. This will keep the monkey bread from sticking to it.You can use your fingers or a pastry brush to coat the pan with the butter.

, Take each piece of cheesy dough and roll it in the melted butter mixture. Place each coated piece in the prepared Bundt pan. Once you have a layer of dough balls, sprinkle them with some of the reserved cheddar cheese and continue to layer the rest of the dough on top.You can place each piece of dough on a fork and dip it into the butter. This will allow the extra butter to drip back into the bowl.

, Wrap the top of the Bundt pan with plastic wrap and set the pan in a warm place to prove. Let it sit for 1 hour, so the dough balls rise to about 2-inches (5 cm) below the top of the pan. You should turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (180 C) once the bread has almost finished proving.It may take a little longer for your bread to prove enough. For example, you might need to prove the dough for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours.

, Take the plastic wrap off of the bread and place the bread in the oven. Bake it for 35 to 40 minutes. It should turn a dark, golden brown once it's finished baking. Remove the pan from the oven and let the bread cool for 5 minutes. Set a plate over the pan and carefully flip it over, so the bread is inverted onto the plate. Finish cooling the bread for 10 more minutes before you serve it.You should wear oven mitts when you invert the bread since the Bundt pan will still be hot.

Crumble the biscuits.,
Cream together butter and sugar.,

Mix everything together.,
Make your cake.,
Chill your cake.,
Remove your cake from the cake ring.,
Frost your cake.,
Enjoy!",How to Make a Chocolate Biscuit Cake1," Lightly grease a small cake ring or springform pan with 1/2 teaspoon butter and set it aside.


If you are using a cake ring, place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.;
, In a large bowl, crumble the biscuits into small almond sized pieces. Use about 1 cup of biscuit crumbs and set the bowl aside.


Using more or less crumbs in larger or smaller chunks will change the texture and consistency of your cake. You can experiment with this if you'd like.

, In a medium bowl, mix 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup sugar until combined. Stir the mixture with a large spoon or rubber spatula until your mixture is a light lemon color.


You may need to let your butter come to room temperature or heat it slightly to allow it to mix with the sugar.

, You can melt chocolate in a pan on the stove over low heat or pop it in the microwave in increments of 15 seconds to melt it. Only melt half of your dark chocolate. You will need the other half to frost your cake later.


Do not allow your chocolate to burn.
Remove your chocolate from the heat once it has melted.

, Stir by hand with a large spoon or rubber spatula. Slowly pour the butter-sugar mixture into the melted chocolate. Add the egg and continue stirring. Pour in the biscuit pieces and fold them into the mixture.


Continue folding in the biscuit pieces to coat them completely with chocolate.

, Pour or spoon the mixture into your cake ring. Lay the mixture as evenly as possible to prevent any gaps from forming at the bottom. For a denser cake, use your hands in plastic sandwich bags or use disposable plastic cooking gloves to press your mixture down into the pan.


You don't need to press very hard, just lightly pack it in.
Pressing your cake down will help you achieve a smooth, even surface.

, Move the trap or spring-form pan into the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 3 hours.Chilling your cake is necessary to achieve a smooth thick texture that holds together when slicing.

, Take your cake out of the refrigerator and remove it from the ring or springform pan. Once your cake has chilled, it will be firm enough to transfer to a cooling rack.


You can flip your cake upside down onto the cooling rack. This may be easier.

, Melt the second half of your dark chocolate (1/2 cup) and pour it over the cake, smoothing the top and sides with a butter knife or rubber spatula. Allow the icing to set at room temperature.


Melt 1/4 cup of milk chocolate and drizzle it over the top of your cake for a decorative touch.

, Transfer your finished cake to a cake dish or platter and serve.


Run a butter knife between the bottom of the cake and the cooling rack to gently pry the cake up if it has begun to stick to the rack.

Try different kinds of chocolate.,
Decorate the ultimate cake.,
Get creative with the biscuits.,
Make chocolate biscuit fudge bars.",How to Make a Chocolate Biscuit Cake2," While you don't need condensed milk to make chocolate biscuit cake, many recipes call for it. Adding condensed milk will give your cake a creamy, fudgy texture and allow it to be sliced more easily.

, Golden syrup is similar to honey and will add a gooey sweetness to your chocolate biscuit cake.


Look for golden syrup in the international section of supermarkets, or even large stores like Walmart.

, There are several ways to get creative with your chocolate biscuit cake. The options are virtually endless. Add nuts, raisins, tiny marshmallows, M&Ms, gummy bears, espresso powder, or anything that sounds good.

, Experiment with white chocolate as a frosting, drizzle, or even a main ingredient. You can also try using semi-sweet or milk chocolate to change up the flavor of your cake.


You can even use chocolate with hazelnut, chili pepper, or salt for an interesting spin on this traditional recipe.

, Cover your cake with frosting and a creative drizzle of chocolate. Don't stop there. Dust the top with a sprinkle of powdered sugar or add a dash of whipped cream. Crumble some biscuit crumbs on top and add some chocolate shavings or chips.

, Change the ratio of the biscuits. The more biscuit crumbs you use, the denser your cake will be. Adjust a number of biscuits based on your own preferences or try different ratios to make the perfect cake.


You can also use different kinds of biscuits. Try ginger flavored biscuits for a unique twist.

, Cut your cake into cubes and arrange on a platter like brownies. Wrap cubes in wax paper and give them to friends, family, or take a tray to a classroom, party, or to work.

Decorate the brownie Christmas trees.",How to Make Brownie Christmas Trees," Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Get out a rimmed half-sheet pan that measures 13x18-inches (33 x 45 cm). It should be about 1-inch deep. Spray the pan with baking spray or butter and flour the pan so the brownies won't stick.If you don't have the time to bake brownies for the Christmas trees, you can use purchased brownies that are already baked. You just may not get as many brownie Christmas trees out of a smaller pan of brownies.;
, Place a double boiler on the stove or use a saucepan if you don't have a double boiler. Fill the saucepan or boiler with an inch (2.5 cm) of water and bring it to a simmer. Set a heat-proof bowl over the pan and add 1 pound (454 g) of unsalted butter, 16 ounces (453 g) of the semisweet chocolate chips, and 6 ounces (170 g) of chopped unsweetened chocolate. Stir the chocolate as it melts. Set it aside to cool as you mix the rest of the brownies.You could also melt the butter and chocolate in a microwave. Just use a microwave-safe bowl and stir the mixture every 30 seconds until it's melted.

, Get out a large mixing bowl and add 6 large eggs, 3 tablespoons of instant coffee granules, 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract, and 2 1/4 cups (450 g) of sugar. Beat the wet mixture with an electric hand or stand mixer until it's combined. Slowly stir in the melted butter and chocolate mixture until it's incorporated.The espresso powder will enhance the flavor of the chocolate and won't make the brownies taste like coffee. If you like, you can leave it out.

, Get out a medium-sized mixing bowl and add 1 cup (125 g) of the flour, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Whisk the dry ingredients together and then add it to the chocolate brownie batter in the larger mixing bowl. Mix the remaining 12 ounces (350 g) of chocolate chips with the remaining 1/4 cup (25 g) of flour. Stir this into the brownie batter.Tossing the chocolate chips in with the flour prevents the chocolate chips from sinking to the bottom of the brownies as they bake.

, Spread the brownie batter into the prepared half-sheet pan. Bake the brownies in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. The brownies should begin to pull away from the sides of the pan. Insert a toothpick to see if it comes out clean. Remove the brownies and let them cool completely.Ensure that you don't over bake the brownies or they may be difficult to cut into Christmas tree shapes.

, Set out 1/2 cup (115 g) of butter and 8 ounces (225 g) of cream cheese on the counter. Let them warm up until they're at room temperature and are soft to the touch.It's important that the butter and cream cheese are soft. If they're cold when you beat them together, you may get lumps in the frosting.

, Put the softened cream cheese and butter into a large mixing bowl. Use the beater attachment on a stand or electric mixer and beat the butter and cream cheese on medium-high speed. Beat the mixture for a few minutes until they're light and fluffy.Beating the cream cheese and butter is important since this will prevent your frosting from having pockets of butter or cream cheese.

, Gradually beat in 3 1/2 to 4 cups (437 to 500 g) of powdered sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Set the mixer speed to low so that the powdered sugar doesn't fly out of the mixing bowl. You can eventually increase the speed to medium. The frosting should be smooth and creamy.You may want to taste the frosting and add additional vanilla according to your taste.

, Remove the cooled brownies from the pan by flipping the pan out onto a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut the brownies into triangles. You can make them all the same size or cut them into different types of triangles to make different shapes of Christmas trees.You could also use a Christmas tree cookie cutter to press out the brownie trees. This will also give your trees more branches and definition.

, Break or roughly cut a candy cane into two pieces that are about 1.5-inches (3.75 cm) long. Repeat this for all 12 candy canes. Insert one of the small straight pieces into the base of each brownie tree.Consider saving the curved parts of the candy canes that you don't use for the base. You can crush these and sprinkle them on the Christmas tree brownies.

, If you'd like to make green frosting for the Christmas trees, you can add a little bit of food coloring gel to the cream cheese frosting. Dip a toothpick into the gel so that you get a little on the end. Run this through the frosting. Beat the frosting so the color is incorporated. Continue adding the food coloring until you get the shade you'd like.

Avoid using standard liquid food coloring since this can cause the frosting to clump up.

, Spoon the cream cheese frosting into a pastry bag with your favorite pastry tip. Pipe the frosting onto each brownie tree, moving back and forth as you go so it looks like garland.If you don't have a pastry bag, you could scoop the frosting into a large freezer bag. Cut a 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) hole in one corner of the plastic bag so you can squeeze the frosting out.

, Use your imagination to sprinkle the frosted brownie Christmas trees with a variety of edible decorations. Once they're decorated, you can refrigerate the brownies in an airtight container until you're ready to serve them. Consider decorating the brownies with:Crushed peppermint candies
Colored sugar
Colored sprinkles

, Coat it with icing. Put one toothpick in each of the frosting flavors. To make eyes, take the M&Ms or Skittles and place them on the face as eyes. You can use a frosting color to make eyeglasses. Just dip a toothpick in the frosting, and drag the toothpick around the eyes to make glasses. If there is no more frosting on your toothpick then you can dip it in to make more.

, If you are making girl hair, then cut 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) of licorice, and hang one end from the head. To make boy hair, lay licorice on top of the face to make boy hair. To make a mohawk, just take the hair and place the ends on the face and partially on on the back of the face. Make sure the strips you cut on the mohawk are only 1 half inch long! Also, make it stick out just like the way you laid it flat on the face for spiky hair! For a ponytail, make loose hair then twist it all together. You can do the same for 2 ponytails, and add a whole lot of licorice to make braids!

, Make a nose and mouth, but you can just use an M&M for a nose and a licorice for a mouth. Now decorate your brownie face with all sorts of things. Repeat steps 2-4 until you used up all your Brownie Bites.

You can also use baking spray as a healthier option.

, You can melt the butter in either a sauce pot or in a glass dish in the microwave. Just heat the butter enough that it is completely melted -- it doesn't need to be hot.


if using the microwave, heat the butter in 30 second intervals.

, While the butter is still melted, pour it into the sugar and quickly combine them. Let this mixture cool while you move on to the flour.

, These make up your dry ingredients.

, These form your wet ingredients. Make sure they are well mixed, but don't worry if some of the liquid is separated from the sugar.


Do not whisk in the eggs until the sugar is cool to the touch, otherwise you risk cooking your eggs.

, Combine the two bowls and, using a spatula, mix them together until you have a consistent batter. If you want any add-ins, like chocolate chips or nuts, add them now.


Once there are no more chunks of flour or sugar the mixture is ready.

, Even it out with your spatula so that the top is flat.

, The bars will be golden brown on the tops and edges when they are finished. Stick a fork or wooden skewer through the center of the blondies and pull it out quickly. If there is wet batter on the knife then the blondies still need to cook.

Dried cherries, cranberries, raspberries, etc.
Chopped, walnuts, pecans, almonds.

, You can easily change the flavor of your blondies with different extracts. You can even mix and match -- a tablespoon of both vanilla and almond has a nice, lightly sweetened flavor, for example.

, Add 1 cup of pumpkin puree and a teaspoon of cinnamon, allspice, or nutmeg for ""Harvest Blondies."" The result will be a hearty, lightly spiced Thanksgiving treat.


These are also great with 1/2 cup walnuts, pecans, or chocolate chips.

, Dried cherries and white chocolate go perfectly together for a rich, sweet blondie. You can also try a teaspoon of almond extract for a marzipan-like flavor.

, These may sound odd, but the bourbon gives the cookie a caramelized tang that goes well with after-dinner drinks. Be sure to add an extra tablespoon of flour with the liquor to offset any additional liquid.

, Baking powder helps the batter rise in the oven, creating more air pockets for a lighter blondie.

Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C/Gas 4) and prepare your cake pan.,
Melt the butter, sugar, and 6 ounces (175 grams) of chocolate in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat.,
Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites.,
Whisk the yolks into the chocolate.,
Add the flour, nuts (if using), and the rest of the chocolate.,
Beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, then fold them into the batter.,
Pour the batter into the greased cake pan, and bake it for 35 to 40 minutes.,
Let the cake cool a little before removing it from the pan.,
Serve the cake.",How to Make a Brownie Cake1," Lightly grease the inside of an 8 to 10 inch (20.32 to 25.4 centimeters) cake pan with some butter. Line the cake pan with parchment paper, and grease the parchment paper as well. Set the cake pan aside when you are done.

If you absolutely cannot get any parchment paper, then you can leave it out. The parchment paper will simply prevent the cake from sticking to the bottom of the pan.;
, Stir the mixture occasionally as it melts with a rubber spatula. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan from time to time to prevent any scorching. Once the chocolate has melted, set the saucepan aside so that it can cool.

Don't use all of the chocolate just yet. You will be using the rest of it later in the recipe.

, If you have not yet done so, separate the yolks from the whites. You can put the yolks directly into the saucepan, but you should put the whites into a separate bowl. You can separate the eggs by passing the yolks back and forth between two shells, or you can use a special egg separator., Make sure that the chocolate has cooled a little, then whisk the egg yolks. Keep whisking until the yolks break and mix evenly into the chocolate. You should not see any streaks of egg yolk.

If the chocolate is too hot to touch, it is too hot for the eggs. If you add eggs to the chocolate too soon, they will get cooked!

, Stir the mixture again until everything is evenly combined. You can continue using a whisk for this, or you can switch over to a rubber spatula. Scrape the bottom and sides of the saucepan to ensure that everything gets evenly mixed.

The nuts are not completely necessary, but they will give the cake more texture and flavor. They will also make it more brownie-like; pecans and walnuts are a popular addition to brownies.

, You can beat the egg whites using an electric handheld beater, a stand mixer, or a food processor fitted with whisks. You can also do it by hand, but it will take much longer. The egg whites should be white, thick, and foamy., Make sure that the baking rack is in the center of the oven. The cake is ready when the top turns crusty, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean., Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes first, then remove it from the cake pan. If you used a spring-form pan, simply open up the sides. If you used a regular cake pan, run a knife along the inside of the cake pan, then dump the cake out onto a serving plate., If you'd like, you can dust it with some powdered sugar. You can serve it while it is still warm, or you can let it cool completely. Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream go great with this type of cake."

Turn the heat up to medium, and wait for the butter and chocolate to melt, stirring with a rubber spatula occasionally., Keep stirring until the sugar melts. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the saucepan from time to time as you do so., If you beat the eggs in too soon, you'll risk them cooking and forming clumps. Stir the eggs in using a whisk, so that the yolks break easier. Keep stirring until they are mixed evenly into the batter; you should not see any streak of egg yolk., Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined, and there are not lumps or streaks left. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the pan., Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture into the pans, and to scrape any residual batter from the saucepan. Make sure that each pan has an even amount of batter in it. Don't worry if it looks thin. You will be stacking these on top of each other to create a tall, layered cake., The cakes are ready when a toothpick poked into the middle comes out clean. Try to bake all of the cakes on the same level. If your oven is small, and you have to bake them at different levels, then be sure to rotate the cakes at regular intervals. This will ensure that all the cakes bake evenly., Allow the cakes to cool in their pans for 10 to 15 minutes first, then remove them from the pans, and let them finish cooling completely. The cakes must be cool before you frost them. If they are warm, the frosting will melt.

Set one of the cakes down onto the serving dish you want to use. Set the other ones aside.

, Keep stirring until the sugar has dissolved, and the heavy cream is evenly mixed in with the chocolate. You don't want to see any streaks or swirls of heavy cream.

You can use the same saucepan as before, but make sure that you clean it first.
Do not add in the shaved chocolate yet. You will be using that to decorate your cake with.

, Don't worry if the mixture looks too thin to be frosting. It will thicken up once it cools, and it will continue to thicken when you beat it., As the mixture cools, it will thicken, sort of like pudding. Stir the mixture occasionally as it cools to prevent a skin from forming on top.

Consider placing a sheet of plastic wrap right against the surface of the mixture. This will further help prevent a skin from forming on top.

, You can do this using a handheld beat, an electric stand mixer, or even a food processor fitted with whisks. You an try doing it by hand with a plain old whisk, but it will take much longer., Spread a thick layer of the whipped, chocolate cream over the top of your first cake, then place the second cake on top. Repeat with the second cake, and finish off with spreading a generous amount of whipped chocolate cream on top of the third cake.

For a more professional finish, use a off-set cake decorating spatula.

, Once you have the cakes all stacked, start spreading frosting over the sides of the cake. If you have any frosting leftover, you can pipe it on top of the cake using a piping bag and star-shaped decorating tip. Finish off by sprinkling the shaved chocolate all over the top of the cake.For extra texture, gently tap the sides of the cake with a spatula or the back of a spoon. This will create a spiky texture.

Throw in some fruit.",How to Enhance Boxed Brownie Mix1," You can purchase chopped nuts at the grocery store, or buy some regular nuts and chop them yourself.

Not only will they add that nutty taste, but they’ll add some delicious texture to your otherwise gooey brownies!, Grab a bag of your favorite candy or a couple of your favorite candy bars. Then, chop them up into chunks and toss them into your batter – pretty easy! You can do this with Reeses, Snickers, peppermints, Butterfingers, M&Ms, Milky Way, or whatever candy you love.Avoid the chewy, fruity candies like Skittles or Sour Patch Kids. Those will not do well in the oven (and probably wouldn’t taste great with chocolate!).

, Cream cheese is a popular ingredient for decadent frostings, so try putting it directly in the brownies for an extra treat. Purchase a package of cream cheese (8 ounces, 226 grams) and warm it up in the microwave to soften it. Place it in a bowl, and then add half a cup of sugar, one egg, and one teaspoon of vanilla.

This will make your brownies deliciously fruity and lower in fat.If your goal is healthy (or healthier) brownies, add in some flaxseed.
