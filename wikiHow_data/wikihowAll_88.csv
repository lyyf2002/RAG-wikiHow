Frost your brownies.,
Top your brownies with fruit.,
Use nuts or candy as a topping.,
Throw chocolate chips on top.",How to Enhance Boxed Brownie Mix3," You frost cookies and cupcakes, so why not frost your brownies? You can whip up some homemade frosting or buy a tub of store-bought frosting. With vanilla frosting and a little food coloring, you can even create colorful brownies with designs.


Frosting is a perfect way to transform normal brownies into festive brownies for any occasion. Write “Happy Birthday” or “Congratulations!” on a pan of brownies, and they’re instantly more special.
Experiment with different kinds of frostings to find your favorite. Try decadent frostings like German chocolate or cream cheese frosting. Add a bit of fruitiness to your brownies with a raspberry frosting. Add lemon, lavender, or honey to a vanilla buttercream frosting to create all sorts of brownies.

, Chocolate and fruit are a traditional dessert combination, after all. Top your brownies with your frosting of choice, and cut them into squares. Then, top each one with a raspberry, a strawberry slice, or whatever fruit you want to use. The culinary combination is great, and the box mix brownies immediately look more sophisticated., Anything you used as a mix-in can be used as a topping as well! While the brownies are still warm, top them with crushed candy, nuts, mini marshmallows, or any other sweet or crunchy treat. As the brownies cool, the toppings will meld to the tops, so they won't be messy. This is great for easily adding color or texture to your brownies.

, As soon as you pull your brownies out of the oven, toss a layer of your favorite chips on top. You can use dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate, or even peanut butter chips. The warmth from your brownies will melt the chips to the surface of your fresh brownies. When the chips are soft, you can spread them along the surface of the brownies with a knife or leave them as they are. Enjoy!"

If you don't have self-rising flour, mix 2 1/4 cups flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt.;
, Using two knives, cut the butter into chunks. Try to handle the butter as little as possible, since it needs to stay cold until the moment you pop the biscuit dough into the oven.









If you find it easier to handle the butter with one hand and a knife, rinse your hand in cold water first, so you won't warm up the butter too much.
If the butter seems to get soft, place it in the freezer after you cut it into chunks. Remove it after it cools for about 10 minutes.

, Place the butter chunks into the flour mixture. Using either a pastry mixer or a fork, blend the butter and flour until the mixture begins to resemble small beans and no large chunks of butter remain.








It's important not to overblend the mixture, since working the flour too much results in tough biscuits. Leaving tiny bean-sized pieces of butter will create pockets of buttery, flaky goodness in the finished biscuits.
To determine whether the mixture has been blended enough, pinch a bit of dough between your thumb and forefinger. If the dough stays together, it's ready for the next stage. If it's still too powdery and crumbly to hold together, blend it a little more, then test it again.

, Place the bowl of dough in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. This gives the butter a chance to cool again before you move to the next stage.








, Remove the bowl from the refrigerator. Slowly pour in the buttermilk and use a wooden spoon to gently incorporate it into the flour and butter mixture. Stir until the buttermilk is just combined, and you have a sticky dough with small bits of butter dispersed throughout.








, If you're going to be baking the biscuits right away, it's important to have the oven preheated so you can transfer them to the oven while the butter is still cold.








, A floured cutting board will do the trick, or you could use a clean, floured counter or tabletop. If you'd prefer not to get your work surfaces messy, lay out a few sheets of parchment paper and flour them.








, If necessary, use your hands to stretch it out a bit. Then take the edges of the dough and fold it in half. Use the rolling pin or the back of a plate to flatten it again. Fold it in half once more, then flatten it again. Repeat until you have folded the dough 3 times. Flatten it one last time so that the dough is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.









If you want thinner biscuits, roll the dough a bit flatter so it's 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick.
Folding the dough in this way creates a lot of flaky layers. For more layers, continue gently folding and pressing the dough.

, Use a biscuit cutter (or the rim of a glass) to cut the dough into biscuits. Place them onto a lightly greased and floured cookie sheet. Don't crowd the biscuits; they will rise and spread a little while they bake.









Biscuits are usually round, but you can cut them into squares if you prefer. You could also leave the dough uncut and use it as a top crust for chicken pot pie.
At this point you can cover the tray of raw biscuits with plastic wrap and freeze them. When you're ready to bake them, simply place them in a preheated oven.

, Make sure the oven is completely preheated before you put the biscuits in the oven. To cook correctly, biscuits require exposure to high heat for a short period of time.








, They're ready when the tops have turned golden brown. Since different ovens run at slightly different temperatures, check the biscuits every few minutes to make sure they don't burn.








, Biscuits are best served fresh and hot from the oven. You can brush them with melted butter and serve them with jam or honey, or serve them plain as a side dish for stew or fried chicken. They will keep for a day or so in an airtight container.

Get creative.",How to Make Bread Bowls," Sourdough is the classic bread type and a round loaf (called a boule) the classic shape for a bread bowl, but there are no hard-and-fast rules. If you can make it, bake it, cut the top off, hollow it out, fill it, and eat it, it can be a bread bowl.


Bread recipes can be found easily online. Here are few bread bowl-ready recipes for inspiration: Italian;; Whole Wheat;Beer Pretzel.The following steps briefly describe how to make a sourdough boule. For more detailed instructions, see How to Make Sourdough Bread.;
, Classic sourdough relies on a starter, a mix of flour and water which feeds the natural yeast needed to make the bread rise.


Mix equal parts flour and water (any amount) in a bowl, then pour the mix into a thoroughly clean class or plastic jar with a tight-fitting lid.
Seal the lid and leave in a dark place at room temperature for 24 hours.

, Every day, pour out half of the mix and replace it with a new flour/water slurry.


Repeat this process until the starter has frothy bubbles on top and a distinctive sour smell. This usually happens within a week.

, Add all your starter to a mixing bowl, then add equal parts flour and water (one cup of water is usually good for one loaf) and mix.


Cover with a clean towel and let your ""sponge"" (the resulting mixture) ""proof"" (rise) for several hours, until bubbly on top.
Save a little of this sponge to become your next starter, if desired.

, Cover and let rise for several hours at room temperature or in the refrigerator overnight.

,


Flour your hands, workspace, and dough to prevent sticking.

, This isn’t essential, since bread bowls can be in any fillable shape, but the following is a good general method for creating a boule (round bread)., Use your thumbs and fingers to stretch the dough from the top of the ball downwards. Tuck the stretched dough underneath the ball.


This process makes a taut “skin” on the top of the dough ball. This helps it to rise while baking, so your bread will have more of a rounded dome than a flattened disc shape.

, With practice, you will be able to do this quickly and efficiently, thus preventing excess gluten development (and thus tougher bread).

, Pinch the excess together and give it a slight twist to hold it in place.


You can also pinch, put the dough ball on the board (topside up), and twist.

, For the sourdough recipe noted here, bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes or until golden brown.


Consider spritzing your bread with a spray bottle of water several times during baking. Keeping the top from drying out will help with rising., A trip to a bakery or bakery section of your supermarket will reveal several different types of bread loaves.


Pumpernickel and sourdough breads are often round, while Italian and French breads are usually elongated loaves. Larger sandwich rolls can become small bread bowls, or try an unsliced loaf of regular white or wheat bread for a larger option. Even a loaf of raisin or banana bread could work with the right filling. Remember, bread bowls do not need to be round, just fillable.
Firmer breads are easier to slice open and empty out, however, so an extra-soft loaf of white bread may not be the ideal choice.

, With a serrated knife, carefully cut the top of the bread using horizontal cutting strokes. Leave as much of the bread loaf behind; only remove enough of the top of the bread to allow access into the loaf itself.

, With your fingers, scoop and tear away chunks of bread from the interior of the loaf. Be sure never to break through the outside crust. The thinner the filling you intend to use, the thicker you want to leave the walls of your bread bowl.

, Cut the removed bread into cubes for dipping either into the soup, chili or dips. Serve the bread alongside the filled bowl.


You can also use this bread to make croutons or bread crumbs, or to feed the birds in your local park.

, Use the removed bread top as a lid, if desired, or cut it up along with the removed inner bread.

, Cream based soups (mushroom, broccoli, chicken, etc.) and chilis are classic bread bowl fillings because they soak into the bread (making a deliciously edible “bowl”) without quickly soaking through it.


You can use thinner soups like tomato or chicken noodle, but be prepared to serve and eat quickly because they will soak through the bread. Consider placing your bread bowl in a larger, non-edible bowl.

, Dips are another classic bread bowl filling. Use the removed inner bread as dippers. Here are a few suggestions:


Taco DipStuffed Mushroom DipCrab Dip, Who says it has to be soup? Consider some of the following:


Chicken or Turkey Pot PieChicken Cordon BleuSloppy Joes, Pretty much everything pairs well with bread, so the possibilities are practically limitless when it comes to filling bread bowls. For instance:


Spaghetti and Meat SauceMake-Your-Own Omelet BarMelted Chocolate Fondue,with bread cubes and sliced fruit to accompany it. Even if the chocolate hardens before you can finish it, you’ll have a delicious chocolate bread to eat instead of a crusty fondue pot to clean.

Bake at 375ºF for 40 to 50 minutes.",How to Make Beer Bread1," A basic beer bread is just a bottle of beer plus a couple of normal ingredients you've already got in your pantry. Any kind of flour, from whole wheat, to self-rising white is fine to use. Cheap beer and expensive beer also work perfectly well. Use a lighter beer if you're not a big beer fan, and a darker beer if you want more flavor. All in all, you'll need the following ingredients to make beer bread:


2 ¾ cups baking flour
2 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
1-2 tsp. dried green herbs (optional)
1 12 oz. can or bottle of beer;
, Into the bowl, measure out the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and any green herbs you'd like to add to the mixture. A small sprinkling of thyme, oregano, and dill work nicely, but you can also leave them out if you'd prefer.


Mix the dry ingredients gently using a wooden spoon, and set the bowl aside.

, Once you've got the dry ingredients measured out, pour in the beer slowly, being careful to avoid too much fizzing up. Pour with one hand and mix gently with the other hand, adding the entire bottle of beer.


Both warm and cold beer work perfectly fine for this recipe.

, Continue stirring the mixture, scraping the sides of the bowl to avoid any dry spots. Keep mixing until the flour is absorbed into the wet beer and everything starts to look uniform.


It should be a little lumpy-looking, not quite as thin as pancake batter, and about the consistency of corn-bread mix.

, Beer bread is best in a loaf pan. Use about a half tablespoon of butter to thoroughly grease the bottom and sides of the loaf pan, so it won't stick, then spoon the mixture in and flatten the top with the spoon.


You can also use olive oil, canola oil, or any other kind of cooking oil you want.

, Preheat your oven to 375 and pop it in. Check on it periodically, to make sure its baking evenly and consistently, turning it around if necessary.


Remove the bread when the edges are golden brown, or crisp looking. Check using a knife or a toothpick in the middle. If it comes back without any wet dough on it, it's done.

"
Use different kinds of beer.,
Add about a cup of grated cheese.,
Add some chopped vegetables.,
Add some seeds on top.,
Make it in the skillet.",How to Make Beer Bread2," Whatever kind of beer you use will impart a subtle yeasty flavor in the bread. Experiment some with different styles and brands to see what you like best in your bread. While fruity or flavored beers might be a little funky in a bread recipe, it's fine to use any beer you like to drink, or whatever's in the fridge.


Light pilsners, like most domestic Budweiser and Coors, are good for beer bread because they're cheap and easy to find. They don't leave much flavor, but some subtle yeastiness, making them great to use if you've got any laying around.
Wheat beers, like Blue Moon, are already quite bread-like to begin with, making them a great addition to a beer bread recipe.
Dark beers, like brown ales, porters, and stouts will leave a sweet nuttiness in the bread that a lot of people like. It'll also make the bread darker.
The baking process burns off any traces of alcohol from the beer, but leaves some of the flavor from the malts, sugars, and yeasts in the beer, making this treat a perfect side for people of all ages. No worries about feeding beer bread to youngsters.

, Beer and cheese? Yes please. This bread was made to have cheese added to it. Hard or soft, any cheese you like to eat can be a good mix-in for this particular recipe. Experiment to see what you like, and grate or crumble the cheese of your choice into the dough before adding it. Here are some good ideas:


Sharp cheddar
Pepper jack
Gouda
Crumbled blue cheese
Grated parmesan

, If you want some more substance in your beer bread, adding about a half cupped of finely chopped raw vegetable with help to lift the bread and make it a little more interesting. Any combination of the following ingredients can be great mix-ins for beer bread:


Onion
Garlic
Chopped green chile
Grated carrot
Grated zucchini
Diced bell pepper

, Before you put the bread into the oven, try the following technique: Brush some melted butter on top of the bread, and sprinkle the top liberally with any of the following seeds:


Poppy seeds
Caraway seeds
Mustard seeds
Sesame seeds
Toasted cardamom and cumin seeds

, Don't have a loaf pan? No problem! Pop a cast iron skillet into the oven while your oven preheats, and pop a pat of butter in to grease it. Pour it in when its hot to create a crisp, even crust across the bread, then finish it in the oven for 20-30 minutes."

, For glass and ceramic containers, you can soak them in boiling water for 15 minutes. This method is not recommend for plastic, as some plastics can leach chemicals when heated. For all container types, you can soak in a solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 litres) of water for 30 minutes. Be sure to soak the lid as well, and rinse the containers to remove all of the bleach.

, If you don't have a scale, use approximately 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup warm water. Any type of wheat flour (except for self-rising) is fine. The water should be around 100 °F (38 °C). Either measure the temperature with a thermometer or check it on your wrist. It should be bath-water warm, but not uncomfortably so.

,, The vigorous mixing should incorporate air into the mixture, which will help the yeast take hold.

,, By this time you should see some change. The batter should smell sour and have small bubbles. If not, your yeast culture might be a slow breeder, just give it more time.

,, You need to feed your starter every day or two if left at room temperature and once a week if stored in the fridge.

For best results, use clean hands or a wooden mixing spoon.

, Mix the yeast solution, oil, and yogurt into the combined flour. Stir with a mixing spoon or with clean hands until a soft dough forms.


The dough should hold together well. If the dough seems too dry or crumbly, add more water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time to help hold it together.

, Cover it and place it in a warm location for 3 to 4 hours. During this time, the dough should double in volume.


Cover the bowl of dough with plastic wrap, an inverted plate, or a moist dish towel.

, Punch the dough down and knead it several times. Tear it into 8 equally portioned pieces and shape them into balls.


Note that you may need to dust your hands with a little additional flour to prevent the dough from sticking to your skin.

, Dust each ball of dough with additional flour and lay them out onto the counter. Flatten them into circles using a rolling pin.


Each circle should be about 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter or less. The circles should also be no thinner than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).

, Pour 1.5 inches (3.75 cm) of oil into a deep frying pan with a heavy bottom. Heat it on high over the stove until the oil reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).


You can check the temperature using a candy or oil thermometer.
If you do not have a thermometer, you can make sure that the oil is hot enough by dropping in a small piece of dough. It should immediately begin to sizzle and float to the top, taking on a light color.
The oil must be sufficiently hot before you begin. If not, the finished bread will be greasy and heavy.

, Drop one into the hot oil. Press it gently with a skimmer or slotted spoon until it puffs up like a ball. Use the spoon to turn the bhatura to the other side, and cook it until both sides turn a light golden-brown.


Monitor the temperature of the oil as you fry the bread. It will naturally drop as you add the dough and rise as the pan sits empty. Manipulate the temperature control settings on your stove to maintain as even a temperature as possible throughout the entire process.

, Remove the finished bhatura from the oil using a slotted spoon. Place the bread on a plate lined with paper towels and allow the excess oil to drain off. Serve while still hot and fresh.


Serve the bhatura with homemade chole, a dish made from chickpeas, or channa.

, After adding all the yogurt, knead the dough inside the bowl until it becomes soft, smooth, and a little sticky.


If the dough feels too dry or crumbly, you could add another 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of yogurt. Do not add any water, though.

, Tightly wrap the dough in several layers of plastic wrap. Chill it in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours before continuing.


Alternatively, you could simple cover the top of the bowl with plastic wrap or a loose plate. The covering or wrapping is simply used to prevent the dough from drying out.

, Remove the dough from the refrigerator and punch it down. Knead it a few times, then break it apart into 8 or 9 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.


Note that the balls should roughly be the size of a lime or lemon.

, Roll the dough balls in additional flour. Use a rolling pin to flatten each one into a circle.

, Pour the frying oil into a skillet with tall sides and a heavy bottom. Allow it to heat on your stove, on high, until the temperature reaches 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).

If you do not have a cooking thermometer, you could verify that the oil is hot enough by dropping in a small speck of dough. It should immediately sizzle and float to the top. Within moments, the dough should deepen to a light golden color.

, Drop the bhatura into the hot oil one at a time. When the dough puffs up and the bottom deepens in color, flip it over and fry the other side. When done, there should be golden-brown specks on both sides.


The temperature of the oil will usually drop once you add the bhatura and rise when you take the finished bread out. For best results, keep a close eye on the temperature of the oil throughout the process and manipulate the controls as needed to maintain an even temperature.

, Remove each finished bhatura with a slotted spoon. Place them on a plate lined with several layers of clean paper towels and let the excess oil drain off. Serve the bread while it is still hot and fresh.


For an even more authentic experience, serve the bhatura with chole masala.

Fry the bhatura.,
Drain and serve.",How to Make Bhatura3," Use a box grater to shred the peeled, boiled potatoes into fine pieces.


Note that the potatoes should already be peeled and boiled prior to this step.

, In a large bowl, mash together the shredded potato, maida, salt, oil, and yogurt. Use a potato masher or your hands to combine the ingredients until a soft, slightly stick dough forms.


If necessary, sprinkle in a little water as you mix the dough if it seems too dry or crumbly. The dough must hold together well.
Continue kneading a few times even after the dough forms up.

, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, a lid, or an inverted plate. Set it aside on the counter and leave it alone for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it becomes slightly inflated.

, Divide the dough into as many lemon-sized pieces as possible and roll each portion into a ball.


Note that you should put a little flour on your hands before handling the dough at this point to prevent the dough from sticking to your fingers.

, Dust each ball of dough with a little additional flour and flatten it into a circle using a rolling pin.

, Pour 2 inches (5 cm) of additional cooking oil into a deep frying pan with a sturdy bottom. Heat it on a flame or stove until the oil reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).


If heating the oil on a stove, use high heat.
Check the temperature of the oil using a candy or oil thermometer.
If you do not have a cooking thermometer, you can test the oil by dropping a small piece of raw dough into it. When the oil is hot enough, the dough should sizzle and rise to the top immediately.

, Drop the circles into the hot oil one at a time. When the dough floats to the top, use a ladle or slotted spoon to press down on it gently, causing it to become puffy. Flip it over to the other side once you notice the bottom beginning to brown, and continue cooking until both sides are lightly browned.


To ensure that each bhatura cooks evenly, you should try to keep the temperature of the oil even throughout the entire process. You may need to manipulate the amount of heat you use as you work since the temperature of the oil will change naturally as you fry the bread.

, Remove the bhatura with a slotted spoon or ladle and drain each on on a plate covered in clean paper towels. Serve while still hot and fresh.


You can also make your own chole or chana masala to serve alongside the bhatura for a complete Indian dining experience.

Start by making the cornucopia shape in foil.,
Take the bottle out (with gloves, if needed to protect your skin from being scratched by the foil) and bend the foil funnel into a horned-like shape.,
Cut a bunch of separate dough strips out of any fresh bread dough you wish to use.,
Start curling the strips of dough around the foil shape, starting at the tail end.,
Glaze the cornucopia with egg mix before you put it in.,
Bake according to the instructions accompanying the dough.,
Remove when baked.,
Separate the cornucopia from the foil.,
Fill the bread horn as you like.,
Place on the table as your centerpiece for Thanksgiving or any other harvest event.",How to Make a Bread Cornucopia1," A good tip is to use a plastic bottle as a basic guide for making the cone. Shapes can vary; a two-liter bottle will make a bigger mold, while a smaller water bottle will make a much smaller one. Use sheets of foil to wrap around the bottle until the foil is thick and sturdy enough to hold some weight.
, The shape shouldn't be too curvy, however, just the end; otherwise, it will be hard to take out of the bread when you're done. Stuff the horn with balls of foil for extra resilience and to keep the shape intact., Pizza dough works well, since it hardens well to keep the shape once you're done baking. You'll want to /lightly/ grease the foil on the outside before you start layering the strips as well., Just strap them around and make them overlap slightly for the best result. If you feel like getting creative, you can always weave and curl the pieces of dough any way you like, as long as you cover the entire foil shape. For the lip of the cornucopia, you can braid three strips of dough to give it a nice finish., To do this, just beat one or two eggs with a whisk (until fluffy) and paint over the dough., Check on the baking process frequently, to make sure that the cornucopia doesn't burn. If some areas are getting more baked than others, a strip of foil on that area can keep it from getting too brown., Allow to cool down for approximately half an hour, or until it can hold its shape., Slowly and carefully remove the foil from the bread once it has completely cooled down. You will be left with an empty bread horn., It is good for adding fruit, veggies or anything else edible and dry. Add some sprigs of rosemary if you prefer to scent the bread and decorate it.

Do not add moist or wet food, as the bread will break down.

It's much better than shop bread and it's intuitive, because after a few attempts, you will not need this recipe and it will all come naturally.

",How to Make Bread by the Intuitive Method,";
,,, The quantity and how much white and high fibre etc are up to you and your taste buds. For the first time, perhaps a kilo will be a good start.

, Roughly, a bit more or less will not hurt and more will probably help it to rise faster.

, For a kilo of flour, probably about 4 teaspoons is enough. You can't miss this stage because the salt helps the dough to rise. Don't use Lo-salt as it doesn't work. Really, it's up to you, according to your taste but you must have some.

, It can be Lo cal if you like but it's more expensive. It's just like sprinkling sugar on cereal - according to taste. You will get the hang of it after two or three goes. Sugar, however, isn't an essential ingredient.

, Do not use ""light"" because it's mainly water. Really it's up to your taste. It will help the bread to last longer but it's not absolutely necessary. Four or five knobs over the top for a kilo.

, Make more than you need according to how the flour reacts. Use you fingers to test. When you get used to it you can forget the cups.

, Add bits of water at a time until the flour absorbs it. This is the intuitive bit because you will get good at it after a few times.

,, Press the centre with your right hand and fold over the dough from the left with your other hand. The idea is to trap the air. (Opposite hands for left handers.)Repeat for five to ten minutes.

,,, Let it rise until doubled in size. If in a hot country, about 45 minutes or cold country, in a warm place for up to two hours.

, Then knead again for 1 minute only.

,,,, Put it near the top, if it's an old oven.

Choose whole-grain over processed grain bagels.,
Eat a mini-size bagel, or cut your bagel in half.,
Eat a whole-grain English muffin or slice of whole-wheat bread.",How to Make Bagels Healthier1," Whole-grain bagels will retain some of the fiber from the grains themselves, and boost the bagel’s health benefits to your body. Whole-grain bagels will also fill you up more quickly, and provide your body with more substantial nourishment, allowing you to stay full for longer.You can find whole-grain bagels at your local grocery store. If the store also has a health-foods section, look for bagels there also. The health section may contain multiple varieties of whole-grain bagels.
Even allegedly healthy “everything” bagels are made with refined wheat flour, and does not carry the health benefits of whole-grain bagels.;
, In order to decrease the amount of carbohydrates and fiber-less calories that you’re taking in when you eat an entire bagel, instead eat a mini-sized bagel. Mini bagels are sold at most grocery stores, and come in bags which contain 12 individual mini bagels, each about three inches diameter. If your grocery store has a variety of types of bagel, purchase the whole-grain option.Alternately, only eat half of a bagel for your breakfast or lunch. Due to their high carb content, bagels are surprisingly filling, so you likely will not be hungry for the second half after polishing off the first.
If you cut the bagel in half and put one half away before you start eating the second, you’ll be less tempted to eat the entire bagel.

, Since bagels lack fiber and provide little nourishment to your body (other than copious amounts of carbohydrates), why not skip the bagel altogether and choose a similar but healthier option. Whole-grain English muffins or whole-wheat bread can be topped with any of the spreads or ingredients that you would put on your bagel.The fiber present in these bagel substitutes will decrease the speed at which your body digests them, and so allow your body to use the bagel as fuel for a longer period of time. This will result in fewer of the bagel’s calories being converted into sugar, and eventually into body fat.
When selecting a whole-grain English muffin or whole-wheat bread at your local grocery store, look for options that contain at least 5 grams of fiber per serving.

"
"
Watch the calories you’re adding.,
Make your own spreads.,
Top your bagel with a low-fat option.",How to Make Bagels Healthier2," Popular bagel spreads can vary widely in caloric content; before you smear peanut butter on your bagel, compare its calories with other common spreads. Cream cheese contains relatively few calories, although it’s higher in saturated fats: 2 Tbsp contains 98 calories and 10 grams of fat. Compare that with 2 Tbsp peanut butter (188 calories, 16 grams of fat) and 2 Tbsp of butter (200 calories, 22 grams of fat).If you’re preparing a healthy breakfast, opt for fewer calories when you can. Bagels are already a high-calorie food: an average bagel contains about 350 calories, and between 50 and 60 grams of carbohydrates ., Most store-bought bagel spreads are high in either calories or saturated fats. To avoid this problem and to accommodate your own flavor preferences, try making your own spread. For example, for a tangy, Mediterranean flavor, top your bagel with plain Greek yogurt. If you’d like a more complex flavor, mix in herbs such as parsley or mint.You could also purchase or make your own nut butter (for example, almond butter), which will contain more healthy fats than grocery-store-brand butter or peanut butter.

, Grocery stores offer plenty of low-fat spreads that will decrease the fat and caloric content of your bagel overall. Look for low-fat cream cheese, or low-fat spreadable cheeses such as Laughing Cow: a single wedge contains only 2 grams of fat and 35 calories.Other low-fat options—that still contain healthy amounts of protein—include hummus and low-fat cottage cheese.

"
"
Opt for more protein.,
Add vegetables to your bagel.,
Add avocado and dill to your bagel.",How to Make Bagels Healthier3," Bagels themselves lack protein altogether (along with other nutritional components including fiber and minerals). You can make up for this deficit by adding protein of your own. Lox (brined salmon) is a popular topping—typically layered on top of cream cheese and served with tomatoes and capers—and 3 ounces of lox contains 17 grams of protein.Focus on adding lean meats and non-fried protein to keep the fat content of the bagel low. While piling on the fried eggs and bacon will give your bagel protein, these foods will also increase calories and fats.
Rather than adding an entire egg, add only the egg whites for added protein without excessive calories., Don’t just smear on veggie-based cream cheese; top your bagel with cut or chopped vegetables to increase the fiber content and to add important vitamins and minerals that bagels themselves do not contain. If you’re scrambling some eggs (or egg whites) to put on your bagel, throw in some chopped bell peppers or chopped artichoke spears. Alternately, add a sliced tomato to the bagel.If you have enough time in the mornings as you prepare breakfast, consider roasting vegetables to add to your bagel. Roasting veggies draws out their naturally sweet flavors; try roasting sliced zucchini or eggplant to add flavor and texture to your bagel.

, Avocados are high in healthy fats and rich in flavor. Paired with dill and served on top of cream cheese, an avocado makes a delicious and filling topping for your morning bagel. First combine 1 Tbsp of chopped fresh dill with 2 Tbsp of a low-fat cream cheese or Greek yogurt. Mix these ingredients and spread on your bagel. Slice a ripe avocado, and place it on top of a toasted and smeared bagel.Sprinkle the bagel with salt and pepper to taste, and eat before it cools off.

Blend all the dry ingredients together well for your dough.,
Add the water to the dough while mixing slowly.,
Mix the dough more vigorously.,
Check the dough for proper gluten development.",How to Develop Gluten in Bread," Blending the ingredients well before adding water will ensure that the ingredients do not become entrapped in isolated clumps once the water has been added.;
, Incorporating water dissolves the ingredients and begins hydrating the gluten on the surface of the flour.


Adding the water slowly allows more time for hydrating the gluten and more time for the gluten particles to interact with one another. After the water is added, the dough should start to become sticky and cohesive. This is a sign that the gluten is hydrating but it hasn’t started developing yet at this stage.
If the dough still looks dry after the water has been added according to your recipe, gradually add a little more water at a time to fully hydrate the gluten.
You’ve added too much water if the dough looks “soupy.”

, The energy created in mixing is required for the gluten particles to interact and create a matrix that allows for the entrapment and expansion of air.


At the start of this process, the dough should be sticking together and forming a cohesive mass. Your goal at this stage is to turn the sticky ball without any elastic properties into a drier ball that is very elastic and holds it shape well.
If the dough becomes over-mixed, it will lose the elasticity and look as if it were over-hydrated.

, Once the watering and mixing stages are complete, the dough needs to be checked for proper gluten development. If the gluten is not developed completely at this point, the dough can still be saved by adding more water or mixing longer, or by a combination of both.


The dough should be a cohesive mass that is smooth throughout. If the dough is mixed properly and the gluten is completely developed, it will be slightly sticky or not sticky at all when handled and will stay as one piece when moved.
A small piece of dough should stretch without tearing when stretched gently in your hands. You should be able to stretch it until it forms a thin translucent film without any having any thick spots or tears.

Grease a 9 x 13 inch (23cm x 33cm) pan. Consider using cooking spray for a reduced calorie brownie (but not by much) or take a stick of butter and run it along the bottom and sides of the pan.
Assemble your mixer, bowls, rubber spatula and ingredients. Pre-measuring the ingredients and placing in separate bowls will also make the process move a little quicker.;
, Since you'll be mingling other ingredients into the brownie mix, don’t add or improvise with the package recipe.


Consider using an electric mixer to ensure the batter is fully integrated. If you don’t have an electric mixer, use a wire whisk to blend ingredients.
Pour the batter into the greased pan and bake according to package directions (usually about 15 minutes in a 350 degree/180ºC oven).

, In a separate bowl, gently toss the remaining ingredients together.


Break graham crackers into 1-inch (2.5cm) pieces. Don't crush or crumble the graham crackers but make sure you have nice chunky pieces, just as how you'd find them in an actual s’more.
Dice the chocolate and into large chunks. If possible, use a higher grade milk chocolate to really bring out the flavor in the brownies and marshmallows.
Toss the marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers together in a large bowl until fully integrated. The idea will be to spread an equal amount of chocolate, marshmallow and graham cracker over the warm, baked brownies.

, In honor of campfire s’mores, you'll want the marshmallow to melt over the top and combine with melted chocolate.


Allow warm s’more brownies to cool before serving. You don't want the brownies to be served cold but provide enough time for the brownie and s’more mixture to congeal and bind before serving (or you could have a big mess).

Use a heavy sauce pan and melt the butter and chocolate over medium-high heat. Watch the pot closely to make sure nothing burns.It's a good idea to remove the butter while it's still somewhat solid. Butter can burn easily. If the chocolate is melted and there is still a small chunk of butter that is solid, remove the pan from the heat. Mix everything together until the butter melts as well.
After melting, allow your butter and chocolate mixture to cool off until it reaches room temperature. This should take about 15 minutes.;
, Once the butter and chocolate mixture is cool, add your sugar. Use a mixing spoon to stir in the sugar. Keep stirring until you have an even mixture., Start with the eggs, adding them one at a time. Use a wire whisk to gently whisk each egg into the batter until the mixture is smooth and even. Once the eggs are added, whisk in the vanilla., To fold in the ingredients, add the flour and salt to the top of the butter mixture. From there, use a rubber spatula. Starting at the back of the bowl, cut a vertical line through the ingredients across the bottom of the bowl.Rotate the bowl a quarter of a circle and cut another vertical line using your spatula. Continue this pattern. Eventually, the ingredients should all mix together evenly.

, Take an 11 by 7 inch baking pan (approximately 28 by 18 centimeters). Spray with a non-stick baking spray. Then, pour your brownie batter into the pan using a spatula or spoon., Brownies should be baked at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (about 178 degrees Celsius). The brownies should bake for about 35 minutes.Check to make sure your brownies are done before removing them from the oven. To do this, stick a toothpick in the center of the brownies. It should come out clean. If there is batter on it, bake the brownies for a few more minutes.

, After removing them from the oven, set the brownies aside for an hour or so. You want them to cool completely before proceeding.

, There is no precise size to cut your brownie bites. It depends on personal preference. Use a knife to cut the brownies into bite-sized portions. You can do this by cutting vertical lines through the brownies, followed by horizontal lines.For the cleanest cuts, use a cold knife. You can put a butter knife in the refrigerator for an hour, for example, and then use it to cut the brownies.

, Set your brownie bits in a refrigerator. You should let them chill for at least an hour. This way, they will be solid enough to dip in your chocolate mixture.As the brownie bits will not be in the fridge for long, it's okay to put them in uncovered. However, you can put aluminum or plastic covering over the brownie bits if you want.

, Place your chocolate squares in a microwave safe bowl. Place them in a microwave for 30 seconds. Then remove them and stir. Keep microwaving the chocolate in 30 second intervals until it's completely melted., Remove the brownie bites from the refrigerator. Dip them into your chocolate mixture one at a time., You can decorate the brownies as desired after dipping them in the chocolate. You can add decorative sprinkles or sparkling sugar, for example.If there is a special occasion, decorate the brownie bites to reflect this. For example, you can use red and green sprinkles for Christmas or pink sprinkles for Valentine's Day.
If you're making the brownie bites for a friend, use decorations they would like. If you're making them for a child's birthday party, for example, glittery sugar may be appropriate.

, After the brownie bites have been dipped in chocolate and decorated, place them in refrigerator again. Chill them until the chocolate hardens. How long this will take depends on the precise coolness of your refrigerator, but it generally takes around 20 minutes., You should store your brownie bites at room temperature in an airtight container. They should keep for about 3 to 4 days. After this point, you should discard your brownie bites."

Fry the bacon and turn it every once in a while. It should become crispy after about 10 minutes. Use tongs to place the bacon on a cutting board. Pour 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings into a prep bowl and set it aside.If your bacon is very greasy, consider setting the fried bacon on a few paper towels before you chop it. The paper towels will absorb the excess grease.;
, Chop the bacon into 1/2-inch (12 mm) pieces. Set the bacon pieces aside and get out sharp cheddar cheese. Grate 1½ to 2 cups (150 to 200 g) of cheese. Measure out 1/3 cup (35 g) of the cheese and set it aside to sprinkle over the dough before it bakes., Measure all of the bacon cheddar bread dough ingredients into a mixing bowl. You'll also want to add two-thirds of the chopped bacon and the shredded cheddar to the bowl. For the dough, you'll need:3 cups(360 g) white bread flour
1 tablespoon bacon drippings
1¼ cups (300 ml) warm water
1½ teaspoons salt
2¼ teaspoons instant yeast
1 tablespoon sugar

, Use a stand mixer to beat the dough on low speed until the flour is moistened. Put the dough hook attachment on the mixer and beat the dough for 10 to 15 minutes on medium speed. The dough should become smooth and elastic.Although you could make this recipe by hand (using a wooden spoon), you should avoid making this recipe with an electric hand mixer. The motor on an electric mixer will not be strong enough to handle the stiff dough., Spread a little olive oil in a large bowl. Use your hands to shape the dough into a ball and set it in the oiled bowl. Turn the dough a few times, so it's lightly coated in oil., Cover the bowl with greased plastic wrap or a damp cloth. Set the bowl in a warm place and let the dough rest for about one hour. The dough should double in volume. The dough should spring back when you gently press it with your finger.Avoid proving the dough for too long or your dough will deflate as it bakes.

, Sprinkle some flour on your work surface and scoop the dough onto it. Use a knife or bench scraper to cut the dough in half. Take one half of the dough and shape it into an oblong loaf. Do this with the other dough half and set both of them on a baking sheet.Ensure that the loaves are several inches apart, so they don't bake into each other.

, Place the baking sheet inside a large plastic bag and put it the sheet in a warm place. Let the loaves prove for one hour. They should double in volume once they're ready to bake. While the dough proves, turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C).If you wait until your dough has proved to turn on the oven, your loaves may rise too much. This could cause them to shrink when they bake.

, Dip a pastry brush in 2 teaspoons of milk and spread the milk over the tops of the loaves. Sprinkle each loaf with some of the reserved chopped bacon and shredded cheddar cheese., Put the baking sheet in the oven and bake the bread for 25 to 30 minutes. The bread should become golden brown and the cheese will melt and bubble a little. Remove the bread from the oven and let them cool before you serve them.These are best served the day you bake them, but you can store them in an airtight container for a few days.

You want just a light coating of oil in the bowl. If the oil is pooling in the bottom of the bowl, you have too much.
You can use cooking oil spray to get a light, even coat in the bowl.

, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a tea towel.

, Set the bowl on a countertop or table at room temperature. Place it in an area free of drafts.


The dough should rest for a minimum of 12 hours. If you let it rest for 18 hours, you'll get the most flavorful artisan bread.

, Scrape the bread dough out of the bowl and onto the floured counter. Add just a bit of flour to the top of the artisan bread dough.

, The dough will be very sticky at this point. Use the scraper to help you fold the bread.

, You can also cover the dough with the inverted mixing bowl. Letting the dough rest for 15 minutes will make it easier to shape.

,


Don't worry too much about making the ball perfect in shape. It can be sloppy and jagged. The bread will straighten out once baked.

, Let the dough rest for another 2 hours.

",How to Make a Microwave Simple Bread," First, add five tablespoons of all-purpose bleached flour. You can also include other types of flour – almond flour, buckwheat flour, whole-wheat flour, etc. Mix these other flour types in with the all-purpose flour, if you like, but be aware that every type of flour has its own moisture content and baking properties. Changing the flour may alter the recipe.Use chemically-treated ""bleached"" flour, if possible. Bleached flour contains less protein than unbleached flour, and it is better for quick breads.;
, The baking powder will make the bread ""rise"" by increasing its volume. Don't add too much, or else the dough may rise out of control!The vanilla is optional: it won't impact the baking process and it can give the bread a pleasantly sweet taste.

, Break an egg and stir it thoroughly into the mixture. The egg size does not matter, although a larger egg will make a somewhat moister bread. Be careful not to leave any eggshell shards in the dough.

, You can use any milk that you prefer: cow milk, almond milk, rice milk, coconut milk, hemp milk. A thicker milk will make for a slightly richer bread. The main function of the milk, however, is to moisten the dough so that the flour sticks together.

, Again, this functions to moisten the dough so that the flour sticks. If you don't use water, your bread will be much too dry. Mix the water into the bowl with everything else.

, You can use olive oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, coconut oil – anything that you prefer to bake with. The main function of the oil is to thicken the dough and moisten the bread, so you may find that taste is the biggest difference between oils.

, Use clean hands to mix the dough more thoroughly and stabilize the consistency. Massage the batter firmly, and try to mix the moisture evenly through. Knead the dough for 2-5 minutes, or until you can stretch it apart without it disintegrating.

, Use clean hands to gently shape the dough into a ball or an ovular shape. This is the shape that the final loaf will take, so consider whether you need your bread to take any particular form. Score the top of the loaf with an X so that it doesn't crack while rising.

, Most ceramic and glass containers are safe – but you should not microwave metal under any circumstances. Many microwave-safe containers are labeled as such. Make sure that the dish is shallow, with a flat bottom: you will need to get the bread out afterward.Try using a large ceramic mug. This container is microwave-safe, ideally sized, and easy to remove without scalding yourself. This is best for single servings.

, When you remove the bread, it should be ready to eat. If your microwave has a window, check in on the dough periodically to make sure that it isn't overcooked or rising out of control. If the dough starts to look dry, flaky, or shriveled, you might have heated all of the moisture out of it! Slice and serve your bread.

Let the yeast do its job and allow the mixture to double in size (at least two hours).;
,
Mix 2 tbsp of malt powder (or 1 tbsp of barley malt syrup), 2 tbsp of honey, 1/2 tsp yeast, 3 tsp salt and about 3 cups of the bread flour to the sponge. Save the remaining 3/4 cup of flour for kneading. This step is easily accomplished in a bread machine or stand mixer. If you’ve used the high-gluten flour, this step might take additional strength and effort (your bread machine might overheat!)
Once all of the ingredients have been mixed in, knead the dough by hand, adding the remaining flour as necessary for about 6 to 10 minutes, until the dough is a little stiff (not tacky) and a little springy. It should be satiny and smooth, without any dry bits of flour.

, 3-7/8 oz. to 4 oz. yields about 16.
Shape these into round smooth balls by using your thumbs to pull one surface of the dough around to that it forms a nice smooth skin and squeeze the folds on the bottom together to seal this ball. Take it and roll it between both cupped palms to further smooth out the folds and form a nearly perfectly round ball.
Places these on a piece of greased parchment paper on a cookie sheet. You can let them rest for about 10 – 20 minutes to allow the gluten strings to reform before shaping them or begin shaping them once the last ball has been formed.

, With fingers of both hands, begin enlarging the hole until it is at least 3″ in diameter. Work your hands around the circle so that the dough remains the same thickness around the hole. As the hole closes up, keep stretching it until it shrinks to no less than about 2″ diameter when relaxed. As each bagel is formed, place them on the greased parchment, or an oiled silicone baking mat. 6 – 8 large bagels will fit on one cookie sheet, or up to 12 if they're smaller. It’s essential that the bagels lift off of the parchment without stretching when ready to move towards the baking steps, so be sure that the surface is well greased.

, Once the bagels have been formed, let them rest for a few minutes to allow them to proof. You can tell if they’re ready by dropping a test bagel into a pot of room temperature water. If it floats, pat it dry. They’re ready for retarding. If it sinks, allow the bagels to rest for a few minutes longer. Spray the bagels with a light cooking oil spray and lay a sheet of plastic wrap over them. Now place them in the refrigerator to sit overnight or up to 36 hours. Retarding the dough allows the yeast to work on the proteins in the dough and yields some of the classic flavors that make bagels taste like bagels.

, It’s true, but it is only a small part of the whole picture. The preceding steps have just as much to do with baking an authentic bagel as the boiling does.


Place two baking racks in the center of the oven and preheat to 500 °F (260 °C).
Fill a pot with water and add two tablespoons of the malt powder (or one tablespoon of barley malt syrup) while the water is still cool. Optional step: add 1 tbsp of baking soda to make it a little more alkaline. Bring it to a boil.
Prepare a couple of baking sheets. If you’re using the oiled parchment, sprinkle some cornmeal or semolina flour on the parchment. If you’re using a silicone baking mat, the cornmeal or semolina is optional.
Take the bagels out of the refrigerator. Carefully lift them and gently place 2 to 3 of them at a time in the boiling water, without crowding them. If you put too many in the water at once, you’ll cool it down below boiling.
Boil them for 30 seconds to a minute on one side and then flip them over and boil for an additional 30 seconds to one minute on the other side. The longer you boil them, the tougher and more chewy the crust will become. Forty-five seconds to 1 minute per side seems to be ideal.
(Note: If you desire a chewier bagel, you can boil these up to two minutes per side. The consistency and flavor will be fine, but there's a small trade-off - your bagels won't rise to a nice rounded height quite as much - they'll tend to be a little flatter when finished.)
Take a slotted spoon and drain them. Place them on the baking sheet and sprinkle them with a topping or leave them plain. You can sprinkle them with a small amount of kosher salt or sesame seeds. Poppy seeds work really well, too. At this point the bagels may appear lumpy and misshapen — not to worry. The magic of the oven will take care of that in no time.

, After five minutes, lower the oven temperature to 450 degrees. Rotate the sheets by turning them around 180 degrees and put the top sheet on the bottom and vice versa. After another five minutes, rotate them as desired. My oven requires that I swap positions at least one more time, but other ovens may vary. Put them back in and bake for approximately 7 to 10 minutes until they’re golden brown (or until they look like the bagels you remember). Once they’re done, place them on cooling racks and let them sit for about 15 minutes. Then enjoy!

Assemble all of your ingredients, which are enough to make 4 or 5 loaves of rustic bread.,
Pour the lukewarm water into the large mixing bowl.,
Add first the yeast, then the sea salt to the water.,
Add all of the unbleached white flour to the mixture.,
Use a mixer with a dough hook to mix the ingredients together.,
Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel or cling wrap and put it in a warm place to allow it to rise.,
Wait for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.,
Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (225 degrees Celsius).

Remove the bread from the oven and place it on a cooling rack.

,
Serve the bread with butter, cheese, cold cuts, French confiture, or eat it dipped in olive oil with sea salt.

",How to Make a Rustic Bread," If you want the bread to have the traditional, crunchy crust, buy 1 or 2 unglazed quarry tiles to bake it on. The ceramic absorbs the moisture, creating a crunchy crust. You can buy unglazed quarry tiles at a carpet or tile store. Before using, rinse with cold water to remove the dust and place on a flat surface to dry. Of course, you can make a rustic bread without using quarry tiles if you prefer a softer crust.;
, Make sure the water isn't too warm, otherwise it will kill the yeast and the dough won't rise.

, Mix it well. This prepares the yeast to combine with the flour and ferment, so the dough rises.

, Do not substitute the unbleached white flour for another type of flour such as whole grain or rye, as they are heavier and will not produce the same texture.

, Knead them for about 5 minutes until they become one mass and combine into a sponge dough. Sponge dough attains its specific flavor by means of a fermentation process, that allows all of the ingredients to blend properly, and multiple rises that enhance the flavor.


You can also mix the ingredients in with a wooden spoon and knead the dough by hand. To do this, once the ingredients form a mass together, sprinkle some flour on a large wooden board, take the dough out of the bowl and knead it on the counter for about five minutes before returning it to the bowl.

, The warmth aids the fermentation process and causes the dough to rise more and faster.

, Some bakers prefer to let the dough rise for 12 hours to create a stronger flavor.

,, Store the rest of the dough in the fridge for later use. When stored, the dough will remain good for about 2 weeks.

, Kneading the dough for the second time blends the ingredients even more, and allows the second rising process to be more effective.

, Popular shapes are a boule, a large round bread, or a baguette, a French bread.

,, Put the baking sheet or pizza tray into the oven and let the dough bake for about 30 minutes until it is brown.

",How to Make a Quick Homemade Bread," It's important that you use water that's very warm, but not too hot! Hot water could kill the yeast. Warm water will wake it up without killing it, which is what you want - that way the yeast will help the bread rise., Use a spoon to stir it all together. The yeast will begin to react with the sugar, and the mixture will become bubbly and foamy. This should happen within just a few minutes.


If 3 minutes have passed and nothing has happened, your yeast might be stale, and you may need to use another batch.
You could also try again using water that's a little warmer or cooler, depending on what temperature you initially tried.

, Five cups will yield two loaves of bread. You can use either all-purpose flour or bread flour. The bread flour might have a bit more height, but all-purpose flour works just fine, too.

, Pour them one at a time over the flour.

, Use either a mixture with a dough hook attachment, a hand mixer or a wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients until they come together in a big, sticky ball of dough.

, You can wash out the mixing bowl and oil that one, or use a separate oiled bowl. It should be at least twice the size as the ball of dough, so the dough has room to rise.

, Cover it loosely with plastic wrap - it shouldn't be airtight - or place a clean dishcloth over the bowl. Put it in a warm area in your kitchen. If your kitchen tends to be drafty, preheat your oven to 200 degrees, turn it off, and put the bowl in there. It'll be just the right temperature for the dough to rise.

, During this time it will start puffing up. It won't quite double in size, but it will rise enough to give the dough a good texture.

, If you have a stand mixer, use the dough hook attachment and knead the dough until it relaxes - about 5 minutes. If you don't have a mixer, you can knead the dough by hand. Turn it out onto a floured surface and use the heels of your hands to knead for 10 minutes, or until the dough relaxes.


You'll know the dough has relaxed when it stops pulling back into a ball shape when you pause your kneading. It should be loose and malleable.
The dough will also start to look shiny and stretchy.

,, Roll it out or press it into a circular shape, like a pizza crust. Use a knife to cut the dough in half, so you have two half-moons of dough.

, Place one piece of dough in front of you so that one of the corners is pointing toward you. Pick up the corner and roll the dough away from your body, like you would a jelly roll. Roll it all the way up until you have a loaf. Repeat with the other piece of dough.


If you don't want a rolled loaf shape, you can divide and shape the dough any way you want. Make traditional loaves, dinner rolls, pizza crust, or any other shape you like.

, Use a knife to make a few slits in the top of each loaf. This helps the bread cook more evenly., A cookie sheet works great, or you could nestle it into a loaf pan.

, It's ready when the top looks slightly golden brown. Serve it with butter and jam or alongside soups and stews.

Use less yeast if all other altitude baking adjustments fail to provide firm bread dough that doesn't collapse after rising and baking.",How to Adjust Bread Recipes for High Altitude1," You may need to use up to 1/4 less flour than the recipe calls for because flour loses moisture at high altitude which creates a dry-tasting finished product. You'll know there is enough moisture your high altitude bread dough when the mass pulls away from the sides of the bowl.


Gradually add flour 1 tbsp. at a time if the batter is too wet or sticky. Your bread dough should be soft and easily handled after re-kneading.;

, at a time, if the dough seems to dry. Your dough should be soft, moist and pull away from the sides of the bowl after re-kneading.

, Good tasting bread depends on a long, slow rising process but bread dough rises twice as fast in high altitude locations. Bread dough that rises rapidly will have a strong yeast-flavor and a dry texture. For the best flavor, allow enough time for 2 separate rising cycles and never let the dough to grow more than twice its size.


Reduce the amount of rising time the recipe calls for by about 15 minutes or until the bread has reached nearly twice its size.
Punch down your dough after the first rising cycle is over. Set into a bowl and allow it to rise again but for half the time of the first cycle.

, At altitude, heat molecules don't have enough energy inside them which results in a lower boiling point but also makes food take longer to cook. Baking at a higher temperature will set the bread structure quickly and stop dough from rising more.

Do you have a friend or neighbor who already has one you can try? The main types of flour mill are:


Hand cranked burr grinder: This can become tiring when used for a lot of grain on a regular basis. The romance soon disappears!
Stand mixer attachment: This can be fitted onto an already existing powerful mixer.
Electric impact grill
Electric stone grinder
;
, If you're only going to be making flour occasionally for fun, the hand grinder version will probably be fine. But if you're going to bake bread regularly, or more than one loaf at a time, go for an electric version to save energy and time.

, When it comes down to actually choosing a mill, ask the following questions:


Is it able to take the amount of grains you want done within a reasonable amount of time?
Are there any known issues about it overheating when it grinds the grain? (You can check people's opinions about individual products online.)
Is it easy or complicated? If you don't like complicated items, be sure it is simple and straightforward to use.
Think about the cleaning. Does it appear to be easy to clean, with pieces coming apart or not?
Look for the ability to adjust between fine or coarse grinding. Does it offer adequate degrees of coarseness for your needs?

, Also be sure to ask if it is easy to source replacement parts if something goes wrong. Grinding can be tough on a flour mill and if a part breaks, you don't want to be left with something useless.

Get a container.,
Mix up the starter.,
Find a home for your starter.,
Wait.,
Feed the starter.,
Feed the starter again.,
Wait some more.,
Switch to unbleached all-purpose flour.,
Feed the starter yet again.,
Wait some more.",How to Make Sourdough Starter1," You'll need some sort of container to provide a home for your starter. Use a small mixing bowl that will hold between 2 to 4 cups (500 to 1000 ml). You can use almost any type of container made for food; however, it is recommended to use a non-reactive container such as glass or plastic. Plan to cover your container with plastic wrap or a clean cloth.;
, Mix 1/4 cup (50 ml) of water with 1/2 cup (50 g) of whole grain flour. If you're weighing your ingredients, use 50 grams each of flour and water. Mix the ingredients until thoroughly-combined and cover with plastic wrap.


Once you've stirred the starter, scrape down the sides of the container. You want to make sure you don't leave ""food"" on the side of the container to feed mold growth.

, You want a place where the starter isn't likely to be disturbed (dogs, children, curious husbands) and where you can maintain the temperature within the 65° to 85°F (18° to 30°C) range.


If you need a warmer area, turning on the light in an oven (but not turning the oven on) will often get you the temperature you need. Similarly, the top of many refrigerators is also a literal hot spot.

, Sourdough is all about patience. What are you waiting for exactly? You want the starter to become active and start bubbling. In time it'll rise and grow like it's alive.


How long are you waiting? 12 hours is usually enough for the starter to become active, so definitely make other plans. Bubbling can begin a few hours into the wait, or it can take as long as 24 hours -- it all depends on the ingredients you used and the environment it's in. If the starter is not active in 12 hours, give it another 12 hours for good measure. If it still isn't active, give it another 12 hours.

And if it's not active after 36 hours, check the steps above to make sure you did them right. If everything was right, throw it out and try again -- it's probably not going to happen. If you've tried twice with no results, try a different brand of flour or type of water.



, When the starter is active, you have to feed it. Add another 1/4 cup (50 ml) of water and stir the starter. Then add 1/2 cup (50 grams) of whole grain flour and stir again until well-combined.


Wait again. You are (once more) waiting for the starter to rise. Usually, the starter will double in size in 12 hours or less. Sometimes it takes 24 hours though, so don't freak out after 12 if it's not looking big enough. If you get good bubbling and the starter doesn't double, that's okay, too.

, However, this time discard half the starter first. Add 1/4 cup (50 ml) of water and stir the starter. What's next? You guessed it: Add 1/2 cup (50 grams) of whole grain flour and stir again. Getting the routine down yet? And yes, it is very important to discard 1/2 the starter at each feeding at this stage. You don't want a flour monster taking over your kitchen counter.


Feeding the starter should double its size. If you don't discard the starter you'll have far too much starter than what you actually need. Later in the process you can save the starter, but at this stage the starter isn't stable enough to warrant saving.

, Again, you want to see the starter bubble and (like clockwork) double in size between feedings at this point. When the starter is established, regular feedings are very important, but don't get over-eager: Feeding the starter too soon could keep the culture from reaching the critical threshold it needs to stay alive. Each feeding dilutes the culture; if you dilute it too much, it'll die.


If at any feeding it doesn't double, give it some more time. When a starter is starting, it is unstable.
Repeat the two steps above until the starter reliably doubles in size between feedings.

, The point of this step is to get rid of unwanted micro-organisms; the whole grain flour keeps adding more of them. Once the sourdough starter is stable, you can switch back to whole grain flour if you'd like.


If you see the starter slow down when you make the switch, don't worry; that's normal. Wait until the starter is active (this may take up to 36 hours) to let it recover from the shock of switching to white flour.

You can ease the transition by not going cold turkey. Make the transition to white flour in 3 rounds, decreasing the amount of whole grain flour a bit more each time. Start by using about 1 part white flour and 3 parts whole grain. For the next feeding, use half white flour and half whole grain. For the feeding after that, use 3 parts white flour and 1 part whole grain. And the next feeding, and subsequent feedings, can be all white flour.



, This is the exact same protocol as last time -- discard half the starter, add 1/4 cup (50 ml) water and stir. Then add 1/2 cup (50 grams) all-purpose flour and stir again. Now that the starter is stable you can start saving the discarded part in another container for other projects (it makes a great gift). If you do decide to keep it, put it in the fridge to prolong its life.

, As mentioned previously, the starter may slow down for a feeding or so as it grows. Don't jump to any conclusions; it just needs time. When it seems to be active and stable, you should be feeding it every 12 hours or so. A starter (at room temperature) should be fed no less than twice a day.


Repeat the two steps above. At this time, the starter is reaching its full potential and growing in strength and maturity. Though it may be tempting, don't try it out until it's about a week old and doubles with each feeding. Most sourdough experts think a starter can continue growing between 30 and 90 days, though ultimately it's unclear.
After about a week, your starter is ready to use!

Melt the butter, cocoa and sugar together.,
Add the eggs and vanilla.,
Stir in the flour.,
Pour the batter into a baking pan.,
Bake the brownies.",How to Make Brownies from Scratch2,", Place these three ingredients in the top part of a double boiler over medium heat. As the ingredients begin to heat, stir constantly. Keep stirring until the butter is melted and the sugar and cocoa have dissolved into the butter. Remove the mixture from heat when it's ready and let it cool for a few minutes before adding the next ingredients.









If you don't have a double boiler, make your own: place a small saucepan into a larger saucepan filled with an inch or two of water. Put the ingredients in the smaller saucepan. Place the contraption over medium heat and stir.
To test whether the mixture is ready for the next step, dip your finger into the chocolate. If it doesn't feel very hot, keep cooking it. If you feel the need to remove your finger, it's ready.

, Use a wooden spoon to quickly beat the eggs and vanilla into the mixture. It will become smooth, glossy and pudding-like. Keep beating until the eggs are fully incorporated into the chocolate mixture.








, Use the wooden spoon to gently stir the flour into the brownie mixture until you no longer see any white spots. Beat the mixture for a minute or two until it's completely smooth.








, An 8 x 8 inch pan is the perfect size for these rich chocolate brownies. Either grease the pan or line it with parchment paper to keep the brownies from sticking, then pour the batter into the pan and use the back of the spoon to smooth the surface.









If you want to add a topping, sprinkle it over the top. You can use coconut, chopped nuts, or another topping of your choice.
To make thicker brownies, use a smaller pan.

, Place the baking pan in the oven and bake the brownies for about 40 minutes, or until a toothpick or fork comes out clean when poked into the center of the pan. Remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool slightly before cutting.

Mix the ingredients.,
Pour the batter into a microwave-safe dish.,
Cook the brownies.",How to Make Brownies from Scratch3," Place all of the ingredients together in a bowl. Use a spoon or a whisk to mix them together until the batter is completely smooth and lump-free.








, Use a glass or ceramic dish that is safe to use in the microwave. Grease it first so the brownies don't stick to the pan. Pour the batter into the dish and use the back of a spoon to smooth the top.








, Place the dish in the microwave and microwave on high for four minutes. Check the brownies; if the top still looks moist, cook for another minute. Keep checking the brownies and cooking them until the top of the brownies are no longer wet.









Insert a toothpick in the center of the brownies; if it comes out mostly clean, they're ready to eat.
Remove the brownies from the microwave and let them cool for a few minutes before cutting them."

Combine the flour and water.,
Add the bunch of grapes, pushing it into the batter.,
Cover the bowl lightly with a clean dish towel or cheesecloth.,
Every day, stir in a tablespoon of water and a tablespoon of flour.,
Continue feeding every day.,
Feed it for a couple more days.,
Cover the starter and refrigerate it.,
Take the starter out of refrigeration the evening before you use it.",How to Make Sourdough Starter2," Stir 1 1/2 cups flour (150 g) and 2 cups (500 ml) mineral water or spring water together in a large plastic or earthenware bowl.


If your tap water tastes fine and doesn't have an odor, it should be effective to use, too. Many people believe that chlorinated water is a starter's death warrant, but start experimenting and use your own experience to judge what gives you the best results.

, Do not mash the grapes or otherwise think their juices need to seep into the batter; it's just the fruit that needs to be present.


You may use plums, or any other fruit that has a natural ""bloom"" of yeast on the skin surface.

, The starter needs to get air but no dust or bugs. Set it on your counter top, preferably in a warm place.


If you put a lid on too tightly, you risk it building up pressure and exploding.
Not too warm. On top of the refrigerator is a nice spot.

, This is called ""feeding"" the sourdough batter. In a couple days there should be signs of ""starting""; namely, bubbling a bit as the yeasts feed on the starch and sugar.


If this doesn't happen within 48 hours, discard the batch and begin again.

, Don't worry if the batter separates; this means the water rises and the flour sinks. This is normal. After 5 or 6 days the starter will develop a good, yet slightly sour, smell. It is yeasty and not unpleasant.


Some schools of thought say that feeding it twice a day is ideal. Experiment to see which method warrants you the best results.

, Do this at least once a day! You'll get a consistency similar to thick drippy pancake batter. After this time, remove and discard the grapes.

, You'll need to feed and stir it every day to keep it healthy. If you begin to get too much batter (say to a gallon), discard the excess.

, It takes four cups starter to make two loaves of bread. Every time you use the starter, replenish it like this:


For each cup starter you remove, stir in 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup cool water.
If you don't use the starter every few days, keep it in the fridge and feed it at least once weekly or it will die. If it gets very yellow and doesn't ""rise"" before baking, discard and start again. Starters have been continued for decades. It is possible (though not always recommended) to freeze your starter and revive it at a later date.

"
"
Keep your starter at slightly above room temperature.,
Feed it regularly.,
Look for little cracks in the surface of the batter.,
Convert other recipes.",How to Make Sourdough Starter3," This is while it's growing. You may move it to the fridge eventually, but if it's still gaining speed, keep it above the fridge or in the oven with the light on.

, If your starter is too thin, increase the amount of flour in each feeding by a couple of tablespoons. But know that thick starters are harder to work with and only experienced bakers generally see good results with them.


A thin starter works too quickly, so a few missed feedings can be catastrophic. Many bakers use a very thick starter and for good reason: These starters develop more flavor, seem to have more strength, are more active than their thinner counterparts and are much more tolerant of a missed feeding. However, a very thick starter can be very difficult for new bakers to work with and maintain. Get the basics down before you go thick.

, As the starter runs out of food, the gas production declines, and the starter begins to fall again, resulting in the drying and cracks. As the starter falls, you may see little ravine-like cracks form on the surface -- believe it or not, this is actually a good thing.


The starter is active and at its peak when it just barely has started to fall. If you're wondering when to use it, it's now.

, Don't be shy -- sourdough can be used for pretty much anything. To convert any recipe to sourdough, start by replacing each packet of yeast (about a teaspoon or 6 grams) with a cup (240 grams) of active sourdough starter. Adjust the recipe to accommodate for the water and flour in the starter already.


If the sourdough taste is too strong for the flavor the bread should be, use more starter next time. And if the bread isn't sourdough-y enough, use less sourdough starter in the future.

One of the best ways to get more flavor out of the starter is to use less of it. Definitely counter-intuitive. But the reason behind that is with less, it takes longer to raise the bread. If you use more starter, you'll get a fast rise, less time for the flavor to soak in, and therefore less sourdough flavor.



"
"
Be careful when refrigerating your starter.,
Don't put the lid on too tightly.,
If the starter has been in storage less than a week, use as normal.,
If the starter has been in storage more than a week, revive it.",How to Make Sourdough Starter4," Some people believe that if a starter gets below 46°F, you shouldn't bother working with it and it should be discarded promptly -- others disagree. If you do store it, it should be at least 30 days old and able to withstand the cooler temperature.


Feed your starter just before you refrigerate it. This seems to help it bounce back faster when you go to use it in the future. A starter that was mature when stored can be very difficult to bring back to life.

, Air pressure will build and possibly explode (or at the very least curb the growing process) the container. Place the lid on, but don't make it air-tight.


Glass is generally a safe bet. Plastic scratches easily and metal will give the starter a metallic-y taste if left in it too long.

, Measure out what you need and put the unused storage starter back in the refrigerator, no harm done. Let the starter you are going to use come to room temperature before you use it, however.


Remember that a starter at room temperature needs to be fed twice a day (even after refrigeration), so don't leave it out without feeding it! It has been going through its stores of starch in the starter while in the refrigerator and if it's going to sit a while, it needs a real feeding.

, Feed the starter for at least three days (twice a day) before using it or putting it back in the refrigerator. Use the same precautions you took when you were growing it (temperature, etc.).


Start the discarding process as normal. Discard 1/2 the starter and then feed another 1/4 cup (50 g) water and 1/2 cup (50 g) flour every 12 hours or so, like you used to in the good ol' days. When the starter is doubling nicely between feedings (good and actively stable), feed it one more time. Clean out your storage container, put the freshly revived starter back in, and then put it back into the fridge to be revived again later.

Again, the keys to a successful starter are to feed the starter until it is doubling consistently between feedings, to fill the cleaned jar no more than 1/2 full (it needs air), and to refrigerate immediately after you feed the starter (once it's mature, of course).

Select a jar to hold the dry ingredients.,
Sterilize or properly clean the brownie mix jar.,
Choose ribbon and/or wrapping.",How to Make Brownies in a Jar1," A mason jar with an accompanying lid is ideal, however you can hold ingredients in a variety of interesting, transparent or lightly colored containers.

Consider using disposable Tupperware. Disposable Tupperware is ideal if you are giving gifts to teachers or other individuals where your child will be presenting the gift (so you don’t have to worry about glass breakage).



 


Fancy jars can make a great gift. Local craft or glass warehouses have a variety of containers with cork tops or lids. If you want to get a little more creative, stop by one of these shops to explore other possibilities.





;
, Make sure you’ve removed any dust, debris or dirt that might have accumulated inside and outside of the jar before adding the ingredients. You might also need to remove any labels that aren't forming part of the gift.


Wait to add ingredients until the jar is completely dry. If the jar you’ve chosen has a narrow opening (and you can’t stuff a paper towel inside to dry it), allow ample time (which could be a few days) for it to air dry. If you add dry ingredients to a wet bottle it could ruin the gift.

, Presentation is everything, especially if you're giving these brownies as a gift. For an old-fashioned presentation, wrap a mason jar containing brownie mix inside a gingham patterned cloth and tie with a jute ribbon. Or, you could include the brownie mix in a larger basket of goodies/items and tie a simple white ribbon around the top.

Heat the oil.,
Add sliced bread to the pan.,
Spice it up (optional).,
Cook for a few seconds or until golden brown.",How to Cook Fried Bread1," Fried bread is almost always eaten with one or more other fried foods, as part of an English breakfast. This often includes eggs, English bacon, sausage, sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, and baked beans. Fry them all in the same pan before you start your bread.


If cooking all of the above, start the sausages first, the mushrooms a couple minutes later, then the other ingredients a few minutes later. Finish with the fried eggs.;
, Depending on how much meat and butter you used in the fry-up, you might already have enough fat in the pan. But let's be honest: caloric introspection has no place when frying bread. Add a small knob of butter, a splash of flavorful vegetable oil or, more traditionally, bacon drippings or lard.

, Turn the stove on medium-high until the oil shimmers and gives off heat. A hot pan will keep the bread crisp, instead of weighed down by soggy grease.

, Slightly stale white bread is perfect, as the dry slice will soak up the flavorful oil more quickly. Save that fresh loaf of whole grain for the people who want toast instead.


Slice the bread into triangles if you have a small pan.

, A small sprinkle of salt and a quick turn of the pepper mill will add some flavor, but this isn't mandatory. Cayenne pepper is another option for people who enjoy spice with their breakfast.

, If the pan is hot and oily enough, you'll only need a few seconds on each side to make the bread crisp, golden brown, and full of the flavors of the fried meal. If your pan was too cold and not sizzling, you may need to fry the bread for 15–30 seconds, but pull it out before it gets too soggy.

, Don't be worried if your baguette cracks a little, and some pieces fall off. This is normal since the baguette's crust is hard and brittle. Don't use too much force, but do it slowly and gently to prevent the baguette from suddenly cracking in half.

, Your front teeth will be too fragile, and the back teeth will not be sharp enough to cut through the crust. After you have bitten into it, tear the baguette away from your mouth in a swift motion, using both your hands and your teeth.

, It might be hard to chew the crust, but the inside is actually really soft. Don't eat too much at once, or you won't be able to chew it all. It might help to switch sides once in a while to prevent strain on a certain tooth.


It might take a long time to chew the baguette, but don't force it down your throat. Just take smaller bites so you have less to chew.

, Spread a slice with butter, margarine, cream cheese or a vegan alternative to moisten the bread then eat as you would a cracker, cookie or biscuit. The slice will have a manageable amount of crust and the spread will make it easier for your salivary glands to handle. Tackling an entire baguette is a bit ambitious.;
, You can toast the baguette before eating for a crispier and fresher taste beforehand. Simply cut the lengthwise, then cut width to the desired size. Then you can start adding meat and vegetables of your choice.

, Simply cut the baguette in half, and add smoky turkey as well as cheese, lettuce, and other foods. You can switch up this recipe to your own preferences.

, There's a lot of pleasure in biting into the crust of a crispy baguette, then discovering something inside it. Cut the baguette in the half width-wise, and remove the inside of the baguette. You can use that for something else, such as dipping it in soup. Stuff with fresh food.

Fry the arepas.,
Bake the arepas.,
Slice the arepas.",How to Cook Arepas1," Place the maize flour and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Use your fingers or a whisk to thoroughly combine them. Measure warm water and slowly pour it over the flour.


Buy maize flour that has been pre-cooked, such as Harina P.A.N., the classic flour used in Venezuela. This flour is gluten and preservative free and comes in both white and yellow.
If maize flour isn't available in your area, you can substitute it for fine-ground cornmeal or flour but make sure it is pre-cooked.;
, Use your hands to knead the flour and water together to create a soft, pliable dough. Continue kneading until the dough has no more grainy lumps and can be rolled into a ball without falling apart.


If the dough seems too wet, add a few tablespoons of flour and continue kneading.
If the dough falls apart easily, add a tablespoon or two of warm water. Continue adding water until the dough has reached the correct texture.

, Take a handful of dough in your hands and shape it into a ball, then press it with your palms to form a large patty shape. It should be about 1/2 inch thick and 3 or 4 inches across, depending on how large you want your arepas to be. Place the first arepa on a baking sheet and continue shaping arepas until you run out of dough.


If you want to save the arepas to be cooked later, you may cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for 3 or 4 days.
You can freeze uncooked arepas, too. Wrap each one in plastic wrap and place them in a seal-able freezer container. They will keep this way for several months.

,, Do this when you're ready to cook the arepas, before you begin to fry them. The oven should be fully preheated before you place the arepas inside.

, Heat a spoonful of oil in a large cast iron skillet or frying pan over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, place a few arepas in the pan and let them fry until a crust forms on one side, about 3 or 4 minutes. Flip them over and fry on the other side until a golden brown crust has formed. Set them on a baking sheet and finish frying the remaining arepas.

, Once all the arepas have been fried and placed on a baking sheet, place them in the preheated oven. Bake them for 15 minutes. When you think they're ready, take them out of the oven and tap the top of the arepas. If they sound hollow - as if there is nothing inside - that means the arepas are ready.

, Use a sharp knife to slice the arepas in half lengthwise, then stuff with your favorite filling and enjoy.

Read the label.,
Consider oats.,
Choose between fresh and frozen.,
Choose a variety.,
Consider where to buy the bread.",How to Buy Gluten Free Bread,"


Learning to read labels if following a gluten free diet is essential. Be familiar with terms such as malt, triticale, dextrin, dinkel and edible starch; these are all names of products that are or contain gluten. Also check the label carefully. A product that claims to be gluten free may have been manufactured on equipment that also produces bread that contains gluten, which might cause cross contamination. To be truly gluten free, the bread should have no gluten ingredients and be made in a gluten free environment.;
,


The international medical community has not reached a consensus regarding the use of oats in a gluten free diet. There are breads labeled as gluten free that contain oats, and others that do not. The argument is that oats have nearly always been cross-contaminated by other grains during processing or distribution, and thereby contain trace amounts of gluten. Some research has also shown that avenin, a protein found in oats, can elicit the same result as gluten if ingested by celiac disease sufferers. Other people show no sensitivity to it at all. If in doubt, choose bread that does not contain oats.

,


Fresh gluten free breads are often an all natural product. They contain few, if any, preservatives and are frozen to retain freshness. Despite being frozen, frozen gluten free bread can become easily freezer burned if not wrapped tightly and kept in a deep freeze.
Frozen gluten free breads are often sold that way because they lack the preservatives required to keep the bread fresh until it is consumed. These breads can contain a dizzying number of ingredients combined to most closely mimic regular wheat flour bread.

,


Gluten free bread makers have risen to the challenge of mimicking wheat flour breads, and like traditional breads, the gluten free ones are available in a variety of flavors. From cinnamon and raisin to cheese bread, your supermarket should carry a selection of different flavored breads.

,


A natural food store may carry a larger selection of gluten free breads, even if the store is smaller than your local supermarket. Supermarkets stock products according to demand; if you want them to carry more gluten free breads, then make sure you tell the managers. Supermarkets in large urban centers typically carry a wide variety of gluten free breads, and they are usually lower in cost than those found in specialty markets.

Cut a hole in a slice of bread with a cookie cutter or knife.,
Heat butter or oil over medium-low.,
Place the bread in the pan.,
Crack an egg into the hole.,
Add salt and pepper to taste.,
Flip the bread once the egg white is mostly opaque.,
Finish frying and serve.",How to Cook Fried Bread2," You can use just about any type of bread for this method, as long as it can be sliced without crumbling apart. Cut a hole in the center of the bread using a cookie cutter, or cut out a shape using a knife. You can fry the cut-out shape as an addition, or nibble it while you cook.


Use a heart-shaped cookie cutter for a romantic breakfast.
If you use a knife, put the slice of bread flat on the cutting board, and use the tip of the knife in an up-and-down motion, perforating the bread with small holes rather than tearing through the bread directly.

, Add a generous amount of butter or cooking oil to a frying pan or skillet. Give it a minute to heat up, or a couple minutes if you are using an electric stove. It should be hot enough to give off a nice sizzle when you place the bread in.


Don't use high heat, or the bread will burn before the egg is cooked.

, Make sure the butter or oil is spread evenly over the pan, then drop the bread slice onto it. Immediately move on to the next step.


Optionally, add the cut-out section of bread as well, if it stayed in one piece.

, Crack an egg directly into the hole at the center of the bread, from just above the pan.

, If serving guests, you can provide this on the dining table instead.


Alternatively, cook alongside anything you would enjoy on an omelette. Try grating a few shreds of cheddar cheese and placing it over the cut-out bread shape.

, You can cook your egg in your preferred style, but a runny egg will be easier, since the bread is less likely to char. After a minute or two, or until the egg white is mostly opaque, but still translucent in places, flip the egg and bread together with a spatula or cooking tongs.

, Cook the other side of the eggy in a basket for another minute or two, until the egg white is fully cooked and firm, and the bread is brown. Now that the egg is more cooked, you can move the bread around the pan with the spatula, soaking up the butter or oil.

Fry the bread.,
Serve the French toast.",How to Cook Fried Bread3," Pre-sliced bread is usually too thin and too flavorless to make good French toast, sometimes called eggy bread or French-fried bread. Instead, slice a loaf of challah, egg bread, brioche, or other thin-crust, tight-crumbed bread into slices ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 centimeters) thick.Ideally, leave a fresh loaf out overnight to make it slightly dry and absorbent; fresh bread should work fine if this is not feasible.
""Tight-crumbed"" refers to the interior of the loaf, which should be spongy and free from large holes.

, Before you start frying, you'll need a soupy custard-like batter that will envelope the bread in a golden envelope. To make enough batter for eight slices of French toast, beat together the following:


3 large eggs
Pinch of salt
⅔ cup (160 mL) half-and-half. Substitute whole milk for a healthier alternative, or cream for an extremely rich dish.Use well-shaken buttermilk instead for additional flavor.Use less dairy for thin-sliced bread, or if your French toast ends up soggy., French toast can be a sweet or savory dish. Flavor your batter accordingly:



For sweet toast, mix in 1 tbsp (15 mL) sugar and 1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla extract. If you do not plan on serving the toast with maple syrup or another sugary topping, you can mix in an addition 1 or 2 tbsp (15–30 mL) sugar. Optionally, add 2 tsp (10 mL) cinnamon and/or 2 tsp (10 mL) freshly grated orange peel.For savory toast, mix in 5 tsp (20 mL) hot sauce, 3 tbsp (45 mL) chopped basil, and a generous amount of black pepper.Parmesan, garlic, and any savory herbs can be added as well, or substitute for the other ingredients., Pour the batter into a wide pan, and place the slices of bread into it to soak. Many cooks prefer to whip up this recipe quickly, and only soak the bread briefly while they heat up the pan of butter. Soaking for as long as 15–20 minutes, however, will increase the amount of batter absorbed, and is recommended if you are using dense, thick slices of bread.Flip the bread over once, halfway through the soaking process.

, You'll need about 2–3 tbsp (30–45 mL) butter total, but unless you have a skillet that can fit eight slices of bread, you'll probably be dividing it into three or four batches. Melt the butter in the pan, and heat until it foams and subsides.


You can use a neutral-flavored cooking oil such as canola oil or peanut oil instead, but the dish will be less flavorful.
A small amount of oil mixed with the butter will prevent it from burning. This may be helpful on an electric stovetop or skillets that heat unevenly.

, Drop as much bread as comfortably fits in the pan. Fry until golden brown on one side, then flip and cook the other side. This will only take a couple minutes on each side.


If you have additional slices of battered bread to fry, quickly wipe up the remaining butter with a dry paper towel, then melt more butter in the pan before adding the next slices.
Spreading custard is a sign that your pan is not hot enough, or that there is too much liquid in your batter., French toast can be served plain, or with a variety of toppings. Try maple syrup, fresh fruit, or powdered sugar for sweet varieties. Savory French toast can be eaten with pesto, sautéed vegetables, or Parmesan.

If you can't find one of the traditional Venezuelan cheese varieties, you can substitute queso fresco or mozzarella.
For a less traditional but equally delicious breakfast filling, try scrambled eggs and salsa.

, Arepas are often eaten plain, or with a simple filling of cheese as a snack. For a heartier snack, make one of these simple arepa fillings:


Chicken salad and avocado. Combine chopped chicken meat, mayonnaise, diced onions, and diced celery with salt and pepper to taste. Spread it over one half of the arepa and add a few slices of avocado, then top with the other arepa half.
Black beans and salsa. Spread black bean paste or whole black beans on one side of the arepa, and top with spicy salsa. You can also add a few slices of cheese to make the arepa richer.

, After arepas, de Pabellón is Venezuela's most treasured dish. The combination of the two is exquisite. A de Pabellón arepa consists of the following ingredients:


Pulled or shredded beef, black beans, and fried plantains. This is the most classic version.
Top the beef, beans and plantains with a fried egg and cheese to take it over the top.

Close everything up and press Start.",How to Use a Bread Machine," Take some time to inspect it. There is a hinged lid, which can be lifted and shut; there may be a window in it, and probably a small vent too. Next to the lid, you should see a control panel with a few buttons (and maybe a light or two if you have a fancy version). Inside the bread machine, there is a bread pan or bucket. There should be a handle on it, which is probably folded down so the lid will close. The bread bucket works as both the mixing bowl and the baking pan. In the center of the bread bucket will be a little bread paddle or kneading blade. It is responsible for kneading and mixing the dough. When the dough bakes, it bakes around the kneading blade. You must remove the blade from the bottom of the loaf after the bread is baked.


You must have all three parts to make bread. The machine itself, the bread bucket, and the kneading blade. If any one of these parts is missing, you must replace it. The kneading blade is the smallest part and the one most likely to be missing. It is also the least expensive to replace. If you need replacement parts then do an Internet search to find the manufacturer of your machine. Go to their website and email them about what you need.
The bread bucket and kneading blade are removable. To take the bread bucket out, your machine may require you to pull hard, depending on how it snaps in. Look it over, grab the handle, and pull. Don’t worry; you are not breaking it. After you get the bread pan out, examine it. If you turn it upside down, the kneading blade will fall out. There will be a peg inside the bread pan the kneading blade fits over. To put the bread bucket back into the machine and snap it into place, you may have to shove down hard. Yours may go in easily or you may have to turn the gear under the bread bucket just slightly to get it to fit into the machine the right way.

, Take the bread bucket out set it next to the sink. Get a measuring cup and fill it with water. Pour the water into the bread bucket. Do it repeatedly, until the bucket is full. Count how many cups of water you are adding to the bucket, until you get a total. This part is important, so measure carefully. When you choose a recipe, it is important that you match it up to the size of the bread bucket you have. You would not want to make a 2 lb recipe in a 1 lb machine. It would result in a big mess.


If your bread bucket holds 10 cups of water then you can make 1-1/2 pound loaves of bread.
If your bread bucket holds 12 cups or more than you can make 2 pound loaves of bread.
If your bucket holds less than 10 cups then you can make 1 pound loaves of bread.

, Have a good look at the buttons and display screen on the control panel. You will probably find a Select button, a Stop/Start button, Crust Color and Timer or Arrow buttons. Unplug your machine. Plug it back in. The machine will be on its Basic (or default) setting now.


Close to the select button you will see several choices. The most common ones are White or Basic; Whole Wheat; French; Sweet; Rapid, & Dough. To set the machine to a particular cycle you have to keep pressing the Select button until it gets to the cycle you want. Sometimes a number identifies each cycle. For instance, White or Basic is usually 1. Whole Wheat is 2. French is 3; and so on; you get the idea. Each cycle takes a different amount of time to mix and cook the bread.
The crust setting is not available on all machines. If you do see a button labeled Crust then it will have 3 settings available: Light, Medium & Dark. The default setting is medium. When you unplug the machine and then plug it back in, it will automatically set itself to the medium setting. If you prefer a light or dark crust instead, then you press the Crust button to change the setting. Usually the Crust button will not work until after you select the dough cycle and before you press Start.
Using the timer is described in a separate section, below.

, There are a few basic ingredients you need to make bread in a bread machine. They are yeast, flour, salt, sugar, liquids and fats.



Yeast used in a bread machine should always be labeled “Active Dry” on the label. Sometimes you can buy yeast in a jar that says it is specifically for bread machines. Packets of yeast, available in the baking aisle of the grocery store, usually hold 2-1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast. You may use one packet of yeast to replace 2 teaspoons of yeast in most bread machine recipes. The extra 1/4 teaspoon of yeast won’t make that much difference. Don’t use rapid rise yeast. It's not worth the extra cost, and the time savings is negligible once you get the hand of making bread.
Bread flour makes better bread. Bread flour is made from hard wheat so it has more gluten, or wheat protein, in it than regular all-purpose flour. All-purpose flour is a blend of hard and soft wheat. This makes it serviceable for biscuits, cakes and quick breads, which prefer soft wheat flour; and serviceable for yeast bread, which prefers hard wheat flour. It is called all-purpose flour because it is designed to be used for all baking purposes. Bread flour is made for yeast bread. If you do not have bread flour then you may use all-purpose flour for most bread recipes. Your results will not be the same as if you had used bread flour, but you will still have good results, and you will still get good bread. Sometimes you will need to add a tiny bit more flour to your dough if you use all-purpose flour. This is not always true but it is sometimes.
Salt is a necessary ingredient in machine made bread. It regulates the rising process so the bread dough does not spill over the bread bucket into the machine. Salt also adds flavor to the bread. Bread made without salt does not taste as good as bread made with some salt.
Sugar, honey and other sweeteners soften the texture of the dough and the finished loaf. They also contribute to the browning of the bread and the crispness of the crust. The main role they play, though, is as easy-to-use-food for the yeast. Yeast can use the starch in flour for its food but it is much happier if it gets an easy to use food like sugar or honey. Most bread machine recipes call for at least a small amount of sugar. However, bread machine breads do best if they do not have too much sugar added to them. When making sweet dough from scratch it is not unusual to add a full cup of sugar to the dough. When making sweet dough in the machine,, though it is better to use 1/4 to 1/2-cup of sugar or honey at the most. This is because the dough rises faster and higher in a bread machine than it does when prepared by hand. Too much sugar is too much food for the yeast and it gets over-excited. This can result in a machine made mess that is unpleasant to clean up.
Liquids used in a bread machine should be room temperature or a little bit warmer. You should never use hot liquids in a bread machine. Liquids that are too hot will kill the yeast. Room temperature liquids make the yeast happy. If you are using tap water then warm tap water is fine. If you are using yogurt or buttermilk you may want to take it out of the fridge to warm up a bit before you use it in the bread machine. (This is not strictly necessary, especially for breads baked on the Basic Cycle or longer. If you are using the Rapid Cycle though it is important the liquids be warm or at least at room temperature.)
Fats make the finished loaf richer, softer, and keep the dough from sticking to the non-stick surface of the bread pan. Usually between 1 and 4-tablespoons of fat are used in a 2 lb loaf of bread machine dough. You can use most fats interchangeably in a bread machine. Margarine, oil, shortening, lard, chicken fat, bacon grease or butter will all give you the same results. Some of the fats will add a different flavor, and the texture of the bread will change slightly, depending on which type of fat you use. Solid fats do not have to be melted before adding them to the bread machine. It helps if they are at room temperature, but this is not always practical.

, If you are going to mix and bake the dough right away then it does not matter which order you add the ingredients. If you want to program the machine with the Delay Cycle to start while you are away, then the order becomes important. The ingredients must be added in a way that will keep them inert until the machine begins its mixing. Therefore it is a good idea to get in the habit of adding the ingredients in this way from the beginning.


Put the liquids into the machine first.
Next add the flour. As you are adding the flour, urge it out over the top of the water so it seals the water in.
Then you can add the other dry ingredients like salt, sugar, dry milk powder and seasonings.
The last thing you should add is the yeast. Most recipes suggest that you make a shallow indentation or well in the center of the flour and sprinkle the yeast into it. This is important because it prevents the yeast from touching the liquid until the machine begins mixing. If the yeast and liquid get together before the machine is scheduled to begin, then the yeast will become active and likely make a big mess out of the machine.

For the quickest results and to save yourself some effort, you can use a stand-up mixer with a dough hook to prepare the dough., Transfer your dough from the work surface to the lightly oiled bowl you prepared earlier. Turn the dough to completely coat it in the oil. Then use a thin layer of plastic wrap to close off the top of the bowl.

After closing the top of the bowl, you'll have to wait 1½ hours for the dough to rise. When the dough has risen, it will be about double its starting size.
Slightly before your dough has finished rising, coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray and sprinkle it with cornmeal., When the dough is done rising, transfer it again to your lightly floured work surface and punch it down. Knead the dough several times, then divide it into two halves and fashion each half into a ball.You may need to sprinkle more flour on your work surface before transferring the dough to it to prevent sticking.

, Place the halves several inches apart on the sprayed, cornmeal sprinkled baking sheet. Cover the baking sheet and the halves on it completely with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise for one more hour.

",How to Activate Dried Yeast," Dried yeast comes in two basic varieties: instant and active dry. If you have instant yeast, there is no need to activate the yeast: Just mix it in with your dry ingredients. If you have active dry yeast, it helps to activate the yeast first.






;
, Consult your recipe and measure out the amount of dry yeast that you need.








, The water needs to be between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 43 degrees Celsius). If the water is too cold, the yeast will not ""wake up."" If the water is too hot, you run the risk of killing the yeast. Make sure the amount of water you use is not greater than the amount called for in your recipe.








, Stir to dissolve. This will provide the yeast with a little bit of food to encourage them to start metabolizing. If you don't have sugar, a drop of molasses works well. A pinch of flour will also work.








, Stir vigorously until you can no longer discern the dried yeast granules. Cover the vessel with a towel, as yeast prefer to work in the dark.








, This process is called ""proofing"" the yeast, and it means you are allowing the yeast to begin metabolizing the sugar and propagate. A minute or 2 is sufficient for most applications, but if you really want to be sure your yeast are alive and well, wait 10 minutes and then check on the yeast. If the water has a little bit of bubbly froth at the top, your yeast are healthy and working.








, Finish executing your recipe as planned.









If you are using dried brewer's yeast to brew beer, follow the same process listed above. As an alternative, you can pitch the dried yeast directly into your wort, although by doing this you run the risk of under-pitching, as many of the yeast can be killed if the temperature is not perfect.

In yeasted breads, you can begin by substituting 1/3 or 1/2 cup of whole grain flour for white flour and then increasing the amount in each subsequent batch until you have found the amount you like.
In chemically leavened breads (those with baking soda or baking powder), start by substituting half the flour with whole grains and then adjust subsequent batches to your taste. Chemically leavened breads can handle more substitutions because they do not need as much of the gluten that comes from wheat to form their texture.;
,


Consider whole wheat, buckwheat, cornmeal, rye, oat, oatmeal, barley, triticale, sorghum, tuff, amaranth and other whole grain flours. Each provides different flavors, texture and nutrients to your bread.

,


Whole grain flours need to absorb more liquid than breads made with only white wheat flour. When you add the liquids to your dough, it should have a slightly wetter texture than normal. The whole grain flours should absorb the extra liquid during rising or resting and the bread dough should have about the same consistency as normal by the time the bread is ready to bake.
Consider adding an extra tablespoon or 2 of the liquid in your recipe to your dough. Experiment with subsequent batches to find the right amount for your substitution.

,


Fold 1 cup of cooked whole grains into the dough before rising or resting. If you are adding the whole grains to a chemically leavened bread, be gentle. Mixing too much at this stage can make the resulting bread less tender.
Consider including brown rice, millet, wheat berries, quinoa, oatmeal and other whole grains.

,


This extra time allows the whole grains and whole grain flours to absorb more liquid and improves the texture of the resulting bread.
Quick bread batters should rest for at least an hour in the refrigerator and may benefit from spending the night in the refrigerator.
Yeasted bread doughs can also have some extra time added to their rising schedule by putting the dough in the refrigerator for some extra time.

, Baking times should not need to be altered from the original recipe.

,,, After about 10 to 15 minutes, or until you are free to add it to the bowl, little by little add the flour and yeast water. Add sufficient flour and yeast water until the dough cleans the bowl on mixing it with a mixer.

, Mix until it is constant in structure and there are no riffs and air bubbles in the dough.

, The baking paper will ensure that the bread does not stick to the metal sheet.

, Cover the bowl with a tea towel for 1 or 2 hours. Watch as the dough rises and the grooves you put on the dough with a knife start opening.

, Put the dough in for ten minutes.

, Let it bake for another 40 minutes.

, Allow to cool before slicing, although it's okay to enjoy it warm too.

, Add some slices of meat or tomatoes, some salad and a bit of your favorite spread. Delicious!

Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C).,
Wrap the bread in foil.,
Bake the bread for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Remove the bread from the oven and serve.",How to Reheat Bread1," This is the best temperature for reheating bread. Any hotter and the bread could burn quickly. A lower temperature would require a longer cooking time, resulting in dry bread. If you want a soft interior with a chewy crust, 350℉ (175℃) is the way to go.It's better to slice the bread after reheating rather than slicing it before reheating. Sliced bread will heat quickly and become hard and crunchy if you're not careful.
However, if you want to make bread crumbs or croutons, you can slice or dice the bread. Toss it with some melted butter, a dash of salt and pepper and some garlic powder, and you'll end up with a delicious topping for your salad.;
, This will protect the crust and help stop it from getting burned while the inside of the bread heats. If you try to reheat it unwrapped, the crust could overcook and turn out hard.

, For small or thin loaves of bread such as baguettes, limit the baking time to 10 minutes. For larger, thicker loaves of bread, bake for 15 minutes so the center has time to warm up.

, Serve the bread right away so it doesn't have time to cool again. Reheating bread a third time probably will result in a less-than-optimal taste and texture."
"
Wrap the bread in aluminum foil.,
Place the bread in a pot with a lid.,
Place the pot on the stove over low heat.",How to Reheat Bread2," This will help it heat evenly and protect it from getting burned during the reheating process.

, Use the smallest possible pot that will still comfortably hold the bread. Put the lid on the pot.

, The low heat will gently warm the bread. Allow it to warm for about five minutes, then remove the bread and check to see if it has been thoroughly heated. If not, replace it in the pan and warm it for another few minutes.


An alternative method is to wrap the bread and steam it in a steamer pan above simmering water. Wrap it well so the steam doesn't get through and make the bread go soft. This method won't really revive a crisp crust, but it's suitable for hard, dry, day-old bread.

"
"
Slice your bread.,
Toast your bread in a toaster.,
Try toasting your bread in the oven.",How to Reheat Bread3," Use a bread knife to slice it into slices thin enough to fit into your toaster, but substantial enough to hold together when you butter it or use it as part of a sandwich.


Keep in mind that the thinner you make the slices, the more quickly the bread will toast, and the crisper it will turn out.
You can toast thick, hearty slices in the oven if they won't fit in your toaster., If you're looking for a quick, convenient, and effective toasting method, nothing beats a toaster. Load the bread into the slots, change the setting to your preferred level of doneness, and push down on the knob that lowers the toast into the toaster and turns it on. When the toast springs back up, it's ready to eat.


Be careful when you remove your bread from the toaster. You might need to let it cool for a moment if it's too hot to touch.






Never stick a knife or fork into a toaster to extract the toast. Unplug the toaster and remove the toast.







, This adds a tasty gourmet touch, since nothing beats the texture of oven-toasted bread. Turn on the broiler in your oven and let it preheat. Place your bread slices on a baking sheet. Put the baking sheet under the broiler for two to five minutes, or until the bread is toasted to your preferred level of doneness.


For extra delicious toast, try buttering the bread before you broil it.






You can also melt cheese on the bread to make a great afternoon snack.

,, You can use it to rinse the oil and sugar off the measuring spoon.
, The salt controls the rise, and you don't want it to over-rise. The bread may hit the lid of the bread machine if it rises too much. It may also form a bubble or cave-in in the center.

Make this bread more than once, and you will learn how much salt to add to control the rise.

,,, Adding it on the top of the flour like this keeps it dry until the bread cycle starts, in case you want to use a delay timer.
, Make sure it's inserted firmly and correctly.
, Do not open the machine while the cycle is running.

Prepare a clean surface on which to handle the dough.,
Run some warm water into a stoneware bowl.,
Chop finely the rosemary and any other herbs you wish to add to the dough.
,Pour the warm water out of the bowl and dry the bowl with a clean dish towel.,
Mix one cup of the flour with the rest of the dry ingredients, including the yeast and rosemary, in the bowl, but reserve about half of the flour.
,
Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, then add the warm water.
,

Gradually add the rest of the flour, continuing to stir.
,
Begin to use your hands to mix the dough as it becomes too thick or sticky to work with a spoon.
,
Turn out the dough onto a clean, floured surface when it behaves more like dough than like batter.
,
Knead the dough by hand for about ten minutes, working in any remaining flour.,
Shape the kneaded dough into a round ball.
,

Cut into squares 3-4 inch squares or strips.,
Serve warm or cool, but serve fresh as soon as possible.",How to Make Focaccia," This can be a bread board or a wooden table, but make sure to wash the surface thoroughly, since it will be in direct contact with the dough. If you will use a table that gets used for other purposes, wipe it with dish soap and then wipe again to rinse, as you would a dish.

Now is a good time to tie up long hair and wash your hands, too.;
, Real yeast is not difficult to handle, but it will help if you keep it warm. A good rule of thumb with yeast is that it will like the temperatures you would like in a warm bath. Some warm water from the tap will preheat the bowl nicely, and stoneware, if you have it, will help to hold that heat.
,,,,, Mix until you have a smooth, batter-like consistency. You can also do some of the mixing and kneading with an electric mixer, if you have a dough hook.
,,,,

If in doubt, knead longer than you think you need to. It is difficult to over-knead by hand.
Sprinkle flour on top of the dough as needed to keep your fingers from sticking.
Kneaded dough should be springy and smooth when it is ready. See if it bounces back when you poke a finger into it. Also try the ""earlobe test"". Pinch an earlobe-sized piece of dough and see if it feels about like an earlobe.

,,, Turn the ball of dough over and roll it to coat the other side.
,,

The dough is ready when you can push a finger or two into it and not have it spring back.











,, This is exactly what it sounds like. Give the dough a good, hard punch, right in the middle. It should deflate like a popped balloon.
,, Something roughly round or rectangular is fine. It need not take up the whole sheet. It should be about half an inch (1-1.5 cm) thick and a fairly uniform thickness. Repeat for the other half of the dough.
,, The dough should puff up.

,, Push your fingers into the dough to make little dents around on the surface.
, Use a pastry brush to spread it evenly across the surface.
,,, A pizza cutter will help.
, A bowl or basket lined with a clean dish towel or napkin makes a good presentation."

",How to Make Rice Cooker Bread,"






;
, The water needs to be between 110–120 °F (43–49 °C). Allow it stand for approximately ten minutes.








,,,, If the dough feels very sticky, then dip your hands into some flour so that the dough will not stick as you roll it.








, It might be easier to cut the butter into small pieces. Also the butter should be soft and at room temperature. The butter will also help to grease the rice cooker bowl, so that the bread will not stick to the sides. Knead the butter into the ball until the butter is completely absorbed into the dough and has no lumps.








, This is the first dough rise.








, This is because the yeast in there is eating up the starch and sugars in the flour and breathing out carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide dissolves into the dough, and either escapes, or expands the air bubbles in the dough that were there from mixing causes dough to get bigger!








, Do this a few times, until the dough returns to its original size. Once again allow it to sit in a warm area. This is now the second and final rise.








, Just leave it alone for one hour, and it will puff back up to double its size. Yeast works this way.








, Make sure it does not burn on the bottom. Temperatures differ with each rice cooker, so you will have to learn what is best for you. Write down the times and steps, so you will remember it for the next bake.








, This is the second baking period. It is also supposed to be 1 hour, but may not need that long. The cooker you use probably makes all the difference here.

, This makes general clean up infinitely easier. If you don't have parchment paper, cooking spray will do, but you still run the risk of the bottom of your loaf sticking.

, This recipe goes fairly quickly -- the dry and wet ingredients can be combined in a matter of seconds. Measure everything out, crack the egg, and grab your mixer.


The butter will cooperate more if it's been left out for a bit. Don't melt it -- just take it out first thing so it's near room temperature when you go to add it to your mixture.

, That's code for the flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Once those are in, add the butter. Lower the hook of the mixer and mix for 1 minute.


If the butter is still cold, zap it in the microwave briefly. You want it soft, not melted.

, Continue mixing until it blends together. When fully blended, dust your hands and the dough with a little wheat flour and remove.

, This should take seconds; the dough will be very malleable. Sprinkle the top with a dusting of flour and make an ""X"" on the top of the dough with a knife.

, On a stove top, heat the milk and butter in a large bowl until the butter melts. Insure the butter is not softened because it can overheat when melted. Cool until warm, about 110 degrees Fahrenheit or 45 degrees Celsius.

, In a smaller bowl, stir the yeast and water together with a spoon until fully combined. Add the wet yeast mixture in with the melted butter mixture. Mix well with a whisk.

, Slowly pour the sugar and beat the eggs in on low speed to blend fully. The mixture should be a light yellow and will be a watery liquid from the eggs, butter, and warm water. This is normal. The mixture will turn doughy once the flour is added.

, Sprinkle the salt and pour only two cups of the flour into the large bowl. Mix at medium speed until blended. The mixture should start to look like cake batter and will get a little stiff. After mixing, switch to the dough hook as this will get really gooey and messy. The dough will get stuck on the dough hook so please switch it. See variation in the Tips below if not using a mixer.

Dough hooks look like a spring and are a little curved or bent. Its job is to make air bubbles in the dough and make delicious, chewy bread. , Add 1 and ¼ cup more flour and knead at medium-low speed. Add more flour sparingly if the dough sticks to the side of the bowl. Mix well and have the dough hook do it's work. You may have to wait a bit for the dough to form and for all the flour streaks to disappear. It should take about three to four minutes depending on your mixer.

, Turn the dough onto a floured work surface. If the dough is sticky knead in up to ½ cup more flour to form a soft, elastic dough. The dough is about rise and you want the it to be as soft as possible for baking.

, Transfer the dough to a very lightly oiled bowl, then rotate to oil all sides. Oil can help give the cinnamon swirl bread a better texture when eating it, and also helps it soften. , Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a towel and let the dough rise until it has doubled in size, usually taking about two hours. If you are having trouble making the dough rise check out the article on how to fix dough that won't rise.

, Turn the dough onto a floured work surface making sure you do not to fold the dough over. Let the dough rest for about ten minutes, getting it ready for the filling go inside.

, Grease the bottom and sides of a 9 x 5 loaf pan. Use a good loaf pan that can withstand high temperatures and will fill in the right amount dough.

, In a small bowl, mix the cinnamon and sugar with a spoon. Cinnamon is the big key to this bread so you want to make sure you have the correct one. Avoid using spicy or hot cinnamon packets as they give your bread a not so sweet taste. , To add the filling to cinnamon swirl bread, you need to flatten the dough so you can rub it on. Press the dough into an evenly shaped rectangle with the short side facing you. Roll the dough with a rolling pin into a 18 inch by 8 inch rectangle. Brush the dough liberally with milk. so the sugar mixture can stick on the dough.

, This is the fun part when making cinnamon swirl bread, adding the filling! Sprinkle the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a border on the far side.

, Starting at the side closest to you, roll up the dough. Pinch the dough gently with your fingertips to seal it. When you finish rolling the dough, pinch the seam together.

, With the seam side up, pinch the ends of the dough together. Place the loaf seam side down in the prepared pan; Press lightly to flatten. Cover the top of the pan loosely with plastic wrap or with a towel and set aside for it to rise.

Let it rise until the dough is 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) above the top of the pan, about 1 ½ hours.

, As the dough nears the top of the pan, adjust the oven rack to the center position and heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).

, Gently brush the top of the loaf with the egg mixture with a pastry brush.

, Bake until the loaf is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted at an angle from the short end just above the pan rim into the center of the loaf reads 185 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or 85 to 88 degrees Celsius. That will usually take about 35-45 minutes depending on your oven.

, Remove the bread from the loaf pan and have it cool on its side, laying it on wire rack until room temperature, at least fifteen minutes.

Bake the flatbread.",How to Bake Bread on the Stovetop," The heavier the material, the better. You will be cooking dry, so cast iron is preferable. If you choose to use something lighter, like aluminum, consider using this pot only for baking on the stovetop, since the bottom will likely become slightly burnt.Most dutch ovens are between 5-7 quarts and will be large enough for baking bread.;
, Place something in the bottom and center of the pot. This will become the base where your bread pan will rest, and allow for air to move around the pan. It also keeps the pan from sitting directly on the heat to reduce the amount of burn on the bottom of the loaf.Try using some broken pieces of thick tile. Flat, or smallish round stones would work as well.
Another option is re-purposing an empty tuna can. Make sure that the paper is removed and place it in the bottom of the pot.

, You may use a Pyrex bowl or equivalent (not ordinary glass) bowl which can withstand the heat. Other options are a metal or ceramic bread pan. Place the pan in the pot on top of the ballast. If you are using a rectangular loaf pan, make sure that the long sides fit within your pot. The height of the pan should not exceed the rim of the pot.It should not fit too snug. You need space for air to flow all the way around the loaf pan.

, This lid should have enough clearance to allow the bread pan to fit, while leaving room for the bread to rise over the top of the pan. Test the lid with a bread pan in place.If you are having a difficult time finding a lid which fits, try using another pan large enough to cover the top of the pot.

, It is important to do all you can to keep as much heat as possible inside the dutch oven. Since heat rises, it is helpful to cover the the lid or pan with a second lid to force the heat back down toward the oven. If the pot lid has a steam hole in it, try to find a stainless steel bolt, washer, and nut to fit it., For a basic bread, you will need 3 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 2/3 cups of warm water. These are the base ingredients, but you can add herbs to your taste. Some herbs might be rosemary or thyme.For smaller loaf pans, you may need to cut this recipe in half.

, Mix the dry ingredients together before folding in the warm water. Turn the dough until everything is fully mixed. The dough should be slightly sticky.

, Cover bowl with plastic wrap and leave it on the countertop for 18-24 hours. The yeast will allow the dough to rise during this time. It may also create visible bubbles on the surface of the dough.

, Remove it from the bowl and place it on a floured surface. Fold the ball of dough in half, then tuck the edges underneath. Wrap this dough in a floured kitchen towel and allow it to rise for another 2 hours until you can poke your finger in about an inch and the dough bounces back.

, Place the dutch oven on your largest burner. Put the thermal ballast in the bottom of the pot and cover it with both lids. Turn the burner on high heat. Allow the heat to rise within the oven for 5 minutes. After five minutes, reduce the heat to just above medium., You want to flour all parts of the inside of the pan. It is helpful to rub oil or lard on the inside for the flour to stick to, then pour the flour in, turn and shake the pan until it is completely covered on the inside. The dough should fit well within the pan. The dough will rise more during baking, so it should not exceed the top of the pan.


Another option to covering the pan with flour is using oatmeal. Pour oil in the pan covering the bottom and sides, then pour finely ground oatmeal in the pan. Twisting your wrist, be sure to turn and shake the pan until all the sides are also covered in oatmeal.

, Using an oven mitt, remove the lids of the dutch oven and set them aside on a heat-proof surface. Carefully place your loaf pan in the center of the dutch oven, avoiding the hot sides. Make sure there is enough room on all sides of the pan for heat to surround it., Using oven mitts, place both of the lids back on top of the dutch oven. Bake the bread for about 30 minutes. Check it after 20 minutes to see if it seems to be gaining a crust. The top of the bread will not brown, but it should no longer be soft and doughy once it is cooked., Remove the lids and the pan from the dutch oven using oven mitts. Carefully shake the bread out of the pan. It should fall out easily because you floured your pan. The bottom of the bread will be significantly more cooked than the top.


If you don’t have a cooling rack, you can cool the bread on another heat-proof surface like a plate.

, Place your dutch oven on the stovetop with the bread pan in place on your thermal ballast. Cover and heat on high for 15 minutes.


Expect to have a few failed loaves which are under-cooked in the middle or over-cooked. If your equipment is different from that shown, your stove may provide more or less heat. Cooking time may need to be varied accordingly.

, The idea of baking in a haybox is that enough heat has built up in the dutch oven. Completely surrounding the dutch oven with insulation will keep the heat from escaping and allow the bread to continue to bake.Remove the dutch oven from the stove using oven mitts. Instead of finishing the bread on the stove top, carefully cover the pot with insulating materials such as blankets or sweatshirts to create a haybox.
Make sure to use a durable natural fabric like cotton. Synthetic material could melt from the heat of the pot.
If it is a sunny day, place the haybox in the sun for a little added warmth.

, Three hours gives a better chance of success and cannot hurt the bread. When the time is up, or you just get too hungry to wait, uncover the pot carefully.

, If it's overdone and dry or burnt, or underdone and doughy in the middle, make a note of it and adjust the stove top time accordingly the next time you try baking another loaf. If it's perfect, as shown here, enjoy the rewards.


You have saved up to 80% of the fuel necessary to bake the same loaf in the oven.

, Stir 2 1/4 teaspoons of instant yeast and 2 teaspoons of sugar into 3/4 cup of warm water. Let this sit for 5 minutes, while you pour 2 cups of all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon of salt in a large mixing bowl. Pour the other ingredients and 1 tablespoon of olive oil into the mixing bowl and mix thoroughly until there are no dry spots and the dough is sticky., Move the dough from the bowl to a flat, floured surface and knead it for 10 minutes. Oil the bowl so the dough doesn’t stick and put the dough back into the bowl. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes., Break the dough into 6 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball in the palm of your hand, then place it on a floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a circle. It should be about 8 inches wide., Heat a skillet on the stove top. Set the heat to medium-high and allow the skillet to warm. A cast iron skillet would work best for dispersing the heat. If you don’t own a cast iron skillet, you can use any pan. Coat the bottom of the pan with oil or butter., Place one circle of the dough in the pan and bake for 30 seconds. Use a spatula to flip the bread. Cook the other side for 1.5 minutes, then flip again and cook the original side for another 1.5 minutes. Set the baked flatbread aside in a kitchen towel while you repeat this process with the other 5 circles of dough.The bread should puff up while it is baking.
You want each side to have little brown spots cooked into them.

,, Yes, add it to the flour.

, Distribute it as best as you can.

, It should be hot, but bearable to the skin. Have someone pour the water in for you. This step is important! While the water is being poured into the flour, use your dominant hand to squeeze the mixture, letting it ooze between your fingers. Let the dough mix itself. Do not try to knead it yet.

, It should be sticky, but not watery. Continue to squeeze it. There should be no pockets of dry flour. All of it should be absorbed.

, Punch the dough. Fold it inwards from the edges over and over. Add flour or warm water when necessary, a little at a time, rotating the bowl as you knead.

, There should be no bumps in the dough, which indicate pockets of flour. Cover it with a towel and let rise for about 30 to 45 minutes.

, It should not be the consistency of thick clay.

, It should not be too hot, or else the frybread will cook too fast and burn easy.

, Explaining how to flap the dough like a Navajo is a bit complicated, and takes practice, therefore I suggest you roll it out instead with a rolling pin.

, Thickness varies. The thinner the frybread, the crunchier it will be.

, Do NOT DROP it into the pan, the hot oil will splash!

, Cook it until it is GOLDEN BROWN on either side. You will know if it's overcooked when it turns a darker brown color with black spots. Use a tined fork to turn it over. That's the Navajo way.

, Popular toppings include salt, honey, powdered sugar, etc. It's great for any meal.

Mix the ingredients to make the dough.,

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.,
Prepare the skillet before proceeding.,

Remove the dough from the bowl and place on a lightly floured work surface.,

Shape the dough into a ball.,

Prepare the oven.,
Lightly flour the top of the dough.,
Move the dough into the Dutch oven.,
Switch down the heat to 425ºF (218ºC).,

Take the bread out of the oven.,
Gather the ingredients.,
Select a mixing bowl that will hold the dough that will rise up during the maturing process.,Mix all of the dry ingredients together.,
Add the 200ml water.,
Cover and let sit for 8-18 hours - longer is better.,
Prepare the baking pan.,
Dump the 'mature' dough on a floured surface.,
Let rise for about an hour.,
Put the pan containing dough in cold oven.,When the oven reaches 425ºF, immediately reduce temp to 375ºF and set timer for 25 minutes.,
Remove the top.,
Finally, remove the finished bread and dump onto a cooling rack.,
If, after ten minutes, you cannot wait any longer, slice off a piece with a serrated edge knife.",How to Bake Almost No Knead Bread," Whisk the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add the water, beer, and vinegar.


Fold the mixture with a rubber spatula. Use the spatula to scrape off the dry flour from the bottom of the bowl until a raggedy ball forms.

, Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for 8 to 18 hours. If leaving it overnight, take care not to leave near an open window if there is a cold breeze., Place the sheet of parchment paper inside the skillet, and spray the top of the paper with non-stick cooking spray., Knead lightly 10 to 15 times. There is no need to knead it beyond this amount., Do this by pulling the edges into the middle and creating a seam where the edges meet. Gently push the ball together.

Remove the dough ball from the work surface and place it onto the parchment-lined skillet. Place it seam-side down. Spray the surface of the dough with non-stick cooking spray.
Cover the dough ball loosely with plastic food wrap.
Leave the dough to rise for about 2 hours, until it doubles in size, and doesn't spring back when poked with your finger.

, About 30 minutes before baking, put the oven rack in the lowest position. Place the Dutch oven (with lid) on the rack. Preheat the oven to 500ºF (260ºC)., Make a slit in the dough; take a razor blade and make a 6 inches (15.2cm) long and 1/2 inch (1.27cm) deep slit along the top of the dough.







Another variation is to make a cross when slitting, as seen in this image.

, Lift out the pot from the oven with care (wear oven mitts), and remove the lid (keep your mitts on).

Pick up the dough by lifting the parchment paper from its opposite edges. Lower the dough into the pot gently and fold down any overlapping pieces of parchment paper over the pot's edge. Replace the lid and put the bread dough into the oven.

, Bake the bread for 30 minutes with the lid sitting in place on the Dutch oven.







After 30 minutes, remove the lid. This will allow the top of the bread to brown. Continue baking until you can see a deep-brown color. You can also test the center of the dough with a cooking thermometer – the bread is ready at 210ºF (99ºC) in the center. This will take another 15 to 30 minutes.

, Remove the bread from the pot and allow to cool on a wire cooling rack.







Leave it to cool completely on the rack. It will reach room temperature in about 2 hours.

, Make sure that the water is not warmer than you can comfortably stick your pinky finger in, as that would kill the yeast. On the other hand, if it's too cold, the yeast won't thrive.


Certain kinds of yeast might grow somewhat better in a slightly higher water temperature. Check the kind of yeast you are using.

, Crack the eggs and add them to your dissolved yeast. Slowly pour the honey and salt. At this stage, you can also consider adding in your nuts or seeds if desired. Stir well with a wooden spoon.

, Reserve a little flour for the kneading.

, Work in more flour very gradually until the dough sticks more to itself than to the surface or to your hands. Note that the dough will stick to your hands and to the board at first, but add extra flour slowly, and make sure to work in each addition before reaching for even more.

, Knead until the dough is uniform in its consistency, and can be lifted from the surface without getting stuck on the baking board. During the kneading, use a dough scraper regularly to remove stuck dough from hands and baking board.

Rye dough behaves differently from wheat dough. One of the most noticeable differences is that it is stickier. Your hands will feel and be sticky, and covered in a layer of dough. This is completely normal, and should not cause you to add large amounts of extra flour.

, Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Roll each piece into a roll of length suitable for your baking tray or bread pan. Put the rolls into the bread pans or onto the baking tray.

, Let them rise for about one hour in a warm spot, until the loaves have about doubled in size.

Yes, the bread only rises once. This is one of the reasons why it is so fast to bake. While waiting for the dough to rise, preheat your oven to 425º Fahrenheit (200-225º Celsius).







, Place the loves in the oven for 25 minutes or until a medium-brown color. The crust should also be a golden-brown.

If you are baking on a tray, cut the loaves apart.

, Let the loaves cool on wire racks, covered by a towel. It's now ready to serve. Try spreading butter, jam, sauce, or cream cheese on top. Enjoy!

Be obvious!",How to Prepare Greek Pitas," You don't need to use a specific temperature; it can be on high or low just as long as you keep an eye on the bread to make sure it doesn't burn. However, it is easier and quicker to have the oven around 180 °C (356 °F). Just pop them in straight into the shelf; no baking tray is needed and wait for them to heat up. Turn over once.;
, Put them on a rack just above the charcoal close to sitting down time as they will be ready to eat quickly. As with the oven method, keep an eye on them and turn them over so they don't burn.

, Pitas can easily be warmed in a conventional domestic toaster. If they stick out of the top a bit, simply up end them half way through heating to warm them at both ends.  

, When they are warmed take them off or out of the heat and place on a chopping board. Use a tea towel or oven glove as they will be hot. Put one hand on top of the pita and using a knife with the other hand, cut either down the length of one side (this is for filling it with kebabs or sheftalia for instance) or to cut along the top into small slices, like little pockets.

, Warm as per one of the methods above then slice in two. Switch out the hamburger for a lamb burger, add fetta, cucumber and thinly sliced red onion rings, pop the lot into the pita pocket and enjoy.

, Warm the pitas using one of the above methods until they are just puffed. Cut the pitta bread along the narrowest part, it's very edge, to make two thin slices. Cut these slices into quarters. Place the halved, then quartered pita slices under a hot grill or in a warm oven until crisp. They will curve slightly at the edges, make sure they don't burn. These chips or crisps are perfect with classic Greek dips such as houmous, taramasalata or Tzatziki.

, Cooked meats, fish, cheeses and salads can all be enjoyed in a pitta. Put Greek salad and grilled chicken in for a Mediterranean meal. Go sandwhich staple with a BLT pita or try some fusion cuisine by filling a pita pocket with teriyaki beef, mooli and pea shoots.

, Dips and sauces are common in Greek cuisine but there's nothing stopping you having salsa, blue cheese dip, sour cream and chive dip, bean dip or whatever other dips you like.

, Make a kebab. There are huge variations on what people consider to be a kebab. Look for a recipe you like or, simply grill meat, or veggies, or both, on a skewer and slide off onto a warmed, unsliced, folded pitta.

",How to Make Pita Bread," Get one that spans across two burners so you can do more than one at a time but it is up to you. They cost perhaps $20-$40 but if you like pita then it will quickly pay for itself. You can also cook other foods, like steak or pancakes on the griddle.






;
, Sift 2 1/2 cups of flour and the salt into a bowl.








, Knead it and add the flour slowly until it's elastic - about 10-15 minutes but it really depends on how fast you go.








, Smear it all around the dough until it is no longer sticky. Put a damp cloth over it and set it in a warm place for about an hour and a half. Dough should be doubled in bulk.








,, The circles should be about 1/4-inch thick and about 7 inches (17.8 cm) in diameter. Sandwich the circles between floured cloths and let rise for about 20 minutes in a warm place. This seems like forever, but this is really only if you have time and want the taste (the second rise will improve the flavor).








, Then, oil the pita as little as possible. Wait for the grill to heat and put the pita on it.








, Take a peek and if it looks like it has the marks that you always wanted on your steak then time to flip. Again, you're looking for those marks. When both sides are nicely browned, the pita should be done.








, (These are really good if you grill a few fresh pineapple slices and put them on vanilla ice cream along with the dessert pita.)

",How to Create a Bread in a Bottle Gift," Old fashioned milk bottles can be a lovely way to present this gift, if you can find some. Check online or look in a local antique store. If not, you can also use large canning jars or even another type of bottle (as long as it had a lid) to house your creation.;
, It's best to provide the ingredients for a quick bread only as they're easier to make. If you want to provide a more detailed recipe, you'll need to include more items, such as packages of dry yeast and specific instructions.


Find a recipe that most people will like and can make. Something overly complicated may be a turn off (unless the gift recipient is a genuinely good baker).

, Take into account the weather when packaging your bread. In warmer climates, items like chocolate pieces may melt and ruin the presentation (not to mention the prospect of baking the bread).

, You’ll want to package and present the gift in an attractive manner so keep in mind everything you might need (including glue or the use of a computer to print labels and/or a recipe card).

, Even if the bottle or jar has never been used, it’s important to properly clean the container to remove debris and make it sanitary.


Don’t fill the bottle or jar until it has fully dried. Do your best to dry the inside of the bottle or jar, otherwise turn it upside down on top of a clean towel and allow it to air dry. You may need to wait a full day before it’s completely dry, depending on the air temperature.

, Follow the recipe by combining base the dry ingredients (that is, flour, salt, baking powder and so forth), together in a large bowl. Since the dry ingredients will most likely be the bulk of the bread, you’ll want to pour them into the bottle or jar first.

Add the next layer of dry ingredients, which may include spice and sugars.






Sprinkle in the top layer dry ingredients, which typically may be any type of nuts, chocolate or garnishes.







, You could also create your own sealant; use materials such as Press and Seal paper or craft paper secured with double stick tape.

, Go with either a hand written label or you could generate a “professional” looking label using your computer software and a laser printer.


Affix the recipe card to either the back of the bottle (using self adhesive tape or a label sticker) or by punching a hole through the recipe card and tying it to the top of the bottle.







, Make your bottle look festive by wrapping it as you would any gift. Don’t forget your card so the recipient knows who gave this creative gift.

Bake the kaiser rolls.",How to Make Kaiser Rolls," Place all of the kaiser roll dough into a large mixing bowl if you want to mix the dough by hand or with a stand mixer. If you want to mix the dough in a bread machine, put the ingredients into the machine's bucket. You'll need:3 cups (361 g) unbleached all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons (4.5 g) instant yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons (6 g) sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons (7 g) salt
1 large egg
2 tablespoons (28 g) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup (180 ml) lukewarm water;
, If you want to mix the dough by hand, you can use your fingers or a firm, wooden spoon to combine the dough. Or beat the mixture with a stand mixer until you get a smooth dough. The kaiser roll dough should be elastic and soft.If you're using a bread machine, follow your machine's instructions for the dough cycle.

, Lightly grease a large bowl and scoop the dough into it. Cover the bowl with greased plastic wrap and put the bowl in a warm place to prove. Let the dough rest for about one hour, so the dough rises and looks puffy.If you're using a bread machine, you'll still need to transfer the dough to a greased bowl.

, Gently punch your fist down into the risen dough. Spread a little oil or cooking spray on a work surface and scoop the dough onto it. Use your fingers or a bench scraper to divide the dough into six pieces.Avoid using flour on the work surface. If the dough has too much flour, the rolls will be dense and tough.

, Take each piece of dough and roll them between your palms to make six round balls. Get out a baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper on it or spray it with cooking spray. Set each ball on the baking sheet., Take a Kaiser roll stamp and place it directly over a ball of dough. Push down on the stamp, so you almost press down to the bottom. Do this for each ball of dough.Ensure that you cut deep enough or the segmented shape won't show up once the dough bakes. But, if you cut all the way to the bottom of the ball, the roll will split off into five separate pieces.

, Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Once you've shaped or stamped the rolls, put them cut-side down on the baking sheet and cover them with plastic wrap. Set them in a warm place to prove for 45 minutes to 1 hour.The rolls should almost double in size once they've finished proving.

, Take each piece of dough and roll them between your palms to make six round balls. Get out a baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper on it or spray it with cooking spray. Set each ball on the baking sheet., Roll a ball of dough between your palms, so you get a long strip of dough (about 12 to 14-inches or 30 to 35-cm long). Repeat this for each of the balls of dough, so you have six strips of dough., Hold both ends of one strip of dough and loop the left end over the right end. You should now have a loose knot. Do this for each strip of dough.This knot is known as a granny knot. Remember to keep it loose, so you don't stretch the dough too much.

, Take one end of the strip and wrap the dough around the center loop twice. Do this for the other end of the strip and try to wrap the loops in the same direction.The roll should now look like a rosette or Kaiser roll.

, Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Once you've shaped or stamped the rolls, put them cut-side down on the baking sheet and cover them with plastic wrap. Set them in a warm place to prove for 45 minutes to 1 hour.The rolls should almost double in size once they've finished proving.

, During the last 30 minutes of proving, turn on the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C). It's important to preheat the oven while the rolls are still proving. If you wait until they've finished proving before you turn on the oven, the rolls might rise too much and deflate as they bake., Turn all the rolls over, so they're cut-side up (if you stamped them) or seam-side down (if you rolled them). If you want a decorative top, pour 1 tablespoon of milk in a bowl. Dip the top of each roll in the milk and sprinkle the tops with poppy or sesame seeds. Place them back on the baking sheet.For six kaiser rolls, you'll need about 2 tablespoons (18 g) of seeds.

, Put the rolls in the preheated oven and bake them for 15 to 17 minutes. The rolls should turn golden brown and feel soft once they've finished baking. Take them out of the oven to cool on a wire rack.To store leftover rolls, wrap them in plastic wrap and let them sit at room temperature. They'll keep for a few days.

, Once your yeast is proofed, add 1 egg, 2 tablespoons of softened butter, ¼ cup honey, 3 tablespoons molasses, 2 tablespoons baking cocoa, 1 teaspoon salt, ¼ cup brown sugar, and 2 cups all purpose flour to your mixer bowl. Combine these ingredients with the proofed yeast using the paddle attachment of your stand mixer. Mix for approximately 1 minute or until combined.If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer and mix these ingredients for 1 minute on medium speed.

, Take a spatula and scrape down the dough from the sides of the bowl. Then remove the paddle attachment from your stand mixer. Next, attach the bread hook attachment to your stand mixer.

, Begin by adding 1 cup of whole wheat flour to the bowl. Mix on low until this first cup of whole wheat flour is completely combined. Then, gradually add the remaining cup of whole wheat flour until the dough begins leaving the sides of your mixer bowl. Continue mixing on low for 7-10 minutes.If you don’t own a stand mixer, you can use an electric hand mixer instead.

, Lightly sprinkle flour on a work surface, such as your kitchen counter. Then, gently remove the dough from the mixer bowl. Lay the dough down on the prepared work surface.

, Once you’ve placed the dough on the floured work surface, it is time to knead it. Use your hands and knead the dough 4-5 times. As you knead the dough, shape it into a ball that is tight and smooth.

, Once you’ve kneaded and shaped the dough into a tight, smooth ball, return it to the mixer bowl. Cover the mixer bowl with plastic wrap. Move the bowl to a warm place. Let the dough rise for 60-90 minutes until it has doubled., After the dough has doubled, punch it down. Then shape the dough into 16 rolls. Place the rolls in a 9x13 baking pan that has been greased with canola oil. Cover the baking pan. Allow the rolls to rise for 60 minutes in a warm place.

Place the bowl of dough in a warm, but not hot, place. Allow the dough to rise for 1 hour. The dough will not double in size. It should, however, be slightly puffy after 1 hour.

, After allowing the dough to rise for an hour, divide it into rolls. You should separate the dough into 10 separate rolls. Then shape each individual roll into an oval that is 6 inches by 2 inches, or 15 ¼ centimeters by 5 centimeters.

, Take 1 cup of cornmeal and place it in a medium sized bowl. Then take each individual roll and place it in the bowl of cornmeal. Use your hands to lightly coat each roll. Place each coated roll on a lightly greased baking sheet.

, Cover the rolls with plastic wrap. Move the baking sheet of rolls to a warm place. Allow the rolls to rise for 90-120 minutes. The rolls will become puffy. You will know they are ready to bake when you gently press your finger into a roll and the indentation rebounds very slowly., Near the end of the rolls’ rising time, you will preheat your oven.

Beat in 1 1/2 cups (350 ml) of warm water and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil on low speed. Keep beating the dough on low speed until it gathers into a ball.You can add an extra tablespoon or two of flour, if the dough is very sticky.
If the dough is too dry, add a tablespoon of warm water.

, Sprinkle a little flour on the counter and scrape the dough onto it. Use the palms of your hand to knead the dough for a few minutes. It should become smooth and elastic. Spread the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil into a large bowl and set the dough ball in it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it prove for 1 1/2 hours. It should double in volume.Let the dough prove, or rest, in a warm place. This will help the yeast activate and make the dough rise.

, Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and scoop the dough onto it. Cut the dough into 2 large pieces and set them aside to rest for 10 minutes. Then take one of the pieces and cut it into 8 pieces. Repeat this with the other dough piece, so you end up with a total of 16 pieces.You may need to sprinkle the knife with a little flour to keep it from sticking to the dough.

, Sprinkle a little flour on each of the dough pieces and roll each piece between your palms to make individual balls. Roll each ball out to a rope. Twist each rope into a knot shape and put the knots on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.If you don't have parchment paper, you can spray the sheets with cooking spray.

Stir the mixture until the yeast dissolves.The water should be approximately 105 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit (40 to 46 degrees Celsius). Use thermometer to make sure that it’s warm enough to activate the yeast.;
, Once the yeast and water are mixed, add 1 ½ cups (188 g) of all-purpose flour, ⅓ cup (67 g) of sugar, ⅓ cup (76 g) of melted butter, 1 egg, and 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt to the bowl. Use an electric mixer on low to beat the mixture for approximately 1 minute until fully combined.You can substitute vegetable oil for the melted butter if you prefer.
As you’re mixing the dough, be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl regularly.

, After you’ve mixed the ingredients together with the electric mixer, add more flour to bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon. Use just enough flour to create a soft dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.You shouldn’t need to use more than 2 ¾ cups (344 g) of additional flour to get the dough to the right consistency.
The dough will still be slightly sticky after you’ve added the flour.

, Once the dough has come together, take a 3-quart (2.8 l) container, such as a bowl or baking dish, that has a lid and grease it lightly with non-stick cooking spray. Place the dough inside the greased container, turning it over once so its surface is greased as well.You can substitute butter for the nonstick cooking spray if you prefer.

, After you’ve placed the dough in the greased container, cover it with the lid. Place the dough in the refrigerator to chill for at least 5 hours or overnight., After you’ve chilled the dough overnight, take it out of the refrigerator. Use your fists to punch it down, and then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface., On the floured surface, use your hands to divide into two pieces. Cover them with a clean kitchen towel, and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.If you have any trouble with the dough sticking to your hands, you can flour your skin lightly.

, While you’re waiting for the dough to rest, ready 1 to 2 baking sheets for baking the rolls. Lightly grease the sheets with cooking spray to keep the rolls from sticking when they bake.You can substitute butter for the cooking spray if you prefer.
You can use a baking dish to bake the rolls if you prefer.

, Once the dough has rested, uncover it. Use your hands to shape the dough into approximately 24 balls. Be careful not to work the dough too much, though, because it will become stickier the more that you handle it.You can shape the dough into more decorative rolls if you prefer. For example, you might roll sections into ropes, tie them into knots, and then tuck the ends under.

, After you’ve shaped all of the dough into rolls, place them on a the greased baking sheet(s). Set them at least 2-inches (5-cm) apart so they don’t rise into one another., When the rolls are placed on the baking sheet(s), set a clean towel over them once again. Let them rise until they are nearly double in size, which should take 45 minutes to an hour and a half.For the best results, set the rolls some place warm to rise.

, In order to ensure that the oven will be hot to bake the rolls, it’s important to preheat it. When the rolls are nearly done rising, set the oven temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat fully.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the proper temperature. It should beep or flash an indicator light to alert you.

, After the rolls have doubled in side, place the baking sheet(s) in the preheated oven. Allow them to bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rolls are a golden brown color., When the rolls are finished baking, remove them from the oven and use a spatula to take them off the baking sheet immediately. Use a pastry brush to apply 2 tablespoons (28 g) of melted butter over the tops of the rolls, and serve them while they’re still warm.You don’t have to brush the rolls with butter. However, the melted butter adds an extra layer of flavor to the rolls.

, Give your rolls more flavor by adding ½ teaspoon (½ g) dried rosemary or 1 teaspoon (1 g) of dried thyme or oregano to the dough when you mix the ingredients for the dough. Finish preparing the rolls in the same way that you would with plain dough.For added flavor, brush the rolls with melted butter and sprinkle them with parmesan cheese before baking them.

, If you want to give your rolls a sweet, spicy kick, you can coat them with cinnamon sugar. Prepare them as you would plain rolls, but brush them with melted butter and sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on them before baking them.If you don’t have any cinnamon sugar, you can make your own by combining ¼ cup (55 g) of white sugar with 1 tablespoon (8 g) of ground cinnamon and mixing well., Give the rolls an extra savory flavor by dusting them with salt and pepper. Brush the rolls with melted butter and sprinkle them with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper before baking them."

Cool the bread on a wire rack.",How to Make Sugar Free Banana Bread," To ensure that your banana bread bakes evenly, your oven rack must be in the right position. Arrange it so it’s in the center of the oven to ensure that it receives equal heat from above and below.If you forget to adjust the rack until after you’ve preheated the oven, make sure to use potholders or oven mitts to handle it.;
, The oven must be hot enough to bake the cake when you’re finished mixing up the batter, so it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176 degrees celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Pay attention to the oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. It will usually beep or flash an indicator light to alert you.

, For the banana bread, you’ll need a 9-inch by 5-inch (23-cm by 13-cm) loaf pan. Keep the bread from sticking to the pan by greasing the sides and bottom with a non-stick cooking spray.You can also grease the pan with butter or margarine if you prefer.
If you don’t want to grease the pan, you can line it with parchment paper.

, Add 4 overripe bananas that have been mashed, ¼ cup (59 ml) of vegetable oil, ¼ cup (59 ml) of honey, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of almond extract, ¼ cup (59 ml) plus 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of milk, 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of heavy cream, and 2 eggs that have been beaten to a large bowl. Stir the ingredients until well blended.The easiest way to mash the bananas is with a fork.
You can combine the ingredients in a stand mixer or with a handheld electric mixer if you don’t want to stir by hand.

, In another large bowl, mix together 2 cups (480 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 cup (240 g) of spelt flour, 2 ¼ teaspoon (11.25 g) of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, 1 ½ teaspoon (7.5 g) of baking powder, and ¾ teaspoon (3.75 g) of salt. Stir until all of the dry ingredients are well mixed.Spelt flour is a whole grain, non-wheat flour. You can substitute whole wheat flour or even an additional cup of white flour if you prefer.

, When the dry ingredients are fully mixed, slowly add them to the wet ingredients. You don’t want to overmix the batter, so stir until they are just combined.Overmixing can lead to tough, chewy bread.
Make sure that there are no dry lumps in the batter when you’re done mixing.
If the batter appears too thick, you can add an additional half of a mashed banana or 2 tablespoons (32 g) of applesauce., Nuts are traditionally added to banana bread, so you can add 1 cup (125 g) of coarsely chopped walnuts to the batter. You can also choose to omit them if you prefer or mix in another type of nut, such as pecans., Once you’ve finished mixing up the batter, pour it into the greased loaf pan. You should fill the pan so it’s approximately ¾’s of the way full.If you prefer, you can pour the batter into a muffin tin and make individual muffins instead of a loaf of bread.

, Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven, and allow the bread to bake until the top becomes golden brown, which should take approximately 1 hour. Insert a cake tester into the center of the bread, and make sure that it emerges clean before removing the bread from the oven.If you don’t have a cake tester, you can use a toothpick or even the tines of a fork.

, Allow the bread to cool in the pan for approximately 10 minutes. Next, remove it from the pan, and let it cool for an additional 30 minutes before slicing the bread and serving it."

;
, Use a vegetable peeler to peel the green skin from the zucchini. Set a cheese grater upright in a bowl and run the zucchini up and down the grater, rotating the zucchini when it gets worn down on a particular side. Continue grating the zucchini until it is completely used up, then move on to the next one. When you have a sizable pile of grated zucchini, place it in a paper towel and squeeze it over the sink to remove the excess juices. Measure the grated zucchini to make sure you have 2 1/2 cups, and grate more if necessary.









Try to remove as much of the juice as you can, so the bread doesn't turn out too watery.
You can use a piece of cheesecloth to squeeze out the juices rather than using a paper towel.

, Place the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg in a bowl. Use a whisk to stir the ingredients together until they are well incorporated.








You can replace one cup of the flour with whole wheat flour. This gives the bread a slightly more dense, nutty texture.
Cake flour may also be substituted for all-purpose flour if you'd like a lighter bread.
Add more or less cinnamon and nutmeg to taste. Freshly grated nutmeg tastes best if you have it available.

, Place the sugar, eggs, oil, yogurt, buttermilk, and vanilla in a separate large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients until they are completely incorporated. Stir in the grated zucchini last.

Add an extra teaspoon of vanilla for a stronger vanilla taste.
Stir in a cup of chocolate chips to add another layer of flavor., Pour 1/3 of the dry ingredients into the wet mixture. Use a spoon to gently stir until the flour is incorporated. Continue adding the remaining mixture in thirds, stirring until the ingredients are just incorporated.

",How to Make Peanut Butter Banana Bread," To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the bread, set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat fully. Next, grease a 9-inch by 5-inch (23-cm by 13-cm) loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the right temperature. It will likely make a beeping sound and/or flash an indicator light.
You can grease the pan with butter or shortening if you prefer.;
, Add 1 ¾ cups (219 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of ground cinnamon, and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) salt to a medium sized bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients together until they’re fully combined.You can substitute white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour if you prefer.

, Add 1 cup (250 g) of smooth peanut butter, ½ cup (100 g) of packed light brown sugar, and ½ cup (100 g) of granulated sugar to a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to blend the ingredients together on medium-high speed until the mixture is smooth.You can substitute chunky peanut butter for the smooth if you prefer. It will alter the texture of the bread, though, because there will be chunks of nuts in it.
If you prefer, you can mix the batter in a stand mixer.
You can also mix the batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort.

, Once the peanut butter mixture is smooth, add 1 large egg and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract. Mix in the ingredients on medium-low until they are fully incorporated.You can use an egg substitute in place of the egg if you prefer.

, After you’ve mixed in the egg and vanilla, add 3 mashed, ripe bananas to the bowl. Use a spatula to carefully fold the bananas in until they’re completely blended into the batter.For the best-tasting bread, the bananas should be yellow with an even amount of brown freckles scattered across the peel.
If your bananas aren’t ripe yet, place the unpeeled fruit on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven at 250 degrees (121 degrees Celsius) for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are soft.

, When the banana is mixed into the batter, gradually add the flour mixture into the bowl. Mix the batter on medium-low until the dry ingredients are just incorporated.Be careful not to overmix the batter, or you may wind up with tough, chewy bread.

, Once you’ve finished mixing the batter, transfer it to the greased loaf pan. Use a spatula to ensure that the batter is distributed evenly throughout the pan., Place the loaf pan in the heated oven. Allow it to bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the top of the bread is golden brown and it’s split down the center.If the bread begins to brown too quickly, tent a piece of foil over it while it finishes baking.
You can be certain that the bread is done by sticking a toothpick or knife in the center. When you pull it out, the tester should come out clean.

, When you’ve taken the pan out of the oven, let the bread cool inside for 10 minutes. Run a knife along the edges of the bread to ensure that it’s not stuck, and then turn it out on a wire cooling rack so it can cool completely, which should take 20 to 30 minutes., While the bread is cooling, add ⅓ cup (85 g) of smooth peanut butter, 3 tablespoons (43 g) of unsalted butter, and 1 tablespoon (8 g) of confectioners’ sugar to a small microwave-safe bowl. Stir the ingredients together until they’re just combined.You can substitute crunchy peanut butter for the creamy if you don’t mind the glaze having chunks of nuts in it.
Confectioners’ sugar is also sold as icing sugar or powdered sugar.
The glaze is an optional step. You can leave the bread plain if you prefer.

, After you’ve quickly mixed the glaze ingredients, place the bowl in the microwave and heat on high in 30 second increments until it is smooth. Be sure to stir the glaze after each increment so it heats evenly.To make the glaze easier to spread, it helps to let it cool for 1 to 2 minutes so it stiffens up slightly. Don’t let it cool too long, though, or it won’t spread.

, When you’re finished making the glaze, use a butter knife or offset spatula to spread it over the top of the bread. Next, sprinkle 3 tablespoons (23 g) of chopped honey roasted peanuts over the glaze. Cut it into pieces and serve.You can substitute plain peanuts for the honey roasted or omit the chopped nuts entirely.
Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature. It will stay fresh for 3 to 4 days.

",How to Make Crescent Rolls," Thoroughly combine the yeast, flour, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl, using a wire whisk.;
, Use a smooth knife to cut the butter into slices that are about 1/2 inches (1.27 cm) thick. Cutting the butter makes it easier to mix into the other ingredients.

, Use your hands or an electric mixer to combine the butter and dry ingredients until a sticky, crumbly dough forms. Large pieces of butter may still be visible, but most of the butter should be mixed into the flour mixture.

, Stir it into the dough using your hands or a wooden spoon. The dough will not appear smooth, but it should be able to hold together.

, Turn it out of the bowl and onto a well-floured surface. Use your hands to knead the dough several times, just enough to remove any deep dividing lines and draw the dough into a solid, cohesive form.

, Form each half into a rough square, using your hands.

, Use a rolling pin to flatten each square into an 8-in. by 10-in. (20-cm by 25-cm) rectangle.

, Fold along the longer edge first, so that the new measurements are 8-in. by 3.3-in (20-cm by 8.4-cm). Turn the dough rectangle over so that the open ""flap"" is on the bottom, and rotate the dough 90 degrees.

, Using a rolling pin to roll the dough into 8-in. by 10-in. (20-cm by 25-cm) rectangles again. Then, fold he dough into thirds again, creating 8-in. by 3.3-in (20-cm by 8.4-cm) rectangles.

, Wrap each half of the dough in plastic wrap. Allow it to chill in the refrigerator, 30 minutes to overnight.

, Allow it to sit out at room temperature for 10 minutes, just long enough to soften and become easier to work with.

, You should be left with four rough squares of dough. Work with one square at a time.

, Use your hands to round the corners, forming a circle that is about 9 in. (22.86 cm) in diameter.

, You should form about six wedges or triangular slices from the circle.

, Start from the broad end of the dough and roll the wedge along its length, toward the top point. Bend the new corners of the roll inward, forming a slight crescent.

, Form the remaining squares into circles, cut the circles into six wedges, and roll each wedge into a crescent shape.

, The baking sheet should be lightly greased or covered with aluminum foil, wax paper, or parchment paper. Place the rolls on the pan so that the tip is tucked beneath the rest of the roll.

, Cover the baking sheet with a clean, moist kitchen towel and set it out in a warm spot for three hours. The dough will not rise drastically, but this step is important to ensure that the rolls will not become too dense.

, The oven should be preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190.6 degrees Celsius) and the rolls should bake until they are golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.

,, You should be left with a total of four rough squares of dough.

, Use a rolling pin. The rectangles should be approximately the same dimensions as they were before, only thinner.

, Mix the two together until evenly blended.

, The cinnamon-sugar should be evenly distributed over the entire length of the dough. Only coat the top side of the dough.

, The strips should be of equal width and length.

, Start from one short end and roll along the length of the dough until a tight spiral forms. The cinnamon-sugar should be on the inside of the spiral. Use your finger to flatten the end of the dough against the side of the roll, smoothing it out to prevent it from uncurling as it bakes.


Note that you may need to moisten your finger with a little water before flattening the dough end. Water can help smooth the dough and adhere it to its side.







, Place the rolls on a lined or greased baking sheet and cover the baking sheet with a moist, clean towel. Allow the rolls to rise in a warm spot for 3 hours.

, Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190.6 degrees Celsius) as the rolls are rising. Bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they look golden brown and the cinnamon-sugar inside becomes gooey.

",How to Make Buttermilk Biscuits," Biscuits need to cook quickly to puff up, allowing the outside to crisp while the inside stays soft, flaky and doughy. High heat will accomplish this with flying colors.;
, The butter needs to be hard when it is cut into the four. This keeps it in hard layers that separate the flour, creating the flaky biscuit layers as the butter quickly melts, forming air pockets in the biscuit. This only happens with cold, near-frozen butter.


If you don't have a pastry knife, a capital D-shaped tool with 4-5 thin wire blades, you can put your two best kitchen knives in the freezer as well.

, Grab your 2 cups flour, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 1 tablespoon baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt. and mix them together in a large mixing bowl. Use a fork, whisk, or mesh strainer to get any clumps out.


Even consistency (no lumps) and well mixed dry ingredients will lead to better biscuits every time.

, Your goal is to cut the butter into small, thin chunks without heating it up too much. This coats all the butter in flour and creates air pockets. As such, you want to keep your hands away from it as much as possible, otherwise, you'll get dense, unenjoyable biscuits. The final mixture should have smaller, 1/2 cm cuts of butter and resemble a crumb topping on a pie. You have a few options, but should always work quickly to avoid extra heat:



Pastry Knife: This tool has several thin wire blades, letting you easily cut the butter into small pieces quickly, with minimal friction. It is a D-shaped tool.

Manual Cutting: Take your two sharpest knives and use them to make X-shaped cuts into the bottom of the bowl, sifting to get the butter near the blades and cut effectively.

Food Processor: Go gently, on the lowest setting, stopping when you still have relatively large (1/2 - 1cm in width) chunks of butter.

, Start with a cup, but know that you may want to add a little more if the dough is sticky and hard to work with. Remember to work with cold buttermilk, not room temperature, to keep the butter from melting.



No Buttermilk? No problem! Substitute 1 cup milk + 1 TB lemon juice or vinegar, or substitute a cup of plain, full-fat yogurt., You want to stir as gently, and as little, as possible. Use your fingers to start working in the flour at the edge of the well. Slowly incorporate more and more flour in with a gently scooping motion, pulling flour from the outside into the center. Never knead biscuit dough unless you want hard, dense cakes.When done, you want a shaggy, loose, and wet dough. It should be a bit sticky, and not fully formed. This is good.
You will have to do some light pressing and mixing to get all the liquid in, but try to do as little work as possible to get a roughly consistent ball of dough.

, Sprinkle some flour on a large cutting board or other kitchen surface and plop the dough down. Pour any shaggy bits of dough on top of the dough before working.

, You can massage the dough from the edges out or use a rolling pin to evenly spread it out. Either way, take your time for the best biscuits. Physically working dough creates breaks down flour, creating rubbery strands of gluten that lead to denser, heavier breads.


Sprinkle some flour on your hands or the rolling pin to prevent sticking.
For now, don't worry about a perfectly even thickness. Just keep working it until it is close, then move on.

, Again, work slowly, methodically, and without excess force. Don't worry about getting it just perfect.


If the dough is sticking to the surface, add a little flour and flip it over to work on the other side.

, More folds equal more flakes, but there is a limit -- too much folding can lead to you overworking the dough. Everyone has their own preferences and style, so the best thing to do is stick to 4-5 total folds the first time, testing the biscuits, and adjusting next time.


When done, you should have a nice square of dough, roughly 1/2 inch thick.

, You can use a knife or a specialty cutter, but the floured rim of a drinking glass makes perfectly shaped biscuits every time. Note that, in general, smaller biscuits are easier to cook to perfection, since they take less time and retain their moist interior better.


Don't twist the cutter as you pull it out of the dough. This seals up the edges of the biscuit, which need to be open to get air and steam inside., The first batch you cut out will always be best, but the ""scrape"" dough is still delicious. You could also try a few ""drop"" biscuits, which are shaggy, barely formed balls of dough that resemble scones more than their flat biscuit brethren., If you have parchment paper or a nonstick, oven-safe pan, this will do as well. How you place your biscuits, as well, will impact the final product:



For higher, taller biscuits place the biscuits so that they are touching, preferably also touching the edges of a lipped pan or dish. Cast-iron pans work well.

For wider, shorter biscuits separate the biscuits by 1-2 inches apiece., This can help them develop the wonderful golden brown sheen of the best biscuits. It also doesn't hurt the taste, giving them added richness. For truly decadent bakers, you can also drizzle a little sugar into the butter for a sweet kick.


In a pinch, a light brush of water, milk, or a whipped egg will also help them cook with a crispy golden top., When done, the tops and sides should be golden brown. The sides will be yellow-white, and still a little soft. If you have an uneven cooking oven, or just want to be sure they cook well, quickly turn them once while cooking.


Put them on the highest rack possible for the best, most golden-brown tops., Biscuits are meant, always, to be served hot, and they lose their wonder when they cool. Still, give them 2-3 minutes out the oven to finish cooking, let the steam build up the flakes inside, and prevent burnt tongues.

Don't have a thermometer? The water is ready about a minute after it hits the definitely-hot-but-I'm-not-burning-myself stage.


At 120° the water is touchable. At about 130°, it hits the point where you can't touch it without burning yourself.You want it somewhere in that frame.;
, You know -- one of those ones with a dough hook, like a KitchenAid. It can be done without one, but your forearms are gonna be aching in the morning. That dough hook will make everything much easier.

, On low speed, combine the dry ingredients until they are well combined.

, Make sure the egg is fully incorporated into the dough.

, The dough should be slightly sticky or tacky, only lightly sticking to your fingers when you touch it.

, This should take about 5 minutes. Obviously it'll take longer if you're doing it by hand.

, Leave it to rise for about 10 minutes on the counter or on top of the stove. A ""warmish"" spot is ideal.

, For the bread to adequately rise in the oven, it needs to go through two rounds of rising beforehand.

, To make old-fashioned pan rolls, pinch off dough the size of a small ball, comfortably fitting in the palm of your hand. Roll the ball of dough between your hands until rounded perfectly.


Continue until all the dough is shaped into dinner rolls of roughly the same size. This recipe should warrant 12-15 rolls.

Hold a pair of kitchen shears horizontally against the bunny's back. Cut two triangular slits into the front of the ball. The slits should be close together but not actually touching. They will look a little like an M.

If you'd like to, you can roll the balls into more oval/egg shapes first.

, Use your finger to gently soften and round the tip of each ear. This is very important; if you don't do this, you will end up with cats instead! You can also stretch the ears out a little to make them longer, but be careful not to make them too thin. If you'd like to, you can give the center of each ear a slight dent using a dowel or paintbrush handle for a more realistic touch.Keep the ears tucked against the bunny's back. Don't stand them straight up. If you do, the edges may brown too much.

, Use a skewer or the end of a paintbrush handle to poke two small eyes into the front of the bunny's face, just below the ears.You can also insert two, round pepper grains instead.If you can find pepper grains, you can use cloves instead.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but it's a nice touch. Make a small upwards snip on the bunny's bum. Pull the flap of dough out, then roll it under itself back towards the bunny., Cover the bunnies loosely with a sheet of plastic wrap. Let them rest for 40 minutes. During this time, the bunnies will poof up even more and double in size.Do not wrap the ends of the plastic wrap around the baking sheet, or it will squish the bunnies as they rise.

, You can do this while the bunnies are almost done poofing., This is not absolutely necessary, but it will give the bunnies a little shine. You can also use a beaten egg with a little water instead., They are ready when the tops turn a golden-brown color., Once the bunnies are done baking, transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Allow them to cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before you serve them."

, Add the milk and yeast mixture, still stirring. Make sure it's all evenly and thoroughly combined.

, Change to the dough hook and knead for 2-3 minutes only -- just until no longer tacky, adding a tablespoon or two of flour, if needed to sop up any extra moisture. Stick your finger in it -- if there's a bit of stick and a bit of residue, you're in the bread zone.

, It needs time to rise and the yeast to take action. When the time is up, place it on a floured surface and knead it a couple of times, then let it rest for 3 more minutes.


Plastic wrap works well, though you can also throw a towel over it if you're in a pinch.

, Once it's blended, cover it and let it rise for about an hour. It should nearly double in size. Plastic wrap is best, but a towel will work too.

, Combine it well until it looks like a perfect bread dough.

, You should end up with 54 small balls. Calm down -- place three balls into each muffin cup. We're not making rolls for an army, here.

Beat the sugar and butter with a stand mixer or handheld mixer until fluffy.
Add the vanilla, eggs and bananas, then beat the mixture until smooth. Though ripe bananas will work, overripe bananas are usually best for baking. They’re easier to mash and they’re typically more flavorful than green or young bananas.;
,


Make sure all the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed and the flour has little to no clumps.

, Marzipan is great for adding moisture to baked fruit dishes because it's an almond paste that melts into the mashed fruit, making it extra gooey. If you’ve put the marzipan into the freezer overnight, chop the marzipan up and put it in the bowl.
If you’ve left the marzipan at room temperature, you can break it into small pieces with your hands and drop those into the mixture. To keep the marzipan pieces from sticking together, coat every piece with some flour before adding them to the mixing bowl.

Leftover banana bread can be stored for up to a few days in foil or plastic wrap at room temperature.

,


3 overripe bananas, mashed
3 eggs
1/4 cup grapeseed oil (or olive or coconut oil)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup almond meal
1/2 cup brown rice flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons honey
6 dates, pitted and chopped

,


Peel the bananas, then mash them together in a mixing bowl.
Once they’re adequately mashed, add vanilla extract, oil and eggs and whisk the ingredients together.

, After these are mixed, add chopped dates and honey to the mixture and stir those in.


Almond meal has a tendency to clump, so take extra care to mash it with a fork or whisk.,


Put a toothpick into the center of the bread to see if it comes out clean upon removal. This means the banana bread is done.
Even though this recipe calls for 45-50 minutes of baking, keep in mind that anything gluten-free tends to take longer to cook. If you need to put the banana bread back in the oven for a few extra minutes, this is not unusual.,


Run a butter knife around the edges of the bread and then flip the pan over onto a cutting board or flat surface. This will remove the bread cleanly and in one piece.,


1 1/2 cups mashed overripe bananas (about 4 medium bananas)
2 tablespoons flax meal
6 tablespoons water
1/3 melted vegetable oil
Coconut oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup applesauce
1 cup whole-wheat flour (can substitute all-purpose flour)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

,


When selecting a pan to use, keep in mind that dark, metal pans are best for banana bread (rather than glass or stoneware). Dark metal pans cook things more evenly and ensure that the banana bread will be cooked all the way through. Banana bread is meant to be moist — but not gooey and undercooked in the center.

,


The flaxseed meal is meant to replace the crucial egg ingredient in a classic banana bread recipe. Why is egg usually so important to banana bread? Because eggs contain ovalbumin — a protein that forms web-like strands when exposed to heat, thus creating a structure to hold the ingredients together and give banana bread that soft, cakey texture in your mouth.In a vegan recipe, flaxseed is a good replacement for egg because it contains hydrocolloids — substances that form a gel when combined with water. This gel creates a structure for the banana bread in the same way eggs do.,


In another medium bowl, mash the bananas, then stir in the brown sugar, applesauce, vanilla extract and vegetable oil.

,


Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir. The batter will be thick and chunky.

,


It's usually best to put the banana bread on the middle or lower oven rack for ample heat. Because whole wheat flour is being used, this banana bread tends to cook quicker than other recipes, which usually take 40-60 minutes to bake.
You will know the banana bread is done when you put a toothpick through it's center and it comes out clean.

Spray the pan with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Set the pan aside.If you're using the cake pan, it should have a removable bottom.;
, Heat a few inches of water in a medium saucepan until the water simmers. Set a large mixing bowl over the simmering water. Measure 1/2 cup (125 g) of sugar and 4 whole eggs into the bowl. Zest two lemons and add just the zest to the bowl.Keep the water in the saucepan simmering, so your sugar mixture heats gently.

, Insert whisk attachments into a hand mixer. Whisk the wet mixture in the mixing bowl on high speed for several minutes. The mixture will double in size and become pale.Turn off the mixer and lift the whisk attachments out of the mixture. If the mixture dribbles back into the bowl in a ribbon-shape, you don't need to whisk it any longer.

, Turn the heat off to the saucepan. Add 1 cup (125 g) of self-raising flour to the bowl with the wet ingredients. Use a metal spoon or rubber spatula to gently fold the flour into the wet mixture.To fold in the flour, hold the spoon and use a twisting motion with your wrist to cut the flour in through the center of the wet mixture. This will combine the wet and dry ingredients without losing the volume you beat into the mixture.

, Place 3 1/2 tablespoons (50 g) of unsalted butter into a small, microwave-safe bowl. Melt the butter and let it cool a little bit. Once it's at room temperature, pour it into the bowl with the génoise batter. Gently fold the melted butter, so it's incorporated.You can substitute salted butter. The batter may be a little richer.

, Scoop the batter into the prepared pan and put it in the preheated oven. Bake the cake for 25 to 30 minutes. The top of the cake will turn a light golden brown and the sides of the cake will pull away from the pan a little once it's finished baking., Remove the cake from the oven and let it rest in the pan for a few minutes. Remove the side of the springform pan or remove the sides from the removable cake pan. Set the cake on a wire rack to cool completely.The finished cake will only be about 2-inches (5-cm) high.

, Pour 2 1/2 cups (600 ml) of milk into a wide saucepan. Take a small knife and careful cut a long slit along one vanilla pod. Use the tip of the knife to carefully scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds and the pod to the milk in the pan.The seeds will look like a dark, thick paste. If you don't have a vanilla pod, you can add 1 tablespoon of vanilla to the crème pâtissière once it's finished cooking.

, Turn the heat on to medium and let the vanilla milk slowly heat up. You'll need to stir it occasionally to prevent it from scorching. Keep cooking the milk until it begins to boil. Turn off the heat once it starts bubbling., Get out a medium-sized mixing bowl and crack 4 whole eggs into it. You'll also need to add 2 egg yolks. Add 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 tablespoon of kirsch, and 2/3 cup (100 g) of cornstarch. Whisk the mixture until it's combined.If you don't have kirsch, you can use another type of cherry brandy or leave it out.
You can discard or save the extra couple of egg whites for a different recipe.

, Remove the vanilla pod from the pan of hot milk. Place a fine mesh sieve over the bowl with the sugar and egg mixture. Carefully pour the hot milk through the sieve into the egg mixture. Discard the solids left in the strainer. Whisk the hot milk into the egg mixture until the custard mixture is combined.Avoid whisking too quickly or the hot milk may splash onto you.

, Pour the custard mixture into a clean saucepan and turn the heat on to medium. Keep stirring and cooking the custard for about 3 to 4 minutes. It will thicken quickly, so stir well to prevent lumps. The custard should be thick enough to pipe.If your crème pâtissière is lumpy, use a whisk to smooth the lumps out.

, Cut 2/3 cup (150 g) of room-temperature butter into cubes. Add the cubed butter to the crème pâtissière and stir the mixture well. The butter should melt and combine with the crème pâtissière., Let the custard cool for a minute and then pour it into a shallow dish or baking pan. Put the crème pâtissière in the refrigerator to chill for one hour. The custard should set and become cold.You can make the crème pâtissière ahead of time and chill it for up to one day.

, Squeeze the juice from the 2 lemons that you zested earlier. Pour the juice into a small saucepan and add 1/3 cup (75 g) of sugar. You'll also need to stir in 4 1/2 tablespoons (70 ml) of water., Turn the heat to medium-high and stir the syrup. Bring the syrup to a boil. Keep stirring and boiling the syrup for a full two minutes, so the sugar dissolves completely. Turn off the heat and let the lemon syrup cool., Get out 17 ounces (500 g) of pink marzipan and roll it into a ball. Use a rolling pin to roll it into a 9-inch (23-cm) circle. If the circle isn't perfect, place the circular bottom of a pan on the marzipan to use as a guide. Trim around the circle, so your marzipan is circular. Place the marzipan circle on a baking sheet in the fridge while you assemble the cake.Chilling the rolled marzipan will make assembly easier and make the circle sit flatter on the cake.

, Take a clean springform tin and spray it with cooking spray. Take a strip of acetate paper and lay it along the sides of the tin. If you don't have acetate paper, you could use parchment paper lined with foil or just line the pan with plastic wrap.You can find acetate paper at culinary supply stores, art supply stores, or engineering supply stores. Just cut the plastic to fit your pan.

, Peel the parchment paper off of the bottom of the génoise cake. Use a serrated knife to gently slice through the cake horizontally, so you have two thin layers of cake. Each layer should be the same height. Lay one of the layers into the bottom of the prepared springform pan., Wash 12 strawberries that are about the same size. Trim off and discard the stems. Use a small knife to cut each strawberry in half, so you have about 24 strawberry halves., Pour half of the cooled, lemon syrup over the layer of cake in the bottom of the pan. Use the back of a spoon to spread it evenly and push it into the cake. Push the cake against the sides of the pan. Place the strawberry halves along the outside of the pan, so they're firmly pressed into the cake and nestled against each other.The cut sides of the strawberries should be pressed against the acetate. This way, the strawberry halves will be exposed once you've assembled the cake and removed the acetate.

, Spoon most of the chilled crème pâtissière into a piping bag that's fitted with a 1/2-inch (1-cm) nozzle. Use a circular motion to pipe the crème pâtissière onto the bottom of the sponge cake. Go back and pipe in between each of the strawberry halves to fill in the gapes.You don't need a decorative piping tip on the pastry bag. Piping the custard ensures that it's spread evenly throughout the cake.

, Chop the remaining fresh, hulled strawberries into small chunks. Spread the chopped strawberries onto the custard. Pipe another layer of crème pâtissière over the berries. Use an offset spatula to spread the custard evenly.If you want to garnish the top of the cake with fresh strawberries, wash and slice a few extra berries. Set them aside.

, Set the other layer of cake on top of the crème pâtissière. The cut side should be facing up, so the top is totally level. Spread the rest of the lemon syrup over the top and gently push down on the layer of cake., Take the chilled marzipan circle out of the refrigerator. Gently lift it off of the baking sheet and set it directly onto the top of the cake in the pan. Put the cake into the refrigerator to chill.


The Fraisier cake should be completely cold before you decorate and serve it.

, Melt about 1/4 cup (40 g) of chopped, white chocolate. Place it in a piping bag with a small tip. Pipe the chocolate onto a silicone mat or more acetate. You can pipe decorations in any style you like. Chill the chocolate decorations until they've hardened.If you don't want to use white chocolate, you could substitute bittersweet or semisweet chocolate.

, Once the cake is cold, remove it from the refrigerator. Release the sides of the springform pan and slowly peel away the strip of acetate.If you used foil, the sides of the cake may not be completely smooth.

, Place your chocolate decorations on the marzipan top of the cake. Garnish the cake with additional fresh strawberries, a few silver sugar pearls, or a dusting of powdered sugar. Slice the cake and serve it immediately.You can store leftovers in the refrigerator for about a day. The moisture in the strawberries will eventually make the cake soggy.

Purchase one large head of cauliflower.,
Pick up fresh garlic, eggs, low fat mozzarella cheese, onion powder, salt and pepper.,
Locate your food processor.,
Find a large mixing bowl (or electric mixer) and a baking pan that will be used to bake these delightful treats.",How to Make Cheesy Cauliflower Breadsticks1," One head will yield at least 20 sticks depending upon how they are cut. Make sure the cauliflower is cleaned and washed before using.;
, You will also need non-stick cooking spray too.

, This handy tool is what will transform the chunky cauliflower to a mealy substance that will make the bread sticks more like bread and less like cauliflower.


Find a cheese grater or sharp knife. You will need to grate or chop the cheese to top the breadsticks.

, Make sure the baking pan has sides and isn’t completely flat. The cauliflower mixer will essentially be poured into the pan so it will need sides to hold it in place.

Let the bread cool for 10 minutes After you take the bread out of the oven, let it cool on the counter for 10 minutes.",How to Make Cauliflower Bread," Before you begin preparing the cauliflower, first preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (232.22 C). The oven will preheat as you are preparing and forming the bread so that it will be hot enough by the time you are ready to bake it., Rinse the head of cauliflower, then place it on a cutting board. Cut away the central stem of the cauliflower as well as any other stems so that you are left with the florets, or the bushy tops, of the cauliflower.If you don’t cut away the stems, the bread will have a tougher and less fluffy consistency. You don’t have to cut away every last bit of stem; just do your best to cut most of it away.

, Once you cut away the stems from the cauliflower, place half of the cauliflower florets in a food processor. Pulse the cauliflower on high until it is about the same texture as rice.After grinding, pour the ground cauliflower into a microwaveable bowl.

, Place the rest of the cauliflower florets in the food processor and grind until they reach the same texture as cauliflower you just ground. Then pour the rest of the cauliflower into the microwaveable bowl as well., Even though you will bake the cauliflower into bread, you first need to cook the cauliflower in the microwave to get it soft. Place the bowl of ground cauliflower in the microwave, then microwave on high for 7 minutes., Take the cauliflower out of the microwave and let sit until it is cool enough to handle. Then place one third of the ground cauliflower in a cheesecloth and fold up the corners of the cheesecloth so it resembles a sack.Squeeze the cheesecloth over the sink until releasing the liquid from the cooked cauliflower until no more liquid comes out. Place the drained cauliflower aside, then drain the rest of the cauliflower in two batches using the same method of squeezing with the cheesecloth.
Draining the cauliflower releases liquid and dries it so that when it bakes it has the consistency of bread.
If you don’t have cheesecloth, you can use folded heavy-duty paper towel.

, Crack a large egg into a bowl, then beat it lightly with a fork until the yolk and egg whites are just combined. Shred the mozzarella cheese using a coarse grater., Once you have drained all the cauliflower and prepared the egg and cheese, place the cauliflower in a large bowl. Add the lightly beaten egg, shredded cheese, and the salt and pepper. Stir with a large spoon to completely combine.You can also add additional ingredients if you want to give you cauliflower bread extra flavor. Add a tablespoon of fresh, shredded herbs like rosemary of parsley for a more nuanced taste, or add an additional ½ cup (118.2 ml) of cheese to give it a richer, cheesier taste.

, Tear off a piece of parchment paper and use it to line a large baking sheet. Then spray the parchment paper lightly with non-stick cooking spray., Scoop out the cauliflower mixture onto the baking sheet in four equally sized portions. Use your hands to form the mixture into four square that are about ½ inch (1.27 cm) thick. Make sure that the cauliflower squares are spaced out so that they don’t overlap when baked., Once you form the cauliflower mixture into squares, place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake the bread for 15 minutes, then check on its progress. If the bread is golden, remove it from the oven. If not, let it cook for 2 more minutes and then take it out., Then use a spatula to remove the bread from the baking sheet, and serve it warm or cooled!"

",How to Make Pumpkin Bread," Pumpkin puree is simply cooked pumpkin sent through a food processor or blender. Roasting the pumpkin brings out it's sweet, nutty flavor and makes it tender enough to puree.;
, You'll be cutting parallel to the grooves running up and down the pumpkin. Work slowly to prevent accidents, start at the stem, working down, and then end back through the stem to cut the gourd cleanly in half.

, You want a clean, smooth surface in the pumpkin. The thin stringy bits will catch fire if left, charring the pumpkin. The seed can be either discarded or saved. Try toasting them for 15 minutes or so and adding to the pumpkin bread., For larger pumpkins, you may want to wait about an hour. When done, they will be nice and tender, and can be easily pierced with a fork. Let them cool off before handling.

, Get as much off the skin as possible, using a large spoon to scrape the pumpkin into a bowl. Throw the skin away.

, Make sure you don't have any chunks as well, working the pumpkin until it is perfectly smooth. You can now store the pumpkin for up to two weeks and use in any recipe that calls for canned or pureed pumpkin.

, While the oven heats up, grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. If you're doubling the recipe, make sure you use two pans. Grease both with non-stick cooking spray or butter. This batter tends to rise substantially, so you'll only be able to fill the pan roughly halfway., Whisk up all the dry ingredients so that there are no chunks or clumps, then set aside.

, You want to work the butter and sugar until well combined and fluffy-looking. It can help to let the butter warm up to room temperature 10-15 minutes before you start mixing. Keep the beaters on medium-low and whip until all the sugar is all combined with the butter., Mix the eggs in well, but don't overdo it. Once the eggs are indistinguishable from the rest of the mixture, move on to the other egg or the rest of the recipe., Keep the mixer on low or medium-low speed and add the pumpkin slowly. It is okay if it is still a little grainy or streaky looking; it will keep mixing with the other ingredients.

, Add the flour in three parts, mixing each third in almost completely before adding the rest. This prevents messes and helps evenly distribute the flour mixture throughout the batter. You want to go slowly here.

, The top of the bread should be a touch darker than golden brown, and a toothpick or knife stuck in the center of the loaf should come out cleanly. This means that, when stabbed, the only things that come out of the loaf with the knife are a few crumbs.


Don't be surprised if a thicker, denser bread (more batter, a smaller pan) require closer to 75 minutes., Pumpkin bread goes well with toasted walnuts or pecans, but you can keep it in the gourd family by simply toasting up some pumpkin seeds as well. No matter what nut or seed you prefer, adding 1 cup of them can take your bread to the next level.Want some crunch without the nuts? Try out 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.


, Spiced breads all go well with a punch of sweet, dried fruit. The dried fruit also goes well with some nuts. Add 1 cup of dried fruit for each loaf. If you're adding nuts, add only a half cup of each. Try out:


Raisins
Golden raisins
Dried cranberries
Dried apricots

, You can use any frosting you want, but these two, in particular, go nicely with the nutty, spiced flavor of good pumpkin bread. Making them is also relatively easy:



Cream Cheese Frosting: Use a hand mixer to beat a 4 oz room-temperature cream cheese, 4 tablespoons butter, 2 cups powdered sugar (added slowly), and a teaspoon vanilla extract until smooth.Orange Glaze: Whisk together 1 cup powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons orange juice, 1 teaspoon orange zest, and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla until smooth., Instead of egg, mix 1 tablespoon flax meal with 3 tablespoons of water until it is sticky and mixed. Then simply use this flax mixture in place of the eggs, adding to the sugar and butter mixture. Note that the bread may take up to 15 minutes longer to cook.,"

",How to Use Cupcake Liners," It is extremely important to choose cupcake liners that will match the rest of your party décor. You do not want your cupcakes sticking out like a sore thumb, you want them to stick out like a 10 carat diamond ring...nice! There are many stores that have quality cupcake liners in almost any color and design imaginable. If you are not cooking cupcakes for any special event, you don't need to worry about the color or design of the wrapper, unless you just feel like being creative.;
, You never know what may happen during the cupcake cooking process, so you will want to make sure that you order a couple extra cupcake liners in case a mishap happens and you have to toss a batch of cupcakes. If you run out of cupcake liners while cooking your cupcakes, you will either have to a) drive to the store, hope they still have the same ones, and purchase more cupcake liners, b) order more from the online store you purchased them from and hope they have an overnight shipping option, c) make less cupcakes than what you planned to make.

, You will need to place a liner in each indentation or ""cup"" in the cupcake pans before you pour the batter into the pan.

, Depending on how you will decorate your cupcakes, you will need to fill each cupcake liner with batter. If you want a crown on your cupcake (or for your cupcake to look more like a mushroom) you will need to fill the cupcake liner three-quarters of the way. If you do not want a crown and need a flat or sunken surface for your decorating needs, you should not fill the cupcake liner more than halfway.

Serve and enjoy!",How to Make Elmo Cupcakes," The cupcake recipe makes 18 cupcakes, so you'll need two 12-count cupcake pans, or one 12-count and one six-count. Line 18 of the cups with white cupcake liners, and preheat your oven to 350 F (177 C). To make and decorate the cupcakes, you'll also need:


One large, one medium, and two small mixing bowls
Electric beaters, stand mixer, or whisk
Sifter
Rubber spatula or wooden spoon
Wire cooling rack
Frosting or butter knife
Pastry bag
Grass tip and a small round tip;
, In a small bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric beater for two to three minutes. The eggs should be fluffy and at the soft peak stage, meaning they’ll hold a peak, but only for a couple seconds. Set the egg whites aside.The reason you separate the egg yolks from the whites in this recipe is to achieve the lightest and fluffiest cupcakes possible.

, In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Sifting will remove lumps, make for a smoother batter, and create a fluffier cake.If you don’t have a sifter, simply whisk the dry ingredients together to remove lumps.

, In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter on high speed for about a minute. Use the paddle attachment to cream the butter. Add in the sugar, and continue beating on high speed for another four minutes, until the two are smooth, creamy, and completely incorporated.


If you don’t have a stand mixer, use a large mixing bowl and electric beaters to cream the butter and sugar.
The creaming process is important, because it whips air into the butter and makes for a lighter cake.

, Lower the speed of the mixer to medium and beat in the egg yolks and vanilla. Beat for one to two minutes, or until the eggs are fully incorporated into the butter and sugar mixture.If too much mixture gets stuck on the sides of the bowl, stop mixing and use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides.

, Turn the mixer speed down low. Add one-third of the dry ingredients to the bowl and mix to combine. Add half the milk and mix until combined.


Continue alternating between adding the dry ingredients and milk until they have all been beaten in.Stop mixing once all the ingredients are incorporated. Over-mixing can develop the gluten in the flour, and this will result in cupcakes that are dense, heavy, and elastic.

, Pour the egg whites into the mixture and use the rubber spatula to gently fold them in. When the batter is ready, it will be thick and smooth.


Adding the whipped egg whites to the batter at the very end will make the cupcakes nice and fluffy.

, Use a spoon to fill the 18 cupcake liners with batter. The cupcakes will rise as they bake, so don’t fill the liners more than halfway.


If your half-empty cupcake pan is prone to warping, fill the empty cups one-third full with water.

, The cupcakes will need 18 to 21 minutes in the oven. You know they're ready when you press the top with your finger gently and it springs back, or when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.


When the cupcakes come out of the oven, allow them to cool for 10 minutes in the pan.

, After 10 minutes, remove the cupcakes from the pan and transfer them to a wire rack. Set them aside and allow them to cool to room temperature before decorating.Hot or warm cupcakes will melt the frosting, so you can’t decorate them until they’ve cooled.

, Outfit a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, and pour the butter into the bowl. Whip the butter on medium–high speed for about eight minutes, until it’s creamy, light, and pale yellow.If you don’t have a stand mixer, put the butter into a medium mixing bowl and whip it with electric beaters, or a whisk.

, When the butter is ready, reduce the speed to medium and add the sugar one spoonful at a time. Wait for the sugar to become incorporated into the butter before adding more.Adding the sugar slowly like this will work more air into the mixture, making the frosting light and creamy.

, Once all the sugar has been incorporated, add in the vanilla, salt, and 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of the milk. Increase the speed to high and beat everything for about four minutes.


If the frosting is too heavy and thick, whip in another tablespoon (15 ml) of milk, until you achieve a frosting that’s fluffy, light, and spreadable., Remove one cup of frosting from the bowl, put it in a small mixing bowl, and set it aside. Add 10 drops of red food coloring to the main batch of frosting and beat it to incorporate the color. Add more food coloring as necessary until you achieve the desired intensity of red for Elmo’s fur.


Add five drops of black food coloring to the small bowl of frosting. Whisk the color in until it’s fully incorporated, and add more food coloring as necessary to achieve a black frosting.
The black frosting will be used to create the pupils in Elmo’s eyes.

, Use the frosting knife to cover each cupcake with a thin layer of red frosting. This base layer will make the fur as intense as possible, and ensure there aren't any areas of exposed cake under the fur.The frosting recipe is good for 24 cupcakes, so don’t worry if you're generous with the frosting.

, Fill the pastry bag with red frosting, and fit it with the grass tip.To create the fur, place the tip of the bag at the center of the cupcake, squeeze the bag gently to release one-quarter to a half-inch (6 to 12 mm) of frosting, and then pull the tip up and away.Continue making fur like this, working outward in a spiral motion to the edge of the cupcake.
Cover the entire cupcake top with fur, making sure there aren't any areas where white cake is showing through from underneath.

, Once all the cupcakes have been decorated with fur, clean and dry the pastry bag. For each cupcake, position two candy melts side by side at the top center of the cupcake.When the pastry bag is dry, fill it with the black frosting, and fit it with the small round tip. Pipe a small dot of black frosting onto the center of each candy melt to create the pupils.

, To create the nose, place a single orange chocolate-covered peanut candy in the middle of each cupcake, right below the eyes. For the mouth, cut each chocolate sandwich cookie in half. Place a half cookie in the center of each cupcake, half an inch (12 mm) below the nose. Make sure the rounded edge of the cookie faces down, farthest away from the nose.


If peanut allergies are a concern, use an orange gumdrop, gumball, jelly bean, or other candy instead., To keep the icing from melting, place the cupcakes in the refrigerator if you aren't serving them immediately. Before serving, let them warm up for at least half an hour.

Insert the candy corn.",How to Make Turkey Cupcakes1," Place 1 cup (227 g) of softened butter into a large mixing bowl and beat it with an electric mixer until it's light and fluffy. This should take about a minute. Beat in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1/3 cup (35 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons of milk, and 1 cup (125 g) of the powdered sugar on low speed. Keep beating the frosting on low and add more powdered sugar until the frosting is thick enough to spread on your cupcakes.You may need a total of 2 to 3 1/2 cups (250 to 437 g) of powdered sugar.;
, Arrange 24 baked and completely cooled cupcakes on your work surface. Use an offset spatula or a knife to spread an even layer of frosting over each cupcake. This will make a base for you to pipe more frosting for the turkey.You can use any flavor of cupcake. Try vanilla, chocolate, yellow, red velvet, or spice.

, Scoop the chocolate frosting into a pastry bag with a simple round tip insert. Take one cupcake and squeeze a 1-inch mound of frosting on one side of the cupcake. This will be the turkey's head. Squeeze a slightly smaller mound of frosting on the opposite side of the cupcake to make the tail mound. Repeat this for every cupcake.If you don't have a pastry bag, you can fill a plastic food storage bag and snip off a corner of the bag.

, Use 1 tube (4.25 ounces or 120 g) of white decorating icing and 1 tube (4.25 ounces or 120 g) of brown decorating icing to make the eyes. Squeeze two very small white dots on the frosting mound that will be the turkey's head. Take the brown icing and carefully make to smaller dots on each white dot.You could also use black decorating icing instead of brown.

, Insert about 6 to 8 pieces of candy corn (from a 22-ounce (624 g) package) into the frosting mound that will be the turkey's tail. The yellow tips of the candy corn should be visibly sticking out of the frosting so they look like feathers. Insert one piece of candy corn so that it's coming out of the turkey's head. Repeat this for all the cupcakes.To give the appearance of smaller feathers, sprinkle chocolate candy sprinkles behind the head near the candy corn feathers.

You can heat the chips on low and stir constantly until they melt. Or you can microwave the chocolate chips to melt the chocolate. Microwave the chips for 30 seconds at a time and stir frequently until they're melted.You'll be dividing the melted white chocolate for decorating the turkey faces.

, Remove 1/4 cup of the melted white chocolate and place it in a small bowl. Stir in enough orange gel food dye to get a tan colored chocolate. Take a Hershey's Kiss and dip the pointy end into the tan-colored chocolate. This will make the turkey beak. Repeat this for all of the Hershey's Kisses. Let the turkey beaks cool and harden.Since orange gel food dyes vary in intensity, you may need to gradually add more gel until you get the color you like. Avoid using liquid food coloring because it will make the chocolate separate.

, Open a 10.8 ounce (306 g) package of mini-chocolate M&Ms and divide the M&Ms by color. Take a red mini-M&M and carefully dip one side of it in the tan-colored chocolate. Press it to the base of the turkey beak to make the wattle (red part) of the turkey. Dip blue or brown mini-M&Ms into the remaining melted white chocolate and place them above the beak so that the white chocolate spreads behind the mini-M&Ms. This will make the eyes.If you want the whites of the eyes to be more noticeable, you can put the melted white chocolate into a pastry bag with a small tip. Pipe little dots of white chocolate and set the mini-M&Ms on them. Let them cool before sticking them to the Hershey's Kiss with more melted chocolate or frosting., Arrange 24 baked and completely cooled cupcakes on your work surface.

, Break off the bottom 1/3 of a Nutter Butter cookie and discard or eat the excess piece. Do this for 24 cookies so they'll be easier to insert into the cupcakes. Dab a little bit of frosting near the rounded part of the cookie so the decorations will stick to the turkey face. Place 2 candy eyes (from a 50-count package) on the frosting and stick a piece of candy corn (from a 22-ounce package) below it for the beak. You can also tear a small strip of red fruit leather from one package to stick next to the beak.To make beaks that are entirely orange, you could cut the candy corn pieces to remove the white and yellow ends.

, Open 24 Oreo cookies and discard or eat the pieces that don't have the frosting. Lay out the 24 pieces of Oreos that do have frosting on your work surface. Press 5 pieces of candy corn around into the frosting so that it creates a fan of tail feathers. Repeat this for each Oreo cookie.The narrow white part of the candy corn should be pointing towards the center of the cookie.

, Take one of your decorated Nutter Butter cookies and insert it on the cupcake half nearest you. Take one decorated Oreo cookie and insert it behind the Nutter Butter cookie. Sprinkle chocolate candy sprinkles between the two cookies to give the appearance of small feathers.You'll only need to insert the cookies about 1/2-inch deep.

This will make the cupcakes heavy and dense instead of light and fluffy.
When the batter is ready, cover it with a damp towel or plastic wrap and set it aside while you make the frosting.
You can use dairy milk, soy milk, or almond milk for these cupcakes.
For the best results, choose an oil with a very mild flavor, such as grapeseed, canola, or safflower.

, Put the butter into a medium bowl and cream it with electric beaters or a wooden spoon. When it becomes light and fluffy, mix in the sugar in ½-cup (57.5-g) increments. When the butter and sugar are fully creamed together, add in the vanilla and the milk.Once all the ingredients have been added, beat the frosting on medium speed for three minutes., Divide the batter equally among three bowls. For the first batch of batter, add a few drops of red food coloring or edible gel paste to the bowl and stir with a clean spoon until the color is fully incorporated. Add more color as necessary to achieve the desired intensity. Repeat with the blue and yellow food coloring.You can actually use any colors you like for tie-dye cupcakes, and can also use more than just three colors. Be sure to use a fresh bowl and a fresh spoon for each batch of colored batter, otherwise the colors will become muddy.
You can also mix and match food coloring to achieve different colors. For instance, you can mix blue and red to achieve purple.
To have white in your mix, leave one of the bowls of batter uncolored.

, Prepare a cupcake tin by lining it with white cupcake liners. Into the bottom of each liner, drop 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of red batter. Then place one or two spoons of yellow batter on top of that, followed by an equal quantity of blue batter on top. Stop when the liners are filled half way.


You can layer the colors in any way you like, and don’t have to use the red, yellow, blue pattern. different spoons for each color.
If you're using more colors, use ½ to 1 tablespoon (7.5 to 15 ml) of batter for each color.
Instead of spooning the colors into the liners, you can also transfer each batter color to a separate pastry bag, and pipe in the batters one color at a time., To create the tie-dye effect, take a clean toothpick and gently swirl around the batter in each liner. Don’t mix too much, or you will end up blending the colors and they’ll become muddy.You can create circular tie-dye patterns by swirling the toothpick in circles.
Create wavy patterns by zig zagging the toothpick in the batter.
Make tie-dye spikes by dipping the toothpick into the batter in a few places and pulling it straight out. This will lift the bottom batter colors to the top.

, Preheat your oven to 365 F (185 C). When it’s hot, put in the cupcakes and bake them for 20 minutes. After that time, remove the cakes from the oven with an oven mitt to see if they're ready. To tell if the cupcakes are done, you can:Stick a toothpick into the center of a cupcake. It’s ready if the toothpick comes out clean.
Press gently against a cupcake with your finger. It’s ready if the cake bounces back when pressed.

, Transfer the baked cupcakes to a wire cooling rack. Let them cool to room temperature before serving or frosting. It’s important to let the cupcakes cool before you add frosting, otherwise the frosting will melt off instead of sticking to the top of the cupcakes.


Once the cupcakes are baked, they are ready to serve if you don’t want to add frosting.

, Divide the frosting into three separate bowls. Add a few drops of a different food coloring or edible gel paste to each bowl and stir to combine. Add a few more drops of the coloring as necessary to achieve the desired intensity.When the frosting is ready, transfer it to the fridge and let it chill for 30 minutes. This will make it easier to work with and prevent it from melting on the cupcakes.You can use any colors you like for the frosting. For instance, you can choose the same colors as you used for the cupcakes, or you can use complementary or clashing colors.
As with the batter, you can use as many or as few colors as you like for the frosting. Just be sure to use separate bowls and spoons for each color.

, Fit a piping bag with your desired tip for frosting the cupcakes. Fill the bag with the frosting, using a spoon to position the frosting colors side by side in the bag. This way, the three colors will come out of the bag simultaneously, creating a tie-dye effect with the frosting as well.Alternatively, you can use a plastic freezer bag if you don’t have a piping bag. Fill one of the bottom corners of the bag with frosting the same way you would the piping bag. When you're ready to frost, cut a small hole in the bottom corner and squeeze the bag to push out the frosting.

, Start the piping around the outer edge of the cupcake and work your way toward the center in a spiral shape. When you get to the very center, pull up the tip of the bag to form a small peak in the middle.Serve immediately, or store the cupcakes in an air-tight container in a cool place for a couple days.

Go for a quick but cute design.,
Create an “under the sea” cupcake your child could create.,
Prepare a frosting crab.,
Finished.

",How to Make Under the Sea Themed Cupcakes2," If you are really pressed for time and resources, you can still create a delicious beach-themed cupcake without a lot of skill and effort.

Crush 20 graham cracker cookies in a large plastic bag. The crushed graham crackers will become a “sandy beach” atop your cupcake so take time to thoroughly crush the cookies. Transfer crushed cookies to a paper plate.






Frost a thin layer on top of each cupcake. Choose light blue frosting (tint white frosting with blue food coloring), which will represent water when you are finished.






Dip half of the cupcake in the crushed cookies. Now you have a sandy beach!






Add more blue frosting to the other half of the cupcake and gently lift the frosting to create small peaks.






Top with a small drink umbrella, perched atop of the sandy beach side of the cupcake.







, Using candy, create a small sea turtle to sit on top of each cupcake. You will need sour peach gummy ring candies, gum drops (red and green), spearmint leaf candies and mini chocolate chips.

Add a thin layer of frosting to each cupcake. However, don’t frost each cupcake too early in advance as you don’t want the frosting to dry. The frosting will act as the “glue” to hold your sea turtle in place.






Place the peach gummy ring in the middle of the cupcake and add a gumdrop to its middle. This will be the basis for the turtle’s shell.






Add a gumdrop to the top of the gummy ring to become the turtle’s head. Consider using a green gumdrop for the head, especially to match the spearmint leaf candy arms.






Slice a spearmint candy in half to create the turtle’s fins. For faster assembly, do this ahead of time. Create more of a fin appearance by rounding out the inside of the spearmint candy so that it fits around the outside of the peach ring candy. Don’t discard the cut pieces--the smaller cut pieces can be used for the turtle’s feet.






Place the larger pieces of spearmint candy alongside the top of the peach gummy candy and below the turtle’s head. Add the feet at the bottom.






Place a dab of frosting on the bottom of two mini chocolate chips and place on each side of the turtle’s head to create the eyes.







, This cupcake design may be slightly more time consuming and require a higher skill level, but can be mastered with just a small amount of practice.

Gather your supplies. You will need two frosting bag tips (#104 and #3), a bag of red frosting (white icing mixed with red food coloring), small white jawbreaker candies (or another round white candy) and a black food coloring pen.






Add a thin layer of frosting to each cupcake.






Create the crab’s base by making a small, thick half moon atop a pre-frosted cupcake (using tip #104).






Add the two white eyes (or jawbreaker/white candies) to the middle/back of your base and create eyeballs using the black food coloring pen.






Pipe a small amount of red frosting behind the eyes using the #3 tip.






Pipe over the top of the eyes using tip #104. Completely blanket and cover the crab from bottom of the base, over the top of the eyes to the other side of the base-- this is the upper half of the crab shell.






Create legs and crab claws using the #3 tip. Give the crab three legs on each side of the base and then two pincher claws in front.

Place cupcake liners into two muffin tins so you'll have enough for 24 strawberry banana cupcakes.If you don't have liners, you could just spray the muffin tins with baking spray or you could grease and flour the tins.

, Peel three large bananas and set them in a mixing bowl. Mash the bananas with a potato masher, rubber spatula, or fork until they're completely smooth. Stir in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and set the mixture aside.The lemon juice will prevent the bananas from browning a lot and give a slight citrus flavor to the cupcakes.

, Put 3 cups (375 g) of all purpose flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Whisk the dry ingredients for about 30 seconds so they're incorporated. Set the dry ingredients aside.You could also sift the ingredients together into a bowl to combine the dry ingredients.

, Place 3/4 cup (170 g) of softened salted butter into a large mixing bowl and beat it on medium speed for 30 seconds. Add 2 1/4 cups (450 g) of granulated sugar and continue beating the mixture until it's light and fluffy. It should take about two minutes to cream the butter and sugar together.Creaming the butter and sugar will make the cupcakes light and fluffy, instead of dense and tough.

, Add three eggs one at a time and beat the creamed butter and sugar well after each addition. You should also scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula after adding each egg. Stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.Avoid turning the mixer on to a high speed when beating in the eggs. A high speed could cause the egg to fly out of the mixing bowl.

, Stir in one third of the dry ingredients on low speed. Add 3/4 cup (176 ml) of buttermilk and continue to beat on low speed. Add another third of the dry ingredients. Finish adding the last 3/4 cup (176 ml) of buttermilk before mixing in the last third of the dry ingredients. Carefully fold in the reserved mashed bananas.To fold in the bananas, hold a rubber spatula in your hand and twist your wrist in a circular motion. This will incorporate the bananas and will keep the batter light.

, Scoop enough batter into each liner so that it's two-thirds full of batter. You'll probably need to divide the batter among 24 muffin liners. Put the muffin tins in the oven and bake the cupcakes for about 15 minutes. Test the cupcakes to see whether or not they're cooked by inserting a toothpick. If cooked, the toothpick should come out clean. Remove the cupcakes and let them cool on a rack.You can also carefully touch the top of the cupcakes. The cupcake should spring back once you've removed your finger. If your finger leaves an indentation, the cupcakes need to cook longer.

, Get out 1/3 cup (73 g) of frozen and sweetened strawberries. These are usually sold in a sweet syrup. Place them in a bowl and let them thaw completely. Transfer the thawed strawberries and syrup to a blender and puree them until they're completely smooth.If you're short on time, you could purchase canned strawberries in syrup to puree.

, Place 3/4 cup (170 g) of softened, salted butter and 4 ounces (115 g) of softened cream cheese into a large mixing bowl. Beat the butter and cream cheese on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy. Slowly stir in the pureed strawberries and add 3 1/2 cups (437 g) of powdered sugar on low speed. Once the powdered sugar is mixed in, you can turn the speed up to high and beat the frosting for a minute.Ensure that the cream cheese and butter are at room temperature. This will prevent the frosting from being lumpy.

, Spread the frosting onto the cooled banana cupcakes or pipe the frosting. To pipe the frosting, fill a pastry bag or plastic freezer bag with the frosting. Use a pastry tip of your choice or cut a corner of the plastic bag so you can pipe the frosting onto each cupcake. To garnish the cupcakes, consider topping them with:Sliced strawberries or bananas

By the time that you have finished making the cupcake batter, the oven should be ready to use., Begin preparing the cupcake batter by combining the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully combined., Inside a separate large bowl or in the bowl of a standing mixer, turn on a handheld or standing mixer on high, then add the vegetable oil, granulated sugar, two eggs and vanilla while continually mixing. Stir until the mixture is completely combined and there aren’t any sugar lumps, about twenty seconds.Once you have finished mixing the sugar mixture, remove the mixer from the bowl and scrape down the sides with a large spoon so that the mixture is sitting in the middle of the bowl.

, Once you have scraped the mixture into the middle of the bowl, turn the handheld or standing mixer back on low and add the sour cream and half the flour mixture (½ cup or 60 ml), pausing a few seconds to let it integrate. Then add half the buttermilk (1/3 cup or 78.8 ml) and mix until it is combined. Scrape down the bowl as you did before so that the mixture is sitting in the middle., After scraping, turn the mixer on low again and add the last of the flour mixture, mixing until it is smooth, then add the rest of the buttermilk. Make sure that the batter is completely smooth, then turn off the mixer., Once you finish the batter, you can begin the process of baking the cupcakes. Prepare two 12- cavity muffin tins by lining the insets with cupcake liners., Spoon the cupcake batter that you just prepared into the cupcake liners of the muffin tins. Fill each liner about ½ to 2/3 full with batter.Cupcakes expand when they bake, so don’t fill the insets to the top with batter.

, Place the trays of cupcakes into the preheated oven and bake the cupcakes for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, insert a toothpick into a cupcake. If it comes out clean, take the cupcakes out of the oven.If the toothpick comes out with crumbs sticking to it, bake the cupcakes for two more minutes, then take them out of the oven.

, Once you remove the cupcakes from the oven, place them on the counter to cool. Let them sit in the muffin tin for at least 10 minutes so that they have time to solidify., After the cupcakes have cooled for 10 minutes in the tins, carefully lift each cupcake up by its liner and place them on a wire rack to cool. If you don’t have a wire rack, place them on the counter.Taking the cupcakes out of the hot muffin tins helps them to cool faster, which means that you will be able to frost them sooner.

, After setting the cupcakes out to cool, you can begin to make the peppermint frosting. Start by beating room temperature butter on medium speed with an electric handheld or standing mixer until it is fluffy and a slightly lighter color than when it was in stick form., Once the butter is fluffy, turn the speed of the mixer to low and add the ½ cup (120 ml) of confectioners sugar. Mix until integrated, about ten seconds, then keep adding sugar by the ½ cup and mixing until you have added 3 ½ cups (840 ml) of the confectioners sugar., Once you have added 3 ½ cups (840 ml) of confectioners sugar, turn the mixer to high and beat the mixture for about 10 seconds. Then add the rest of the confectioners sugar and mix until combined., Add 1 tablespoon (14.78 ml) of whipping cream to the frosting, then beat on medium until it is integrated. Repeat adding whipping cream by the teaspoon and mixing until you have added all the whipping cream (4 tablespoons or 60 ml)., Once the whipping cream has been added and the mixture has a frosting-like texture, add in the mint extract ½ teaspoon (2.46 ml) at a time, mixing on medium speed. You can add anywhere from 1-2 teaspoons (4.9- 9.8 ml), depending on your preference. Also add a few drops of green food coloring and mix in if you want the frosting to be green.Do a taste test after integrating 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of mint extract into the frosting if you aren’t sure how much mint you want to use. Then decide if you want to add more or keep the frosting as is.

, If you want a professional-looking application of frosting, add the freshly made frosting to a piping bag by spooning the frosting inside the bag and pushing the frosting to the tip of the piper.If you don’t have a piping bag, you can simply apply the frosting to the cupcakes with a knife.

, If the cupcakes have reached room temperature or close to it, you can apply the frosting. Pipe the frosting on the cupcake by holding the tip of the piping bag over the cupcake, then squeezing the bag to release the frosting. Frost in a traditional swirl design by working in circles until your reach a peak at the top of the cupcake.Alternatively, you can also simply apply the frosting with a flat knife. Make sure to cover the entire top of the cupcake with frosting, and run the flat of the knife over the top after applying to smooth out the frosting.

Drizzle or pour the icing over the cupcakes and let it set.",How to Make Lemon Cupcakes," At this time, you can also prepare your cupcake pan by inserting the paper liners into the wells.;
, You can do this using a handheld mixer or an electric mixer with a paddle attachment. To make mixing even easier, cut the butter into cubes first.

, Beat the eggs in one at a time, then add the vanilla extract with the second egg.

, To avoid any lumps and clumps, pour the flour and baking powder through a sifter.

, Do not over-mix the batter, or the cupcakes will be tough. For a more complex flavor, add 1 tablespoon of toasted poppy seeds., An ice cream scooper is a great way to do this. It is quick, easy, and it will ensure that each liner gets the same amount of batter.

, The cupcakes are done when the edges turn golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Another way to tell if the cupcakes are done is by pressing on one of the domes; if it bounces back up, it's done.

, Let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes first, then transfer them to a baking rack to finish cooling. Choose a frosting or glaze from below to decorate your cupcakes with.

, You can do this using an electric mixer or a handheld mixer fitted with paddles. This recipe will give you a frosting that is rich and creamy, perfect for spreading or piping.

,, If you don't have any heavy cream, you can use half-and-half instead. At this point, you can also add other ingredients to alter the flavor of your icing.


If you'd like to make lemon buttercream, add 2 tablespoons of lemon zest, 3 tablespoons of lemon juice.If you'd like, you can also add in a few drops of yellow food coloring.
If you'd like to make blackberry buttercream, use only 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and add ½ cup (165 grams) of seedless blackberry jam., Depending on what you added to the frosting, and how thick you like it, you might not even have to use all of the sugar.


If the frosting is too thin, add more confecitoner's/icing sugar. If the icing is too thick, add more heavy cream.

, You can do this simply by spreading the buttercream on using a spatula. or fancier cupcakes, you can pipe them on using a piping bag and a decorator's tip.

, This icing is much more delicate than the typical frosting or buttercream. It is glaze-like and perfect for pouring or drizzling.

, How much liquid you add will depend on how thick or thin you want your glaze to be. Keep in mind that it will harden once it sets.


If you'd like to make a lemon glaze, use lemon juice instead., If you are making lemon glaze, consider skipping the extract and using 2 teaspoons of lemon zest instead., If the mixture is too thin, add some more confectioners'/icing sugar. If the mixture is too thick, add more of whatever liquid you were using. If you were using lemon, however, consider using just water so as not to overpower the other flavors.

, After a few minutes, the icing will set and harden. If the icing layer is too thin, wait until it hardens, then pour or drizzle more on.

, In a large pot of salted water, boil the dry elbows until soft and slightly firm. The time it takes to cook depends on your package's cooking instructions. For most pastas, it should take about 7-10 minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander once fully cooked.

, Return the macaroni back to the pot. Crack the egg and add it to the elbows. Then slowly pour the softened butter. Use a wooden spoon to combine until well-coated. The elbows should be slightly buttery when combined thoroughly.

, First, add the shredded mozzarella cheese. Use the wooden spoon to blend until the cheese melts and the macaroni is creamy. Then add only 1 cup of the sharp cheddar cheese. The color will result into a bright, orange color and the macaroni will feel sticky.

, Splash in the milk to the macaroni and cheese and incorporate the pasta with a wooden spoon. Mix until the macaroni is smooth and not as sticky as before.

, Use a mini ice cream scoop to place the macaroni and cheese into each case into the tray. Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup of cheddar cheese and the breadcrumbs on top of the cupcakes.

, Place the macaroni and cheese cupcakes in the oven have them bake for about half and hour, until the edges are brown and crispy. The tops of the cupcakes should also be slightly brown. Remove the cupcakes from the oven once fully baked.

, Before you remove the cupcakes from the tray, have them cool for about 10 minutes. That way the cheese can set and the cupcakes can remain in its shape.

, Remove the cupcakes from the cupcake tray and serve them on a serving plate. Consider serving these cupcakes with homemade chicken nuggets and/or a salad.

, Pour the cake mix into a large mixing bowl, then stir in the water, oil, and eggs. Beat the batter for 2 minutes. You can do this using a whisk, a mixer, or even a food processor fitted with whisks.You can use any flavor of cake mix you want. Chocolate is quite popular, but you can also use white, birthday, or even red velvet!
The amounts for the water, oil, and eggs are based on what's commonly printed on the back of cake mixes. If your cake mix uses different amounts of water, oil, and egg, you should use those instead.

, You are not filling the cupcake holes all the way because you want to save room for the ice cream. You want just the bottom of your finished cupcake to be spongy., If you are only using 1 tablespoon of batter, check on the cupcakes after 8 minutes. They are ready when a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean., Do not take them out of the pan. The cupcakes and the pan must be cool before you move on to the next step, or the ice cream will melt. If you are in a hurry, consider placing the entire pan into the freezer until it turns cold., Make sure that you pack the ice cream in well so that it completely fills the hole; do not simply drop scoops of ice cream into the holes. Plan on using about ½ cup (72 grams) of ice cream per cupcake.You can use any flavor of ice cream you want. Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and mint chip are all very popular. You can also experiment with unique flavors, such as cake batter, cookie dough, coffee, etc.
If the ice cream is too hard to scoop, let it sit for about 10 minutes on the counter.
Use a butter knife or the back of a spoon to smooth down the top of your ice cream cupcakes. This will give you a neater finish.

, The ice cream will harden during this time, and keep its shape when you serve it., When you are ready to decorate and serve the cupcakes, carefully take them out of the pan and transfer them to a tray. If you did not use cupcake liners, hold a small knife under hot water, then run the knife along the edge of cupcake. You should be able to easily lift the cupcakes out. Freeze the cupcakes for 15 minutes before decorating them., For a traditional cupcake look, use a piping bag and a star-shaped decorator's tip to pipe whipped frosting or buttercream frosting on top.You can also spoon some frosting on top instead.

Decorate the cupcakes in small batches so that the ice cream doesn't melt. Store the cupcakes in the freezer when you are not decorating them. This includes adding garnishes!

, A lot of cupcakes had a dash of sprinkles on top, but you can also use other types of garnishes as well. Try to match the garnish to your ice cream flavor. For example, sprinkles would work well with vanilla ice cream while chocolate chips would work better with mint chip ice cream. Here are some ideas to get you started:

Chocolate chips
Colored sugar
Maraschino cherries
Mini candies
Sprinkles

, You do not need to use an oven for this method, but it would be a good idea to clear some space in your freezer., The Oreo cookies need to be crushed into a fine crumble with no large chunks visible. You can crush them using a blender or a food processor. You can also crush them by putting them into a plastic bag, and then crushing them with a mallet or rolling pin.

For a twist, try white or ""birthday"" flavor Oreo cookies.If you can't find any Oreo-brand cookies, you can use any other chocolate-sandwich cookies instead.

, You can melt the butter either in the microwave or in a small saucepan over the stove. Pour the butter over the cookies, then mix it in using a fork. Smoosh and press the mixture around until everything is evenly combined., Make sure that the mixture is packed into the bottom of each cupcake liner., During this time, you can take the ice cream out of the freezer, and place it on the counter so that it will soften. The cookie mixture may not set up completely, but that is fine., Do not just leave the ice cream in little balls in the cupcake liners. You want the ice cream to completely fill each liner, from side to side, bottom to top. Use a butter knife or the back of a spoon to smooth each cupcake flat.

For a twist, try cake batter ice cream, or mix some sprinkles into vanilla ice cream., Keep the cupcakes in the freezer until you are ready to decorate and serve them. Because these cupcakes are made out of ice cream, they will start to melt as soon as you take them out., Pour the heavy whipping cream into a bowl, then stir in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat the mixture together until stiff peaks form. You can do this by hand, using a mixer, or a food processor fitted with whisks., For a typical cupcake look, use a piping bag with a star-shaped decorator's tip to pipe the frosting on top.You can also spoon the frosting on instead.

Work on the cupcakes in small batches to prevent them from melting. Store the cupcakes in the freezer when you aren't working on them.

, A lot of cupcakes have garnishes, such as sprinkles, on top. You can make your ice cream cupcakes resemble real cupcakes even more by doing the same. Consider any of the garnishes listed below, or make up your own:

Chocolate chips
Colored sugar
Maraschino cherries
Mini candies
Sprinkles

, Grease or line a cupcake pan. You will have enough batter to make about 24 cupcakes., Pour the cake mix into a large mixing bowl. Add the water, oil, and eggs, and stir until combined. Beat the ingredients together for 2 minutes. You can do this with a whisk, a mixer, or even a food processor fitted with whisks.

The amounts for the water, oil, and eggs are based on what's printed on the back of most cake mixes. If your cake mix requires different amounts of water, oil, and egg, you should use those instead.

, They are ready when a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean., Let the cupcakes cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes first, then take them out of the pan, and let them finish cooling. They must be completely cool before you move on to the next step, or the ice cream will melt., Use a paring knife to cut a circle out of the top of the cupcake. Angle the knife slightly so that when you pull the circle out, you get a cone shape.Having trouble? Use a cupcake corer to scoop out a hole out of the top of each cupcake instead., Discard the pointed end of each cone, and save the rounded part. You will use these to ""plug"" your cupcakes back up. You want the plugs to be shorter to make room for the ice cream you will be putting into the cupcakes.Instead of throwing the pointed ends away, consider saving them and turning them into cake pops.

, Plan on using 1 to 2 tablespoons of ice cream per cupcake. Don't fill each hole all the way to the top with ice cream, however.To keep the ice cream from melting too quickly, work in small batches of 3 to 4. Place each batch into the freezer as you finish it.

Having troubles getting just the right amount? Try a melon scoop!You can use any flavor of ice cream you want. Chocolate, strawberry, mint chip, and vanilla are all very popular, but you can also try more unique flavors, such as coffee or caramel swirl.

, Gently press down on each one until they are almost flush with the cupcakes once more. Don't worry if they aren't perfect or even. You will be frosting the cupcakes later on., If you made the cupcakes ahead of time, you should keep the cupcakes in the freezer until you are ready to decorate and them. Even though these cupcakes are mostly cake, their centers are still ice cream—and ice cream melts if it is out of the freezer for too long., For a traditional cupcake look, use a piping bag and a star-shaped decorator's tip to pipe whipped frosting or buttercream frosting on top., Most cupcakes have some sprinkles in addition to a swirl of frosting. You don't have to use sprinkles if you don't want to. Chocolate chips and colored sugar are also popular toppings. Here are some ideas to get you started:

Chocolate chips
Colored sugar
Maraschino cherries

Bake for the proper amount of time.,
Do a test bake before baking all the cupcakes.",How to Make Gluten Free Cupcakes," There are many options for gluten-free flour. The key to picking the right flour is knowing how you want the final product to come out. Each type of flour has unique flavors and properties. Since gluten-free flour is lower in protein than wheat flour, it’s actually a good thing for cupcakes because too much protein creates a tough cupcake. Also, look for a fine texture flour to help give your cupcakes the best structure and consistency.


Try gluten-free multi-purpose flour for a mild flavor and to cut down on the amount of ingredients needed for your cupcakes. The multi-purpose flour has gluten-free flour and starches already added to it to mimic the effects of gluten. This is good flour for beginners to gluten-free baking because it’s easy to use.
Use amaranth flour if you are looking for a very nutritious option. This flour is an ancient grain, high in fiber and binds water well. You may need more water when using amaranth flour to get the best batter consistency. It has mild corn flavor and will work best in a flour blend.
Try sorghum flour or tapioca flour for a mild flavor and a texture similar to wheat flour. These flours work well in gluten-free baking and can be used for most baked goods.
Try rice flour for good batter consistency and final texture. Rice flour contains the bran, the starch and the hulls, all of which help create a creamy, stable batter good for cupcakes.
Try cassava flour for a one to one switch with wheat flour. Cassava flour properties and flavor are very similar to cake flour. With cassava flour, you may be able to take a regular cupcake recipe and just switch the flours. The biggest issue with using cassava flour is finding a place to purchase it. You will have the best luck ordering the flour online.;
, Food gums are carbohydrates, considered dietary fiber and are not digested or absorbed by the body. They come from natural plant sources and are used to help with water binding, air cell structure and mouth-feel of a product. They come from the class of foods called hydrocolloids. Gums are very important in gluten-free baking because they help perform functions that gluten performs in regular baking.


Use xanthan gum. Xanthan gum is essential in almost every gluten-free baked good. In cupcakes, it helps trap air in the batter, giving a light texture to the cupcake and increasing the volume. For best results, do not use more than 0.5% xanthan of the total recipe weight.
Try guar gum for increased volume and a light texture. Guar gum should be used in conjunction with xanthan gum. Unlike xanthan gum, guar gum is optional. For best results, do not use more than 0.5% guar of the total recipe weight. Guar gum will be harder to find than xanthan and you may have to order it online.

, Starches are also in the class of foods called hydrocolloids. They help bind water and trap air. They work in conjunction with protein and other starches to help mimic the effects of gluten.


Some good starches for gluten-free baking are rice starch, tapioca starch, cornstarch, potato starch and arrowroot starch.
Use a starch that works well with the chosen flour. For instance, if you have rice flour, try using rice starch in the recipe as well.
Cornstarch, potato starch and arrowroot starch generally work well with any gluten-free flours.

, Providing cell structure is one of the most important and challenging aspects of a gluten-free cupcake.


Use egg whites to create a light texture. Whipped egg whites trap an abundance of air. Whipped egg whites are a delicate ingredient, so use cream of tartar to stabilize them if needed.
Use flax seed meal for an allergen-free egg substitute. Mix the flax seed meal with water and whip it to incorporate air. It will add a nutty flavor to your recipe.

, Cupcakes are chemically leavened and that leaves room to work with the type of leavening to get the best volume in your cupcakes.


Use baking soda. Fresh baking soda will work best because it will still have the most ability to create air bubbles.
Use an acid to get baking soda to react properly. Some natural acids are cream of tartar, lemon juice or buttermilk. You want to use just enough acid for the reaction so that the acid and baking soda flavor are neutral after baking. The downfall to natural acids with gluten-free baking is that they react immediately to create air bubbles. With gluten-free baking, the best acids will react more slowly to allow air bubbles to develop in the oven.
Sodium aluminum phosphate or monocalcium phosphate are good slow reacting acids. These will be hard to find at the local supermarket, but are found in specialty baking shops or online.
Be sure to check if there is acid already in the cupcake recipe and adjust the leavening accordingly.
Use double acting baking powder. This is the best option for someone new to gluten-free baking. Double acting baking powder is inexpensive and can be found at most local supermarkets. It contains baking soda and acids. Double acting means that it leavens before and during cooking, which is good for gluten-free cupcakes.

, Some necessary ingredients for a good cupcake can cause problems if used in excess in a gluten-free system.


Do not use too much sugar. Sugar will increase the temperature at which the starch begins to form a gel. In order for the starch to work best, it needs to form a gel before the water reaches boiling point.
Do not use too much dairy. Dairy and high levels of lactose will slow the rate of reaction in the cupcake batter because of the calcium present.
Use a minimal amount of course grains. Course grains change the texture of the cupcake and make it more like a muffin. They also act like knives that break the cell structure in the batter system that traps the air pockets.

, The sugar needs to be added slowly during whipping. The eggs should whip to a soft peak, creating a foam consistency of tiny air cells.

, This is done by adding the sugar as you whip the butter. The end result should have an even, creamy consistency, free of lumps.

,, This works best by alternating the addition of liquid and dry ingredients in stages.

, Be careful to keep the egg white texture as airy as possible. This will help with the light, airy texture.

, This allows the leavening process to begin and the dry ingredients to hydrate properly, which will yield the best results in the oven. This is important for cupcake volume and texture.

, Be sure to leave room for the cupcakes to rise.

, You do not want the oven to be too hot because the water may reach boiling point before everything has had a chance to react.

, This can range from 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the size and amount of the cupcakes. It is best to only use a single rack in the oven for the most even baking. Use a toothpick to check for doneness; it should come out clean.

, You can store the extra batter in the refrigerator while you test the temperature and time for baking or you can make a new one. Be sure to let the batter temperature rise slightly after taking it out of the refrigerator and before baking because it will adjust the time needed for baking.

, Place all of the dry ingredients into a medium bowl and whisk them for about 30 seconds. This will break up any lumps, aerate the flour and distribute the leavening. To make 12 eggless vanilla cupcakes, you'll need these dry ingredients:


1 1/2 cups (180 g) of cake flour
1/2 teaspoons of baking soda
2 teaspoons of baking powder
1 pinch of salt

, In a separate medium-sized mixing bowl, cream the 1/2 cup (115 g) of butter with the 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar. Beat them for a few minutes until the mixture is light and fluffy. Take a rubber spatula and fold in 1 1/4 cup (236 g) of unsweetened applesauce.Avoid stirring the applesauce in too much or the butter and sugar mixture will become dense. Simply folding in the applesauce, using a twisting motion with your wrist, will make light and fluffy cupcakes.

, Stir 1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk into the wet ingredients. Gently stir in the milk so it's combined with your butter, sugar and applesauce. The mixture will look very runny and wet. There shouldn't be any lumps.You can use any type of milk. Keep in mind that the higher milkfat milks will make richer cupcakes.

, Take the bowl of dry ingredients and carefully add the dry ingredients to your bowl of wet ingredients. Stir the dry ingredients in using a rubber spatula. Stir until the ingredients are completely combined.The cupcake batter will still be slightly runny and smooth.

, Use a measuring scoop, spoons, or a cookie scoop to fill your muffin liners or greased muffin holes with the cupcake batter. Fill each muffin hole or liner two-thirds full with the cupcake batter.Cookie scoops are easy to use when filling the liners. Depending on the size of your cookie scoop, you may need a few scoops of batter for each liner or hole.

, Place your filled muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake the cupcakes for 15 to 20 minutes. Test the cupcakes to see if they're done by inserting a cake tester or toothpick in the center of a cupcake. If it comes out clean, the cupcakes are baked. If it comes out with batter stuck to it, the cupcakes need to bake longer.Add just a few minutes baking time to your cupcakes and keep checking them for to see if they're done.

, Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes before removing them to a cooling rack. Let the cupcakes cool completely before frosting them or eating them.Store the cupcakes in an airtight container until you're ready to eat them or frost them. You can use almost any flavor of frosting to finish these eggless vanilla cupcakes.

Stir together the eggless chocolate cupcake batter.,
Fill and bake the cupcakes.",How to Make Eggless Cupcakes2," Turn on your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Take a 12 hole muffin tin and grease and flour it. You could also line the muffin pan with cupcake liners or just use cooking spray.You can also spray the cupcake liners so they peel away easily from the cupcakes.

, Place the dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and whisk to combine them. You shouldn't be able to see any lumps and the cocoa should be evenly distributed so the mixture is a light brown color. Put these dry ingredients in the bowl:1 1/4 cups (156 g) of all-purpose flour
1/3 cup (40 g) of cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder
1 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 teaspoons of salt

, Put 2 mashed bananas and 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar into a separate large bowl. Stir them together. Stir in the following wet ingredients:1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (82 g) of vegetable oil
1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

, Add a little of the dry ingredient mixture to your large bowl of wet ingredients and stir it together, using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and stir the batter until there aren't any lumps or pockets of flour.If you want a little crunch in your cupcakes, you can add 1/2 cup of chopped nuts. If you want a stronger chocolate flavor, add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.

, Fill the muffin liners or holes so that they're three-quarters full of batter. Bake the cupcakes for 15 to 17 minutes in your preheated oven. A cake tester should come away clean if you poke the center of a cupcake with it. If not, let them bake for a few more minutes and then test them again.Let the cupcakes cool completely on a wire rack before you frost them with a frosting or icing of your choice.

Replace eggs for moisture.,
Use a mixture of tofu and yogurt.,
Use an egg substitute.",How to Make Eggless Cupcakes3," Consider the cupcake recipe that you'd like to adapt. If you left out the egg or eggs from your recipe, would the batter be dry? Cupcake batters should be smooth and somewhat runny. If your batter would be dry, you need to substitute the eggs for a different ingredient that will provide moisture to the batter. Consider increasing the baking soda/baking powder by 25 to 50 percent and replacing 1 egg with:Fruit juice
1/4 cup of milk or water
1/4 cup of fruit puree (like mashed bananas, unsweetened applesauce, pureed prunes or dates)

, Instead of using eggs in your recipe, mix together equal parts of plain yogurt and silken tofu until they're completely combined. Use 1/4 cup of this mixture to equal 1 egg in your cupcake recipe.You shouldn't use this as an egg replacer if you recipe calls for 3 or more eggs. If the recipe calls for a lot of eggs, just use an egg substitute product.

, You can buy a commercial egg substitute from the grocery store (in the baking aisle). Follow the manufacturer's instructions to mix it up. You'll probably have to stir together 1 1/2 tablespoons of the dry egg substitute powder with 2 to 3 tablespoons of warm water to equal one egg.Egg substitute is a good choice is you're worried about other types of substitutions changing the flavor of your recipe. Egg substitute won't change the flavor of your cupcakes.

Cupcake recipes can be found at: How to make cupcakes, How to make lavender cupcakes, How to make chocolate cupcakes, How to make tie dye cupcakes and How to make vegan cupcakes.;
, Choosing a topping design for your Easter cupcakes will depend on such things as the ingredients you have available or can obtain, whether the cupcakes need to match an Easter theme for your table setting and what you think those eating the cakes might like. Most of all, being inspired by existing ideas will help you a lot, so the following steps present a number of suggestions to do just that.

, Chicks are an obvious choice for Easter cupcake toppings and there are many different possibilities for this topping. Here are some ideas:


Mold Easter chicks from yellow fondant or sugar paste. Frost each cupcake with white frosting and place the chick in the middle. Decorate with candy grass.
Frost each cupcake. Stick chick peeps on each cupcake.
Frost the cupcake with yellow frosting. Stick a small chocolate egg (about 5cm/2"" in height) in the middle of the cupcake. Draw the yellow frosting over the chocolate cupcake as well so that the yellow frosting covers the egg and the top of the cupcake. The decorated egg forms the chick's body. Use an orange jelly bean for the beak and two small chocolate drops for eyes. Pipe a little extra squiggly bit on top of the chick's head.
Frost each cupcake. Sprinkle toasted shredded coconut across the topping, to serve as nest material. Settle little Easter chicks into each cupcake. Small eggs can be turned into little chicks by adding eyes and beak using frosting, chopped candies and melted chocolate for eyes and beak.

, This is another obvious choice for an Easter cupcake topping. Bunnies are always liked by children, so they're a natural choice for cupcakes aimed at them. Here are some ideas:


Pipe buttercream onto each cupcake. Fashion rabbit's ears out of chocolate, marshmallow or other candies. Stick a pair on each cupcake. Use plain cupcake cases and draw a nose, eyes and whiskers onto the case.

Rabbit's ears can also be added and nothing else.
Use cookies or hard biscuits shaped like ears on for an easy rabbit's ear look.


Fashion fondant bunnies and pipe buttercream frosting onto each cupcake. Place the fondant bunny on each cupcake. Add sprinkles, edible glitter, candy grass, etc.
Frost the cupcake and stick a small chocolate bunny on top.
Frost the cupcake and place bunny peeps on top.
A cute design is to make a cupcake topping that looks like the bunny burrowing into green frosting (grass). Make each bunny backside using fondant or sugar paste: mold one shape for the bunny's butt, two smaller sides for two paws and one small round ball for the tail. Frost the cupcake with green frosting, then place the body on one side of it and attach the paws and tail to it so that it looks like the bunny has its paws up in the air and the rest of its body is tucked into the frosting grass.

, Easter always suggests eggs, so adding them to cupcakes will definitely fit any Easter theme. Here are some ideas:


Frost the base with green frosting in a way that looks like grass. Place little eggs on top of the grass.
Easter bird's nest cupcakes
A simple way is to frost the cupcake and add eggs to it.

, Easter falls in spring in the northern hemisphere, making it a good theme for cupcake decorations. Here are some ideas:


Frost the cupcake with different colors of marshmallows. Form some into flowers, as shown in the image.
Frost each cupcake. Ring each one with pastel or light colored jelly beans to form petals. Add a center jelly bean to balance the cupcake.
Frost cupcakes in a range of different spring colors, especially pastels. Sprinkle with sprinkles or edible glitter.
Form petals using sugar paste or fondant and arrange on top of each cupcake.
Frost each cupcake. Add pastel bonbons, candies or chocolates on the topping.

, This is easily done with the addition of a ""handle"" made from candy. Shoestring licorice or twisted marshmallow lengths make a good choice but you might be able to find other candies that work too. Once the handle is in shape, you can place anything on the topping that you'd find in an Easter basket, like little eggs, miniature chicks or chocolate bunnies, candy grass, etc.


If you're good with fondant or sugar paste, you can make strips and weave these in and out to make a basket effect on the side of each cupcake.

, Then decorate them with carrot designs as follows:


Mold carrots from fondant or sugar paste; use orange for the carrot and add a small green stem to the top of each carrot. Then add a single carrot to each cupcake (it looks striking against a white frosting) or go crazy and make little bunches of carrots for each topping.
Another style of carrot can be to make it appear that the carrot is still growing––the frosting serves as the ground. Mold the carrot shape so that you have a small orange top with green leaves sticking out of it. Insert this molded fondant in the middle of each cupcake, tucked into the frosting. Sprinkle some edible green glitter around the frosting.

, Lambs are another animal associated with Easter celebrations. There are a number of ways to add a lamb to the cupcake topping:


Create a flat design of a lamb in sugar paste and stick to the topping.
Mold a lamb in sugar paste, marzipan or fondant. Color and attach to the topping.
Turn the entire topping into a little lamb using small marshmallows and licorice. Use the licorice for the feet and facial features and the miniature marshmallows as wool. This design can either be flat or you can build it up to be three dimensional.
Pipe white frosting onto each cupcake in swirls to look like wool. Shape a black face with ears and pink nose for the sheep in fondant or sugar paste and attach to the frosting.

, For a bit of fun, make red velvet cupcakes and add some zombie chicks or bunnies, leaking blood onto the white frosting.

Add an extra egg and stir the batter longer to make the cupcakes fluffier.",How to Make Cupcakes with Cake Mix," If you are going to be using dark or nonstick baking pans, lower the temperature to 325°F (162.78°C)., Most cake mixes will also require additional wet ingredients, such as water, oil, and an egg. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with your whisk or spatula while mixing. This will help the batter come out more even. You will also want to ""fold"" the batter every now and then; this will give you a smoother batter.


How much water, oil, and eggs you will need will depend on what brand of cake mix you are using. If you lost the box, try finding the instructions on the company website; they often will have them posted there. Plan on using about 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water, ½ cup (120 milliliters) of oil, and 2 to 3 eggs.

, You can bake the batter in the cupcake wells directly, or you can place cupcake liners into the wells first. The liners are not necessary, but they will make cleaning up easier; they will also make the cupcakes look prettier. You can use a regular, mini, or jumbo sized cupcake pan.


If you want to fill the wells with batter directly, you will need to wipe them down using a paper towel soaked with vegetable or canola oil first.

, Do not over-fill the cupcake wells. The batter will rise as it bakes. A quick and easy way to fill the cupcake wells is to use a large spoon or an ice cream scooper.


A box of cake mix will be enough to make 24 to 30 regular-sized cupcakes. It will make even more mini-sized cupcakes, but fewer of the jumbo-sized ones.
Cover and refrigerate any leftover batter. When you are done baking the first batch, let the pan cool for 15 minutes, then fill it with the rest of the batter. You may need to bake this new batch 1 to 2 minutes longer than the first one., Check the cupcakes for done-ness after the lowest-baking time listed, and bake them longer, if necessary. If you have a convection oven, check the cupcakes after 8 minutes. You can tell when they are done if a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean. Well-done cupcakes will also ""spring"" back when touched on the top.


Regular-sized cupcakes will need 15 to 20 minutes.
Mini cupcakes will need 10 to 15 minutes.
Jumbo cupcakes will need 20 to 30 minutes.

, Let the cupcakes cool for 5 to 10 minutes in the pan first. After that, pop them out, and let them finish cooling on a flat surface.It will take about an hour for them to become completely cool.

, If they are not completely cool, any icing or frosting you put on will melt and turn runny.

, When you open the tub, give the frosting a quick stir with a fork or whisk. This will help make it softer and fluffier. Then, dip the top of each cupcake into the frosting. Give the cupcake a slight twist as you pull it back out.


To make your frosting colored, add a few drops of liquid food coloring, and give it a quick stir with a fork or whisk.
To make the cupcakes more interesting, dip them into a bowl filled with chopped walnuts, colored sugar, or sprinkles.Mix and match the frosting. Try chocolate frosting on white cupcakes, and white frosting on chocolate cupcakes.

, Beat 3 cups (375 grams) of confectioner's/icing sugar and 1/3 cup (75 grams) of softened butter in an electric mixer until you get a smooth consistency. Add in 1½ teaspoons of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of milk. Keep stirring until the frosting is smooth. If it is too thick, add in a little bit more milk. If it is too thin, add some more confectioner's/icing sugar.To make colored buttercream, stir in a few drops of food coloring.
You can use a spatula to spread the buttercream on, or an icing bag to pipe it on.

, Sift 10½ ounces (300 grams) of confectioner's/icing sugar into a bowl. Stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons of boiling water, or until you get a smooth, thick texture. Drizzle this over the cupcakes, and let it set. Here are some more ideas for variations:To make colored icing, add 2 to 3 drops of liquid food coloring.
To make the icing flavored, use 2 to 3 tablespoons of orange juice or lemon juice instead of water.
For a hint of chocolaty flavor, add 2 teaspoons of cocoa powder into the icing sugar before you add the water.
Add some sprinkles or a Maraschino cherry for a burst of color.

, Get a tub of chocolate-hazelnut spread, and spread about 1 tablespoon on top of each cupcake. It is great on cupcakes made from yellow cake mixes., Frosting and icing can make cupcakes look pretty, but it is the toppings that can make them look really colorful. Here are some ideas to get you started:


A Maraschino cherry is a classic topping atop white icing.
Sprinkles, colored sugar, sugar strands are great for swirled on buttercream frosting.
Flower-shaped sugar/candy are dainty, and perfect for spring or girlish cupcakes.
Chopped walnuts are great for chocolate frosting.

,


If it is near Saint Patrick's Day, try using green icing. You can also use white frosting and add some green sprinkles instead.
If the cupcakes are for a baby shower, use pink frosting if it is a girl, and blue frosting if it is a boy.
If it is around spring, try using white icing and flower-shaped sprinkles. If it is around winter, try using blue icing and snowflake-shaped sprinkles.

,


If it is near Valentine's Day, try finding some liners with hearts on them. You can also use pink or red lines.
If your cupcakes have a Halloween theme to them, consider using some matching Halloween-themed liners. You can also use orange or black ones.
If the cupcakes are for a birthday party, try finding some liners that say ""Happy Birthday"" on them, or have balloons and streamers printed on them. You can also use liners that match the colors of the party.
If it is around spring, try using liners with flowers on them. If it is around winter, try using liners with snowflakes on them.

, There are more varieties than just white cake mix and chocolate cake mix. Here are some other options:


Red-velvet is great when paired with cream cheese frosting.
Yellow is great when paired with chocolate frosting.
Birthday or Funfetti cake mixes are a basic white or yellow cake, but with sprinkles.

, Stir the food coloring into the batter before you pour it into the cupcake wells. The more color you use, the brighter/darker your cupcakes will be. You can use either gel, paste, or liquid food coloring, but liquid food coloring will be less intense.Consider matching the color to the upcoming holiday. For example, if it is February, you can make the cupcakes red or pink in honor of Valentine's Day. If it is March, you can make them green in honor of Saint Patrick's Day.

, Once you have stirred your batter together, add about ¼ cup (55 grams) of sprinkles into the batter and give it a final stir. Transfer the batter into the cupcake wells. Note that the color from the sprinkles may bleed a little bit into the cupcake itself.


You can use more sprinkles if you want.

, Prepare the two cake mixes separately Pour enough of each one to fill the cupcake wells two-thirds to three-fourths of the way. Give the batters one or two quick stirs with a toothpick before popping the pan into the oven.

, Be sure to use the same pudding flavor as the cake mix. For example, if you are using vanilla cake mix, use vanilla pudding; if you are using lemon cake mix, use lemon pudding. Add the pudding into the cake mix before you stir in the wet ingredients.


If you are adding chocolate pudding, consider adding some instant coffee as well. This will help intensify the chocolate flavor.

, Add 1 more egg than what the box instructs along with the rest of your wet ingredients. Once the batter is blended, stir it for 3 more minutes.

, Try something that matches the color of your frosting. You can also use toasted coconut., Preheat your oven to the temperature specified.

, If you are using chocolate cake mix, but you don’t want your cupcake shoes to appear brown, use two cupcake liners for each cupcake. The oil in the cake can seep through the liner and make it opaque.

Preheat the broiler.,
Brush the open bun with melted butter.,
Broil for 30 to 60 seconds.,
Serve.",How to Toast Buns1," Switch on the oven's broiler setting and allow it to preheat for roughly 5 minutes. (10 minutes for ovens with broilers in base)


Meanwhile, pull out a small baking sheet. If don't correctly, the bun should not stick to the baking sheet, so there's no need to cover the pan with foil or cooking spray.
Note that this method can be used to toast hamburger-style sandwich buns, sub-style sandwich buns, and hotdog buns.;
, Split open the bun and brush melted butter over the cut sides of both halves.


You only need to spread butter over the cut sides of the bun; leave the crust sides dry.
When spreading the butter, make sure that you coat the entire cut side, including the edges. The edges are especially prone to burning if left dry.

, Set the bun halves cut-side up onto the prepared baking sheet. Slide the baking sheet beneath your preheated broiler and keep it there until the bun halves turn golden brown.The bun halves will brown quickly, so you need to watch them closely to prevent them from burning.
Since the heating element of broiler lies at the top of the oven, the cut sides of the bun halves must face the top of the oven. You only need to toast the cut sides of the bun, so you do not need to turn the bun halves during the browning process.

, Enjoy the toasted bun while it's still hot and crispy.

"
"
Preheat the pan.,
Paint the open bun with melted butter.,
Toast for 10 to 20 seconds.,
Serve.",How to Toast Buns2," Place a skillet, griddle, or grill pan onto a stove burner set to medium heat. Allow the pan to heat for approximately 30 seconds.


Any pan should work as long as it has a large enough base to hold the bun halves.
Avoid using higher heat settings. High heat can cause the bun to brown—and burn—too quickly.
This method can be used for hamburger-style sandwich buns, sub-style sandwich buns, and hotdog buns.

, Open the bun and brush melted butter over the cut sides of both halves.Spread the butter over the entire cut side, paying special attention to the edges. Dry edges can burn quickly when exposed to heat.
Note that you do not need to brush any melted butter over the crust of the bun.

, Place the bun halves cut-side down into the hot pan. Toast, without moving, until both cut surfaces turn light golden brown.


Check the buns after 10 seconds or so. If they still look too light, you can return them to the hot pan and toast them for a little longer. Progress slowly, though, since the buns can burn quickly if left unattended.
Only the cut sides need to be toasted, so you do not need to flip the bun halves during the toasting process.

, Remove the bun from the pan and use it immediately to enjoy the best texture.

"
"
Preheat the grill for indirect heat.,
Brush melted butter onto the open bun.,
Grill for 10 to 15 seconds.,
Serve.",How to Toast Buns3," Preheat the grill as usual, leaving one section open for indirect heating.


Both charcoal and gas grills can be used for this. Indoor electric grills will work, too.
Since toasting the buns will take a very short amount of time, it's best to use this method only when you are already using the grill to cook something else, such as hamburgers or hotdogs. If you have not yet set up an area of the grill for indirect heat, wait until the rest of your food is done, then turn off one of the burners or push aside some of the hot coals. Allow the newly emptied area to cool for several minutes before toasting the buns there.
This method can be used for all bun styles: standard sandwich buns, sub sandwich buns, and hotdog buns.

, Split open the bun and lightly paint both cut sides with melted butter.


Coat the cut sides of the bun thoroughly, spreading the butter all the way to the edges. Dry ends will likely burn.
You do not need to paint the butter over the crust side.

, Place the bun halves directly on top of the grill grate, keeping both cut sides face-down. Carefully grill the halves until the cut surfaces turn light golden brown.Make sure that you place the bun halves over the indirect heat. Sitting them over direct heat will increase the likelihood of burning them.
Check the progress after roughly 10 seconds. You can return the bun to the grill if it needs more time, but buns tend to brown quickly, so you need to work in small intervals to prevent them from burning.
You do not need to turn the bun halves while grilling them since only the cut sides need to become toasted.

, Remove the bun halves from the grill and use them while they're still hot and crispy.

"
"
Preheat the toaster oven.,
Paint both halves of the bun with melted butter.,
Toast for 1 to 2 minutes.,
Serve.",How to Toast Buns4," Switch the setting dial to ""Broil"" and turn the thermostat dial to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius).


Even though toaster ovens also have a “Toast” setting, the “Broil” setting is ideal for toasting buns. The “Toast” setting uses both the upper and lower heating elements, so both sides of each bun half will brown, resulting in drier, crumblier bread. The “Broil” setting, on the other hand, only uses the upper heating element, so one side of each bun half will brown and crisp while the other side remains soft.
You should be able to use this method for hamburger-style sandwich buns, sub-style sandwich buns, and hotdog buns.

, Open the bun and thoroughly brush both cut sides with the melted butter.You do not need to coat the crust side in butter.
Make sure that the entire cut side is coated with butter, however, including the edges. The edges will be the first part to burn if left dry.

, Place the split buns directly onto the toaster oven grate, keeping the cut sides face-up. Set the timer dial for 2 minutes, but watch the buns closely as they toast and remove them once the cut sides turn a light golden color.


Do not cover the grate with foil or place the bun halves on top of a baking sheet. The bun should go directly on top of the grate itself.
Watch the bun halves closely throughout the toasting process. They may finish sooner than 2 minutes, or they may require a little more time. Work in relatively short intervals, though, to minimize the risk of accidentally burning the bun.

, Use the buns immediately for the best texture and overall experience.

"
"
Split the bun.,
Toast the bun on medium heat.,
Serve.",How to Toast Buns5," Separate the sandwich bun into its two halves.


Note that you do not need to apply any butter to the bun halves before inserting them into the toaster.
This method of toasting will only work for hamburger-style sandwich buns, and you'll need a toaster with large enough slots to accommodate the bun halves. You won't be able to use this method for hotdog buns or sub sandwich buns.

, Turn the toaster dial to a medium-range heat setting. Place the bun halves inside and press the lever down, then wait for toaster to automatically finish its heating cycle.


It shouldn't matter which direction the bun halves face when you insert them into the toaster. Unlike the other methods, this procedure will toast the bun halves on both sides, resulting in a bun that is drier and more crumbly.
Toasters can vary in strength, so watch the browning progress through the top of the toaster to make sure the buns won't burn. If the bun halves begin to look too dark, press the lever upward to eject the bun quicker.

, Use the buns while they are still hot and crispy.

For best results, move an oven rack to the position second from the top.;
, Canned pineapple conveniently comes in pre-cut rings for easy presentation. The fresh pineapple has a better taste, especially during its peak season in spring and early summer.Choose either one and prepare as follows:



Canned slices: Drain the juices into a bowl and set aside for later.

Fresh pineapple: Cut the pineapple into rings. Start by removing both ends, then the brown skin and eyes. Slice into circles, then remove the core from each slice with a paring knife.

, Heat the butter first, until melted. Add the brown sugar and cook over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. This should make a thick syrup.


If possible, use a 9–10 inch (23–25 cm) heavy cast-iron skillet You'll be able to bake the cake in the same pan.

, Chopped nuts and powdered ginger balance out the acidic fruit, making the topping taste more like spice cake. Just stir these in and move to the next step.

, Add the pineapple slices to the pan in a single layer. Cook for 2–3 minutes on each side, stirring occasionally.


You can cook the pineapples for up to 15 minutes if you prefer them lightly browned.

, Let this cool to a semisolid layer while you make the batter.If you plan on baking the cake in a baking dish instead of the skillet, move the pineapple slices to a well-greased baking dish and pour the hot syrup over them.

, Place one in the center of each pineapple ring.

, Let the butter soften at room temperature, so it is easily pressed but has not begun to melt. Beat this with an electric mixer's paddle attachment or a wooden spoon until smooth. Add sugar gradually. Beat until the mix becomes lighter in color and expands in volume.., Beat in the following ingredients, one at a time. Scrape the sides of the bowl down after each ingredient is thoroughly mixed. The additional egg white is important for making a cake sturdy enough to support the pineapple, while staying light and fluffy.2 whole eggs
1 egg white
2 tbsp (30 mL) pineapple juice from the can. (Skip if using fresh pineapple, or substitute lemon juice.)
1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla extract, or the flavoring extract of your choice

, Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl. Whisk for a few seconds to combine.

, Add about ⅓ of the flour mixture to the bowl of creamed butter, and beat until no dry lumps remain. Beat in ¼ cup (60 mL) milk. Repeat with another ⅓ of the flour mixture, then another ¼ cup (60 mL) milk, then the last of the flour mixture.


Just beat the ingredients until you can't see any dry flour. This batter does not need to be smooth., Spread it out with a knife so the batter covers the fruit completely and evenly.You can do this directly in the skillet used to cook the pineapple.

, Bake at 350 °F (177 °C) for 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.


If you have a cooking thermometer, the cake is ready when the center reaches 190–200ºF (88–93ºC)., Let cool for five minutes, then loosen the edge of the cake with a knife. Put on your oven mitts and place a large serving plate over the skillet. Carefully turn the skillet and plate upside down, then lift the skillet.


Choose a serving plate with a rim, to catch the juices.
If the pineapple is left behind on the pan, use a spatula to transfer it back onto the cake. This won't make a difference to the cake's appearance."

, Keep beating it until the yolk is broken and evenly mixed into the butter mixture. There should be no streaks or swirls of egg yolk visible.

, For best results, use cake flour. Many bakers find that this is the secret to the ideal cupcake texture., The oil will help add extra moisture to the cupcakes and prevent them from turning out too dry. Be sure to use a flavorless oil, such as canola or vegetable., Beat in a little bit of the flour mixture into the blended butter, then beat in some of the milk mixture.

Ideally, you should add in the flour mixture three times, and the milk mixture two times., Do this by hand using a spatula and not with a mixer. Keep folding in the mini chocolate chips until they are spread evenly throughout the batter.

, For easy, even measuring, use an ice cream scoop to pour in the batter. There is enough batter to fill about 20 cupcake liners.

, Start checking them at 15 minutes for doneness. They are ready when the domes spring back when lightly touched.Another way to check whether or not the cupcakes are done is to insert a toothpick into the middle of one. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cupcakes are done.

, If they aren't, the frosting will melt.

If it is too thin, add more confectioner's sugar. If it is too thick, add more heavy cream. Be sure to beat the frosting after each addition.


If the frosting is too sweet for you, you can also add a pinch of salt. This will help cut the sweetness.

, You can spread the frosting onto the cupcakes using a butter knife or spatula. You can also fill a piping bag with the frosting and pipe it on instead; use a star-shaped decorator's tip for this.

Whisk the milk and eggs into the dry ingredients until combined. Make sure there are no lumps in the mixture., Once you have whisked together the ingredients, bring them to a boil in the saucepan over medium heat. Whisk the ingredients constantly as you bring them to a boil. Keep whisking until the ingredients have thickened. This will take about one minute. Remove from stove., Transfer the filling to a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the filling in the refrigerator while you make the whipped cream., After you place the warm filling in the refrigerator, you will whip the cream. Place the heavy whipping cream and vanilla extract in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk the cream and vanilla together until stiff peaks form., Remove the filling from the refrigerator. Fold the whipped cream into the filling by running a spatula around the sides, and then the base, of the bowl. Then fold the mixture on to itself. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat until the ingredients are just combined., Once you have folded the whipped cream into the other ingredients, you will transfer the filling into a piping bag. First, fit the piping bag with a fluted tip. Then, transfer the filling to the piping bag., After you transfer the filling to a piping bag, you will need to chill it. Place the piping bag in the refrigerator. Chill the filling for two hours., You will be using your stand mixer to make the dough. Fit the mixer with a paddle attachment. If you do not have a stand mixer, you can make the recipe by hand., Place these ingredients in the bowl of your stand mixer. If making the dough by hand, place the ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Stir the ingredients together by hand., After you combine the milk, sugar, cardamom, and yeast, you will need to let the mixture stand. Allow the mixture to sit until it is foamy. This should take about 10 minutes., Once the milk, sugar, cardamom and yeast have become foamy, you will begin adding the remaining dough ingredients in batches. First, add the egg. Mix by hand or on the low speed of your stand mixer until just combined., If you are making the dough by hand, you will now add the butter to the mixture. Melt the butter and then carefully add it to the egg mixture. Use a spatula to combined the ingredients., After combining the egg with the milk, sugar, cardamom, and yeast, you will add the dry ingredients. Slowly mix in the flour, baking powder and salt on the low setting of your stand mixer or by hand. Mix together until a dough forms.

, Pour enough water in the pot so that the water level is a few inches above the beans. Bring the water to a boil, allow to simmer, and cook for about an hour or until the beans are done.


Although azuki beans cook faster than other beans, sometimes you'll need to cook the beans slightly longer than an hour.

, Do this in batches because there will be too many beans to do all at once.


This is where personal preference will affect how finely you strain the beans. Some people prefer a completely smooth paste, devoid of bean skin, while others don't mind a little bit of chunkiness. The choice is yours, but either way is delicious!
Some people puree the bean paste in a blender for added smoothness. Afterward, they pass the mixture through cheesecloth to remove the fine fragments of bean skin.

, Make sure to constantly stir so the beans don't stick to the pan. You may need to add water occasionally if you find the beans are getting too dry.

, Cook for 10 minutes and remove from pan. Store in a container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to a week.

Cover the cupcakes with the frosting.",How to Make Butterscotch Cupcakes," To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cupcakes, set the temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully preheat. Next, line 1 to 2 muffin tins with 20 paper cupcake liners to ready them for the cupcakes.Make sure that the rack is in the center position in the oven.
You can substitute silicone cupcake liners for the paper if you prefer.;
, Add 1 ¾ cups (219 g) of flour, a 3.4-ounce (96 g) box of instant butterscotch pudding, ⅔ cup (133 g) of sugar, 2 ½ teaspoon (10 g) of baking powder, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, and ¾ cup (130 g) of roughly chopped butterscotch chips to a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully combined.The pudding adds butterscotch flavor to the cupcakes, and helps make them especially moist and tender.

, Add 2 eggs, ½ cup (118 ml) of canola oil, 1 ¼ cup (296 ml) of milk, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to a separate small bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully blended.You can substitute vegetable oil for the canola if you prefer.

, After you’ve mixed the wet ingredients together, add them to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix the ingredients together until they are just combined.You can use a handheld electric mixer to blend the ingredients if you prefer.
Be careful not to overmix the batter or you may wind up with tough cupcakes.

, When the batter is fully mixed, divide it evenly between the prepared muffin pans. Use a spoon to carefully add the batter until the cups are about ⅔ full.Don’t overfill the cups because the cupcakes will puff up as they bake.

, Once you’ve filled all of the muffin tins, place them in the preheated oven. Allow the cupcakes to bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until the centers are completely set.Test the cupcakes for doneness by inserting a toothpick or cake tester into the center. It should emerge completely clean.

, When the cupcakes are finished baking, remove the muffin tins from the oven. Let the cupcakes cool for 5 to 10 minutes in the pan before transferring them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely, which should take about 30 minutes.It’s important to ensure that the cupcakes are completely cool before you ice them or the frosting may melt off.

, Add ½ cup (113 g) of butter a large saucepan. Heat it over medium heat until the butter melts completely.Stirring the butter periodically as you heat it can help it melt more quickly.

, After the butter has melted, continue heating it on medium. Allow the butter to cook until it becomes foamy and starts to turn a light golden brown.Make sure to keep a close eye on the butter as it’s heating so it doesn’t burn.

, As soon as the butter becomes foamy and light brown, add ½ cup (100 g) of brown sugar to the pan. Turn the heat up to medium high and cook the mixture until it comes to a boil.Stir the mixture regularly as you cook it so the brown sugar doesn’t stick to the pan.

, When the butter and sugar mixture has come to a boil, slowly add ⅓ cup (79 ml) of heavy cream to the pan. Whisk the cream into the mixture and allow it to cook until it returns to a boil.For the creamiest frosting, don’t substitute milk for the heavy cream

, Once the butter mixture has returned to a boil, take the pan off the heat. Whisk in ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of salt, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of vanilla extract, and a dash of cinnamon until they are fully incorporated., After you’ve mixed the flavorings into the butter mixture, let it rest for about 20 minutes. You want the mixture to cool slightly before you add the milk in the next step.The mixture may thicken up slightly as it cools. Stir it well before you mix in the other ingredients.

, When the butter mixture has cooled slightly, mix 3 cups (330 g) of powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of milk. If the frosting isn’t creamy enough to spread or pipe, add more milk by the tablespoon (15 ml), checking the consistency after each addition., Once the frosting is the right texture, transfer it to a piping bag to pipe on the cupcakes or use a butter knife to spread it over the tops of cupcakes. If you like, you can garnish the cupcakes with a few butterscotch chips before serving.Store leftover cupcakes in an airtight container. They should be eaten within 2 to 3 days.

Reserve two tablespoons of the flour mixture as this will be used later to prevent the buns from sticking to the counter when you roll them out.

,
Add 1C sugar to the flour mixture, stir well, and then slowly pour the 1 cup of milk into the dry ingredients, alternating with mixing by hand and pouring until all the milk is incorporated with the flour.,
Add the one tablespoon of oil to the dough, and then knead for another 10 minutes.,
Remove the dough from the bowl and cut in half, and then in half again, until you have 12 balls of dough on the counter.,
Place some of the reserved flour on the counter and roll each ball of dough to a thickness of about one-quarter inch.,
Put a disc of dough in the palm of your hands, and place some of the red bean paste onto it, making sure not to use too much because you might stretch the dough while trying to seal the buns.,
Seal the bun.,
Put a piece of parchment paper (or foil) on the bottoms of each bun and arrange buns on a plate until you have enough to begin steaming your first batch.,
Arrange buns in steamer, close lid, and steam for 20 minutes.,
Cooling the buns is optional, but eating them is mandatory.",How to Make Steamed Buns2,", At this point, you may be alarmed at the gloppy consistency of the flour and milk mixture, but don't despair! As you continue to mix the dough, it will slowly become smooth and supple like bread dough, and also tough and difficult to knead. All of this is completely normal, so continue the workout! The total kneading time is 20 minutes.

, Now, the dough needs to rest for 30 minutes in a bowl. The chemical leavening agents in the flour mixture will cause the dough to rise slightly.

, If you prefer smaller buns, cut each ball of dough in half so you end up with 24 total.

, Make sure that the edges are much thinner than the middle section of the dough because this will make sealing the buns easier and also create a substantial section of bread in the finished bun.


A small rolling pin works best for this procedure, not the larger ones with which your mom may have chased you around the house as a child. If you don't have one, an alternate method is to simply flatten each ball of dough with a broad bottomed glass, pressing firmly and then shaping the dough with your hands.

, Remember, less is better!

, Do this by bringing up one side over the top of the red bean paste, and then another side, and then another until the paste is completely covered. Press the pieces of dough together and twist with your fingers to seal it completely.


To make the dough more cohesive while sealing, wet the outer periphery of each disc with water. Don't use too much water, though, as this will interfere with the texture of the bread and create a distasteful gummy spot after steaming.

, How many batches you have will depend on how large you made your buns. Smaller buns can be steamed in three batches.

, Remove lid and steam for another 10 minutes.

, Enjoy!

, Start out by getting two black jellybeans and one pink jellybean for each cupcake. These will represent the eyes and noses. Cut out fondant for the whiskers and ears.


For the ears: Get white fondant and cut out two pieces in the shape of a bunny ear. Get pink fondant and repeat, but make the pieces smaller. Place the pink pieces on top of the white fondant.
For the whiskers: Cut out short and thin strips of black fondant.

Cook your buns for 20-25 minutes at 400F, or until golden brown.,
Apply your glaze right out of the oven, then eat while still hot.",How to Make Chelsea Buns1," You just want the butter to be completely melted -- it helps a lot to cut it into small pieces first. It should be very warm to the touch, but not so warm that you can't put your finger in it. If you leave it on too long and it gets hot, set it aside for a minute or too to cool while you prepare the flour.
, You simply want to break up any clumps of flour and ensure that the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the flour mixture.

If you don't have instant or quick-acting yeast, just that is okay. Just know that the rises later in the recipe will take a bit longer.

, This allows you to more evenly mix in everything, folding the flour slowly into the wet ingredients instead of pouring it all on top and trying to mix it in this way., Once everything is well mixed, turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured surface and start kneading. To do so, stand over the dough. Pull up a third of the dough and fold it onto the top of the dough ball. Using the heel of your hand, push down firmly into the center of the dough. Rotate the dough ball a quarter turn and then pull up another third, pressing it down. Repeat for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, shiny dough.If you have a stand mixer, like a Kitchen-Aid, you can use the dough hook attachment on medium instead of kneading. It should only take 4-5 minutes.

, A warm spot is best, as this helps promote yeast growth. When done the dough should be about twice as high as it was when you started -- usually 1-2 hours later.

If you want to eat the buns tomorrow, you can refrigerate this dough to slow the rising process. It will make it about 12 hours in the cold before starting to lose some of its moisture.

, A light pat of butter or some non-stick cooking spray will do the job. A square, 9"" dish will be big enough for taller buns, but you may want a bigger pan if you're planning on making many smaller buns., Using a rolling pin, flatten the dough into a rectangle about 1/2"" thick. While the exact proportions are up to you, it should be about a foot on it's longest side., Room temperature butter is perfect. Use a knife to spread the butter evenly on the entire rectangle of dough., Leave about a 1/4"" of space between the edge of the dough and the mixture. While this recipe calls for light brown sugar, you can easily substitute in darker brown sugar for a richer, more molasses-like flavor., You want to roll the longest ends, leaving you with a long, skinny roll of dough. To do so, press one one long side into the countertop to anchor it down. Then roll the other long side towards you, trying to keep it as tight as possible.

If the dough sticks to your hands, lightly dust them with flour.

, If you want bigger, thicker buns you can cut fewer rounds, and if you want more than nine you can cut them smaller. Try not to press down on the roll as you cut. Try to cut through by pushing the blade forward -- through the dough instead of down into it., Set them in the dish so that they aren't touching, roughly 1/2"" apart. You'll know they are ready to cook when they have risen enough that they're touching when you return to them.

Make sure, like the last rise, the buns are covered and in a warm place.
Now is also a good time to pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F.


, Once the tops are gorgeous and golden, you can take them out. If the tops aren't quite dark enough, but the fruit is starting to burn, simply cover the entire pan of buns with a sheet of aluminum foil for the last few minutes., Chelsea buns, like most other quick, risen breads, are best the day they are baked. Be sure to choose your favorite sweet glaze and apply it while they are still hot.Don't feel like glazing? Simply dust with powdered sugar and serve!

Turn up the temperature.,
Add more yeast.,
Blend in the starter.,
Knead in more flour.,
Knead the dough properly.",How to Fix Dough That Won't Rise1," Yeast loves nothing better than a warm, moist climate to live its yeasty life to the fullest. If you want your dough to rise, you need to give the yeast what it wants.


Fill a baking pan with boiling water, and set it on the lowest rack in your oven. Place the container of dough on the middle rack, and close the oven door and allow the dough to rise.
Alternately, you can boil a cup of water in the microwave, then place the container of dough in the microwave with the water, and close the door. (Don't microwave the dough!)
Some people turn on the oven, and place the dough on top of the stove, covered with a damp towel. The oven keeps the surface of the stove warm, and the damp towel provides the moisture.;
, If warm and moist isn't activating the yeast (you'll know in less than an hour), you can try adding more yeast.


Open a new package of yeast, and mix teaspoon of yeast with 1 cup (240ml) of warm water (at about 110°F/43°C) and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let this mixture proof for about 10 minutes, until it gets 1/2- to 1-inch of foam. If this fails, you will need to get fresh yeast and try again.
While proofing this yeast mixture, gently warm the flat dough to about 100°F (38°C) by placing the bowl in a warm place.

, Adding more flour as necessary: a ratio of 60% flour to 40% liquid is usually a good ratio for bread doughs so add sufficient flour needed to balance. Knead the active yeast mixture into the dough, then let it rise in a warm, moist place.


This can also be an indicator to see if your yeast is not active. This method makes the yeast very active so when it is added to the dough, it should rise perfectly. If your dough still fails to rise, it will indicate the yeast is not at fault: there is another problem.
You can also do this at the beginning of the recipe next time you make a different yeast dough.

, Check whether the dough is sticky to the touch. If so, this is probably under-kneaded dough. Knead in additional flour until smooth and silky to the touch and dough no longer sticks to your hand. Let rest and rise in warm wet environment. Repeat if needed. You may need to let dough rest overnight before shaping and baking.

, There's an art to kneading. Too little, and you may not distribute the yeast through the dough. The dough will then be too weak to be able to rise. Too much kneading may make the dough so tough that it cannot expand. The dough should feel smooth and elastic, not tight like a rubber ball, or soft like biscuit dough.

Dust with powdered sugar right out of the oven for a simple, easy glaze.,
Glaze them with an improvised glaze of your favorite jam, such as apricot.",How to Make Chelsea Buns2," All you need is water, icing sugar, and an egg white also known as powdered sugar. You can blend these up into a wonderfully light, but delicious, icing in no time. Simply beat the following together with a wooden spoon until completely blended:

2 cups icing sugar
1 egg white (or powdered egg white equivalent)
1/2 teaspoon water., This icing has a slightly more intense flavor, taking on notes of toffee if cooked for long enough. To make it, simply warm 2 tablespoons of milk on low heat, mixing in 2 tablespoons of sugar until dissolved. Spread over warm buns immediately with a kitchen brush or the back of a spoon.If you have demerara sugar, which is extra large and crunchy, sprinkle it over this glaze for a little punch of crunch and sweetness., This is more and more common in English bakeries and takes no more than a bit of zest. You can choose either icing recipe listed above this step, simply grating in 1/2 teaspoon of orange or lemon zest to get a light, but decadent, citrus flavor., If applied early enough, the sugar will likely start to melt slightly, as it is so fine it doesn't need much heat to dissolve. This can lead to a light, simple, and instant glaze without dirtying any other dishes., This sugary, fruity glaze goes incredibly with the bun and dried fruit, especially if added while the buns are still hot. While any jam will work, the slightly tart bite of apricot jam is particularly heavenly.

If the jam is hard to spread, even over the hot buns, add a splash of water and microwave for 10-15 seconds, until smooth and spreadable."

Try spicing the dough, instead of just the filling.,
Adjust the sugar in the recipe to get more savory or sweet treats.,
Try using more butter for an even richer dough.,
Mix up the dried fruit that you use in the center.,
Consider mixing the fruit into the dough, not the rolls.",How to Make Chelsea Buns3," This can lead to a much more nuanced bun, and prevents overly strong bites of spice by more evenly distributing it throughout the entire bun. Remember when spicing to smell your spice mixture before adding -- if it smells good, it will likely taste good, too. To spice the dough, simply whip up your dough like normal, adding the following to the dough after the milk and egg:

Zest of 1 lemon
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice or mixed spice (combine cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, allspice, and/or cardamom).

, Remember that you do need some sugar -- at least 1 teaspoon, to help feed the yeast. That said, how much sugar you add is largely up to you. Want more ""spiced,"" less sugary buns? Stick to just a teaspoon. But equally correct are sweeter dessert buns, which can take 2-3 tablespoons of sugar. There are many recipes on the internet, but the basics are easily adjusted to change the exact flavor you want., Butter leads to denser, but richer, doughs. There are recipes that call for as much as 8 melted tablespoons of butter in the total recipe, 5 in the dough and three for the filling. If you want something just a bit more decadent, try throwing in 1-2 extra tablespoons of butter when warming the milk., While currants are the most common fruit for a Chelsea bun, they aren't your only option. Other popular fruits include:

Raisins
Craisins
Sultanas
Dried apricots (cut small)
Dried cherries

, This may cause them to lose some of their spiral shapes, but it ensures that the fruit doesn't burn, as well. Simply add the dried fruit in after the dough is almost done mixing and bake like normal."

Find the problem.,
Check the environment.,
Check the flour types.,
Let the dough rest.,
Use the proper container.,
Check your ingredients.,
Ease up on the salt.",How to Fix Dough That Won't Rise2," Consider several of the following points to do some preliminary diagnosis. It may be that a simple correction to the environment can fix the problem with no further effort.


Check the dough and yeast type. Some sourdough cultures are very slow rising and may need several hours to rise. A
Make sure the yeast is still within its expiration date.Powdered yeast in packets last a long time, as does storing jars of dry yeast in the freezer. However, both fresh and dried yeast have a lifespan after which they will function weakly, or not at all.

, The ideal temperature is approx 100°F (38°C) and high humidity. Move too far out of that range, and your yeast will not be happy.

, Breads made with cake or all-purpose flour, have low gluten and protein contents, so your dough may rise—and then collapse.


This can also happen if you have a dough that has too high a ratio of water to flour.
Some flours contain antifungal ingredients to prolong shelf life. As yeast is a proud member of the Fungi kingdom, this will most definitely inhibit growth.
Organic, additive-free unbleached white bread flour works best for a good loaf of white bread.
Heavier flours such as whole wheat, rye and other types of whole-grain flour will result in a heavy loaf that does not rise as much as fine white bread flour.

, Do not disturb the dough while it is rising, especially if it is a particularly wet dough.

, The pan, banneton, or tray you use will make a difference. Too large, and the dough has nothing to push against when rising, so won't rise upwards. Instead, it will spread and possibly collapse.


Small buns do well placed fairly close together.

, Some spices, such as cinnamon, are naturally anti-fungal.


For sweet fruit buns or cinnamon rolls, you usually want a fast rise, as the cinnamon will eventually kill the yeast off.
Some dried fruits also are coated with antifungals as a preservative. Organic dried fruits are expensive but much better for baking. What many bakers do is use standard dried fruit but don't add it till the final proofing.

, Salt is a required ingredient for developing the gluten proteins that make for a smooth elastic dough, but too much will kill the yeast. Add only the required amount, and add it to the flour, not the water, at the beginning.

Bake the cupcakes for 20 to 25 minutes.,
Make the frosting while the cupcakes are baking.,
Frost the cupcakes once they’ve cooled.",How to Make Butternut Squash Cupcakes1," While it’s preheating, go ahead and line your cupcake tins with paper cups. This recipe is for 30 regular-sized cupcakes. It will take you 15 to 20 minutes to prepare the muffins. The cook time is an additional 20 to 25 minutes.
, Chop off both ends of the squash. Use a potato peeler to remove the skin. Cut the squash in half right where the neck meets the body. Cut the neck part into rings, then cubes. Cut the body of the squash in half length-wise. Scrape out the seeds and the surrounding stringy pulp with a spoon. Cut the halves into strips and then cube the strips., Place the cubes into the food processor. Pulse until the butternut squash is finely pureed. You may need to stop once or twice to scrape the squash down the sides of the processor with a spatula., Measure out the butter, white sugar and brown sugar. Put them into the bowl and cream the ingredients together using the standing mixer. Keep pulsing the mixer until the mixture looks fluffy and light., Crack the eggs into the mixer bowl. Pour the squash puree in carefully. Add the butter rum flavoring and mix it all together until fully combined., Measure out the flour, spices, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

You will probably need to stop mixing several times to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Lastly, add the nuts. Pulse the mixture until the batter is well-mixed.

, Carefully fill each paper cup about ¾ of the way up with the cupcake batter. There should be enough batter for 30 muffins, so you will use all of the batter. If you end up with extra batter, add a little more to each paper cup., Place the cupcake tin in the preheated oven. At the 20 minute mark, check on the cupcakes. You will know they’re ready to take out when you can insert a toothpick or knife into the center of one and it comes out clean.

If your toothpick/knife comes out sticky, put the cupcakes back in for another 5 minutes.
Once they’re done, remove them from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.

, Whisk heavy cream in a standing mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Do not over-mix, which can lead to grainy icing. Stir the mascarpone, cinnamon, and confectioners' sugar together in a small bowl until smooth. Carefully fold the whipped cream into mascarpone mixture. Mix well., Allow the cupcakes to cool completely, then use a spatula to frost each cupcake. You can also use a cake decorating bag to apply the icing, if preferred. Once frosted, either serve immediately or place in the refrigerator until you’re ready to serve them."

Spray the interior lightly with nonstick cooking spray.You substitute softened butter for the cooking spray if you prefer.;
, Add ½ cup (113 ½ g) of melted butter and ½ cup (100 g) of packed brown sugar to a medium size bowl. Stir the two ingredients together until the mixture is smooth.You can use either light or dark brown sugar for the sticky buns.

, Once the butter and brown sugar are fully mixed, use a spoon to transfer half of the mixture to the bottom of the slow cooker. Make sure to spread the mixture in an even layer.You can set the bowl with the remaining butter and brown sugar mixture aside. You won’t need it until after you’ve added the biscuits to the slow cooker.

, After you’ve spread some of the butter and brown sugar mixture over the bottom of the slow cooker, sprinkle ½ cup (63 ½ g) of pecan halves over it. Distribute the nuts as evenly as possible throughout the slow cooker.Pecans are traditionally used for sticky buns, but you can substitute walnuts if you prefer.
You can sprinkle ½ cup (75 g) of raisins into the slow cooker with the pecans if you like.

, Pour the remaining ½ cup (113 ½ g) of melted butter into a shallow dish. Add ½ cup (100 g) of cinnamon sugar to a separate shallow dish, and set it next to the dish with the butter.You can use store-bought cinnamon sugar or make you own. Combine ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar with 2 tablespoons (16 g) of ground cinnamon.

, Open 1 16-ounce (454 g) can of refrigerated biscuit dough and separate the biscuits on a piece of wax paper or parchment paper. With clean fingers, dunk a biscuit into the melted butter to cover it completely.It’s best to work with one biscuit at a time, so dip one in the butter and move immediately onto the next step before repeating the process with the remaining biscuits.
If you want to dip all of the biscuits in the butter before moving onto the next step, set them down on the wax or parchment paper until you’re ready to coat them with the cinnamon sugar.

, After you’ve dipped the biscuit in the melted butter, place it in the dish with the cinnamon sugar.

",How to Make Sour Cream Coffee Cake," To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the coffee cake, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully.Keep an eye on the oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. Most models with flash an indicator light and/or beep to alert you.;
, For the coffee cake, you’ll need a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) pan. Keep the cake from sticking by greasing the interior of the pan with butter, and set aside.If you prefer, you can grease the pan with nonstick cooking spray.

, Add 2 cups (250 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of baking powder, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of baking soda, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt to a large bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients until they’re fully combined, and set the bowl aside.If you’re using salted butter in the cake, you can omit the salt if you prefer.

, Add ½ cup (113 g) of butter that’s been softened to room temperature and 1 cup (208 g) of granulated sugar to a large bowl. Use an electric handheld mixer to beat the two together on medium-high until the mixture is light and fluffy, which should take approximately 2 minutes.You can mix the coffee cake batter with a stand mixer if you prefer.

, Once the butter and sugar are creamed together, add 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract, and 1 cup (230 g) of sour cream to the bowl. Mix the ingredients in at medium speed until they’re fully incorporated, which should take approximately 1 minute.You can use a reduced-fat sour cream if you prefer, but it’s best not to use fat-free.

, After you’ve mixed in the eggs, vanilla, and sour cream, add the flour mixture to the batter in increments. Mix after each addition on medium-low speed until the dry ingredients are just combined.Don’t overmix the batter. You may wind up with tough coffee, dry cake if you do.

, To make the topping for the coffee cake, add ¼ cup (52 g) of sugar, ⅓ cup (69 g) of brown sugar, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon, and ½ cup (105 g) of chopped nuts to medium bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients together well.You can use whatever type of nuts that you prefer, but pecans or walnuts are classic options.

, When the topping is ready, transfer half of the batter into the greased pan. Use a spatula to spread it across the pan so it’s in an even layer.If you want the inner layer of the filling to be closer to the bottom of the cake, you can pour a little less than half of the batter into the pan.

, After you’ve added some of the batter to the pan, use a spoon or your fingers to spread half of the topping over the batter. Try to sprinkle the topping as evenly across the cake as you can.You can skip this step, pour all of the batter into the pan at once, and sprinkle all of the topping over the top of the cake if you prefer.

, Once you’ve added the topping to the first layer of batter, spoon the remaining batter into the pan. It will be difficult to spread so you’re better off adding dollops of the batter with a spoon all over the pan and then spread it out with a spatula.If you find that the batter is sticking to the spatula, you can spray it with non-stick cooking spray to make spreading the batter easier.

, When all of the batter is in the pan, sprinkle the remaining topping over it. Once again, distribute it as evenly across the cake as you can.If you want thicker layers of topping for your coffee cake, you can double the recipe for it.
You can also add extra layers of the topping if you prefer. For example, pour just a quarter of the batter into the pan, sprinkle a quarter of the topping, add the next quarter of the batter into the pan, and repeat the process until you’ve used up all of the batter and topping.

, Place the pan in the preheated oven. Allow it to bake for approximately 30 minutes, or until a toothpick that you insert in the center comes out clean.If you don’t have a toothpick, you can use a knife or fork to test the cake for doneness.

, When the cake has finished baking, remove it from the oven. Set the pan on a wire rack, and allow it to cool for at least 15 minutes.You can pour the icing over the cake when it’s still slightly warm. However, if the cake is fresh from the oven, it will be so hot that the icing will likely melt off.

, While the cake is cooling, add ½ cup (63 g) of powdered sugar and 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of milk to a small bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re smooth.If you want the icing to have a glaze-like consistency, you can add a little more of the milk to thin it.
If you want the icing to have a spreadable, frosting-like consistency, you can add a little more powdered sugar to thicken it up.

Drizzle the glaze over the bites and serve.",How to Make Cinnamon Bun Bites," Add ½ cup (118 ml) of warm water to the bowl of a stand mixer. Next, sprinkle 1 tablespoon (8 ½ g) of active dry yeast over it in an even layer.If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can use any large bowl to hold the yeast mixture.;
, After you’ve sprinkled the yeast over the water, let the mixture stand for 5 to 7 minutes, or until it becomes foamy. Whisk the mixture until it’s completely smooth., Once the yeast mixture is smooth, add ½ cup (64 g) of all-purpose flour to the bowl. Whisk it into the mixture until a loose paste forms.You can substitute a gluten-free flour mix for the all-purpose flour if you prefer.

, After you’ve mixed the flour into the yeast mixture, place the bowl in a warm spot. Let the mixture rise and then fall, which should take approximately 30 minutes.You can place the yeast mixture beneath a sunny window or beside the stove to rise and fall.

, After the yeast mixture has fallen, add 4 large eggs, ¼ cup (50 g) of sugar, 2 teaspoons (10 g) of coarse salt, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla, and the remaining 4 cups (500 g) of flour to the bowl. Mix the ingredients in on low until they are fully incorporated.You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer.

, Switch the stand mixer’s attachment to the dough hook and begin kneading the dough. Continue kneading for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the dough is smooth.If you don’t have a hook attachment for your mixer, you can use clean hands to knead the dough. However, you’ll probably need to knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes to get it smooth.

, Once the dough is smooth, add ½ cup (113 g) of softened, unsalted butter to the bowl. Knead the dough again until it becomes smooth and elastic, which should take approximately 10 minutes.If the dough seems too sticky as you knead it, you can add a little more flour.

, When the dough is smooth and elastic, transfer it to an unfloured surface. Use clean hands to knead it again until it is extremely smooth, which should take about 3 minutes., After you’ve finished kneading the dough, place it in a clean bowl. Cover it with a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm spot until it doubles, which should take approximately 1 ½ to 2 hours.You can cover the bowl with plastic wrap if you prefer.

, After the dough has doubled, use clean hands to punch down the dough. Make sure to smooth out any air bubbles in it as well., For the cinnamon roll bites, you’ll need a 9- to 10-inch (23- to 25-inch) pie dish. Use softened or melted butter to lightly grease the surface of the dish so the bites won’t stick.If you prefer, you can use nonstick cooking spray to grease the pie dish.

, To prepare the coating for the bites, place ½ cup (113 g) of melted unsalted butter in a small bowl. Add the remaining 1 cup (200 g) of sugar and 2 tablespoons (16 g) of ground cinnamon to a separate small bowl and whisk the two together well.If you prefer, you can use 1 cup (216 g) of store-bought cinnamon sugar.

, When you’re ready to prepare the bites, take small pieces of the dough and roll them into balls with clean hands. Aim for balls that are approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) in size., After you’ve rolled the dough into balls, place them in the melted butter to thoroughly coat them. Next, roll them in the cinnamon sugar so they are evenly covered.It’s best to work with one ball at a time.

, When you’re finished coating the balls, place them in the greased pie dish. Layer the balls on top of one another to create a stack and pour the remaining melted butter and cinnamon sugar over the stack.The stack of dough balls should resemble a dome.

, When you’ve finished adding all of the balls, cover the pie dish with plastic wrap. Let the balls rise by approximately half, which should take about an hour., To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cinnamon roll bites, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Make sure that the balls are done or nearly done rising before you begin preheating the oven.

, Once the oven is preheated, remove the plastic from the pie plate and place it on a baking sheet. Set the bites inside the oven, and allow them to bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until they are firm and golden brown.Placing the pie plate on a baking sheet keeps any possible butter and cinnamon sugar mixture that might bubble over from dirtying the oven.
You can be sure that the bites are done by inserting a cake tester or toothpick inside one. If the tester emerges clean, the bites are finished baking.

, When the cinnamon roll bites are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Let them cool in the pie plate for 10 to 15 minutes., To make the glaze for the cinnamon roll bites, add 1 cup (125 g) of sifted confectioners’ sugar and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of coarse salt to a medium bowl. Whisk the two together until they are fully combined.Confectioners’ sugar is also known as icing or powdered sugar.

, Add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of melted, unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of whole milk, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract to a separate small bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully blended., When the butter mixture is blended, pour it into the sugar mixture. Mix well until a smooth, pourable paste forms.If you’re having trouble blending the two mixtures together, it may help to use an electric mixer.

, Once the glaze is fully mixed, pour it over the cooled cinnamon roll bites. Set the bites out and serve immediately.Store the glaze at room temperature until you are ready to add it to the bites. Be sure to whisk just before drizzling it over the bites.
Keep any leftover bites in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should stay fresh for up to 5 days.

This recipe resembles a banana bread, but is a little sweeter, with a thinner batter suited for cakes., You can use any sort of baking dish that you'd like, of course, but loaf dishes are nice and deep, allowing you to get thick, moist center to your bread. You can just as easily pour the batter into pie tins, a bunt cake, or any other baking dish.

, Beat using an electric mixer until the ingredients are combined in a light, consistent color, about one minute. If you don't sift the flour, whip it up with a fork at least -- this breaks up big clumps of flour to ensure that everything gets melted and mixed together well.

, Melt the butter slowly, in 15-20 second bursts, so that it is liquid but not hot. Then mash up your bananas, blending well. The more ripe the banana is, the better it will be. Dark brown bananas are often your best bet.You can pre-mash the bananas easily on a plate with the back of a large., Flour actually toughens up as you mix it, leading to chewier, less tender cakes.

, Take these three wet ingredients and mix them together in a small bowl off to the side. Remember that, the darker and more ripe the banana, the better it will be for banana cake, as overripe bananas are sweeter and softer. When done mixing the wet ingredients, add to the oil and egg mixture.

, Mix together all of these powdered, dry ingredients and then use a fork or a whisk to break up any clumps. For perfect cakes, you should sift the flour in, which perfectly breaks up clumps for a nice smooth batter.


Add the walnuts, and if using, the sultanas. Chocolate chips are also a wonderful addition that could go in now, if desired., If you have an electric mixer, this is your best choice. Turn it on low and slowly incorporate the flour mixture into your milk/oil/banana mixture, adding the flour, mixing in 80% of it then adding more flour. Mix until all of the dry ingredients are mixed with the wet., Make sure it is level and without air pockets. A good way to do this is to bang fill the tins up and then bang the bottom of the pans on the counter top lightly, which should shake out any air bubbles.

To assemble the strawberry shortcakes, cut the scones in half.,
Top with strawberries and whipped cream.,
Finish with more whipped cream and a few more strawberries.",How to Make Strawberry Shortcake," Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.


If you don't have parchment paper, cooking spray will do -- but it's less reliable.;
, With your whisk in hand, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Once combined, move onto the butter. Be sure to use chilled butter, cutting it into small pieces to incorporate it into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives. When it's ready, it'll have the consistency of coarse crumbs.









Make sure the butter is thoroughly mixed in! It may take a few minutes to accomplish this -- be diligent.

, Add all of it to the flour mixture -- when the dough comes together, stop mixing. Do not be tempted to over mix the dough; that will make it lose its pliability and texture.








, Knead the dough gently four or five times to get it going and then work it into a round. About 7"" (18 cm) is good. To make your individual shortcakes, cut out rounds with a 3"" (7 cm) round cookie cutter. Place them evenly spaced out on the baking sheet.









Brush the tops of the scones with a little cream; this will give them a golden, luscious color.

, Insert a toothpick in the center of a scone -- if it comes out clean, they're ready. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.









As the shortbread bakes, keep an eye on it. It can burn quite easily.

, Make pieces of all shapes and sizes -- don't worry about uniformity.








, Then it's time to go to town, crushing them with a potato masher or fork. Add the remaining sliced strawberries, along with the sugar. Use more or less sugar, depending on how sweet your berries are.









Some strawberries are a bit unripe and need more sugar to match the flavor of the scone and cream.

, Leave them alone and at room temperature for about 30 to 60 minutes. This softens the berries and gives them a dessert-like quality. The flavor will come alive at this time, so don't skip this step!








, This will help the cream aerate. Kind of like how a beer is always better in a frosted glass.








, This should take about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. When the peaks start forming, stop immediately. If you over beat the mixture, it will lose its form.









If you don't have vanilla and lemon zest, you can make a topping out of 1 cup (250 ml) cold heavy whipping cream and 1-2 tbsps (15-30 g) white sugar. Orange zest or lime zest can be colorful alternatives to lemon zest as well.

, Place the bottom half of the scone (soft side up) on the plate. It's time to make it beautiful.








, Make sure to get both crushed and whole strawberries on all areas, for presentation (even though it'll last about 2 minutes once served!). Place the top half of the scone on top, like the most delicious sandwich ever. Almost there!








, If there is strawberry juice left over, drizzle a little over the top of the whipped cream or make a pattern on the edge of the plate. Place a bit of the strawberry mixture to the sides, too -- everyone likes extra! Serve immediately.

Arrange the pillar object in the center of the platter or plate base.

,
Add the plate layer.,
Place the cupcakes on the top layer.",How to Make a Cupcake Stand1," A platter or plate is ideal.;
, It needs to be tall, so a martini glass, a wide brimmed glass or vase or something similar is ideal.

, This forms the only layer you'll make.

, While it is possible to very carefully move this stand, it's best not to!

,, Balance with care.

, If wished, you can also add to the base layer but if you don't have enough cupcakes, that's fine, just use the top layer only, as this is the layer which draws the eye.

"
"
Create a base.,
Cover the base if needed.,
Choose the layers.,
Make the pillars to hold the layers.,
Arrange the pillars and layers.,
Add the cupcakes.",How to Make a Cupcake Stand2," For the base, use a flat piece of cardboard, plastic, or a thick cutting board. It can be in any shape - square, circle, or heart-shaped, provided it's solid and pretty.


Some stores sell cake bases that could serve as a suitable base for the cupcake stand. These are usually very cheap to buy and come already wrapped in gold or silver foil.

, Cover the base with wrapping paper, foil or another type of covering to improve its appearance. This step isn't necessary if the base is already in great condition and looks nice.

, Basically, choose plates and platters that are lightweight and strong. They should ideally decline in size as they go up the stand, so choose something like a dinner plate for the first layer, a side plate for the next layer, a cake plate for the next layer and a saucer for the final layer.


Match the plates or mix them up. If you have plates with pretty patterns, eclectic matching won't matter. Plain white or silver platters are always a safe bet when you want a neutral look.
For the top layer, where you place only one layer, an unwanted CD is a clever item to use. You can leave it unwrapped (but do wash it first in warm, soapy water), or cover with paper or fabric.

, Here is where you get to have quite a bit of artistic license. Choose whatever is strong and likely to look nice. Most importantly, the item must be safe for use around food, it must not take up too much room on the plate, it must be balanced and it must decline in size as it goes up the layers, just like the plates do.


Some great examples of things to use as pillars between the layers include: a glass, cup, eggcup, fabric-covered cleaned out can, vase, sugar bowl, etc.
An example of layering could be: First pillar vase, second pillar a glass, third pillar a sugar bowl and final pillar an eggcup.

,


Place the base layer down in the area where it'll stay. This stand won't be moved once made.
Add the first pillar. Then carefully balance the next layer.
Continue adding pillars and balancing layers. Anytime something seems wobbly or uncertain, try a different pillar or layer object in its place to see what sits more soundly.

, Carefully arrange the cupcakes on every layer of the cupcake stand. Wait for the oohs and aahs from your party guests.

"
"
Find a base layer.,
Find two cake stands.,
Assemble.",How to Make a Cupcake Stand3," Choose a flat base layer which has good strength to it and looks pretty. A silver platter, a favorite dish, etc. are nice choices.

, They can be the same size or different. If different, the smaller stand sit atop the larger one.


If you want to make the stand complementary with a table theme or your favorite tea set, etc., you'll need to be a little more picky about the colors and patterns of the stands and base layer. If in doubt, plain white and plain metals are safe choices. (But nobody much minds eclectic placement when the stands are pretty and have heirloom quality.)

, This is easy and fast:


Assemble in place, so that you don't have to move the cupcake stand once put together.
Place the base layer down. If using doilies underneath, make sure the doilies are already securely in place.
Place the first cake stand on the base layer. Center the stand's leg in the middle of the base layer.
Place the next cake stand on the first cake stand. If using different sizes, this should be the smaller of the two. Again, center it.
Fill with cupcakes, using the base layer and the two cake stand layers.
Done. It will look wonderful but don't be surprised if the cupcakes steal all the attention!

Cake boards are the foil coated boards sold by cake supplies stores to hold heavy cakes like wedding and Christmas fruit cakes for easy transportation. For a three-tired cupcake stand, you'll need:


3 cake boards in descending size
4 cake dummies, one pair larger than the other pair (note that you can substitute with like objects, such as an unwanted hat box and a large can, etc.)
Glue
Satin ribbon in color of choice
Pretty wrapping paper (match your party theme or just choose a color or pattern that you adore)
Scissors
Dressmaking pins
Double sided tape (strong)
Pencil.

, Glue each pair of cake dummies together. Allow to dry.

, Now wrap it all the way around the cake dummy until you reach the top of it. Add a dab of glue here and there to keep it tautly in place.


Secure the other end with another pin when you reach the top of the cake dummy.
Repeat with the other cake dummy.

, Draw around it with the pencil and remove. Do the same for the other two cake boards.


Cut out the paper shapes you've drawn.

, Match the paper circle to it and press down, taking care to evenly match the circle so that it covers the whole board.


Repeat with the other two cake boards.

, Glue in place. (You may need to hold it briefly so that the glue takes.)

, Use double sided tape of tested strength to keep the boards attached to the pillar cake dummies.


Place the largest cake board down first. Place double sided tape to the the base of the first pillar. Find the center of the cake board and press the pillar down firmly.
Place double sided tape on the top of this dummy. Find the center of the middle cake board and press the two together, the base facing the pillar's top.
Repeat for the next dummy and final layer.

, While this cupcake stand can be moved around with ease when there are no cupcakes on it, it's best not to move it once the cupcakes are in place. Arrange the cupcakes around each layer as desired.

, Use a well-wrung out damp cloth to spot clean frosting or sticky crumbs.


Eventually the stand will become a bit rundown and you'll need to pull it apart and rewrap with new paper and possibly wash the ribbon. Try not to throw away the base materials––they can be reused again and again if you're prepared to keep renewing the outer materials.

",How to Make Caramel Shortcake," Put two eggs into a small saucepan and cover them with cold water, plus an extra inch (2.5 cm) of water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. When the water boils, remove the saucepan from the heat, cover it with a lid, and set it aside for 12 minutes to let the eggs cook.When the eggs are fully cooked, remove them from the pan and place them into a bowl of ice water to cool completely.
To use the eggs, crack the shells with the end of a knife and peel them off. Cut the eggs in half and remove the yolks from the center.;
, Add the egg yolks and the flours, baking powder, salt, and sugar to a food processor. Pulse the mixture a few times to combine all the ingredients and break up the egg yolks.


You can use finely ground cornmeal in place of the semolina flour.
If you don’t have a food processor, combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and use a pastry cutter or two knives to incorporate all the ingredients., Add the butter to the food processor a few cubes at a time and pulse. Once all the butter has been added, pulse a few more times until the mixture comes together as pea-sized crumbs. Slowly pour in the heavy cream.


Pulse the food processor a few more times after adding the cream to bring the ingredients together., Turn the dough out onto a flat surface and knead it gently a few times to finish bringing the ingredients together. Stop when everything has been incorporated.


Don’t over-knead the dough, as this can develop the gluten and make the cake tough and dense.
When the dough is ready, preheat your oven to 350 F (177 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

, Use an ice cream scoop or ¼ cup (60 ml) measuring cup to divide the dough into six separate balls. Place the balls of dough onto the parchment-lined baking sheet.


Cover the balls of dough with a sheet of plastic wrap and transfer them to the refrigerator to chill for 25 minutes.

, With a pastry brush, cover the tops of each dough ball with a thin layer of cream.Sprinkle each with a pinch of sugar before baking for about 30 minutes.


The shortcakes are ready when the sides turn golden brown and become firm. This could take between 28 and 32 minutes.
When cooked, remove the cakes from the oven, transfer them to a wire rack, and set them aside to cool as you prepare the topping and filling.

, In a mixing bowl, toss together the fruit, sugar, zest, and salt. Leave half the fruit mixture in the bowl to develop for at least 30 minutes, and transfer the other half to a small saucepan.Add the water to the saucepan and heat the fruit over medium–low heat until it comes to a gentle simmer. Continue cooking for about 15 minutes, then remove it from the heat and stir in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of lemon juice to each batch of fruit.


There are a number of fruits you can use for this caramel shortcake recipe, including strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and bananas.

, In another medium mixing bowl, combine the cream, sugar, and salt. Cut the vanilla bean in half lengthwise, and use the tip of a spoon to scrape the seeds into the mixture. With electric beaters or a stand mixer, beat the mixture on medium speed until soft peaks form in the cream, about two minutes.Instead of fresh vanilla seeds, you can use ½ to 1 teaspoon (2.5 to 5 ml) of vanilla extract.

, Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan.Heat over medium–low heat to melt the butter and sugar. Whisk the mixture constantly and cook it for about six minutes. Whisk in the vanilla and cook for another minute. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.As you heat the ingredients, they will come together and thicken into a gooey caramel sauce.

, This recipe makes six individual-sized caramel shortcakes. Cut each cake in half, dividing the top and bottom of the cake so you can fill the center with fruit, cream, and caramel.Remove the tops from the cakes and set them aside, leaving the bottoms in place so that you can add the filling.

, Spread a layer of caramel sauce over the top of each shortcake bottom. Then spoon a layer of the warm and cold fruit fillings on top of the caramel. Top the fruit with another drizzle of caramel and a generous dollop of whipped cream.When you have filled the cakes, return the shortcake top to each bottom

, Divide the remaining warm fruit filling among the six cakes and spoon the fruit on top of the cake. Then drizzle more caramel over the fruit. Don’t worry if the caramel drips down the side of the cake. Cover the fruit with another dollop of whipped cream.


Finish each cake by sprinkling the remaining cold fruit over the whipped cream before serving.,"

Next, set the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius) to preheat the oven.Most ovens beep or flash an indicator light when the oven has reached the preheated temperature. Pay attention so you know when yours is ready.;
, Find a 8-inch by 8-inch (20.32 cm x 20.32 cm) baking dish or pan for your shortcake. Use butter or a nonstick cooking spray to lightly grease the pan so the shortcake won’t stick to it when it’s time to remove it.If you prefer not to grease the pan, line it with parchment paper or a nonstick baking liner., Sift 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour with ⅓ cup (66 g) granulated sugar, 4 teaspoons (20 g) baking powder, 1 teaspoon (3 g) kosher salt, and a pinch of ground nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well blended.If you don’t have a sifter, you can use a fine mesh strainer. Place it over the bowl and dump the flour in it, shaking it to help the flour pass through.If you don’t have a sifter or strainer, use a whisk or fork to mix up the flour before adding it to the mixing bowl so it has a lighter texture.

, Take ½ cup or 1 stick (113 g) of very cold unsalted butter that’s been cut into small pieces and add it to the bowl with the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. Continue working until the butter is cut into pieces that are as big as small peas.If you don’t have a pastry cutter, you can use a fork or a butter knife to cut the butter into the flour., After you’ve cut the butter into the dry ingredients, mix in 1 well-beaten egg and ⅓ cup (78 ml) cold milk. Stir together until the egg and milk just moisten the dry ingredients.Avoid overmixing the batter or you may wind up with a tough shortcake.

, Once you’ve mixed in the egg and milk, press the batter into the bottom of your greased or lined pan. Work quickly and avoid touching the batter too much so you can keep the butter cold., Place the pan in the preheated oven, and allow it to bake for 15 to 20 minutes. You’ll know that it’s done when the top of the shortcake is a golden color. Allow it to cool for approximately 20 minutes on a wire rack.To make sure that the shortcake bakes evenly, place it on the center of the oven rack. That allows air to circulate around evenly in both directions.

, Once the shortcake is cool enough to handle, it’s time to divide it into individual servings. Cut the cake into even squares. You can make them any size that you prefer, but 2-inch (5 cm) square is usually a good size., For the shortcake, you’ll need 4 ripe peaches that have been peeled. To make it easier, use a knife to make a small “x” at the bottom of each, and place them in a large pot of boiling water. Allow them to boil for 30 seconds.Use a slotted spoon to take the peaches out of the pot, so you don’t take any boiling water with them.

, When you remove the peaches from the boiling water, place them immediately in a bowl of ice water. That will stop the peaches from cooking any further, but the skins will be loosened enough that you can remove them with your fingers.It’s easiest to start peeling the skin from the bottom of the peaches where you made the “x.”

, Once the skins are removed, cut the peaches in half and remove the pit. Next, slice the peaches lengthwise to create ½-inch (1.27 cm) thick slices and place them in a medium bowl.Add 2 teaspoons (10 g) of granulated sugar to the peaches, and mix well. Set the bowl aside.If you want your peaches to have a deeper flavor, replace the granulated sugar with light brown sugar.

, In a separate bowl, stir 3 tablespoons (42 g) unsalted butter that’s been melted and 3 tablespoons (45 ml) dark rum together. Mix until well blended, and then set aside.If you aren’t a fan of rum, you can replace it with 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of amaretto or peach schnapps., Chill a bowl in the refrigerator for an hour or so, and then pour 1 ½ cups (355 ml) cold heavy cream into it. Whip the cream on medium speed with the whisk attachment on a stand mixer or hand mixer until the liquid starts to thicken.You can whip the cream by hand with a whisk, but the process will take longer.

, When the cream has thickened slightly, add 5 tablespoons (106 g) of honey to it. Use a spatula to gently fold the honey into the cream. You may need to push down the cream from the sides of the bowl to incorporate the honey completely.Choose a honey that has a delicate flavor so it won’t overpower the flavor of the peaches. Clover or orange blossom honey is a good option.

, Turn the stand mixer or hand mixer back on, and whip the cream on medium-high speed. Continue until soft peaks form.It’s best to use the whipped cream right after you make it, but if you’re not going to assemble the shortcakes right away, place it in the refrigerator.

, With a knife, split the shortcake squares in half horizontally. Use a pastry brush to apply the rum butter mixture to each cut side of the shortcake and place on a plate.If you don’t have a pastry brush, try using a coffee filter or your fingers to brush the butter over the shortcake.

, Place one buttered piece of the shortcake in the center of the plate, and spoon enough peaches to cover the square onto it. Next, top the peaches with a dollop of the whipped cream., Top the first shortcake half with the other piece. Layer a few more peach slices and another dollop of whipped cream on top to finish off the shortcake.If you prefer, you can top the second layer of shortcake with only whipped cream.

Serve the plum cake.",How to Make Plum Cake," You will need ½ pound (about 227 grams) of ripe plums. Once pitted and sliced, you will have about 1 ¼ cups (313 milliliters) of sliced plums.Only buy ripe, ready-to-eat plums. Signs of a ripe plum include:


A deep, even purple color
Sweet, fruity-smelling skin
Gives slightly when squeezed
Smooth, wrinkle-free skin;
, First, run a knife along the seam of the fruit until you feel the pit. Continue slicing along the pit until you have cut all around the fruit. Next, firmly twist the two halves in opposite directions to separate them from one another.


Set the plum on a cutting board when slicing it in half. If you hold it in your hand, you may cut yourself.

, When you separate the two halves, one half will still have a pit inside. If the plum is ripe enough, use your fingers to pull the pit away from the plum flesh. If it’s firmly attached, scoop the pit out with a spoon.


Discard any plum pits that you remove from your fruit.

, Set each plum half flesh-down on your cutting board. Next, use a sharp knife to cut each half into small, even slices. Each half will yield about six slices.If you prefer larger pieces of plums, you don’t need to slice the halves. You will add them to the cake flesh-down when the batter is ready.
Remember to practice knife safety when cutting fruit.

, You will need 3 eggs, 1/2 cup (114 grams) of butter at room temperature, 1 teaspoon of lemon zest, 1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour, and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.To get room-temperature butter, leave a stick of butter on your counter for a few hours.

, First, set out two small cups or ramekins. Next, crack the egg over one of the ramekins. Allow the whites of the egg to fall into the ramekin. Gently pass the egg yolk between the two shell halves until all of the egg whites have separated. Place the egg yolk in the empty ramekin and pick out any pieces of shell that you see.If you don’t want to separate the eggs by hand, purchase an egg separator online or at your local gourmet grocery store.
It’s better to have a little bit of egg white in the yolk than to have a little bit of yolk in the egg white.

, Use a hand mixer or a whisk to beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Start beating the eggs on a slow setting until they become foamy. Raise the speed slowly every thirty seconds or so until the egg whites are whipped.To avoid over beating the eggs, keep a close eye on their progress.


Stiff peaks will have a glossy appearance and stand up sharply on their own.
Use a metal or glass bowl to beat the eggs. Plastic bowls can affect the whipping process.
If you overbeat the eggs, they will start to look curdled. Throw them away and try again.

, Add the soft butter to a large mixing bowl. Use an electric mixer or a whisk to turn the butter into a creamy paste. Next, add in the sugar. Continue mixing the sugar and butter mixture until it resembles light fluffy sand.Make sure to use a very large mixing bowl, as you will be adding other ingredients to the butter mixture.

, Use an electric mixer or a whisk to incorporate the egg yolks and lemon zest into the butter mixture. When you first start mixing, the egg yolks won’t mix well and the batter will look strange. However, the egg yolks will eventually become incorporated and the batter will look smooth and creamy.


Once the egg yolks are incorporated, consider adding fragrant extracts to enhance the flavor. For example, add 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) of almond extract.To further enhance the flavor, consider adding the zest of other citrus fruits as well. For example, add an extra teaspoon (5 grams) of orange zest.

, Sifting will aerate the flour and remove any lumps in the baking powder.First, hold a sifter over a large bowl. Pour in the flour and move the sifter from side to side. Once all of the flour has fallen into the bowl, pour the baking powder into the sifter and repeat the process.


If you want a slightly spiced plum cake, add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture.After sifting, use a whisk to mix the baking soda and the flour together.

, Add about half of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and blend it together. Once the flour is completely absorbed, add the rest of the flour mixture. Continue mixing until all of the flour has been incorporated into the batter.

, Add about a quarter of the whipped egg whites into the mixture. Use a spatula to fold the egg whites into the mixture. To do so, scoop batter from underneath the egg whites and gently drape them towards the center of the bowl. Turn the bowl slightly and repeat the process until the egg whites disappear.


Continue folding in batches egg whites until all of the egg whites are incorporated.Resist the urge to stir the mixture. If you do, the cake will flatten in the oven.

, Set your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, or 190 degrees Celsius. Many modern ovens will alert you when they’re done preheating. If yours doesn’t have this feature, preheat the oven for at least ten minutes to bring it to temperature.

, You can use two circular 8-inch (21cm x 5cm) cake pans, a nine inch (23cm x 8cm) Bundt pan, or two 8-inch (23cm x 13cm x 6cm) loaf pans.Rub the inside of the pan and dust it with flour to create a non-stick surface. Alternatively, spray cooking spray on the inside of the pan.


Discard any extra flour leftover from greasing and flouring the pan.

, Gently pour the cake batter into the cake pans. Use a spatula to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl clean. If you’re using two cake pans, fill them as evenly as you can. To do so, add a large dollop of cake batter to each pan until all of it has been used.

, If you want to create a beautiful pattern, carefully arrange the sliced plums in a spiral formation. If you want to create a rustic, haphazard look, drop the plum slices into the batter in a random pattern.


If you are using plum halves instead of slices, set the plum halves in the batter flesh-down and press gently.
Don’t press the plums too far into the batter. The batter will rise around the plums in the oven.

, When finished, the cake will have a golden-brown crust. To test whether or not your cake is done, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done baking. If it’s covered in batter, let the cake continue baking for five more minutes and check it again., Once the cake is done cooking, remove it from the oven. Slide the cake out of the pan and onto a wire baking rack to cool. If you let it cool in the pan, the bottom will become soggy. Allow the cake cool completely.


While the cake is cooling, dust a layer of confectioner’s sugar over the top to add visual excitement.

, Once the cake has cooled, serve your plum cake with a hot cup of tea or coffee. Alternatively, make a caramel sauce and pour it over a slice of plum cake before serving it. Finally, if you have a strong sweet tooth, serve a slice of cake with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.


Refrigerate any leftover cake.Eat the cake within three days of baking it.

Hold the cupcake in the palm of one hand.,
Use your other hand to tear the cupcake in half.,
Flip the bottom of the cupcake onto the top.,
Enjoy.",How to Eat a Cupcake1," Rest the bottom of the cupcake in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Keep your hand steady so that the cupcake does not topple over.


Note that this method can also be referred to as the “gentleman style” or “hamburger style.” It is a convenient and relatively mess-free alternative that creates an even ration of frosting to cake.
This method works with any standard cupcake but does not work well with filled cupcakes.;
, Grip the center of the cupcake from the bottom using your dominant hand. Dig into the cupcake with your fingernails, twisting it gently simultaneously. Continue until the bottom breaks free from the top.


Note that it may be easier for you to use a knife to cut the cupcake in half. This can be done by placing the cupcake on a plate and sawing the top from the bottom with a knife. A plastic knife or other dull kitchen knife will work sufficiently well.

, Turn the bottom half of the cupcake upside-down so that the cut portion now faces downward. Place the bottom half over the top half and press it down into the frosting. Press well to secure the two halves together, using the frosting as an adhesive.

, Eat the cupcake by biting into as you would do with a sandwich or hamburger.


Watch out for any stray frosting. If your press too tightly as you eat, frosting may squirt out from in between the two cake layers.

"
Let the cupcakes cool.,
Store the cupcakes in a container.,
Store the cupcakes in airtight freezer bags.",How to Freeze Cupcakes1," If you try to freeze them while they're hot, the cupcakes will give off a steam that turns into condensation and may even cause the paper liners to peel off while they are freezing. The best way to cool cupcakes fully is to leave them on a wire rack for about an hour, until they're cool enough to touch and handle.


Wire racks are recommended over a plate or chopping board because the air can circulate more easily around the cupcakes.This prevents the cupcakes from getting soggy on the bottom while they are cooling.;
, After the cupcakes have cooled thoroughly, consider placing them in an airtight container to freeze. The container should be large enough to hold all the cupcakes you have and tall enough to prevent the cupcakes from squishing into each other.Ensure the container gives the cupcakes enough room to avoid the tops from getting sticky or touching the lid. The lid should also be able to snap tightly on top of the container.

, If you don't have a container on hand or would like another method of freezing cupcakes, you can use freezer bags. When placing the cupcakes in the airtight bag, create layers and stack the cupcakes with parchment paper to keep them from sticking to each other."
"
Place the cupcake on a plate.,
Divide the cupcake in half.,
Spread jam or another filling onto the bottom.,
Replace the top half.,
Enjoy.",How to Eat a Cupcake2," Set the bottom of the cupcake down onto the center of a plate.


This technique works best for un-frosted cupcakes and cupcakes that have very little frosting since the jam can be used to add more flavor. You can also use it for heavily-frosted cupcakes, but be aware of the fact that it can result in an even messier—albeit, tastier—treat.
Note that this method works with standard cupcakes but not with filled cupcakes.

, Hold the cupcake steady with your non-dominant hand, grasping the cake portion with your thumb and forefinger near the top of the cupcake. Use a plastic knife or other dull kitchen knife to slice the cupcake in half, separating the top from the bottom.


Set the top half aside as you work with the bottom half. Place the top half on your plate cut-side-down.
You could tear the cupcake in half as you would do with the sandwich method, but cutting it in half is preferable for this method because it creates a smoother, more even division.

, Use a dull kitchen knife to smear a thin layer of flavored jam, honey, hazelnut spread, or other similar spread onto the cut-side of the bottom layer.


You can use a thicker layer of spread, but a thicker layer is more likely to squirt out from the sides of the cupcake as you eat it.

, Place the top half of the cupcake back onto the lower half, reconnecting the two cut sides. Press down on the top half slightly to secure it in place, relying on the jam to adhere the halves together.

, Eat the cupcake by biting into as you would bite a sandwich.

"
"
Place the cupcake on a dish.,
Eat the frosting with a spoon.,
Dig out any filling, if applicable.,
Consume the remaining cake.",How to Eat a Cupcake3," Set the bottom of the cupcake down onto a plate or in a shallow bowl.


This method works well with both standard and filled cupcakes. You will be eating the various parts of the cupcake—frosting, filling, and cake—separately instead of enjoying them at the same time. This is a very non-traditional way to enjoy a cupcake, but it works well for people who don't enjoy mixing flavors.

, Use a spoon to scrape away the frosting a little at a time. Eat each spoonful of frosting as you scrape it away. Continue eating the frosting in this way until the top of the cupcake is frosting-free.


Unless you have a massive sweet tooth, you should eat the frosting in small bites.
If necessary, you can pile some of the frosting into the corner of your dish to save for later. This can be done if the sweetness of the frosting becomes too intense as you eat it or if you want to save a little for the end.

, Use your spoon to dig out and eat the filling from the center of a filled cupcake. If the filling is already exposed, the job is easy. If it is covered by the top of your cupcake, use your spoon to carefully dig out a small chunk of cake from the center top to expose the filling beneath.


You can either eat the removed portion of the cake immediately or set it off to the side to enjoy with the rest of the cake.

, At this point, a hollowed-out, frosting-free cake should be all that remains. You can eat it with your spoon, but you can also eat it by picking it up with your hands and taking bites directly out of it.

"
"
Set the cupcake down.,
Hold the cupcake steady with one hand.,
Use a knife to cut the cupcake into pieces.,
Eat one piece at a time.",How to Eat a Cupcake4," Place the bottom of the cupcake onto a plate.


This method works best with standard cupcakes but can also be used for filled cupcakes as long as the filling is thick.
Separating the cupcake into proportioned pieces is a favorite tactic of dieters since it allows you to eat a portion of a cupcake while saving the rest for later.

, Carefully grasp the cake portion of the cupcake near the top, using your non-dominant hand. Hold it carefully to minimize the amount of frosting you get on your hand.

, Smoothly divide the cupcake in half, dividing it into to equal sides, using a plastic knife or other dull kitchen knife. If desired, you can divide the cupcake further into bite-size pieces.


Note that you are cutting the cupcake vertically, not horizontally. The top and bottom should still be intact, unlike with other methods mentioned.

, If you cut the cupcake into bite-size pieces, pop each piece into your mouth one at a time. If you only cut the cupcake in half, pick up each half and take bites out of it.

"
"
Hold the cupcake between your thumb and forefinger.,
Take bites directly out of the cupcake.",How to Eat a Cupcake5," Grasp the cupcake with your dominant hand, gripping the sides lightly but securely between your thumb and forefinger.


This is the classic cupcake-eating method. It can be fairly messy, but it maintains the look of the cupcake for as long as possible and works with filled and non-filled cupcakes alike.

, Bring the cupcake up to your mouth and take bites out of it directly.


Wipe away any frosting that gets on your nose your cheeks as you eat.

Let the cupcakes cool.,
Frost the cupcakes.,
Freeze the cupcakes in an uncovered container.,
Store the cupcakes in a container.,
Store and cover the cupcakes with aluminum foil.",How to Freeze Cupcakes2," Before freezing the cupcakes, they must cool, to avoid the build-up of condensation and moisture in the cupcake container. The best way to cool cupcakes fully is to leave them on a wire rack for about an hour, until they are cool enough to touch and handle.


Wire racks are highly more recommended so that the air can circulate more easily around the cupcakes.This prevents the cupcakes from getting soggy on the bottom while they are cooling.

, In order to freeze frosted cupcakes, they must be frosted correctly. Consider using a frosting pipe to pipe the frosting neatly on top of the cupcakes. Add a good amount of frosting for each cupcake, as once you freeze the cupcakes, you cannot frost them again. There are a variety of frosting flavors to choose from: buttercream frosting, chocolate frosting, strawberry frosting, and cream cheese frosting.

, The container should be large enough to carry all the cupcakes you have and tall enough to prevent the cupcakes from squishing into each other.Place the cupcakes to freeze in an open container so that the frosting can freeze thoroughly, usually taking about 3-4 hours. Ensure the frosting is solid before removing it from the freezer.

, Using the same container as before, snap the lid on tightly so the cupcakes can freeze until they are ready to be eaten. Make sure the container is large enough so that the frosting does not touch the cupcakes while freezing them.

, Instead of a container, you can also freeze the cupcakes in foil. Freeze the frosted cupcakes without covering them for about 3-4 hours so the frosting can become solid. Cover each cupcake with aluminum foil carefully, taking care not to touch the frosting. Lay each covered cupcake on a cookie sheet or place them in a large Ziploc bag."

Finished.

",How to Freeze Cupcakes3," Take the cupcakes out of the freezer and place them in a safe place where they can defrost without being disturbed, such as a countertop or cooking space.

, It's not recommended to use heat to defrost your cupcakes. Avoid using an oven, microwave, or stovetop to defrost your cupcakes or they will end up soggy and/or the paper liners will peel off.Leave the cupcakes wrapped or in their container or bag when you remove them from the freezer.

, After about an hour, slightly crack open the container or Ziploc bag. If the cupcakes were wrapped in foil, remove some of the foil off each cupcake, but not all of it. Too much moisture can cause the paper liners to peel off, so it's important to let out some air for the cupcakes., Most cupcakes will take about thirty minutes to an hour to defrost, but you can leave the cupcakes overnight so they can defrost fully.Image:Freeze Cupcakes Step 12.jpg

",How to Eat a Cupcake6," This is a messy method meant for messy cupcakes, so a bowl is preferable to a plate.


This method is rarely used when eating a cupcake in good condition. Instead, this method works best for cupcakes that are otherwise inedible because they are too crumbly or because the frosting is too runny.

, Press down onto the cupcake using the tines (the pointy part) of the fork, smashing the cake down until it is completely broken apart.

, Stir the crumbled cake pieces and the frosting until clumps of sticky cupcake goodness form.


You will need a sufficient amount of frosting to make this work. If your cupcake is lacking in frosting and you cannot get it to clump up, consider adding more frosting or a dollop of jam or similarly sticky spread to the crumbled up cupcake.

, Pick up the clumps of cupcake with your fork and eat them that way. If the clumps fall apart when you stick your fork through them, switch to a spoon.

Clean up.",How to Have a Cupcake Party," Look at your schedule and choose a week that you're not busy and don't have any other activities or appointments planned. Having a week that's clear and not too busy will give you plenty of time to plan the cupcake party, find decorations, and get it set. Find a time that's easiest for most people to join. For example: Hosting a cupcake party for five year old girls would probably not be a good idea during the middle of the night.

Once you have picked a date and time, stick to it and mark it. Mark it on your calendar and set reminders (such as on your phone, tablet, computer, etc.) daily so you can plan properly and avoid procrastinating the night before the cupcake party.;
, Having a party without anyone isn't a party at all. Ensure you tell as many people as possible about your party, but knowing your limits and not inviting too many to avoid overwhelming yourself. Clearly state what day the party is on, when the cupcake party starts, what time it ends, where it's at, and other needed information. You could state this by calling them or, more preferably for the fun of the part, make an invitation.

Send invitations to your friends and family. Create cupcake-themed invitations to keep up with the theme. You may also want to create invitations that are colored in shades of pink, purple, or light blue since these are common colors for cupcake parties, but shades of light green, yellow, and light brown can work and match well with the theme, too.
Consider creating invitations that are in the shape of a cupcake, rather than regular paper shaped in squares or rectangles. This can make the upcoming party more exciting and may want others to attend the cupcake part as well.
Placing small craft decorations on each invitation such as pom pom balls, sparkles, glitter, lace, colored foil, and/or ribbon can make the invitation more exciting and will help match with the cupcake theme.

, One thing that you must have at a cupcake party is most definitely cupcakes. Beware of allergies that your party guests may have. You may want to provide nut-free or dairy-free cupcakes so others don't feel left out. Be creative as well, instead of the classic chocolate and vanilla, try making cupcakes you've never made before that are unique, and will make others want to try. You may want to consider making:

Bacon cupcakes
Jalapeno cupcakes
Rainbow cupcakes
Smore cupcakes
Cookie monster cupcakes
Coffee cupcakes
Oreo cupcakes
Hamburger cupcakes

, While cupcakes should be provided at a cupcake party, it's not the only food everyone will eat. Offer party snacks such as snack mixes, chopped fruit and vegetables, dips, mini-sized fried food, and crackers with cheese. If the party guests will be staying over for a meal such as lunch or dinner, plan the food you will be making by writing it down. Don't forget to also offer liquids, especially water. Consider bringing lemonade, fruit punch, chocolate or strawberry milk, smoothies, milkshakes, hot or iced tea, fruit juices, and/or coffee.

To match with the cupcake theme, try making savory cupcakes when it comes to appetizers or meals. You may want to consider making meatloaf cupcakes, pizza cupcakes, spaghetti cupcakes, or macaroni and cheese cupcakes.

, You'll most likely need a few decorations and basic party supplies. Always buy your supplies ahead of time rather than last minute to avoid overwhelming yourself on the day of the cupcake party. When shopping, try finding supplies that have a certain color theme. You may want to buy pink forks, pink plastic plates, pink napkins, etc. For children, you may want to pick out party hats or streamers. If possible, choose decorations that have cupcakes on them to match with the party theme.

Try finding finding small, plastic goody bags or colored paper bags to store with treats when the party guests arrive or leave.
Consider buying colorful paper lanterns. These can be hung on the ceiling and make pretty decorations for a cupcake party.

, Write down the activities on what all your party guests will be doing. You may want to plan a schedule on how the party will work by including when the will start, what activity everyone will be doing this period of time, when they will leave, etc. Split up the party time into periods where something new will happen every half hour or full hour. Knowing what you'll exactly do at the cupcake party will cause less stress and hassle when the party starts and continues., You may want to have the party inside if the weather is particularly cold, foggy, wet, extremely hot, and/or rainy. If the weather is mild, sunny, and slightly windy, it might be a good idea to set up the party outside. You may find it easier to set up the cupcake party inside since it's easier to decorate, but it's also a great idea to throw one outside, especially during the spring when the weather is not too hot or too cold.

Try to pick an environment most of the party guests would want. If most of the guests like the great outdoors, set it up outside, but if most of them like everything indoors, plan the party inside.

, Pin a dozen or more cupcake liners together and wrap it around a table or chair.You can also hang it up against a wall, door, or countertop for pretty looks. Try pinning together colorful cupcake liners, rather than the basic white, to make the decor more exciting and bright.

For a colorful look, pin together cupcakes liners that are made out of colorful foil.

, Set up a table and cover it with a tablecloth. You may want to place a poster that says 'Cupcake Booth' or 'Cupcake Station' and adding other unique designs. Make a batch of simple cupcakes such as chocolate or vanilla. Place different toppings and colorful sprinkles in clean art easels. Allow the party guests to decorate and top the cupcakes to their desires. This method works especially well for younger children since they will enjoy decorating and topping off their cupcakes.

You can also place cupcakes that are unfrosted and allow the party guests to frost them. Set up different frosting flavors such as strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, and/or lemon. Place butter knifes of frosting pipes and have others frost them.
Some toppings you can hand out include a variety of different colored or shaped sprinkles, mini chocolate chips, small candies such as Skittles or M&Ms, edible glitter, coconut flakes, chocolate shavings or curls, mini marshmallows, and/or berries.
Try making mini-sized cupcakes rather than them being regular-sized since these are easy and fast to decorate.
Place the cupcakes on a metal cupcake tray so others can spot and pick up the cupcakes with ease.

, Create a large poster that others can see right away when they arrive at your cupcake party. The party should be more of a 'fun greeting', welcoming others to your party. To decorate the poster and make it more catchy, use glitter, sparkles, sharp markers, fake sprinkles, craft pom pom balls, lace, and/or ribbon to help the poster become more visible to the guests. Ensure the poster has a cupcake to match with theme.

Keep the poster visible where all the party guests can see it once they arrive. You may want it placed on the doorway or on the wall.

, On colorful sheets of paper, stick or write down cupcake quotes or cute sayings. You can place these on chairs, on the table, the wall, the doorway, the entrance. Add extra designs on the quotes such as glitter, sparkles, sharp markers, fake sprinkles, craft pom pom balls, lace, and/or ribbon to help the poster become more visible to the guests. Some quotes and sayings you can use include:

O.C.D - Obsessive Cupcake Disorder
Get you cupcake on
It's cupcake'oclock
Life is full of questions. Cupcakes are the answer.
Keep calm and eat cupcakes.
Life is short, eat more cupcakes!
You are the icing on my cupcake.
You can't be sad when you're holding a cupcake.
Happiness is only a cupcake away.

, Create craft cupcakes by using paper, craft foam, tissue paper, and glue. Make variety of different colored craft cupcakes and place them all over the floor. You can also hang them up on the wall or doorway for decorative looks.

Stick a red pom pom ball on the craft cupcake for a more realist look.

, You can blow up balloons that are shaped into a cupcake or use normal balloons and tape them together to form a cupcake. Find balloons that match with the color theme of party. You may want to tape the balloons on the wall, leave them all over the floor, or leave them floating., Fake sprinkles resemble the real type of sprinkles and make colorful, cute decorations for the cupcake party. You may want to sprinkle them all over the floor, table, countertop, or entrance to enhance your cupcake party and make it look more fun.

If your cupcake party includes younger children you may want to use real sprinkles instead of fake to keep from choking hazards.

, When your guests arrive, welcome them in with a warm greeting and smile, and thank them for making it to your your cupcake party. First impressions always start when you meet, after all. Show your guests where they can sit and offer a cupcake or two as they wait for the rest of the guests. You may also want to offer your guests snacks, drinks, and a few appetizers., A cupcake creation contest can be a fun activity do with younger children. Blindfold your player's eyes and have them create a cupcake with toppings for only ten seconds. You'll want to choose cupcakes that can be a specific theme such as clown cupcakes, bunny cupcakes, snowmen cupcakes, spider cupcakes, or reindeer cupcakes., Using homemade or store-bought frosted cupcakes, have a cupcake fight. This is preferred to be done outside since it can make a mess. Have everyone throw cupcakes at each other and enjoy the fun. Avoid throwing cupcakes with toppings or decorations, only use plain, frosted ones., Have a few guests do a cupcake eating contest, eating as many as cupcakes as they can in only a minute. Offer basic flavors to the contest such as chocolate or vanilla that are frosted since these are the best for cupcake eating contests. Have others cheer on while the participants eat as many cupcakes as possible. Whoever eats the most wins!

Try leaving the cupcake liners on the cupcakes so you can count who ate the most cupcakes at the end.

, Children and teenagers may enjoy doing cupcake-themed crafts since they're fun to create and make., This activity must be done indoors and it's best to have a large kitchen with two or more ovens so everyone can bake. Have your guests split in three or four groups (depending on how many guests are there) and have them work together to make unique batch of cupcakes. You may want to hand out cupcake ingredients ahead of time and choose some special ingredients such as mint, gummy bears, marshmallows, candy bars, etc.

Have a few of the guests be the judges and allow them to choose their favorite cupcake. Whoever has the tastiest cupcake wins!
Make sure that all the ingredients and tools to make the cupcakes are in the kitchen so the participants are able to bake easily.

, This is mostly for older guests with experience in baking and fondant. Set out plenty of cupcakes, fondant, and fondant tools. Have the participants get blindfolded and in one minute, make a fondant design for their cupcake. The cupcake with the most neat fondant designs wins!

For younger children, you may allow them to fondant cupcakes with their eyes open. Children usually enjoy playing with exploring with baking tools, and will find it fun to create designs for their cupcakes.

, Young children will enjoy this. Hide about 30-40 mini-sized cupcakes either outside or indoors. Hand each participant a paper plate to place their cupcakes on, and in five minutes have everyone search for the cupcakes. Whoever finds the most cupcakes wins!, Prepare a variety of unique flavors and different types of cupcakes such as cookie dough cupcakes, bacon cupcakes, apple cupcakes, eggnog cupcakes, green tea cupcakes, lemon cupcakes, and lime cupcakes., Put on some music and have everyone dance as they eat a cupcake. This can be done either outside or inside as long as if you have some place to blast music and dance. You may consider having a disco ball on for an extra touch of light and color., Verbally thank all the party guests for taking the time to attend your cupcake party., Instead of throwing out any leftover cupcakes, hand them out to the party guests as a thank you for coming to your party., Find colorful plastic bags and place small treats such as stickers, mini toys, cupcake erasers, small snacks, and other goodies. Wrap the goody balls into a knot using a ribbon and hand them to others., Before everyone leaves you may want to consider handing out cupcake milkshakes to satisfy everyone's stomach. Place them into plastic colored cups and top it off with sprinkles. Stick striped straws that match with the cup's color., After the party it will most likely be a mess. Clean up the house and take off the decorations for another party. It was fun while it lasted."

, It is more important that you have an even layer than if it looks nice. The evenness of the top and sides will create an even base for the fondant.


Apply it to the top and rotate your cake to cover the angled surface.
If the cake is looking bare in places, add more frosting.

, Fondant should not sit out for long, or it will dry out., Then measure the angled height. You will need to double the height and add the width to find the diameter of your fondant circle.

If you would prefer smaller cupcakes, that's okay but the rising fingers won't be as realistic.


You can even use metal pie dishes to get the size right for these cupcakes.;
, Chocolate frosting is best because it looks like the dirt of the ground the zombies will be rising out of. Dust thickly using cocoa. This is just more ""soil"".

, Roll the marzipan to the same thickness and length as your own fingers (an easy guide to follow). Pinch them in a bit more though––zombies have been stuck in the ground for a while and things have shrunk. You're after a ""spindly"" look to these fingers. And don't forget the shorter, broader thumb for each hand.


Some fingers should be a little bent over, to give the impression of grasping their way out of the soil, while other fingers can be reaching for the sky.
Score some of the back of the fingers with a knife, to give the impression of knuckles.
Make as many fingers as needed for four fingers and one thumb per cupcake.

, This will help the fingers to stand upright when inserted into the cake.

, Make an edible glue paste using water to which you've added a little sugar. Or use plain frosting. Glue each almond flake to the top of each finger to make the fingernails.

Make two white circles in sugar paste. Place these on top of the chocolate frosting blobs.






Using frosting as glue, stick one brown M&M or chocolate drop to the center of the sugar paste circle to form the pupil. Do for each eye.






Using frosting as glue, stick on a cashew nut on as a beak. Place the large end of the cashew nut down between the two eyes, with the smaller end facing down the owl's face. For a cashew-free version, use a round candy for the beak and simply push in half, letting the other half poke out.






Add two small curled pieces of licorice or raisins above the eyes to form eyebrows. Position to form a wise expression!







, Make chocolate cupcakes. Then create the owl as follows:

Frost the cupcake with chocolate frosting.

",How to Make Rising Zombie Cupcakes2," These cupcakes can be normal size or large, depending on how large you intend to make the hand decorations.

, Dust with cocoa for the ""soil"".

, Note that this step may need to be done before making the cupcakes and frosting them, depending on how much time the hands need to dry before adding to the cupcakes. In most cases, it can't hurt to make these at least a day ahead. To make:


Roll enough balls for the amount of cupcakes (for example, a dozen balls).
Press the end of each ball to flatten into a cylinder.
Flatten one end into a rounded shape.
Carve out the thumb, followed by the fingers on the flattened round part.
Mold the fingers and thumb to look realistic. Use a knife and toothpick as molding aids.

Even if the cupcakes are being baked in cases/cups, placing the cases/cups inside the holes of a muffin pan is an excellent way to keep the shape of the cupcakes during baking.;
, There are several possibilities here:


Grease each baking pan hole with butter or oil. Use a pastry brush to distribute the fat evenly.
Spray with cooking oil spray.
Sprinkle a little flour over the individually greased holes. While optional, this provides added ease of removal over just greasing the holes. Tap the pan upside down to get rid of any excess flour.

, This is the latest innovation in cupcake baking holders, and there are many variations in shapes, including stars, hearts, and squares. These can be very useful when you're making themed cupcakes for a party, or if you're trying to build a cupcake cake. Silicone baking cups are usually available from quality cake supplies retailers. These cups do not require greasing or preparation, but do check what the manufacturer suggests.

, The easiest way to make batter is to follow a recipe specifically tailored to making cupcakes. There are many excellent cupcake compilations in book form, as well as cupcake baking sections in many cookbooks focused on baking. And the internet is absolutely brimming with cupcake recipes for you to experiment with, including wikiHow.


When making the batter, use proper measuring equipment to ensure accuracy in the amounts of ingredients.

, In this case, you simply shift the batter from your usual large cake pan and pour it in even lots across the cupcake cases/cups. You'll need to adjust the baking time to ensure the cakes don't burn though––most cupcakes take on average around 20 minutes to bake, although this depends on the batter used and the size of cupcake you're baking. You may need to experiment a little to see what works but a good rule is that when the cupcake begins to come away from the edges, it is usually baked.

, It is possible to change the flavor of the batter with what are known as ""mix-ins"". These additions must be small in quantity, otherwise you change the nature of the batter, which may impact the quality, baking time and success of the cupcake. Typical mix-ins include:


Flavoring: Use extracts/essences, juice or cocoa powder to change flavor.
Sprinkles: These add crunch and flavor to cupcakes.
Fruit pulp: A little fruit pulp can change flavor and texture; be careful though, as this can change the whole nature of the cupcake and may spoil it unless the recipe calls for it.
Chocolate: A few chocolate chips or grated chocolate can add some delicious flavor.
Marshmallows: Chopped marshmallows can be added if you like their flavor and texture.

, Use a teaspoon or a dessertspoon to transfer the batter from the mixing bowl into each cupcake case/cup. Aim for an even distribution across all of the cupcake holders.

, This involves filling a pastry piping bag with the cupcake batter and piping it into each cupcake case/cup. It is ideal for smaller or miniature cupcakes, where control over the batter is essential (such as to avoid unsightly spills, etc.). This method is the best way if you want to avoid any drips.


If you don't have a pastry bag, just use a resealable plastic bag and snip out one corner.

, Some companies manufacture special batter scoops for transferring the batter from the bowl to the cases/cups. It's not really necessary but if you like kitchen gadgets, it might be something you'd like to add to your collection. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for use.

, There is no reason you can't continuously use the same batter for cupcakes (say, plain vanilla) but keep on changing the flavor profile of the cupcakes by continuously changing the icing flavor. Typical flavorings include:


Chocolate: Usually sourced from adding cocoa powder; for a coffee variant, a little cold strong black coffee can be used (or combine both chocolate and coffee to make a mocha)
Juice: Add drops of citrus juice (lemon, orange, grapefruit, etc.)
Make fruit flavored cupcakes. Using fruit pulp, pieces or flavoring extract in cupcakes is a nice way to make the cupcake fruity. Occasionally, it's a very useful way to get rid of overripe fruit. Two of the most common fruity styles of cupcakes are strawberry cupcakes and banana cupcakes. Other fruit flavors compatible with cupcakes include orange, lemon, blueberry, and apple.
Extract or essence: There are ample flavors available in the form of extract or essence, just choose the ones you like the most. Always add cautiously, then taste and increase the amount if needed.

, Once again, there are many choices, all depending on what you need by way of appearance and texture. A few suggestions include:


Plain icing/frosting: Simply flavor standard package icing sugar/confectioners sugar and spread on the cake as usual
Glacé/glazed icing: Make richer icing by adding butter to the mixture (along with any flavoring)
Butter cream icing/frosting: A deeper and richer form of icing; the texture of this can be used imaginatively to create fur, fleece or hair for animal-themed cupcakes
Cream cheese icing/frosting: Very rich and tasty
Dusted icing/confectioners sugar: Simple but effective for some cupcakes, looks especially good against chocolate backgrounds and on butterfly cupcakes
Glazed fruit: A bit trickier but perhaps good for a more elegant occasion
Melted chocolate: Decadent but delicious, white, milk and dark chocolate varieties lend themselves well to this topping
Jelly/jam/preserves: A simple but lovely way to decorate cupcakes is to use a cookie cutter to remove a small shape from the top of the cupcake (such as a heart), then refill it with jelly or jam. Finish it off with a dusting of icing/confectioners sugar for an elegant look.

, Here, the limit is your imagination but in case that needs a nudge, here are a few suggestions for decorating a cupcake:


Simply frosted: Just add the icing/frosting of choice and let it set. Make a swirl if it's icing/frosting that is compatible with this.
Top with candies or sweets: This is an easy option but is always effective and encourages fast consumption. And candies can be cut, rolled, turned into facial features, built upon, etc., to make a wide range of interesting designs
Add edible flowers: This can make a pretty topping suitable for afternoon tea in the garden
Try fruit: If the cupcakes are to be eaten quickly, a halved strawberry or a bunch of berries on the top makes them refreshing and appealing
Use sugar art: Whether you're into crafting figurines from sugar paste or you like making toffee lace, sugar can be used in many ways to make a lovely cupcake decoration
Add chocolate: Chocolate is always a good standby when in doubt. It can be grated, sprinkled, dotted, blobbed, etc., or you can add intact chocolate pieces for a tempting feature.

, A simple decorative element is to color the icing/frosting. This can be to match a flavor, a party theme, or personal preference. Use food coloring suitable to the icing/frosting. Types of colorings include:


Liquid coloring: This is a standard form of coloring available from most supermarkets; it only takes a drop or two to spread color and you can always increase it for a more intense color.
Gel, powder and paste colorings: These are more sophisticated forms of coloring. They will have a wide variety of different shades to choose from. Pastes tend to be more expensive but are easy to blend and create very good quality colors. They also last longer. Powdered colorings have metallic shades, allowing you to color the cupcakes with golds, silvers, etc.
Edible glitter: This is glitter for baked goods and it is much loved by bakers of fairy-themed cupcakes!

, If your recipe suggests otherwise, follow its instructions; otherwise, this is a standard rule.


The richer and fruitier the cupcake, the more likely the recipe will suggest to let it cool in the pan.
Dense mixtures, such as chocolate mud cake, will need about 10 minutes cooling in the pan before moving.

, Let cool. They can be iced/frosted once cool.

, This can be as simple as arranging them on a small plate and helping yourself to them or as elaborate as turning them into a wedding cake. A tiered cake stand is a very popular way of presenting cupcakes, as it looks pretty and it is a good opportunity to show off your well-decorated cupcakes on each level of the stand. Cupcakes can also be arranged in the shape of an animal (such as a bunny for Easter, a caterpillar for a child's party) or they can form a birthday age number or a smiley face; all you need is a large enough plate or background to achieve this.


You will find instructions for making a cupcake stand here.

, Vanilla cupcakes might seem plain but they form the basis for many possibilities, making them very useful for your cupcake baking adventures. Using a simple vanilla cupcake, you can add many flavors, decorative features and even shape changes, and nobody will ever think this cupcake is boring. For example, the dainty party treat butterfly cupcakes is often based on vanilla cupcakes.

, This is other most common type of cupcake. It has many variations, such as chocolate chip cupcakes, banana chocolate cupcakes and peanut butter and chocolate chip cupcakes. As with vanilla cupcakes, these can also be turned into butterfly cupcakes and can handle a wide range of different flavorings.

, For those unable to tolerate wheat products, there is still a way to enjoy your cupcake. Such cupcakes substitute wheat flour with suitable flour varieties instead; all you need to do is follow the instructions that will work for alternative flours, such as rice. Some suggestions include:



Plain gluten free cupcakes;

Gluten free carrot cupcakes; and

Gluten free apple blueberry cupcakes.

, Some people are not able or willing to eat eggs or dairy. In this case, vegan cupcakes are ideal. Egg-free cupcakes are also useful when you've run out of eggs.

, Cupcakes don't need to be sweet. They can be made from savory items, such as tomato and basil or sweetcorn and ham. These sorts of cupcakes are suitable for eating with soup or just because you'd prefer a savory cupcake option.

, If you really want to spice up the cupcakes, try making cupcakes with alcohol such as Tia Maria, champagne or rum. This can also be a good way to use up the last dregs of the bottle; for example, see How to make champagne cupcakes.

, Use store-bought or homemade frosting, as preferred. Dip your cupcake in the frosting, turning it so it comes out with a tiny point at the top. Dip it the exact same way in a shallow bowl of sprinkles. Be modest with the amount of sprinkles added, to create a cleaner look.


It's always good to heat up any store-bought frosting for about 15 seconds in the microwave to get it a little more liquids in order for the sprinkles to stay.
If you prefer, pipe the icing onto the cupcakes rather than dipping them.

, The water will work as an adhesive for the sprinkles. Do this on both sides.

Pick your mug.,
Create the cake mix.,
Crack an egg into the mug.,
Add butter.,
Add a tablespoon or two of chocolate chips (optional).,
Mix it all together.,
Bake the mug cake.,
Let the cake sit.,
Enjoy!",How to Make Cake in the Microwave1," You can use any type of mug for the cake. A larger deeper mug will create a softer moister cake, while a smaller shallower mug will create a firmer cake.;
, Add two tablespoons of brown sugar or honey to the mug. Add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and then 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of flour.









It is okay to use regular flour if you don't have self-rising, but the cake will end up more like a brownie in texture.

, The great thing about mug cakes is that there is virtually no cleanup; just toss the shell in the compost or trash.








, Soften a stick of butter on the countertop and scoop a tablespoon into the mug. You can use salted or unsalted butter, or margarine.

, Adding the chocolate chips will create a chocolate flavored mug cake. If you prefer a vanilla cake, you can add an additional tablespoon of vanilla extract instead.

, Use a spoon to stir up the contents of the mug. Stir until the chocolate chips are folded in, or all the contents are combined. Don’t worry about the top edges of the mug getting messy, your cake will rise up in the microwave anyway.








, Put the mug in the microwave for 50 seconds on full power. After 50 seconds, check to see if the cake is baked by sticking a toothpick straight down into the center. The toothpick should come out clean. If there is gooey cake residue on the toothpick, put the mug back in the microwave and cook it in 30 second increments until done.Take care not to overcook. If you microwave the cake for too long, it will dry out. It shouldn't need to be cooked for any longer than 2 minutes.
Don’t worry about the toothpick creating a hole in the cake, you won't be able to see that when you frost it later.

, Microwaves often don’t distribute heat as evenly as ovens do. Let the cake sit on the counter for 1-2 minutes after baking, giving time for the heat to distribute throughout the mug.

, Take a spoon and dig in. If you'd like, frost and decorate the cake first.


Be careful when removing the mug from the microwave. Use a hot pot holder or a towel to lift it out. It will probably be too hot to grab.

, This is important––never use a metal baking pan for microwave baking.









A shallow dish will probably give you the best results.

, Cook the cake in the microwave for 3-4 minutes on full power. The cake will bubble and puff in the microwave just as it would in the oven.

Cool the cake fully before trying to put on icing, or the icing will melt.
Make sufficient frosting. It would be better to end up with leftover frosting than to run out before you are done decorating.

, Have the frosting at room temperature. Use a long rubber spatula or spoon to spread frosting over the surface of your cake.








, Slice fresh strawberries thinly and place them on top of the frosting in a pattern or randomly. Brush with seedless jam.You can substitute the strawberries for fresh mango, banana, or any softer fruit you desire.
If you're using fresh fruit, add it at the last minute. If the fruit is wet, it could cause the frosting to move or melt slightly., Sprinkles are a fun way to make a colorful confetti cake. You can also add a pinch of sprinkles to your cake batter before baking.

, Sprinkle a handful of mini marshmallows on top of the cake for a super sweet addition. Dust the marshmallows with a pinch of powdered sugar.

, If you want a chocolate cake with some crunch, break your favorite candy bar into small pieces and drop some on top of the cake. You could sprinkle chocolate chips instead.

, Coconut can be baked in a cake or used to decorate it too. It's a healthier version than sugar sprinkles or sweets and looks great on a cake. Cover the cake in a light frosting and then press coconut into it.


Coconut is so light it can be added to many cakes, from lighter flavors like vanilla and lemon to richer cakes like chocolate and carrot cake.

, You can cover the whole cake, top to bottom or you can sprinkle some on top of the cake.


If you're making a chocolate cake, sweet pecans be a good match.

Sponge cakes are time sensitive cakes, so you don't want to measure ingredients or wait on the oven to heat while you're in the middle of mixing.Measure all the ingredients and have them nearby before you begin.


Sift the baking powder into the flour before you begin. Set aside until needed.
Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190°C.)
Line the pan with butter before beginning. As an alternative to butter or cooking spray, use parchment paper. Parchment paper is a grease and moisture-resistant paper. When using parchment paper, no butter or cooking sprays are needed because cakes, cookies, or other baked goods won't stick. It also helps with clean up, since you will have no leftover batter to wash.If using parchment paper, cut a piece of paper into the shape and size of the bottom of the pan. You can also line the sides of the pan with paper, or you can use cooking spray or butter.;
, Using an electric mixer, beat well. You can use a standard hand mixer or a standing mixer.


Make sure the eggs are at room temperature when you cook. Take the eggs out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before you begin to make sure they are room temperature.Do not leave them out of the refrigerator much longer than 30 minutes.

, Using the hand mixer, beat well until the mixture is a pale yellow color and creamy in texture.You can also mix the sugar and eggs together with an electric whisk attachment.

, Beat into the mixture. Slowly sift the flour into the mixture, beating the batter until smooth.


Sifting all-purpose flour creates an airy cake, which is what you want to do for a sponge cake.Sift the flour as you measure it when you begin, then sift the flour into the measure before you mix.
The baking powder is added when using all-purpose flour because this type of flour has no leavening agent added to the flour, unlike self-rising flour., You can use a round pan, an angel food cake pan, or any other type of pan. Bake at 375ºF for 30 to 35 minutes.

, Every oven is different, so as the cake approaches 30 to 35 minutes, you need to begin watching it. Check to see if the cake is done by gently touching with your finger. It will spring back if it is done. If you are still unsure, insert a toothpick or fork into the center of the cake. If the cake is clean, it is done., After removing from the oven, let it cool for 15 to 20 minutes before removing cake from the cake pan. If you used butter or spray on the pan, loosen around the edges with a knife, then flip cake and place on a serving plate

Sift the flour into the yolk.,
Fold the egg whites into the batter.,
Bake for 30 minutes.,
Let cake cool.",How to Make an Easy Sponge Cake2," Before you can begin working on the batter, you must get all of your ingredients ready. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Make sure your counter space is clear so you have room to work.


Grease your pan with butter or spray. If you don't want to use butter or spray, line the pan with parchment paper.
Sponge cakes can be time sensitive, so you don't want to waste any time sifting or preheating the oven., Prepare two bowls: one for the whites, and one for the yolks. Break the egg open over your hand. Separate your fingers just enough so the whites drip through, while the yolk remains in your hand. If the yolk starts to break, close your fingers to keep the yolk and whites separate.Place the yolk in the other bowl.


Try other egg separating methods here: 6 Ways To Separate An Egg.
This should be done half an hour before you begin mixing. The eggs are easier to separate when they are cold because both parts seem to hold their shape better.Leave the eggs out for half an hour so they can warm to room temperature before starting the recipe.
Make sure your hands are clean and all soap and oil have been removed. The smallest amount of grease, oil, or egg yolks can cause the whites not to stiffen., When measuring the flour, sift it into the measuring cup. This aerates the flour, making it fluffier - a must for a sponge cake.Next, sift the salt and the baking powder with the flour. You may also whisk the salt and baking powder into the flour instead. Set aside for now.

, Place the egg yolks into a bowl and beat on high with an electric mixer. Gradually, add 2/3 cup of sugar into the bowl as you mix. Beat until they are thick, fluffy, and lemon-colored - approximately 5 minutes. When they are ready, the batter will fall into the bowl in a ribbon.Next, beat in the vanilla extract, water, and lemon zest.
Zest is the flavorful outer part of the rind of citrus fruit, such as lemons, oranges, and limes. On a lemon, this is the yellow part; on an orange, this is the orange part of the rind. To zest, use a lemon zester, lemon (or cheese) grater, a vegetable peeler, or a small knife. Make sure to only remove the top layer. If you have removed the white skin, you have gone too deep.Make sure to beat the yolks in a bowl large enough to add the flour later.

, In a clean bowl, whip the egg whites on medium to high speed until the egg whites are foamy, then add the cream of tartar and continue whipping the whites until soft peaks form. Slowly, add 1/3 cup of sugar as you continue whipping the egg whites. Whip until they are shiny and form stiff peaks.The peaks will stand up straight when the mixer is lifted.


Do not overbeat the eggs. If the egg whites start to divide and separate, or look dull instead of shiny and glossy, they are over beaten., Sift about 1/3 of the flour into the yolk mixture, and then gently and quickly fold the flour into the yolk. Add 1/3 more flour, fold, and then sift the final 1/3 of the flour into the batter, and then fold.


To fold, start at the back of the bowl and cut into the batter with a spatula until it hits the bottom of the bowl. Lift the batter over the top of the top ingredient. Then, turn the bowl a quarter of a turn and repeat. Make sure to slide the spatula along the sides. This method will gently mix the ingredients together., After the flour has been folded into the batter, fold a little of the whites into the batter. This will lighten the batter. Then, add the remaining whites, folding until everything is mixed together.


Do not over mix. This can deflate the cake and make it tough.

, Place batter into a pan. Use a spatula to level the top of the cake. Bake for approximately 30 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C) in the center rack. Watch the cake carefully when it is approaching the 30 minute mark since every oven is different. Test to see if the cake is done by placing a toothpick or fork into the center. If it comes out clean, it is done.

, After removing the cake from the oven, let it cool for almost an hour. Then use a spatula or a knife to separate the cake from the sides of the pan, and then remove onto a serving platter."

",How to Make a Cupcake Cone," Each well gets one ice cream cone. If you cannot fit all of your ice cream cones into the muffin tin, set them aside; you can bake them in a separate batch.


Some bakers recommend cutting holes into the bottom of a aluminum foil baking tin, turning the tin upside down, and sticking the cones into the holes.
Use ice cream cones that have a flat bottom as opposed to the ones that are cone-shaped; they will stand up better.;
, Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl, then add the baking powder and salt. Stir everything together to combine, then set aside.

, Cut the butter into small cubes first, then put it into a separate bowl. Beat the butter until it turns smooth using an electric mixer on low speed. This will take about 2 minutes.You can use an electric stand mixer, a handheld better, or even a food processor to do this.

, Keep beating until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl often to ensure that everything mixes in together evenly., Beat in the vanilla extract first. Next, add just one egg, and beat until combined. Add your second egg, and beat again. Make sure that there are no streaks of egg yolk left.

, Add one-fourth of the flour mixture into the creamed butter, and stir well. Pour in one-fourth of the milk, and stir again. Keep doing this until you have no more milk or flour left.You can do this step with a rubber spatula or using the medium-low speed setting on your beater.

,, If you have any leftover cones and batter, fill them up with batter, and bake them for another 18 minutes or so.

, This is very important. If you frost them too soon, the frosting will melt.

, Cut the butter into small cubes first, then place it into a mixing bowl. Beat the butter on medium speed using an electric mixer until it turns light and fluffy, about 6 minutes.

, Beat everything together on low speed first to combine, and then on medium speed for 6 to 7 minutes, or until the frosting is light and fluffy.

, Press down on the scoop slightly to seal the frosting against the cupcake. This will make the cupcakes look even more like ice cream!Alternatively, you could fit a piping bag fitted with a star-shaped decorator's tip with the frosting, and pipe the frosting onto the cupcake. Start the from the outer edge, and squeeze the bag harder as you reach the center., To keep them from tipping over, place them all back into the muffin pan. Once the frosting has set, you can start preparing the chocolate ganache topping.

, Pour the heavy cream into a small saucepan, then place the saucepan on the stove. Set the heat to medium, and wait until the heavy cream comes just short of boiling.

, Place the chocolate chips into a heat-safe bowl, then pour the hot, heavy cream over them. You can use milk chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate chips for this.

, If you don't have any foil on hand, you can use a plate instead.

, Lift the foil away, and briskly whisk the two together until everything is smooth. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often.

, If you piped the frosting on instead, you can skip this step and more on to the next; you'd want to use the ganache before it starts to thicken.

, If you piped the frosting on, pour the ganache on instead so that you don't ruin the piped texture.

, You can also use crushed nuts instead of sprinkles.

, This will allow the ganache to set up. Once the time is up, you can serve the cupcakes!

If so, place one muffin liner in each spot of the muffin pan. If you don't want to use liners, spray both pans with nonstick baking spray so your cupcakes come out easily after baking.Consider using liners if you'll be serving the cupcakes at a party or to a group. The liners ensure that you won't be touching the sides of the cupcakes when you're frosting them.;
, Place your dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and whisk them to combine them. Once they're combined, set them aside. You'll need to mix:1⅔ cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa (sifted)
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda

, Set 7 tablespoons (100 grams) of soft salted butter and 1 cup (200 grams) of granulated sugar into a large mixing bowl. Cream them together using your stand mixer or using a handheld mixer. Beat the butter and sugar for several minutes until the mixture is soft and fluffy. Add in 1 heaping tablespoon of red food coloring paste and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat to combine the color and flavoring.If you prefer to leave out the food coloring, your cupcakes will only have a slightly reddish hue. You may be able to find all-natural food coloring at some specialty grocery stores.

, Turn your mixer on to low and add 1/3 of your dry mixture. Once it's combined with the sweetened butter mixture, add an egg and stir until it's incorporated. Add another 1/3 of the dry mixture and beat until it's just combined. Add the last egg and stir till it's incorporated. Add the final 1/3 of the dry mixture and stir till it's just combined.If your stand mixer has a splash guard or shield, consider placing it on the bowl. This will prevent the dry mixture from flying out. Or you can just make sure that your mixer is set to low.

, Beat in ¾ cup of buttermilk and 1 teaspoon of cider vinegar till they're fully mixed into your batter. Your batter is now ready to divide into your two prepared muffin pans. You may want to start by filling them all halfway and then go back and add more batter so they're equal.Try using a cookie scoop to scoop the batter into your liners. If you don't have a cookie scoop, you might want to use a large measuring cup to scoop out the batter.

, If your oven has heated to 325 degrees F, pop the cupcakes into the oven and bake them for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, pull them out to see if they're done. Poke a toothpick or cake tester into the middle of a cupcake. If it's done, the toothpick should come away clean. If not, bake the cupcakes for a few more minutes before testing again.Once your cupcakes are out of the oven, let them cool on a wire rack until they're no longer warm.

, Place 8 ounces of cream cheese, 8 ounces of butter, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl. If you have a stand mixer, set the bowl in the mixer with a beater attachment or you can just use a handheld mixer. Beat the ingredients on medium speed until they're completely combined and smooth. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.If your ingredients aren't soft or at room temperature, the frosting will have lumps. You'll know your cream cheese and butter are soft enough if you press them and you can see an imprint of your finger.

, Turn the mixer down to low speed and gradually sprinkle in 2 cups of powdered sugar. Keep the mixer going until all the sugar is added and combined with the butter/cream cheese mixture. Your cream cheese frosting should be light, fluffy and ready to use.Powdered sugar is also called confectioners' sugar. It's important to sift it before you add it to the butter to prevent lumps from forming.
If you want a firmer frosting, you can add extra powdered sugar, beating in about 1/4 cup at a time.

, Once your cupcakes are completely cool, cover them with your cream cheese frosting. Use a small offset spatula or a spoon to dollop the frosting onto each cupcake. Spread the frosting around the top of each cupcake so that it's evenly covered.


If you frost the cupcakes while they're still warm, the frosting will slide off the cupcake or melt into the cupcake. This is why it's important to let them cool first.

, You can serve the frosted cupcakes immediately or garnish them before serving. Consider sprinkling them with red sprinkles or a dusting of cocoa powder. If you plan on storing the cupcakes to serve later, store them in an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to one day.If you know you won't be serving these the same day, it's best to make the cupcakes and frosting without topping them. Refrigerate the cupcakes and frosting separately. Then you can take them out and frost them an hour or two before serving.

Follow the cake recipe carefully.,
Keep these ""rules of substitution"" in mind when working out the readiness of a cake:

For a cake that you have substituted wet ingredients for dry (for instance, adding berries, fruit pieces, honey etc.,
Wait before opening the oven door.,
Remove the baked cake.,
Try one of two methods to test the cake:


The implement method: Take a fork, a cocktail stick, a skewer or a toothpick.,
Check the surface of the item used to poke the cake.,
Place the cake back in the oven quickly if it has not been baked adequately.",How to Test a Cake to See if it is Done," If you follow the recipe properly and use the cooking temperatures and times it has suggested, you have a greater chance of the cake being ready when the recipe says it should be. However, in reality, we all have different oven types (convection ovens change cooking times) and often we make substitutions to cakes that change the essence of the recipe and can alter the cooking times. So, it is handy to know how to test a cake for readiness.

,), the cooking time will be longer.
For a cake that you have doubled or tripled the ingredients, the cake will need to cook for a longer time and at a lower temperature.

, One of the major errors in making a cake is to open the oven too soon and have the cake sink on you because it is exposed to the temperature difference before it has had a proper chance to rise.
, Use oven mitts to remove the cake from the oven.
, Use one of these items to poke the top of the cake slightly in the middle.

The hand method: Take your hand and spread it out. Palm face down, gently press your clean hand on the top of the cake. A firm top that does not give way under pressure and springs back means a ready cake. If the cake gives, it must cook more. This method is tricky and should only be used by advanced cooks - the cake may sag if pressed too hard and it must be performed very quickly as the cake is hot!

, You will know whether or not the cake is ready by seeing:

If it comes up with some wet batter, crumbs or stickiness on it, the cake needs to bake some more.
If it is dry, then the cake is done.

, Otherwise, leave your cake out to cool for 5 -10 minutes in the pan and then transfer to a rack to cool before adding frosting (icing) to the top. Or, if you cannot wait, eat some warm cake with butter - that is always delicious.

Verify that the recipe you are making requires for the pan to be greased.,
Prepare baking pans prior to mixing your ingredients.,
Select a lubricant to coat the pan with.,
Line the grease-coated pan.",How to Prepare a Cake Pan," Some recipes, like angel food cake or some cookies that are high in oil content, call for ungreased pans instead. Greasing pans for these recipes will have disappointing results.;
, Many cake recipes, especially those calling for baking soda or baking powder and those with beaten egg whites, need to be baked as soon as they are mixed. Taking a moment to prepare your cake pan prior to mixing the recipe's ingredients, instead of after, will not only guarantee a more successful release from the pan but also a superior cake.

, Apply the chosen grease to the pan accordingly.

Coat the pan with butter. Using butter on the interior surface of the pan will result in a darker crust that has a hint of butter flavor. Either melt the butter and apply it to the pan using a pastry brush or hold a slice of butter and rub it over the surface. You can use wax paper to hold on to the butter. You can also put your hand into a plastic sandwich bag to hold the butter.






Spray the pan with a vegetable oil spray. Using spray to coat the pan is a fast solution to preparing your baking pan. This method applies a very light coating of oil to the surface of the pan which is ideal for those looking for healthier alternatives when baking.






Use shortening to coat your baking pan. Preparing your baking pan using shortening does not transfer any flavor to the baked goods you are making. Use wax paper, a paper towel or a sandwich bag to apply shortening to the bottom and sides of the pan.







,

Flour the pan. Place a couple tablespoons of flour in the pan. Gently shake the pan to disperse the flour over the bottom. Continue shaking the pan, tilting it to cover the sides with flour as well. Tip the pan over, and tap it or gently bump it on the palm of your opposite hand to clear the pan of any excess flour. This method is ideal for thin or very sweet batters.






Opt to use cocoa for chocolate baked goods. Apply a mixture of 1 part flour to 2 parts cocoa to the pan by placing the powder in a mesh sieve and sprinkling it over the pan's surface. Then proceed with coating as you would if you were just using flour. The cocoa will enhance the chocolate flavor of the finished baked good and eliminates unsightly white powder that can remain on the finished baked good if just flour is used.






Cover the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. To cover the pan with parchment paper, place the pan on top of a piece of parchment paper that is larger than the pan. Using a pencil, trace the base of the pan onto the paper. Cut out the shape just inside the line with scissors. Place the cut out into the bottom of the greased pan.






Create a bed of foil so baked goods can be easily removed from the pan. Using lengths of foil longer than the pan, line the inside of the pan with the foil, going beyond the ends and sides. You will use these extra flaps once the food has been baked, to pull on, releasing the baked goods from the pan. Spray the foil prior to filling the pan to ensure the food does not stick to it.

Prepare the foil covering in advance.,
Try replacing oil with yogurt.,
Pull the oven rack out and cover the cake quickly.,
Try using a microwave.",How to Make a Moister Christmas Cake," The foil helps to reduce evaporation of the steam produced by the cake as it cooks and keeps more moisture in.;
, The layer should cover the cake but it doesn't need to seal completely - just a tab on each side perhaps to make sure it doesn't fly off.

, It makes the cake very moist, and also reduces calories and fat.

, This will help avoid any sinking or cooling down of the cake. Push the cake back in quickly.

, This is a fairly unconventional solution and one that won't please a number of cooks but if you're willing to give it a try, this is a great way to keep the moisture in because the cake cooks faster than it has time to dry out. You will need to know the right baking time to use this method.

, Layer cakes often bring together complimentary cake and frosting flavors. You may want to combine lemon with vanilla or chocolate with raspberries.


Use butter, eggs and water at room temperature. Set the on the counter for about an hour before baking., If you are just learning how to assemble a layer cake, save some time by buying cake mix and pre-made frosting.

, Take it out of the oven for 10 minutes. Then, loosen it from the pan and place the cake on a baking rack to cool all the way.


Test the cake by inserting a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean, your cake is done.

,, Place them in the refrigerator or freezer overnight. If you are short on time, do it for at least a few hours.


A cold cake is easier to frost., You can trace the cardboard and cut it out or buy a round cake platform at a kitchen or craft store.


If you don’t want to use a platform, slide pieces of parchment paper underneath the cake before you frost to cover your cake stand. Remove them before you serve the cake.

, Any thick, buttercream-like frosting should work. To make a quick version at home, mix together three cups (360g) powdered sugar and one cup softened butter.


Add one tsp. (5ml) vanilla extract and one to two tbsp. (15 to 30ml) of whipping cream once the mixture has been creamed. Beat in your mixer on medium speed for five minutes altogether.,, Unwrap the first one. Set it atop the platform.

, Make sure they are no higher than your shortest cooked cake. If the batter was not poured to exactly the same amount, one cake may be shorter than the others.


You can also cut each cake into two cakes if they are thick enough.

, You may want to measure and mark the cake with a frosting dab if you aren’t confident you can cut in a straight line. Ensure saw through the domed top of the cake very gently.


If your cakes came out of the oven very level, you can skip the step of cutting them flat.

, Use an offset spatula and start with a big clump of frosting in the middle. Work the frosting out just past the sides of the layer.

Spice up the batter.,
Add dry pudding mix.,
Enhance the overall flavor with richer ingredients.,
Pour syrup over the cake.,
Spread filling in between layers.,
Change the frosting.,
Experiment with different combinations.,
Research your idea.,
Learn about each ingredient.,
Build the flavor gradually.,
Evaluate the finished cake.",How to Flavor Cake," Liquid extracts and flavorings are one of the easiest ways to alter the taste of cake batter since they generally have little effect on the other ingredients, moisture level, or density of the cake.Extracts are more concentrated than flavorings, so you should generally use less extract than flavoring. Since extracts are more concentrated, however, they typically create richer, more natural tastes.
To experiment with different extracts, consider starting with a cake recipe that already contains vanilla extract. Replace half of the vanilla with the extract of your choice to introduce a subtle hint of the new flavor.;
, Adding fresh ingredients to the batter can produce an even stronger taste than using the equivalent extract. Some ingredients will blend into the batter, but others will retain their form even after the cake bakes.


Melted chocolate is a popular choice, but it can be a difficult ingredient to work with. Since the ingredient is so heavy, you will likely need to balance the extra weight with additional beaten eggs or other raising agents.
Consider scraping out the inside of a vanilla bean instead of using vanilla extract. As a general rule, 2 inches (5 cm) of vanilla bean equals 1 tsp (5 ml) of vanilla extract.
Chopped ingredients, like nuts, fruits, or large pieces of chocolate can be used and typically retain their form instead of mixing into the batter. Note that fruit can make cakes more moist, however, since the juices tend to seep into the batter as it bakes.

, Cocoa powder is essentially the dehydrated form of cocoa solids. You can add it to white or yellow cakes to create a strong chocolate flavor or mix it into chocolate cakes to further intensify the taste.


There are two types of unsweetened cocoa powder: Dutch-processed and natural. The former has a lighter flavor and should be used in cake recipes calling for baking powder or other acidic ingredients. The latter can have an intense, bitter taste and should be used in recipes calling for baking soda., For cake mixes and recipes including water, switch out part or all of the water for another liquid that can introduce more flavor to the cake.You can generally swap out half to all of the water when using dairy-based or water-based liquids, including brewed coffee, milk, and juice.
For alcohol-based liquids, however, you should replace no more than half of the water with your liquor or liqueur of choice.

, Certain spices can add new flavors to the cake or enhance flavors currently used. Some spices are more potent than others, though, so you'll need to vary the amount depending on which one you choose.


Popular choices include cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. Of these additions, only cinnamon should be used in relatively large quantities (up to 2 or 3 tsp ). The others tend to be more potent when used in excess.

, Dry instant pudding can add both moisture and flavor to a cake, and it's an especially good option to use when you want to flavor a boxed cake mix.


Typically, you should use one small box of instant pudding in the flavor of your choice for one standard box of dry cake mix. You may also wish to add an extra egg to help balance out the extra weight since eggs can serve as raising agents.

, If you want to produce a richer taste instead of completing altering the flavor profile, switch blander ingredients for more flavorful options or increase the amount you use.


Instead of using vegetable oil, use equal amounts of melted butter since butter has a richer taste. Depending on the recipe, you might be able to add as much as twice the amount originally called for, but doing so will also introduce more moisture into the cake.
Consider cracking an extra egg into the batter. Eggs are another ingredient capable of enhancing the tastes already in your batter, and adding an extra egg can also make cakes fluffier.

, As soon as you pull the cake out of your oven, use a toothpick to poke small holes into the surface and pour or spread hot fruit syrup over the entire top.The resulting cake will retain the flavor of the syrup while also becoming more moist.
For a simple fruit syrup, consider mixing 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of any fruit jam or preserve with enough hot water to dissolve it into liquid form.

, If you baked a layer cake, you can add more flavor to each bite by spreading an interesting filling between each separate layer.Choose a filling that can hold its form beneath the weight of the cake's upper layers. Buttercream icing is popular, but jams, canned pie fillings, and canned cake fillings also work well.
For most fillings, you should spread an even 1/4 inch (6 mm) over the top surface of the bottom layer before placing the next layer over it.

, A change in frosting is another easy way to change the overall flavor profile of your cake. You can use prepackaged jars of frosting or mix your own frosting.


Like cake batter, you can also alter the taste of the frosting using extracts or liquid flavorings. Add the ingredient in small amounts, however, to prevent the frosting from becoming too runny. Moreover, you should also opt for artificial extracts or naturally clear flavorings if you do not wish to tint the final color of the frosting.

, Be bold, and don't be afraid to try flavors and flavor combinations you haven't run across before. Departing from the recipe as it's written requires a little culinary courage, but the end result can be well worth it.Look for inspiration everywhere and jot down the ideas as they come. Inspiration often strikes when you eat other foods, learn about unique ingredients, or hear about intriguing cakes. Additionally, your sense of smell is connected to your sense of taste, so don't dismiss ideas derived from candles or other pleasant scents, either.
Experimenting when the pressure is low can also embolden you. Avoid testing new ideas when baking cakes for special occasions and consider halving the recipe to create less waste if your test fails.

, If you have an idea but are too scared to take the plunge, do some research before you step into the kitchen. Search on Pinterest or popular recipe websites to determine if anyone else may have combined similar flavors, then read about the methods others have used when doing so.


Instead of looking for an exact recipe to duplicate, focus on the proportions and ingredients used to produce certain flavors. Doing so can give you an idea of how much to add of which ingredients when you start experimenting with your own cake recipe.

, Baking involves chemistry, and many ingredients you might use to add flavor will also affect the cake in other ways. Before using any particular ingredient, find out if it might impact the cake's density, texture, or ability to rise.


Counteract unwanted effects by adding other ingredients to balance them out. For instance, cocoa powder adds weight and dryness to a cake, so you would need to add more of your raising agent and more moisture to neutralize these effects.
Note that you may also need to learn about some of basic ingredients; otherwise, you won't know which ingredients to use when balancing out the negative effects of your flavor additions.

, Since you'll likely end up working with some unfamiliar ingredients and flavor combinations, it's best to start adding new flavors in small amounts.


This is especially important when you add flavors directly to the batter. You can easily build up weak flavors, but if you accidentally add too much of any one taste, you won't be able to cut that flavor back down.
After adding each new flavoring ingredient, taste the batter and determine if it needs more. When adding multiple flavors, ask yourself if the flavors balance each other or if you need to alter the proportions further.

, The baking process can tone down some flavors while drawing out other tastes, so the finished cake may not taste exactly like the batter. For that reason, you'll need to continue evaluating the taste and balance of flavors while biting into the finished cake.


Be your own critic. Ask yourself if the cake tastes the way you hope it would, and if it doesn't, try to figure out the cause. The flavor combination may not work at all, but oftentimes, the taste can improve with some alterations. It's possible that you added too much or too little of one ingredient. Alternatively, you might decide to swap out one ingredient for another—for instance, melted chocolate for cocoa powder.
Ask others to critique your cake, as well. Since they didn't bake it, they may not be able to help you alter the recipe for future reference, but they can at least give you an honest opinion about the way it tastes.

Th easiest way to spiff up such a boring cake is to throw some candy into the batter before you bake it. By dropping some candy into the batter, you’ll transform your cake into a unique surprise for the whole family.


Add popular chocolate candies to your batter. For instance, consider throwing in pieces of Snickers, Baby Ruth, Heath Bar, or other chocolate candies.
Drop sugar candies into the batter. Consider dropping gummy worms or peppermint pieces into your batter.
If you want something simple, add chocolate or butterscotch chips to your batter.
Try to tailor your creation to the season.;
, There are a wide variety of things you can add to your batter to improve it. Ultimately, flavor combinations you can create are almost impossible to quantify. Consider adding:


Half of a cup of sour cream to make your vanilla boxed cake richer
A couple of tablespoons of peanut butter
Pumpkin puree
Nuts
Coconut flakes or even coconut milk
Fruits like strawberries, bananas, blueberries, raspberries, or even pineapple., By adding spices and extracts, you'll be able to personalize your boxed cake. Ultimately, spices enable you to experiment with making a wide range of cakes.


Add an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract to your batter.
Think about adding some lemon extract to a yellow boxed cake to turn it into a lemon cake. Start with a couple of teaspoons and add more based on your preference.
Add between two and three teaspoons of spices for one boxed cake.
Some popular spices include: cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves.
Adjust your ingredients appropriately. For instance, if you are adding pieces of candy to your boxed cake, you may want to add less spices.
Start with a smaller amount of spices, and taste the batter to see if it needs more., While adding candy might improve the overall taste of your cake, adding color will give it a truly unique character. Thus, think about different colors you may want to turn your batter.


Coloring your batter works best with vanilla cakes.
Use food coloring to transform your batter. Think of blue, red, yellow, green, or other colors.
Dye your batter based on the holiday. Try dying your batter green for St. Patrick’s Day, red for Valentine’s Day, or even green and red for Christmas., Most box cakes come with a simple frosting as a topping. However, you can spoof this up by applying the frosting and then adding a variety of ingredients on top. Some possibilities include:


Breaking up Oreos and sprinkling them on top of the frosting.
Putting whip cream on top of the frosting.
Adding blueberries or another type of berry to the top of a boxed cake., Homemade frostings often take simple boxed cakes to a whole new level. By creating your favorite frosting, you’ll add your own unique character to a generic cake. Consider:


Adding several tablespoons of cream cheese to the pre-packaged frosting and putting it on top of the cake.
Whipping up a chocolate frosting (or applying store-bought pre-prepared chocolate frosting) and topping your boxed vanilla cake with it.
Substituting frosting for whip cream and adding strawberries or another fruit to the top of the cake., While baking a double layered cake might seem very complicated, you can easily turn a single-storied cake into a layered cake. To create your layer cake:


Bake your cake as the box instructs.
Slice the cake into two layers. Do this by cutting the cake halfway up. For instance, if the cake is two inches tall, cut it at one inch.
Remove the top layer.
Add your frosting and toppings to the bottom layer.
Place the top layer back on the cake and add frosting to it., Boxed cake mix often calls for minimum or low grade ingredients. Thus, one of the east ways to improve your cake mix is by substituting certain ingredients for others. The box cake will wind up tasting richer and homemade.


Substitute milk for water.
Switch out low fat milk for cream or whole milk
Use coffee instead of water in chocolate cakes. This will add a richer and more complex flavor to your cake., Perhaps the easiest way to improve your boxed cake mix is to add more called-for ingredients. By adding ingredients, you’ll make the cake richer and have better flavor. In the end, your cake will seem more like a homemade cake than a store-bought box cake.


Add more eggs. For instance, if the box calls for two eggs, add a third. This will make the cake taste richer.
Increase the amount of sugar. Do this carefully, though. Consider adding maybe 10% or 20% more than the box calls for.
Pour in more vanilla. More vanilla may add more flavor and enrich your boxed cake. Like with sugar, only add 10% or 20% more., By expanding the recipe, you’ll not only enlarge your end product, but create the opportunity to use new and better ingredients. In the end, you’ll have more cake to share with your family.


Double the ingredients. For instance, if it calls for two eggs, use four.
You may need to add extra ingredients like flour, sugar, baking powder, and more.
Make sure you adjust all your ingredients proportionately. For example, don’t add more flour unless you add more sugar, eggs, milk, and everything else."

Ensure you also slice off the burnt bottom and sides to remove the burnt areas. Shaving off the burnt edges will prevent the cake from having an unpleasant taste and will help make it more enjoyable to eat. This method can also be useful if your cake has gotten minor brown burns while baking.


While the cake may end up looking smaller and the serving amount will decrease, the burnt edges will be gone and the cake can be happily devoured.;
, Sometimes when over-baking a cake it won't burn or blacken, but instead, taste dry and crumbly. You can fix that by spreading the cake with butter with a large butter knife while the cake is still warm. The butter will melt into the cake and allow it to moisten and not taste as dry. , If you shaved off the burnt edges from the cake and notice the cake is too small, fix the cake and save it by making it into a trifle instead. Cut off the burnt edges of the cake if you haven't already and crumble it up into a bowl. In a tall glass, make a variety of layers such as one layer of chocolate pudding, another layer of the cake, one layer for walnuts, etc. Others won't notice the burnt cake and you'll end up with a new tasty dessert to enjoy. You can also add freshly chopped fruit into your trifle for a sweeter flavor that can hide the taste of the burnt, dry cake.

, Cover up the burnt flavor of your cake by adding a variety of cake toppings such as icing, frosting, ganache, vanilla glaze, fresh fruit, chocolate candies, gummies, sprinkles, and nuts to hide the burnt, dry flavor. After you snip off the burnt edges from a cake, cover the cake with icing and frosting. This fixes the cake from looking and tasting burnt. , While you and others enjoy the cake; serve the cake with a glass of milk, a mug of hot chocolate, some tea, or coffee. This prevents the burnt flavor the cake to show and will usually hide the dry, crumbly flavor of a burnt cake. , One way to fix a burnt cake is to freeze it in a freezer. Snip off the burn edges from the cake, frost it, and then freeze it until the frosting is solid. Allow it to thaw and then re-frost it again with more frosting. The dry, burnt taste will be gone and you won't even notice it. It will usually take about 5 hours till overnight until a frosted cake can freeze solid. , If your cake ended up pretty much dry and crumbly, cake pops are a good idea to save and fix up your cake. Crumble the cake up into a large bowl and then add a cup or two of frosting. Combine them together and roll the mixture into medium-sized bowls. Allow the balls to chill until firm and then stick cake pop sicks into each pop. Dip and roll into any desired toppings and enjoy. , If the cake has many burns and the edges are brown, snip them off and only cut the inside of the cake into cube-sized pieces. Garnish it with whipped cream, fresh fruit, and sprinkles to fix up the cake and make it more enjoyable to eat. , This is a common and known method to keep any foods from over-cooking or baking when making them. If you know you'll be away or get distracted, set a timer for the amount prescribed by the recipe. Make sure the timer is loud enough to hear if you're far away from the kitchen. , It's possible you could accidentally set the temperature too high without meaning too. Double-check the oven temperature before placing the cake in the oven to bake to ensure it doesn't burn. , When the cake starts to brown while it bakes, but the inside of the cake is still raw, cover the edges and top with foil. The aluminum foil will protect the cake from burning and blackening. , If you've set the correct temperature and time for the cake to bake and it stills ends up burnt, double-check your oven to make sure there is nothing wrong and that the settings are correct. It's possible your oven's settings could have been switched which causes it to not produce the correct heat level. , While the cake bakes, check it every 10-15 minutes to ensure it isn't burning and that it is baking correctly. It's best not keep opening the oven door, however, since the heat leaves every time you open it. Instead, use the oven light that's placed in your oven so you can watch the cake, but also avoid it from under-baking. "

Turn it into a slice for dessert. Heavy cake can often pass off as a dessert slice provided fruit, cream, ice cream, or custard are included as compensation.
If it's heavy and your heart sinks to look at it, try slicing it thinly, brushing each thin slice with oil or melted butter, and baking them the oven as for cookies. The slices will dry out and turn crunchy, and can be enjoyed as cookies or slices.

, Follow the ingredients carefully; if you have done so and it still turns out heavy, the recipe may be at fault.

Combine 6 oz of Jello with 2 cups of boiling water.,
Pour liquid Jello evenly over the cake.,
Place the cake in the refrigerator.,
Spread a whipped topping over the top of cake.,
Enjoy your Jello “poke” cake.

",How to Make Jello Cake1," Follow the box's directions. Use a sheet cake (9x11) baking pan. This is an ideal size as it allows the cake to cook evenly. If you want to get really creative, use different flavors of cake mix too. Some people prefer the taste of angel food cake. Experiment with other flavors to find what you like.
Every cake's instructions are different, but most can be made in under 30 minutes.
You can also use a cupcake pan and make individual sized Jello cakes. These are great for kids' parties.Let the cake cool for at least 15 minutes. To avoid burning yourself and to help the Jello to congeal on your cake, it should be at room temperature.;
, This can be done with a fork, chopsticks, or any other pointed cooking utensil. Holes should not go all the way through the cake to the bottom of the pan. Holes should be made every 1/2 - 3/4 inch (1-2 centimeters)., Stir until completely dissolved. If you do not dissolve the Jello mix entirely, it will clump and not congeal properly.If you decide to make a layered Jello cake, use 1 box of gelatin for each layer. You could coordinate for holidays such as red and blue gelatin for the 4th of July. This is also a good idea, if you are trying to accommodate a lot of people who prefer different flavors.For a vegan option, use Weikfield jelly based on agar-agar (a seaweed). It is available in India and in Indian stores worldwide. It works just like Jello for this recipe.Jello is not a vegan dessert. Gelatin is a protein produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from the various animal parts., The holes you made in the cake allow Jello to seep into the cake.Most people prefer that the Jello be evenly spread throughout the cake, giving each bite an equal portion of cake and Jello. Feel free to get creative. Maybe spell out a person’s name if it is their birthday. Make elaborate Jello designs. You might even consider combining several flavors of Jello to give your cake a pop of color.

, Let sit for about 1 hour or until the gelatin solidifies., Decorate with colorful candy sprinkles (optional), fruits, candles, and anything else that helps make the cake more festive. You might consider mixing in some fun food coloring into your whipped topping to give it a splash of color. ,"

",How to Make Jello Cake2," Follow the instructions and use a 9x11 baking pan, unless otherwise indicated on the box. You might consider a clear baking dish as well. The Jello mousse cake is much prettier from the side than the Jello “poke” cake because it has distinguishable layers. A clear dish will allow your family or guests to see this.


Most cake mixes take around 30 minutes to make. Allow your cake to cool for at least 15 minutes. To avoid burning yourself and to help the Jello-mousse layer settle without becoming runny, your cake should be at room temperature., Take 6 oz of Jello with 2 cups of boiling water. Stir until completely dissolved. If you do not dissolve the Jello mix entirely, it will clump and not congeal properly.Then add 1 cup cold water and stir. The cold water will activate the mix and the Jello will start to form., If you need your Jello to set more quickly, place it in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes., Once the Jello starts to thicken, take your cool whip and mix it completely with your Jello. This will give it a mousse-like texture., Make it an even layer. If using a 9x11 pan, your mousse layer should be about 3/4' thick., This will allow the mousse to fully set. If you don't refrigerate the mousse, it will stay runny and won't support the next layer of the cake., Add 3 oz of Jello mix to 1 cup of boiling water and stir. When the gelatin is dissolved (like before), add 1/2 cup of cold water and let cool at room temperature.You can combine flavors at this point, if you'd like. For instance, use cherry Jello for the mousse and strawberry Jello for the top layer. Then you'll have a berry Jello mousse cake.

, This layer of Jello should be even as well., A lot of people like to add fruits to this final Jello layer. Pick fruits that compliment your Jello flavors like cherries, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, or apple slices.Add candy sprinkles. They can add a fun touch to your cake.


If you are celebrating a specific occasion, like someone’s birthday, spell out a message with your fruits or sprinkles.
If you decide to make a several layer Jello mousse cake, make sure to use a deep container as it will tend to slide or sag.

Frost or fill, as desired.",How to Make a Sponge Cake1," Set the oven to 180°C, 350°F, or gas mark 4. Butter two 9-inch cake pans or 2 12-by-17 inch rimmed baking sheets. Line the bottom of your pans with parchment paper, butter the paper, and then sprinkle flour all over it. Gently shake the flour around and shake the excess out of the pan.


Don't be tempted to skip the parchment paper. It will ensure that the cake doesn't stick to the pans and will make it easy to remove.;
, Pour water into a saucepan and get it simmering, or slightly bubbling. Place a bowl over the saucepan taking care that the bowl doesn't touch the water.


You can also buy and use a double boiler, which similarly nests two saucepans.

, Whisk till the yolks and sugar over the simmering water until the sugar dissolves, about 3 or 4 minutes. When you no longer see sugar granules, remove the bowl from heat.

, Use a hand-mixer on medium-high to beat the mixture until it lightens in color and thickens slightly, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in vanilla extract and salt. Pour the mixture into a large bowl.

, Place the whites in a separate large bowl and beat with a mixer on high speed. Beat till soft peaks form. These should be slightly droopy if you lift the beaters out of the bowl. Once this happens, beat in the rest of your sugar until the peaks become stiff and shiny. This should take a couple of minutes.


Be sure to use spotlessly clean beaters and bowl. If there's any trace of grease or fat, your egg whites won't form peaks.

, Do this gradually, by folding in one third of the whites at a time. Then, gently sift the flour over the top and fold it in as well. Stop folding just before all the flour is incorporated.


To fold in a mixture, simply use a spatula and a light hand to gently combine a lighter mixture into a heavier one. Avoid stirring, or you'll lose the volume of the lighter mixture. Instead, rotate your wrist when combining substances.

, Pour it down the side of the bowl and fold it into the batter until it's smooth, but take care not to overbeat.

, Divide the batter between your two cake pans or sheets. Bake the cake pans for around 25 minutes or 15 minutes for the sheet pans. To ensure even browning, rotate the pans or sheets halfway through the baking time. The cake is done when a tester or toothpick comes out clean after being stuck in the center.

, If you used cake pans, hold a plate over the cake, then swiftly turn it upside down so the cake comes out onto the plate. Remove the parchment and then use the same method to flip it onto your serving plate.


If you used sheets, lay out a few kitchen towels and dust them with the powdered/confectioner's sugar. Immediately flip the hot cakes onto the dusted towels. Dust the top of the cakes with more powdered/confectioner's sugar and then roll up the cakes in the towels. Let them cool for at least an hour. Unroll them before filling.

, Sponge cakes baked in cake pans easily lend themselves to filling between the layers. Sponge cakes baked in sheet pans can be filled and rolled before being frosted on the outside.


Try making a Buche de Noel. Take your prepared sponge cake made in a sheet pan and fill with your choice of chocolate, chestnut, coffee, or cream cheese fillings. Roll it up and cover with a frosting of your choice (typically, a chocolate). Decorate the rolled up cake to look like a Yule log by adding meringue mushrooms, holly, and sugared cranberries. Dust with powdered sugar.Try making a Victoria Sponge. Place one of your sponge cakes made in the cake pan onto your serving plate. Spread raspberry jam overtop or scatter with fresh berries. Dollop whipped cream or buttercream over the jam or fruit and spread. Stack the other sponge cake on top of the fruit and cream, then dust with powdered/confectioner's sugar and serve."

, In a separate large bowl, whisk together the oil, egg yolks, and milk till combined. Gradually whisk the flour mixture into your wet mixture.

, In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with a mixer set to high until the whites become frothy. Add the cream of tartar and vanilla, then beat until the whites hold soft peaks. Slowly beat in the rest of the sugar (3/4 cup) and keep beating until the whites hold stiff, shiny peaks. This should take around 5 minutes.

, Start by whisking in a third of the egg whites into your other batter. Then, take a spatula and gently fold the rest of the egg whites into the mixture. Stop folding just before all the flour is incorporated.


To fold in a mixture, simply use a spatula and a light hand to gently combine a lighter mixture into a heavier one. Avoid stirring, or you'll lose the volume of the lighter mixture. Instead, rotate your wrist when combining substances.

, Cook the cake until it springs back when you touch it, around 50 to 55 minutes. Remove it from the oven and let it cool upside down for an hour before you take it out of the pan.

Decide how much time you have.,

Let your cake cool in the refrigerator for an additional 1-2 hours.,
Loosen your cake from the pan.,
Remove your cake from the pan.",How to Cool Cakes1," Depending on the type of cake, cooling using this method can be done in just a couple of hours. Here are some things to consider:

Angel food cakes, pound cakes, sponge cakes and other light and fluffy cakes can cool in the refrigerator in about 1-2 hours.This method may not be the best choice for a cheesecake, as quick changes of temperature can upset the structure of the cake, causing cracks. For rich, creamy cakes that are served chilled, this method may take you up to 4 hours.If you are cooling a traditional cake, this method will take you about 2-3 hours.;
, Once your cake is fully cooked, use oven mitts to carefully take it out of the oven and place it on the kitchen counter. Let your cake sit for 5-10 minutes. Here are some guidelines to consider:


If you are working with a cheesecake, or other creamy cake, it is recommended that you turn off the heat and let your cake cool in the oven for about an hour before transferring your cake to the refrigerator. If you don't have the time, you can put your cake in the refrigerator although it may crack slightly.If you are working with cheesecake, run a butter knife along the edge of the cake and the pan while the cake is still warm, this will prevent the cake from sticking to the pan later.
You may want to place your cake pan on a wooden surface like a cutting board to protect your countertop from heat damage.

, After allowing it to cool briefly on the countertop, place your cake pan in the refrigerator for another 5-10 minutes. This will further cool the cake without causing it to dry out. It should be pretty cool to the touch after 5 or 10 minutes. Here are some things to consider:


If you are cooling a sponge or angel food cake, it is recommended that you cool the cake upside down.This can be done by turning the pan upside down and setting the tube part over the neck of a stable bottle. Turning it upside down for cooling helps prevent it from collapsing as it cools.
If you are cooling a pound cake, it is recommended that you take it out of the pan to cool it. Cooling a pound cake for too long in a pan can cause it to become overly damp and stick to the pan.Transfer it to a wire rack and place it in the refrigerator.

, Sealing the cake tight will help keep it moist as it continues to cool.


If you have removed your cake from the pan or placed it upside down, you don't need to wrap it up.

, If you are chilling an angel food cake or pound cake, you may only need to cool it for an additional hour. If you are cooling a cheesecake, let it cool for the entire 2 hours.

, Use a sharp knife or butter knife and run it along the edges of the pan between the rim of the pan and the cake.


Be sure to keep your knife vertical so you don't accidentally cut into the sides of your cake.

, Place a large plate over the cake pan. Hold the plate and the pan firmly together and flip them upside down. Shake the pan softly to transfer your cake from pan to platter.


If your cake is especially delicate, gently tap the bottom of the pan a few times until you feel your cake release.

Pry the sides loose with a rounded knife.,
Unstick the bottom with a flexible nylon spatula.,
Shake the cake onto the serving plate.,
Tap the base of the pan.,
Leave it to sit upside down.,
Twist or lever the cake out (not recommended).",How to Fix a Baked Cake Stuck to the Pan1," Select a palette knife if you have one, or a slim butter knife if you don't. Push the vertical knife down between the cake edge and the pan. Carefully move the knife around the entire cake to loosen the sides. Stay as close to the pan edge as possible to minimize the amount you cut into your cake.


If the cake is for a major occasion, you may want to try the other methods first. This one often causes minor damage.
If the cake burned onto the sides, saw up and down slowly to break it loose. You may need to go around the cake four or five times.;
, Push the spatula down at the edge of the pan, as you did with the knife. This time, lever the spatula inward as you move around the cake. This tool should be flexible enough to separate the perimeter of the base from the pan.


If the cake is seriously stuck, don't try to force it off. Skip down to one of the other methods instead.
You can use a thin metal spatula or pizza peel instead. Run hot water over it first, as the heat and moisture can help unstick the cake.

, Place a large plate over the cake pan. Hold them firmly together and flip them upside down. Shake the pan softly until the cake comes out.


You may flip it onto a cooling rack instead. Keep something underneath the rack to catch crumbs.
If the cake is damaged, skip down to the cake repair instructions.

, Knocking the base of the pan can dislodge the cake. Hold the cake just above the plate when trying this, tilted at a 45º angle. If this still doesn't work, turn the pan right side up and bash the side against a countertop.

, If the cake still hasn't popped out, it might do so once the pan is fully cooled. Leave it upside down over the serving plate and cross your fingers.

, In most cases, you should try one of the methods below instead. If you don't have the time or tools to do so, you can try to remove the cake by force. Be forewarned: this usually results in a broken cake.


Hold the cake with your hands or a spatula, while twisting the pan.

and/or Lever the cake out using the same rounded knife. This time, angle the knife inward toward the center of the cake to break off the base.

Let your cake cool.,
Determine what kind of cake you're freezing.,
Select the right wrapping to freeze it in.,
Extend the wrapping of your choice onto a flat surface, preferably in your kitchen.,
Wrap your cake.,
Place your wrapped cake into the freezer.,
Keep your cake in the freezer within certain time limits.",How to Freeze Cakes1," Before you can freeze your cake for later consumption, you must let it cool. So if you've just baked a cake, put it aside for about three hours. Lightly place your hand on it to make sure it's cool to the touch.


If you're freezing a store-bought cake, or a cake that has already cooled, skip this first step.;
, Most cakes will freeze well due to the high fat content in them. If your cake doesn't have fat (like fat-free cakes), it won't freeze well and you should avoid putting it in the freezer.

, Your cake has to be protected from freezer condensation, so using a moisture-proof wrapping is key to preserve your cake's flavor and texture. You have a few options:


Plastic wrap: this wrapping material is always well suited, but might require multiple layers as moisture might get in. Plastic wrap is easy to wrap and fairly durable.
Aluminum foil: this wrapping foil is probably one of the best barrier films as it's impervious to light, moisture and bacteria. One major disadvantage is that it tears very easily.
Place the wrapped cake into a metallic tin, if desired. This protects the cakes from being knocked by other items, makes it very easy to find and provides added protection from moisture and freezer odors, such as seafood.

, Then, take the pan with your cake in it, and flip it upside down. Your cake should come out of the pan without much work on your end.


If the cake doesn't come out right away, get a knife and slide along the edges of your pan (between the pan and the actual cake).
If you previously removed your cake from its baking pan, skip this step.

, Now, simply use your wrapping to envelop the cake. Make sure you're wrapping your cake tightly, without much room for air between the cake and the wrapping.

, You're now ready to freeze your cake for storage. Make sure you have enough space, and try not to position your cake next to foods with strong flavors and odors (like seafood). Your cake could well absorb some odors, and even flavors, so you should ideally have a spot where your cake won't be around other food items.


You might even consider cleaning your freezer before placing your cake in it. This will greatly improve your cake's flavor and odor retention.

, A cake will generally freeze well for a few months, but not more than that. Whilst freezing initially retains the moisture of a pre-baked cake, cakes will tend to dry out after two months of freezing and you can expect the flavor to change at around four months.


Once you're ready to frost your cake, simply take it out of the freezer and let it thaw for about 40 minutes. Then, frost it to your liking.

"
"
Prepare your cake pan by greasing the inside of the pan and then either dusting it with flour or lining it with parchment paper.,
Fill the prepared pan only 1/2 full instead of 2/3 full with the cake batter.,
Increase the recipe's baking temperature by 15 to 25 degrees.,
Reduce the recipe's baking time by 20 percent.",How to Adjust a Cake Recipe for High Altitude1,"


This prevents the cake from sticking, which is more likely at high altitudes. The exception to this rule is any type of sponge cake, which should be baked in a pan that has not been greased.;
,


This prevents the cake from overflowing in the pan when the air expands.

,


This helps prevent the cake from collapsing.

,


This prevents over-baking or burning.
Judge your cake's rising time if yeast is an ingredient, watching it closely instead of relying on the recipe's time. Yeast can rise more quickly in high altitudes.

Choose the right cooling rack.,
Remove your cake from the oven.,
Let your cake sit.,
Loosen your cake from the pan.,
Spray your cooling rack.,
Transfer your cake directly to the rack (optional).,
Remove your cake from the cooling rack.",How to Cool Cakes2," Make sure to pick your cooling rack according to the size of the cake you are baking. 10-inches seems to be the largest standard pan size (for bundt cakes and round cakes), so a rack that is at least 10-inches across should serve just about all of your needs.Cooling racks are an essential tool for any baker as they help your cake cool evenly and quickly. Here are a few things to consider:


Pick a wire rack that is easy to fit in your dishwasher and in the area you plan to store it.
Cooling racks work by allowing air to circulate under your cake, which helps prevent condensation which could make the bottom soggy.

, Once your cake is fully cooked, use oven mitts to carefully take it out of the oven and place the pan directly on your cooling rack.


If you are cooling a cheesecake, you can simply turn off the oven and leave your cake inside to cool for about an hour. This allows the delicate cake to cool slowly, which will help prevent it from cracking.

, At this point, it is a good idea to check your cooking instructions for cooling time guidelines. Cooling time can vary considerably depending on the type of cake you are baking. As a rule of thumb, expect to cool your cake on the rack for 10-15 minutes.


The cake pan should be resting on the rack to ensure that the bottom of the cake pan has airflow.

, Remove your cake pan from the cooling rack and place it on the counter. Use a sharp knife or butter knife and run it along the edges of the pan between the rim of the pan and the cake.


Be sure to keep your knife vertical so you don't accidentally cut into the sides of your cake. Run the knife around the edges a couple times to loosen your cake from the pan.

, Before transferring your cake directly to the cooling rack, you will need to lightly spray your rack with cooking spray.Since your cake will still be slightly warm, placing it on a rack with cooking spray will prevent it from sticking to the wire rack.

, Hold the cooling rack over the top of the pan and slowly turn the pan upside down. Gently tap the bottom of the pan until the cake releases. Slowly lift the pan away to transfer your cake to the cooling rack. Before removing your cake from the pan, consider this:If you are cooling a cheesecake, you won't want to attempt to transfer your cake to the wire rack. Cheesecakes are very delicate and this could ruin your cake.
If you are cooling a pound cake, removing your cake from the pan sooner will help keep it from getting too soggy.
If you are cooling an angel food cake, you may want to skip the wire rack and place it upside down on the counter instead. To cool your cake upside down, turn the pan upside down and set the tube part over the neck of a stable bottle. Turning it upside down for cooling helps prevent it from collapsing as it cools.
Remember to use oven mitts when handling the pan. Since the pan hasn't been out of the oven for very long, it may still be hot enough to burn you.

, After letting your cake fully cool for 1-2 hours, you can transfer it to a plate or platter and frost and decorate however you wish.

"
"
Pour hot water in a deep tray.,
Sit the cake pan in the tray of water.,
Steam out the cake.,
Place ice on the base of the pan.,
Freeze the cake solid.",How to Fix a Baked Cake Stuck to the Pan2," The tray should be wide enough to hold your cake pan. Pour in a shallow ¼"" (6mm) layer of hot tap water.


If you don't have a tray this size, soak a dishcloth in hot water and wrap it around the base of the pan.

, The heat will cause the metal pan to expand slightly, pulling away from the cake edges. Leave it there for a few minutes to let this happen. Attempt to remove the cake as described above.

, Absorbing steam add moisture and ""lift"" to your cake, which can help it become unstuck. Boil water in a small saucepan or kettle, then pour it into a mug. Place the mug and the cake pan in a microwave, cupboard, or other enclosed space. Leave it there for several minutes, then try to remove the cake again.


The microwave is just a convenient size for trapping the steam in with the cake. Do not turn it on.

, Turn the pan upside down over a serving plate. Place a bowl of ice on the pan base and leave it for several minutes. Attempt to remove the cake as before.

, Let the cake cool completely at room temperature, about one hour. Freeze the cake for six hours. This makes it harder to ruin the cake's shape, and may break it loose from the pan. Run a butter knife around the edge to separate the sides, even if you already did this before freezing. Hold the pan upside down and tap the base to see if it worked.

Cut off the burned layer.,
Add small broken pieces to the bottom of the cake.,
Cover minor damage with frosting.,
Piece together broken cake with gluey frosting.",How to Fix a Baked Cake Stuck to the Pan3," If the cake is burned, carefully saw it off with a wire cake cutter or a large bread knife. If it ends up crooked, don't try to fix it with a second cut, as this will likely reduce your cake to crumbs. Patch the broken area with frosting instead, as described below.

, If a few small bits have broken off, wedge them underneath the cake. If your cake is moist enough, these will stick back to the cake fairly well, especially if the cake is still hot.

, Put together a batch of frosting and spread it over the cake in a smooth surface. Dollops of any frosting can fill holes and uneven edges in a cake.


Sugar-and-liquid icing is too thin and runny to do the trick.

, If your cake looks like a demolition site, you'll need extra-sticky frosting to hold it together. You can make caramel frosting, dulce de leche, or try this sticky chocolate frosting recipe:


Mix 1 can condensed milk, 3 tsp (15mL) cocoa powder, and 2 tsp (10g) unsalted butter.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly. Stop when it reaches a slightly thick, gluey consistency.
Allow it to cool to room temperature; it will thicken more as it sets.
Place the broken pieces on top of each other as close to the desired shape as possible. Cover the surface and cracks liberally with the frosting.

Cut the cake into squares.,
Serve in the pan.,
Make cake pops.",How to Fix a Baked Cake Stuck to the Pan4," Cut a grid of squares in the cake pan — even if it's a round cake. Use a wide, flexible spatula to carefully separate the square pieces from the base.


Keep reading to find uses for the stuck pieces at the edge.

, The easiest option is to frost and serve the cake in the pan. The slices will break apart during serving, but it will look attractive on the table.

, If you've torn the cake into pieces trying to get it out, change your plans and put together some cake pops. You can read these detailed instructions, or try the simple (and sometimes sloppy) recipe:


Rub together the chunks of cake in a large bowl.
Beat in cream cheese or buttercream until the mixture reaches a doughy consistency.
Roll the largest chunks into balls.
Dip in chocolate sauce, then sprinkles (optional).

Place your Twinkie on a cutting board or any other clean surface.,
Slice your Twinkie open lengthwise.,
Scoop the middle out of your Twinkie using a teaspoon.,
Dip a spoon into your Nutella.,
Dig in!",How to Fill a Twinkie With Nutella," Make sure it is oriented towards you and that it has no signs of damage or affliction. It should be bright yellow and slightly moist to the touch, in a shape resembling a log. Do not use a Twinkie that appears defective in any way! It is one of the two crucial ingredients in this tutorial and its conditions cannot be any less than ideal.;
, Try to cut it into halves, with equal amounts of cream in each half. Lay the sections of the Twinkie next to one another, like so, and either set your knife to the side or put it in the dishwasher (since you won't be needing it from this point onward).

, Place this extracted mixture of cream and yellow cake somewhere out of your way. Remember, you do not have to get every single morsel out--just enough so there is room for the Nutella. You also don't need to be too careful as you're sculpting the insides, since the point of this culinary creation is taste, not aesthetics.

, Stir it well, especially if you have just opened the container, and once its consistency is smooth enough take a spoonful of Nutella and spread it inside your Twinkie halves. Repeat this action until you have a satisfactory amount of filling in both parts. Now place the halves back together, so your Twinkie looks the same as it did before except for the gleam of Nutella on the side.

, If you are enjoying your Nutella-filled Twinkie by yourself, you might want to add a few more elements to complete the experience, like a banana or a tall glass of milk. You can even put peanut butter or ice cream on the side for a decadent dessert. If you are making more than one Chocolate Sunshine Indulgence (as those of us in the biz like to call it), make sure that you are in possession of the correct Twinkie-to-Nutella proportions. Most people find that three or four spoonfuls of Nutella per Twinkie will suffice, but you should figure your personal preferences before you prepare this delicacy for others. Happy eating!

Frosted cakes might also take up more space than unfrosted cakes, depending on how high the frosting is.

, Then, place it in the freezer unwrapped for about 4 hours. Then, remove the cake from the freezer.

, Try to cut a piece of foil that will nicely wrap around all sides of your frosted cake.

, Loosely cover your entire cake with plastic foil. Make sure that the whole cake is properly covered, but that you don't flatten the frosting too much.

, It's a good idea to add an additional layer of plastic foil around your cake to protect the shape and keep other odors in your freezer from sticking to your cake.

, You can also freeze the cake without the added protection of tupperware, but a plastic container will keep your cake in better shape. After wrapping the cake into plastic foil, put it into the plastic container and place it in the freezer.

Put your paper aside for a few days.",How to Write a Report," If your teacher, professor, or boss gave your guidelines for your report, make sure you read them (and reread them). What is the assignment asking of you? Are you supposed to inform your audience about a topic? Generally if you are writing a report for an elementary, middle or high school class, you will be asked to present a topic without inserting your opinion. Other assignments might ask you to persuade your audience about a certain way of perceiving your topic, or analyze a topic. Ask your teacher about any questions you might have as soon as possible.Keep in mind that if your purpose is only to inform your audience, you should not put your own opinion into your report or add any persuasive elements.

, Feeling passionate about a topic will drive you to do your best work possible. Of course, sometimes you will not have the option to choose your topic. If this is the case, try to find something about the assigned topic that you can get passionate about. Always make sure to run your ideas by your teacher to make sure that it is okay that you approach the report in this way.If your assignment is to give a report on a particular event of the 1960’s in America, and you don’t like history but you do like music, focus your report on the way the music in the 1960’s tied into the event that occurred during that time. But make sure to include lots of details about other things based on the topic too.

, If you are giving a report to your classmates, try to pick a topic that is original and engaging. If you are the third person to give a report on Disneyland that day, chances are you probably won’t have your classmates attention. To avoid repetition, ask your teacher what topics have already been picked.


If the topic you want has been chosen, try to find a different angle to present it in. For instance, if you wanted to do your report on Disneyland, but somebody already chose that topic, you could focus your report on one specific section of Disneyland, like Adventureland. You could discuss what inspired its creation, the different rides you find in that section, and any major changes that have happened to Adventureland recently., If you begin to research the topic you have chosen and realize that you can’t find any information on the topic, or that your topic is too broad, you can always change your topic, so long as you are not starting your project the day before its due.


If you find that your topic is too broad, try to pick a specific part of the topic to focus on. For instance, if you wanted to do your report on World Fairs, but realized there are way too many of the them to talk about, and they are all too varied to discuss as a whole, choose one specific world fair, such as the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, to focus on.

, Make sure you have the correct number of sources for your paper (your guidelines should cover how many sources your teacher expects you to have).If you are writing a report about a time in history, make sure to add a time line.


If you are giving a report on a specific person, research his/her life--what was his/her childhood like? What did he/she do that was important? What was his/her family life like?I
If you are writing a report on an event, find out what other events led to your event, what actually happened during the event, and what the aftermath of the event was.

, Libraries are an excellent place to find information. Search the library’s database for any books or materials related to your article. If you are having trouble, ask a librarian for help.


If you find a great book that covers your topic well, look at the sources the author used (these will generally be listed in the back of the book.) These sources can often lead to even more useful information and websites.

, If you are using the internet to find information about your topic, always make sure to double check any facts you find. Stick with information gathered by known experts in the field you are researching, government agency websites, and scholarly journals. Try to avoid forums and other sources that have no credible backing.If you are writing a report about a specific person, company, or place, try to find their own website. For instance, if you are writing a report on Jane Goodall, a great source would be using the Jane Goodall Institute website.

, Write each source you use down on a flashcard. Write down all of the information you can find on the source (such as the author, publication date, publisher/website, city in which it was published, page number for where you found the information, and so on) so that you can easily create your bibliography later.

, Thesis statements are the main idea of your report. A thesis statement summarizes what you want to prove in your report for your reader. All of your subsequent topic sentences of body paragraphs should tie back into this thesis, so make sure that it is general enough to stand throughout your essay. If you are simply reporting on a topic, create a thesis statement that does not contain any opinion-based information. If you are creating a thesis that is meant to persuade someone about a topic, or that is meant to deeply analyze a topic, the thesis should contain an argument that you intend to prove in your essay.Example of straightforward report thesis (Thesis 1): The three main halls of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition were filled with modern creations of the day and were an excellent representation of the innovative spirit of the Progressive era.

Example of a persuasive or analytic report thesis (Thesis 2): The Panama-Pacific International Exposition was intended as a celebration of the Progressive spirit, but actually harbored a deep racism and principle of white supremacy that most visitors chose to ignore or celebrate.

, Outlines help you to visualize how your essay will look. Outlines can be straightforward lists, idea webs or concept maps. Begin with your thesis statement and then pick the three major ideas related to your thesis statement that you will want to cover in your essay. Write down details about each main idea.


Your main ideas should support your thesis. They should be the evidence that provides support to your argument.

Example main ideas for Thesis 1: Exhibits at the Court of the Universe, Exhibits at the Court of the Four Seasons, Exhibits at the Court of Abundance.

Example main ideas for Thesis 2: Racism in the ‘Joy Zone’, the statue of ‘The End of the Trail’, and the presence of ‘Race Betterment’ lectures at the fair.

, The structure of your paper depends on your topic. If you are writing a report on a person, it would make the most sense to structure your report in chronological order.


For Thesis 1, the report would be structured as a spatial guide to the fair--the report would discuss the main exhibits in each of the major buildings at the fair (the Court of the Universe, the Court of the Four Seasons, and the Court of Abundance.)

, Your intro is where you introduce your topic and state your thesis. Your intro should be engaging but not corny--the goal should be to hook the reader so that they want to read the rest of your report. You should provide some background information on your topic and then state your thesis so that the reader knows what the report is going to be about. When you are revising make sure you look at the first word in every sentence and try not to let any of them be repetitive.



Example Intro for Thesis 1: The Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE) of 1915 was intended to celebrate both the creation of the Panama Canal, and the technological advancements achieved at the turn of the century. The three main halls of the PPIE were filled with modern creations of the day and were an excellent representation of the innovative spirit of the Progressive era., The body paragraphs are where you state your evidence that supports your thesis. Each body paragraph consists of a topic sentence and evidence supporting the topic sentence. The topic sentence introduces the main idea of the body paragraph and links the paragraph back to the thesis.Example topic sentence for Thesis 1: At the PPIE, the Court of the Universe was the heart of the exposition and represented the greatest achievements of man, as well as the meeting of the East and the West.
For a report that is about a person, a topic sentence might be something like, “John Doe had a rough childhood that shaped who he became.” Obviously you would put in more specific information relevant to the person you are reporting about.

, After you write your topic sentence in the body paragraph, provide evidence found in your research that supports your topic sentence. This evidence can be descriptions of things mentioned in your topic sentence, quotes from experts on the subjects, or more information about the topic listed.


For the topic sentence listed above about the Court of the Universe, the body paragraph should go on to list the different exhibits found at the exhibit, as well as proving how the Court represented the meeting of the East and West.
For a report about a person, you would provide evidence that proved John Doe had a hard childhood and that his experiences led him to become the famous person he was.

, This paragraph both summarizes your thesis again, and provides your final thoughts on your topic. It should reiterate to the reader what the reader should be taking away from your report., Your teacher or professor should tell you whether to use MLA, APA or Chicago style when writing your essay. Format any quotes you use, as well as your bibliography accordingly.

, Try to follow your teacher's formatting instructions to the letter. If he or she made no formatting instructions, go with something clean and classic. Standard format for academic reports in the United States is 12-point Times New Roman or Arial font, double-spaced lines, and 1-inch margins all around.

, Does the point you are trying to make come across clearly? Does all of your evidence support your thesis? If you were someone reading your report for the first time, would you feel like you understood the topic after reading the report?

, Having a second pair of eyes can be helpful to make sure your point is clear and your writing doesn’t sound awkward. Ask your helper, do you understand what I am saying in my report? Is there anything you think I should take out or add? Is there anything you would change?

, Check for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. Are there any awkward sentences that you can rewrite?, Reading out loud will help you to identify any sections of the report that might sound awkward (like if there are run-on sentences.)

, If you have time to put the paper away and clear your head before proofreading, it is a good thing to do. Taking a break from your paper will help you to spot more errors and parts that don’t make sense when you come back to it."

The best, most complete manner for blending dry ingredients and getting rid of lumps is done by thoroughly whisking the dry ingredients in a large bowl.

,, A digital scale makes easy work of making sure there is an equal amount of batter in each pan. If you don't have one, use measuring cups to ensure a balance between the two pans.

,, If the cake pans are on different racks of the oven, you should also swap racks so one pan isn't getting more heat than the other, especially if your oven heats from the bottom. This compensates for any uneven oven temperatures. This step may not be necessary if your oven works well. For more tips, see How to Cook Food in a Bad Oven.

, You can also check with a toothpick, inserted in the center and pulled out. The cake is done if the toothpick is clean. If you're into temperature, the doneness temperature of a cake is about 210 °F (99 °C).

, A cooled cake is easier to remove from the pan. Be sure to loosen the cake from the sides of the pan by running a knife around the sides of the pan.

, When you're done frosting the cake, take away the strips. No frosting where it shouldn't be; you have a good clean plate.
Put a thin coating of frosting on cakes called a ""crumb coat"", then put on the normal frosting. This keeps crumbs out of the decorative ""topcoat"". This works well when using light frosting on a dark cake.
Clean the edges of the cake plate with a damp cloth. Just pick up any crumbs and wipe off any frosting smudges.

Announce your research topic.,
Consider referring to key words.,
Define any key terms or concepts.,
Introduce the topic through an anecdote or quotation.,
Include a brief literature review.,
Use the literature to focus in on your contribution.,
Elaborate on the rationale of your paper.,
State your research questions.,
Indicate your hypothesis.,
Outline the structure of your paper.",How to Write a Research Introduction," You can start your introduction with a few sentences which announce the topic of your paper and give an indication of the kind of research questions you will be asking. This is a good way to introduce your readers to your topic and pique their interest.The first few sentences should act as an indication of a broader problem which you will then focus in on more closely in the rest of your introduction, leading to your specific research questions.


In scientific papers this is sometimes known as an ""inverted triangle"", where you start with the broadest material at the start, before zooming in on the specifics.The sentence ""Throughout the 20th century, our views of life on other planets have drastically changed"" introduces a topic, but does so in broad terms.
It provides the reader with an indication of the content of the essay and encourages them to read on.;
, When you write a research paper for publication you will be required to submit it along with a series of key words which give a quick indication of the areas of research you are addressing.You may also have certain key words in your title which you want to establish and emphasise in your introduction.For example, if you were writing a paper about the behaviour of mice when exposed to a particular substance, you would include the word ""mice"", and the scientific name of the relevant compound in the first sentences.If you were writing a history paper about the impact of the First World War on gender relations in Britain, you should mention those key words in your first few lines.

, It may be necessary for you to clarify any key terms or concepts early on in your introduction. You need to express yourself clearly throughout your paper so if you leave an unfamiliar term or concept unexplained you risk your readers not having a clear understanding of your argument.This is especially important if you are attempting to develop a new conceptualization that uses language and terminology your readers may be unfamiliar with.

, If you are writing a humanities or social science essay you can find more literary ways to begin your introduction and announce the topic of your paper. It is common for humanities essays in particular to begin with an illustrative anecdote or quotation that points to the topic of the research. This is a variation of the ""inverted triangle"" technique and can generate interest in your paper in a more imaginative way and demonstrate an engaging writing style.


If you use an anecdote ensure that is short and highly relevant for your research. It has to function in the same way as an alternative opening, namely to announce the topic of your research paper to your reader.
For example, if you were writing a sociology paper about re-offending rates among young offenders, you could include a brief story of one person whose story reflects and introduces your topic.
This kind of approach is generally not appropriate for the introduction to a natural or physical sciences research paper where the writing conventions are different.

, Depending on the overall length of your paper, it will be necessary to include a review of the existing literature already published in the field. This is an important element of your paper which demonstrates that you have a strong knowledge and understanding of the debates and scholarship in your area. You should aim to indicate that you have a broad knowledge, but that you are engaging in the specific debates most relevant to your own research.


It is important to be concise in the introduction, so provide an overview on recent developments in the primary research rather than a lengthy discussion.You can follow the ""inverted triangle"" principle to focus in from the broader themes to those to which you are making a direct contribution with your paper.
A strong literature review presents important background information to your own research and indicates the importance of the field., A concise but comprehensive literature review can be a very effective way to frame your own research paper. As you develop your introduction, you can move from the literature to focus in on your own work and its position relevant to the broader scholarship.


By making clear reference to existing work you can demonstrate explicitly the specific contribution you are making to move the field forward.
You can identify a gap in the existing scholarship and explain how you are addressing it and moving understanding forward., Once you have framed your work within a broader context you can elaborate more fully on the rationale of your research and its particular strengths and importance. The rationale should clearly and concisely indicate the value of your paper and its contribution to the field.Try to go beyond saying that you are filling a gap in the scholarship and emphasise the positive contribution of your work.


For example, if you are writing a scientific paper you could stress the merits of the experimental approach or models you have used.
Stress what is novel in your research and the significance of your new approach, but don't give too much detail in the introduction.A stated rationale could be something like: ""the study evaluates the previously unknown anti-inflammatory effects of a topical compound in order to evaluate its potential clinical uses"".

, Once you have indicated where your research sits in the field and the general rationale for your paper, you can specify the research questions the paper addresses. The literature review and rationale frames your research and introduces your research question. This question should be developed fluently from the earlier parts of the introduction and shouldn't come as a surprise to the reader.The research question or questions generally come towards the end of the introduction, and should be concise and closely focused.The research question might recall some of the key words established in the first few sentences and the title of your paper.
An example of a research question could be ""what were the consequences of the North American Free Trade Agreement on the Mexican export economy?""
This could be honed further to be specific by referring to a particular element of the Free Trade Agreement and the impact on a particular industry in Mexico, such as clothing manufacture.
A good research question should shape a problem into a testable hypothesis.

, After you have specified your research questions you need to give a clear and concise articulation of your hypothesis, or your thesis statement. This is a statement which indicates your essay will make a specific contribution and have a clear result rather than just covering a broader topic.You should make it clear briefly how you came to this hypothesis in a way which references your discussion of the existing literature.


If possible try to avoid using the word ""hypothesis"" and rather make this implicit in your writing.This can make your writing appear less formulaic.
In a scientific paper, giving a clear one-sentence overview of your results and their relation to your hypothesis makes the information clear and accessible.An example of a hypothesis could be ""mice deprived of food for the duration of the study were expected to become more lethargic than those fed normally"".

, In some cases the final part of an introduction to a research paper will be a few lines that provide an overview of the structure of the body of the paper.This could simply give an outline of how you have organised the paper and how it is broken down into sections.


This is not always necessary and you should pay attention to the writing conventions in your discipline.
In a natural sciences paper, for example, there is a fairly rigid structure which you will be following.A humanities or social science paper will most likely present more opportunities to deviate in how you structure your paper.

Use cups and saucers.,
Make a tiered cupcake or cake slice stand.,
Make a cupcake stand.,
Use votive candle holders and a plate to fashion a cake stand.,
Be inspired by the garden.",How to Make a Cake Stand from Household Objects," This is a very simple but effective cake stand for a lightweight, smallish cake. It simply involves choosing a pretty teacup or coffee cup and a saucer of a good size. To create the stand, turn the cup over onto the table so that its mouth sits steadily on the table. Then balance the saucer on the cup so that it sits without wobbling or tilting. (If it still teeters, use a different cup.) You might be able to get away with placing a larger cake plate onto the saucer but be very careful that this doesn't unbalance things, and keep in mind that guests will bump the stand when serving themselves, so the more solid it is, the better. Also you can secure the plate to the cup using poster hanging sticky tack. It will hold the plate and remove easily when you are done.


The cup and saucer could be chosen to fit a theme, such as a flowery cup for a spring afternoon tea or a favorite motif of the birthday guest.;
, Using a variety of objects with pretty plates, you can create a remarkable table piece that allows for adding different cakes (and cookies) at each level of the tiered stand. For this effect, decide how many layers (up to five is usually good), and what items you have handy to create it. For the supports between each plate, you can use cups, egg cups, sugar bowls, small milk jugs, small vases, etc.––anything you have handy in the sideboard or kitchen! It doesn't matter if it's mixed up if you're creating the ""eclectic chic"" style but if you want it to look more uniform, then stick to one pattern theme and one style of support. To assemble:


Place the largest plate at the base. The basics for creating this stand are––largest plate forms the base, each ascending plate decreased in size until the top plate is dainty and small.
Add the first and most sturdy/strongest support in the middle of the large plate.
Balance the next plate of a slightly smaller size.
Add the next support in the middle of the plate, again ensuring it's safely and solidly balanced.
Continue adding these items until completed.
Assemble the treats around each plate, heaviest at the base to lightest at the top. The top level can be something as cute as a cupcake in a cup or simply some candies in a cup.

, If you're serving cupcakes, follow a similar method to the one outlined in the previous step but only use cups (after all, they are ""cup""cakes). Stack a larger cup on the bottom, topped with a smaller plate, followed by a slightly smaller cup and a larger sized plate, topped with an even smaller cup, leveled off with a medium sized plate. For added flair, you can even get away with making the supports from one cup turned mouth down and another cup balanced on top of that cup with the next plate sitting on its mouth. Don't do this for more than three tiers though, as it risks becoming unstable.

, Votive candles are the small candles used for offerings in some faiths and for small decorative lighting at home. The small size of the containers makes them ideal as a stand support. Look for containers with a sturdy base, wide mouth and made from solid material such as glass or metal. Bear in mind that they must be substantial enough to take the weight of the cake. For the cake plate, choose the one that suits the theme of your occasion and is right for the cake. To assemble the cake stand:


Turn the votives upside down. Add suitable glue to the base of each one and glue them together to form one piece. (Use a glue that matches the material––in some cases a hot glue gun might work but if your votives are made from metal, then super glue or liquid nails will work best.) Allow to dry.
Once bonded together, stand the votive support on the table.
Balance the cake plate on the support, checking that it is sitting solidly, without tilting. If wished, you could glue the plate to the votives but this makes the stand permanent.

, Terracotta pots make terrific centerpiece statements when used the right way. This cake stand is ideal for an afternoon tea in the garden or a party where flowers are a predominant feature. Also, terracotta pots are very solid as a support for the stand. To make the stand, find a clean, unused terracotta pot and a terracotta saucer (the one that captures the water when used as a planter). The pot needs to be smaller than the plate but not so small that the plate causes the whole stand to topple over––test the weight and balance in the store before purchasing. To assemble the stand:


Turn the terracotta pot over and squeeze liquid nail glue over the base.
Place the terracotta plate base centered over the terracotta pot and press down to glue together. Make sure the plate sides are facing upwards and hold the pot to the plate for several minutes until fully bonded.
Once bonded, you have a lovely and budget-friendly cake stand ready for use. It's a good idea to line the terracotta plate with foil and a doily or similar item before adding the cake. This will prevent stains and will reassure guests that it's hygienic.

Be balanced.,

Pinpoint the target audience.,
Write the conclusion.,
Publish the review.",How to Write a Product Review," In order to demonstrate to your readers that your review is reliable, make sure to conduct as much research as possible before you begin writing. A thorough knowledge of the product, its evolution and its competition will allow you to write something approaching an expert review.


Read the manufacturer's website, as well as any manufacturer information included with the product you are reviewing. Beware of publicity material released by manufacturers and retailers - readers will often stop reading if they sense that publicity material is being used rather than observations drawn from real-life experience.
Look into the competition and research the benefits and flaws of products that consumers consider alternatives. This will allow you to compare and contrast the reviewed product with the often numerous alternative products on the market.;
, Buying or renting a product for review is the easiest way to get prepare for a review. However, you may be able to obtain a product directly from the manufacturer or retailer for free if you are persistent.


If you have a blog and wish to post reviews, contact companies through e-mail, a phone call, or even traditional mail. Make sure to be up front about the type of blog you write and the traffic it receives, and keep your message short and to the point.
Larger companies may employ a marketing or sales representative. If this is the case, contact the appropriate representative and pitch your review directly to them., Using and getting to know the product you are reviewing are perhaps the most important aspects of writing a product review. Readers will be looking for genuine knowledge of and experience with a product when they read your review.


Fake reviews that are full of exaggerated praise or criticism are widespread on the internet, and most people will stop reading a review if they suspect it is written with ulterior motives. A genuine appraisal of a product is the best way to draw a reader’s attention. Providing a photograph or video of your interaction with the product will demonstrate to your readers that you have actually used it, and will lend credibility to the review. , There are several reasons why potential buyers read product reviews, and you should think about these as you research and use the product before writing your review. Common questions readers would like answered include:


Is the product easy to use?
Is it of a high quality?
Is it geared towards somebody like me?
Have others had a good experience with the product?
What are the pros and cons of the product?
What alternatives are available, and how do they measure up?
Is the product worth my money? , A good review introduction will not only hook the reader, but also provide a clear picture of the product under review and the product’s advertised benefits.


For first-time users, dedicate some space to explaining the functionality of the product in some detail, treating the product as if all the features are new. Teaching new customers about a product is an important aspect of a product review.
For experienced consumers, focus on the evolution of a product from one model to the next, as well as any common defects or problems users may have encountered in the past. Long-time users of a product will often read reviews for solutions to problems, giving you a chance to demonstrate your knowledge of a product. , Provide the reader with the basic information a consumer likes to know before buying a product. This may include brand name, model number, measurements, target demographic, price, and so on., Talk about what you liked AND what you didn't like about the product. The most helpful reviews are those that outline both the pros and cons of a product, while readers will most likely skip reviews full of effusive praise or bitter criticism.


Make sure to clearly explain how you arrived at your judgments, and specifically address why you believe certain features are beneficial and why you consider others flaws.
Most people will be looking for an unbiased review of a product, and thus a clearly explained, balanced review is more likely to be read than a review that focuses too much on the positive or negative aspects of a product (unless warranted, of course)., Discuss the product under review in light of similar products available to buyers, comparing the pros and cons of each. This will both demonstrate your research and knowledge, and provide the reader with a point of reference when making their next purchase.


This is particularly important for first-time buyers who may require a point of reference before deciding to purchase.

, Describe for the reader who you believe would benefit the most from the product, which will help them to decide whether the product is right for them.


Points of interest may include how easy or difficult the product is to use, specific features that will appeal to particular audiences, as well as how the product relates to other products readers may have used in the past. , A good conclusion will summarize the benefits and flaws of the product, evaluate whether the product lives up to the company’s marketing, and communicate your opinion on whether the product offers good value., Choose the most appropriate forum for your review and post the it online. There are countless online venues for product reviews; some of the most popular include blogs, dedicated product review sites, and product retailers.


Allow some time to pass between the release of a product and the publishing of your review. This will allow you time to properly test the product and arrive at an honest evaluation. Readers will more often trust a reviewer who can demonstrate that they have spent some time with a product before offering a review."

You may be assigned a situation to address or be allowed to choose a situation for the paper. Often the situation will address a social, cultural, or historical issue in society.For example, you may have a main situation like, “obesity and poor fitness,” or “trigger warnings on college campuses.”
If you get to choose the situation, make a list of groups you belong to, such as “school,” “family,” “race,” “culture”,” or “local community.” Then, identify a situation or issue you have encountered as a member of one of these groups.;
, A problem solution paper will contain four main components: the situation, the problem, the solution, and the evaluation. You should structure your paper so it addresses these four components.In the situation component, you will paraphrase the prompt of the paper in your own words.
In the problem component, you will state the problem or problems and explain what they are in your own words.
In the solution component, you will state your solution or solutions to the problem. You will also explain how it will address the problem.
In the evaluation component, you will list the main ideas in the paper and offer a prediction or recommendation based on your solution to the problem.
There will only be one situation presented to you in the prompt for the paper. You can then have multiple problems and multiple solutions that link back to the situation.

, One way you can outline the paper is to use the block structure, where you list the problems first in the paper, followed by the solutions. You will use the following outline for the block structure:Introduction section, where you discuss the situation
Problem 1
Problem 2
Transition sentence or paragraph
Solution 1
Solution 2
Conclusion section, where you discuss the evaluation

, Another possible structure you can use for a problem solution paper is the chain structure, where you discuss a problem, followed by a solution to that problem. The chain structure is used more often for short problem solution papers. You will use the following outline for the chain structure:Introduction section, where you discuss the situation
Problem 1 and Solution to Problem 1
Problem 2 and Solution to Problem 2
Problem 3 and Solution to Problem 3
Conclusion section, where you discuss the evaluation

, Start by writing out the situation in your own words. You can do this in the introduction section of the essay. Focus on a specific angle or perspective on the situation, especially if the situation is broad.For example, if the situation in the paper prompt is “obesity and poor fitness,” you may focus on specific aspects of the situation in the introduction. You may look at how the consumption of unhealthy food and the overuse of cars plays into obesity and poor fitness in society.

, Read as much as you can about the problem, such as scholarly journals online, print books, and academic texts. Look for articles at a national or state level that discuss the problem. Check local publications for discussions about the problem. The more research you do, the stronger your solutions to the problem will be in the paper.If you cannot find a lot of outside material on the problem, you can collect your own data for the paper. Do this by making a survey that you give to people who are affected by the problem. You can also interview people associated with the problem, or with possible solutions.
For example, if you were researching the problem “trigger warnings on college campuses,” you may interview college representatives at your university or college. You may also talk to students on campus.
Most problem solution papers written for exams do not require you to cite any outside sources. You may need to cite your sources if you are writing the problem solution paper for a class.

, A problem solution paper should have a thesis statement that appears in the introduction section and in the conclusion section. The thesis statement will act as the touchstone or guide map for the paper. It should discuss the situation and the problem that you are focusing on in the paper.For example, if you were writing about the situation “obesity and poor fitness,” you may have the following thesis statement: “Obesity and poor fitness can lead to a decrease in life expectancy, and it is essential that individuals and governments work together to tackle this issue by improving their citizen’s diet and fitness.”

, The best solutions to a problem will be easy to implement, effectively address the problem, and be cost effective for all involved. Think about the problem and come up with one to two solutions. You will then explore these solutions in your paper.For example, you may come up with a solution that addresses a lack of resources by adding support, money, or more staff. Or you may come up with a solution that addresses the problem by changing an existing practice or habit.

, Avoid simply listing problems and solutions in the essay in a general way. Use specific examples that allow you to expand on your solutions. Do not use general or vague language when discussing the solutions.For example, if one of your solutions to the problem of obesity and poor fitness is to encourage people to cook at home, you may list a few specific ways people can do this. You may suggest that a national eating healthy at home campaign is created, offering recipes online that take less than 30 minutes to prepare at home.

, Once you have outlined your solutions in the body of the paper, you should end with the evaluation in the conclusion section. The evaluation should discuss your solutions briefly and sum up the goal of your solution. It can also have a call to action, where you note the value of your solution.For example, you may end up a call to action like, “With rising levels of obesity in our country, it is essential that we take action now to address this serious issue.”

, Review the paper and confirm it covers the four components of a problem solution paper. Make sure it addresses the problem and the solution in detail. Check that your thesis statement appears in the introduction and in the conclusion sections of the paper.You can create a reverse outline using your paper as a guide, where you go through each section and confirm it follows the outline you started with.

, Read the paper aloud to yourself to check for any misspelled words or grammatical errors. Try reading the paper backwards, starting at the end, to check for spelling mistakes. Circle the punctuation in the paper and confirm you are using all punctuation correctly.You can also show the paper to a peer, friend, or family member and get them to proofread it for you.

, If you are writing a problem solution paper for an exam, you will often have a set word count. The word count is usually very short, around 250-500 words. Make sure the paper falls under or at the word count. If it doesn’t, you may need to revise it by shortening the sentences, tightening up the language, and making your ideas more concise.If you are writing the problem solution paper for a class assignment, you may still have a set word count. Check that your paper falls within this word count.

Clearly indicate whether you are offering a reason, an objection, or a counter-objection.,
Use examples and analogies to illustrate where needed.",How to Write a Philosophy Paper (for Beginners)," Can you state your thesis and can you give reasons in support of it?;
,


Example: Suppose the thesis is that there is no free will and a reason you offer in support of it is that we are governed by the laws of physics. The diagram will have an arrow running from ""We are governed by the laws of physics"" to the thesis ""There is no free will"". There, of course, may be other reasons in support of the thesis but let's keep it simple.

, Is each reason independently plausible or is there room for someone to raise doubts about it? Also (looking at the arrows), would each reason provide strong support for the thesis or is this support not so strong?

, An objection to the plausibility of a reason will have a red arrow going from the objection to the reason. An objection that the reason doesn't offer good support for the thesis will have a red arrow going from the objection to the reason's arrow.


Example of an objection to plausibility: The objection ""We have minds and minds are not physical"" may be an objection to the claim ""We are governed by the laws of physics"". It is itself a controversial issue (one that may deserve attention in its own right) but do not let that cloud the fact that anyone that accepts this objection will have less reason to believe that we are governed by the laws of physics. This objection would have a red arrow going from it to the reason ""We are governed by the laws of physics"".
Example of an objection to the support a claim offers: The objection ""The laws of physics are not determinate"" is meant to undermine the support that ""We are governed by the laws of physics"" is supposed to give to the main thesis that there is no free will. The idea is supposed to be that you can accept that we are governed by the laws of physics and still believe in free will since you believe that the laws are not determinate. This objection's arrow would hit the arrow that ran from ""We are governed by the laws of physics"" to ""There is no free will"".

, These are called 'counter-objections' or simply 'counters' and they work the same way as reasons and objections do; each statement has an arrow running from it to some other statement or arrow. However, since you are now playing for your own team again, do not use the red ink.

, Life and college is too short. One set of objections with one set of counters in your defense may be enough. However, if there are any obvious replies you should note them. Do not ignore any strong points in the criticism against your argument. (The grader will easily spot them and see the fact that you ignored them as a fault in your paper.)

, Decide whether you will (i) present your entire argument first, then the objections, then your counters or (ii) present your argument with objections as you go. If there are many objections to deal with, go with (i).

,, (A dramatic alternative is to reveal your thesis at the end, but this is generally not advisable in a college paper.)

, And clearly indicate whether that claim (whatever it is) attacks the plausibility or support of another claim.

, For example, a line of dominoes falling over is a pretty clear example of what is supposed to be a determinate process. Likening human behavior to your car's engine is a powerful analogy regarding the issue of free will.

Brainstorm ideas.,
Gather research from various sources.,
Organize your research.",How to Write a Report Quickly and Painlessly2," Once you’ve established what your report will focus on, write down everything that you know about the topic. This will give you a place to start. Even if you don’t know much about the topic, having a starting point for your research alleviates the pressure of not knowing where to start in the writing process.


As you write down what you know about the topic, look for gaps in your knowledge. For example, if you're writing a report about the history of a park in your city, you may realize that you don't know who originally designed the park, or what the area was before it became a park.
Write out questions you'll need to answer in order to complete the report, such as ""What year was the park founded?""

, After you’ve picked your own brain about what you already know about your report topic, it's time to turn to books, articles, and other good sources of information so you can find out more. Verify what you know and expand those ideas by finding more information that supports your ideas. Utilizing different sources can help to build your bibliography of references.It depends on the assignment, but you should aim to use at least three different sources of information when gathering research for your report. Utilize sources such as articles from scholarly databases, articles from newspapers and magazines, book excerpts and credible, trustworthy websites.Many of the sources you need can be found online, which will help you to write your report as quickly as possible.

, All of your sources will contain more information than what you need to complete your report. It's up to you to read the sources and figure out which facts you'll need to include. You may want to print out the sources material so you'll be able to write on it and highlight the parts that will be useful for your report.


Take notes that will help you begin to construct an outline for your report. For example, you may decide to focus your report on comparing your city park's original usage to its modern usage.
Write down the bibliographical information for each of your sources.

Make an outline.,
Write the introduction.,
Lay out the body of your report.,
Write the conclusion.",How to Write a Report Quickly and Painlessly3," If you're in a hurry, you might not want to make an outline. However, this simple step will save you time in the end. An outline lets you map out your entire essay, start to finish. After that, all you have to do is fill in the gaps.Figure out the topic sentence, or thesis, of your report. This is the foundation of your entire report. For example, you could write, ""Central Park, founded in 1891, is still a hub of activity in the Hillsdale community.""
Lay out the body of the report. To use the park example, you might have a paragraph discussing historical information, one on ways the park has evolved, and one on the role the park serves in modern times.
Summarize your conclusion. Reiterate the point you want to make in your report one more time.

, The introduction should contain your topic sentence as well as a summary of the arguments you'll be presenting in order to back up your claim. Aim for an introduction that's at least four sentences long. Since this is the beginning of the report, it's your chance to engage readers (or impress your teacher) and give them a taste of what is to come., Take a look at your outline and begin expanding on the points you made. This is your chance to use the research you gathered and the ideas you brainstormed early in the process. Each paragraph in the body of your report should be at least four or five sentences long. More importantly, it should contain substantial information backed with good examples and facts that you have researched.


Never copy source material word for word. You should always paraphrase, or summarize, the information in your own words.
Many teachers require that a report have at least three body paragraphs in addition to the introduction and conclusion. Each paragraph should build on the last, leading to the conclusion.
If you're having trouble setting up your paragraphs, consider this format: make a statement, back it up with two examples, and make another statement to reinforce your point.

, Even though you'll be reiterating the information you've already discussed, it's important to present it in a fresh way in the conclusion. Drive your point home by bringing in a new example so that readers will see it in a new light.For example, you could point out since the park in your town is still a hub of activity after all these years, it's worth putting in time and effort to keep the buildings maintained.
You could also end with a quote to back up your main points.

It's important to write your bibliography according to the instructions outlined by your teacher. Don't neglect this important step, since many teachers deduct points when students forget to include their source material.

, If your teacher told you a certain font size and type to use, be sure to use it. Most reports are typed in Times New Roman, 12 pt font, and double spaced. The title of the report should be centered at the top of the page. Don't forget to include your name.


Don't attempt to turn in a report formatted in extra large font to make it look longer. Teachers can see right through this tactic.
If your teacher requested a handwritten report, be sure to write neatly and legibly.

, No matter how well-written your report is, it won't seem polished unless you make sure it is free of errors. Check for spelling errors, grammatical errors, and formatting errors. You may want to ask a family member or friend to proofread your report, too, since it can be hard to catch your own mistakes.

Ask a friend to read your thesis.",How to Write a Persuasive Thesis," Some instructors, colleges, and universities have very strict requirements about what a thesis must include.Read your syllabus, assignment rubric, or course website thoroughly in order to understand exactly what is required of you.Some questions to ask yourself include:

How long must my thesis be?
Are there any specific topics I must address, or must I come up with my own topic?
How many sources must I cite?
Do I have to submit any pre-writing assignments (drafts, outlines, bibliographies, proposals, etc.)?;
, Sometimes your research topic is provided to you by an instructor or university. At other times, you are responsible for brainstorming your own research topic.You can consider framing your research topic as an interesting question to answer or as a tough puzzle to solve.If you are coming up with your own topic, be sure to ask yourself the following questions:Is this topic something I am passionate about? Remember that you might spend several weeks or even months working with this topic, so it should hold your interest.
Is this topic relevant to the assignment? Always adhere to the restrictions of the assignment.
Is this topic broad enough to provide me with flexibility, but narrow enough that I can contribute meaningfully to it? For example, ""The U.S. Civil War"" is probably too broad of a topic to be manageable. On the other hand, ""The type of thread used to sew Civil War regimental flags"" might skew too far in the other direction by being too narrow to sustain a lengthy thesis assignment. ""The design of Civil War regimental flags"" is a topic that is just right: broad enough to provide you with plenty of research and flexibility, but narrow enough that you will not be overwhelmed.

, Instructors and thesis advisors are usually very happy to meet with thesis-writers about their topics. They want you to succeed as much as you do.Once you have collected and organized your thoughts, set up a meeting with your instructor to discuss your tentative topic. Take careful notes during the meeting: your instructor might have excellent suggestions for sources, approaches, and ideas that you could include in your thesis.

Some thesis assignments even require that you submit a thesis proposal or annotated bibliography before you are permitted to begin writing.If these are required of you, be sure you follow the appropriate assignment guidelines.

, While it is too early to begin fully delving into your research, you want to be sure that you have a general sense of your topic before you begin narrowing things down. Take a day or two to read some general sources surrounding your topic.This will help you determine whether your topic is a viable one, and it might give you a sense of what your tentative thesis statement might be., A descriptive thesis argues that the world operates in a certain way. A prescriptive thesis, on the other hand, argues that the would should operate in a certain way.Depending on your field of study, you might be expected to craft a descriptive argument or a prescriptive argument. A persuasive thesis can take either form.

For example, ""Voter ID laws discourage minority voters more than white voters"" is a descriptive thesis. ""Voter ID laws should be abolished in order to maintain a democratic form of government"" is a prescriptive thesis.

, Your thesis will be governed by your thesis statement, which is a clear and concise summary of your argument. A thesis statement is usually 1-3 sentences in length.Having a tentative thesis statement at the outset can help your paper remain focused and grounded. However, as you continue researching you might find that your thesis is somehow inadequate and must be revised. This is a normal part of the writing process. Remember that your thesis must be:

ClearSpecificArguableRooted in facts, not pure opinions(though sometimes expert opinion can count as evidence)
Non-judgmental and non-confrontationalRelevant to the assignment
Significant

, One of the most useful things you can do before you begin writing is to carefully plan the trajectory of your research, writing, and revising process. Be sure that you leave yourself plenty of time to accomplish each task, and leave yourself some leeway in case you encounter any roadblocks in your research. Depending on the length and expectations of your thesis, you might spend anywhere from a few weeks to over a year working on a thesis., Different fields of study will have different conventions about what counts as research. For example, a social science field might require that you engage in surveys of human subjects.A lab science field might require that you spend several weeks conducting experiments before you can begin writing. A humanities field might require that you closely examine several primary text sources, such as letters, diaries, novels, or historical documents. Each of these kinds of research might require a different time investment, so keep this in mind as you prepare your thesis.

If your research involves human subjects, remember that you are usually required to get approval from an Institutional Review Board.This can take extra time, so be sure that you submit your project proposal early.

, No matter your field of study, other professionals and experts will have written analyses on your topic or closely related topics. Many theses have a section known as the literature review, in which you describe these major scholarly conversations and debates. Having a thorough literature review will allow you to explain where you stand in these debates. Some types of commentaries you might encounter include:

The results of related scientific experiments
The results of related social science surveys
Theoretical analysis of your topic
Historical analysis of your topic

, Many colleges and universities subscribe to online databases that compile relevant research materials. Sometimes these databases are specific to a single field of study (such as the Literature Online database); others are more general (such as Jstor).By using keyword searches and Library of Congress subject heading searches within these databases, you can acquire a solid list of potential sources that will aid your literature review.

Sometimes these databases will provide you with direct access to an online copy of a book or article. At other times it will provide you with a title that you must track down yourself at another library.
If your university does not subscribe to an online database related to your field of study, you can use open-access searches such as Google Scholar. You might also visit your local public library to see if they have access to online databases that can help you.

, Many colleges and universities have a research library that has extensive holdings that include periodicals, books, and other media (such as films or photographs).Use the library catalog search engine in order to narrow down some potential journal articles and books for you to read.

Remember to scan the shelves that surround the book titles you acquired during your search. Many libraries shelve according to subject, and there might be relevant materials in the immediate vicinity of the books you identified.
Research libraries often employ research librarians who can help you identify additional sources and databases to aid you in your search. Talk to the library staff to see if someone might be willing to assist you with your research project., Not every source you find will be an accurate, scholarly source. Be wary of random internet searches.Make sure that your sources have gone through a peer review process, are published in legitimate journals or with established scholarly presses, and cite their sources properly., Write down key pieces of information as you read your research materials, such as their thesis, methods, key terms, pithy quotations, and major sources of evidence. It can also be helpful to look through the citations of your research materials to get ideas for other sources you might read. It is important to write this information down because you will likely be reading through dozens of sources: it will be easy to forget vital pieces of information.

, In order to ensure that you do not plagiarize, be very careful about citing all of your sources. Whenever you quote another author, refer to another study, or paraphrase a scholarly argument, you must cite your sources.It is the responsible thing to do, and you might suffer huge consequences for failing to cite your sources properly.

, After you complete the bulk of your research process, you will have a lot more expertise in your research topic. Take another look at your tentative research statement. Do you still believe it? Or does your thesis require some revision? Take some time to think hard and carefully about what your new thesis statement might be., An outline is a general, organized sketch of a large piece of writing. It provides a brief overview of each section of your thesis and will likely list the evidence you will use in each section.Be sure that each stage of your thesis helps to affirm your thesis statement.

As you write, you can use the outline as a guide to keep you focused and relevant. However, many people find that they must depart somewhat from the outline as they write: this is a normal part of the writing process.Many long theses are arranged in several, related sections. Consider what sections and section headers you might use to organize your thesis.

, The most effective thesis allows the reader to understand and hopefully agree with the author. Consider who your reader might be and what information they require to understand your topic. For most theses, your imagined reader will be someone who is conversant in your general field of study but is not an expert in your specific research topic.

, The best introductions include a thesis statement in their first two paragraphs. The thesis statement should be strong, clear, and concise. Make sure your reader understands what question your thesis will be answering as well as the methods your paper will use to answer that question., The best theses are ones that are not only accurate but also meaningful. Do not just explain what your argument is: explain why you think your argument is important.Does your thesis change the way your reader might think about history? Does your thesis posit a new method for analyzing cells? Have you uncovered a new angle on a philosophical topic? Describe what is new, interesting, and important about your work., Remember that your reader will not have done the extensive background reading that you have. This means that you have to act as a teacher, explaining what certain terms, events, dates, or methods mean and why they are significant.Do not talk down to your reader. Rather, address your reader as an intelligent person who simply requires a summary of what you have learned during your extensive research., As you work through the body of your paper, take a look at your outline several times. Make sure that you are keeping on track and that your body text is always working in service of your thesis statement.As you write, you might find that you have to revise your outline or change your focus slightly. This is perfectly fine: just remember to keep your thesis statement in mind at all times as you write.

, A paragraph is a set of sentences unified by a single idea or closely related set of ideas. You should treat each paragraph as a separate piece of writing in order to ensure that each paragraph is well-organized and unified.However, each body paragraph must also work in order to further your support of your overarching thesis statement. Make sure that you are not including any irrelevant information or digressions.


Topic sentences are a great way to ensure that your body paragraphs remain focused. Ask yourself whether the topic sentence of each paragraph supports your thesis statement.

, Ideally, body paragraphs will build off of one another, adding up to conclusive support for your thesis. Transition sentences can be used in between paragraphs in order to describe how two paragraphs are related. This can help orient your reader to your way of thinking, and it will also help make your thesis seem more unified., Every paragraph should include some kind of evidence, such as a quotation from a primary source (like a letter or poem), analysis from a secondary source (such as a quotation from an expert historian or the result of a previous scientific study), or the results from your own research investigation (such as the results from a survey you administer). Remember that you have to analyze your evidence: don't simply list it. Explain why you think each piece of evidence is relevant and important. If possible, try to come up with your own interpretation of the evidence., Consider your reader at all times.Orient your reader to important contexts for the evidence you present.Do not expect your reader to be able to understand the evidence as well as you can: think of yourself as a teacher who must explain the context of each piece of evidence., Persuasive theses are rooted in fact, not opinion or hyperbolic rhetoric. Keep your tone neutral and professional. Do not use statements such as ""I think"" or ""As everyone should know."" Instead, present your evidence clearly and analyze your evidence compellingly. This will be a more effective persuasion technique., It might be tempting to hide or minimize counter evidence that you find in your research. However, the most effective theses take such counter evidence into consideration.Think carefully about why the counterevidence should not be as persuasive as the evidence that you present, and ask yourself why your argument is superior to that of those who might disagree with you. If you can deal with counterevidence and counterarguments in a measured and effective way, your thesis will be all the more persuasive for it.

, Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. A first draft should get your ideas, evidence, and analysis on the table. However, there will likely be rough patches, confusing sections, or paragraphs that you will have to rewrite later. Don't get hung up on small details: get the large ideas on paper, and worry about the small things during the revision process., After you have finished drafting the body of your essay, take a few moments to consider whether it is persuasive enough to conclusively support your thesis. Does your evidence add up to what you say it adds up to? Or does it add up to something else? It is possible that you will have to revise your thesis statement again after drafting the bulk of the essay. If you have to change your thesis statement, don't beat yourself up about it. Be proud that you are improving your essay at each stage., A good conclusion should remind your reader about the overarching argument of your paper. What was the purpose of the thesis? What were your methods? Especially for lengthy theses, a conclusion has to tie up the various sections together in order to remind the reader how they are all connected., The best conclusions explain why the previous pages were important. How should your reader's mind be changed after having read your thesis? How have you shifted scholarly discussion?Feel free to move beyond your very specific topic and discuss more general claims., A conclusion is also a great place to discuss parts of your paper that might require further thought. Are there other possible explanations for the phenomenon you discovered through your experiments? Were there variables that you did not take into consideration? Think about some of the gaps of your thesis, and address them in your concluding section., The best theses will answer their research question but then posit new, significant questions. How might this topic be pushed even further in future work? What would you like to see other scholars work on in the coming years? Has your thesis opened up new veins for scholarly work that other people might explore?, Ideally, you should take a few days off in between drafting your essay and revising it. Effective revision has to be done while you are rested, refreshed, and after you have a little bit of distance from your essay. This is an excellent time to work on other projects, catch up on sleep or housework, or do some fun activities with friends., As you sit down with your thesis draft, pretend like you are somebody objective, like a jury member or a journal editor.Try to put yourself into a different mind-space than where you were when you originally wrote the thesis. This will help you identify unclear sentences, sloppy thinking, and poor phrasing more easily., It can be easy to miss typos, grammatical errors, and unclear or incomplete sentences when you are reading a piece of paper. Take the time to read the essay out loud to yourself, at a slow pace. Use a highlighter to mark every word, sentence, or paragraph that seemed confusing or wrong when you said it out loud.

, When you finish reading the essay, consider whether the problem you initially set out to solve has in fact been solved. Be honest with yourself: is your conclusion accurate? If you were a member of a jury, would you believe that your thesis statement has been conclusively proven?If so, great! If not, you might have to consider more serious revision such as:

Changing your thesis statement to reflect the evidence more accurately
Finding new sources of evidence to help prove your case
Adding more of your own analysis to the evidence you have already provided
Dealing more thoroughly with potential counterarguments

, Each sentence should be clear and concise. Stay away from long-winded, abstract, or repetitive sentences. Limit your use of jargon when possible., Remember that each paragraph should be unified, should have an effective transition sentence to relate it to the previous paragraph(s), should have a topic sentence to describe the paragraph, compelling pieces of evidence, and compelling analysis of the evidence.You might find that some paragraphs require more detail, and other paragraphs have irrelevant sentences that should be cut. Other paragraphs might need to be split into two separate paragraphs if they include too much information., In order to determine whether a thesis's overall structure is convincing, write a ""reverse outline."" A reverse outline is made up of the individual topic sentences of each paragraph that you have already written. (This is opposed to a regular outline that you write before you have drafted an essay.) Copy and paste each topic sentence into a separate document, in the order you present them in your essay draft. If the ""reverse outline"" makes logical sense and is convincing, it is likely that you have a solid structure for your paper. If your reverse outline is jumbled up, repetitive, or disorganized, you might have to rearrange your body paragraphs., A thesis should not use contractions, slang, or swear words. Keep your essay appropriate for its scholarly context: it should be professional and objective., Many computer programs will help spell-check and grammar-check your essays. Sometimes these can catch errors and typos. Sometimes, however, they miss typos and might even auto-correct your writing in a way that causes further errors. Don't just rely on your computer to proofread your essay: do it yourself, at a slow pace. Be sure that you catch all grammatical errors and spelling errors.

It can sometimes help to change your font or use a different color of ink when you proofread. Your eyes are more likely to catch an error when your essay is presented in a different format from when you originally typed it.

, Double-check that every quotation and citation is properly referenced and that your bibliography is accurate.Use whatever citation format your instructor suggests, such as MLA, APA, or Chicago. There are many citation guides that can help you ensure that your citations and bibliography are formatted correctly., Sometimes it can be difficult to catch errors, inaccuracies, or clunky writing in your own work because you are too familiar with it. Ask your friends or colleagues if you could trade papers. You will help your colleague edit her paper if she will take a look at yours. Rely on another set of eyes to catch the mistakes that you could not catch.

Sometimes those who edit your paper will provide you with helpful notes. At other times, it might be best for you to follow your own instincts: do not make changes just because a fellow student tells you to. Think carefully about the suggestions, and make corrections as you see fit.
Sometimes you are required to submit a draft of your thesis to an advisor or external reader, who will provide you with comments to help you revise the thesis."

Most often you will have to analyze another piece of writing or a film, but you could also be asked to analyze an issue, or an idea. To do this, you must break the topic down into parts and provide evidence, either from the text/film or from your own research, that supports your claim.For example, ""Stanley Kubrick's The Shining uses a repeating motif of Native American culture and art to comment on America's history of colonizing Native Americans' lands"" is an analytical thesis. It is analyzing a particular text and setting forth an argument about it in the form of a thesis statement.;
, If you are writing this for a class, your teacher will generally assign you a topic (or topics) to write about. Read the prompt carefully. What is the prompt asking you to do? However, sometimes you will have to come up with your own topic.


If you're writing an analytical essay about a work of fiction, you could focus your argument on what motivates a specific character or group of characters. Or, you could argue why a certain line or paragraph is central to the work as a whole. For example: Explore the concept of vengeance in the epic poem Beowulf.
If you're writing about a historical event, try focusing on the forces that contributed to what happened.
If you're writing about scientific research or findings, follow the scientific method to analyze your results.

, You may not immediately know what your thesis statement should be, even once you've chosen your topic. That's okay! Doing some brainstorming can help you discover what you think about your topic. Consider it from as many angles as you can.Look for repeated imagery, metaphors, phrases, or ideas. Things that repeat are often important. See if you can decipher why these things are so crucial. Do they repeat in the same way each time, or differently?
How does the text work? If you're writing a rhetorical analysis, for example, you might analyze how the author uses logical appeals to support her argument and decide whether you think the argument is effective. If you're analyzing a creative work, consider things like imagery, visuals in a film, etc. If you're analyzing research, you may want to consider the methods and results and analyze whether the experiment is a good design.
A mind map can be helpful to some people. Start with your central topic, and arrange smaller ideas around it in bubbles. Connect the bubbles to identify patterns and how things are related.Good brainstorming can be all over the place. In fact, that can be a good way to start off! Don't discount any ideas just yet. Write down any element or fact that you think of as you examine your topic.

, The thesis statement is a sentence or two that summarizes the claim you will make in your paper. It tells the reader what your essay will be about.

Don't: write a vague or obvious thesis such as ""Revenge is a central theme in Beowulf.""Do: make a specific argument such as ""Beowulf explores different styles of vengeance in the Anglo-Saxon age, contrasting the dragon's honorable retribution with the response of Grendel's mother.""


This is an analytical thesis because it examines a text and makes a particular claim.
The claim is ""arguable,"" meaning it's not a statement of pure fact that nobody could contest. An analytical essay takes a side and makes an argument.
Make sure your thesis is narrow enough to fit the scope of your assignment. ""Revenge in Beowulf could be a PhD dissertation, it's so broad. It's probably much too big for a student essay. However, arguing that one character's revenge is more honorable than another's is manageable within a shorter student essay.Unless instructed to write one, avoid the ""three-prong"" thesis that presents three points to be discussed later. These thesis statements usually limit your analysis too much and give your argument a formulaic feel. It's okay to state generally what your argument will be.

, Depending on your assignment, you may need to work only with your primary sources (the text or texts you're analyzing) or with primary and secondary sources, such as other books or journal articles. The assignment should tell you what types of sources are required. Good evidence supports your claim and makes your argument more convincing. List out the supporting evidence, noting where you found it, and how it supports your claim.Example of supporting evidence: To support a claim that the dragon’s vengeance was more righteous than Grendel's mother's, look at the passages in the poem that discuss the events leading up to each monster’s attack, the attacks themselves, as well as the reactions to those attacks.

Don't: ignore or twist evidence to fit your thesis.Do: adjust your thesis to a more nuanced position as you learn more about the topic.


, An outline will help structure your essay and make writing it easier. Be sure that you understand how long your essay needs to be. While some teachers are fine with the standard ""5 paragraph essay"" (introduction, 3 body paragraphs, conclusion), many teachers prefer essays to be longer and explore topics more in-depth. Structure your outline accordingly.


If you're not quite sure how all your evidence fits together, don't worry! Making an outline can help you figure out how your argument should progress.
You can also make a more informal outline that groups your ideas together in large groups. From there, you can decide what to talk about where.
Your essay will be as long as it needs to be to adequately discuss your topic. A common mistake students make is to choose a large topic and then allow only 3 body paragraphs to discuss it. This makes essays feel shallow or rushed. Don't be afraid to spend enough time discussing each detail!

, Your introduction should give your reader background information about your topic. Try to make your introduction engaging but not too overzealous. Avoid summarizing the prompt--it’s best to simply state your argument. Also avoid dramatic introductions (beginning an essay with a question or exclamation is generally best to avoid). In general, do not use the first (I) or second (you) person in your essay. State your thesis, generally as the last sentence in the first paragraph.



Example introduction: Revenge was a legally recognized right in ancient Anglo-Saxon culture. The many revenges in the epic poem Beowulf show that retribution was an essential part of the Anglo-Saxon age. However, not all revenges are created alike. The poet's portrayal of these revenges suggests that the dragon was more honorable in his act of revenge than Grendel's mother.
This introduction gives your readers information they should know to understand your argument, and then presents an argument about the complexity of a general topic (revenge) in the poem. This type of argument can be interesting because it suggests that the reader needs to think about the text very carefully and not take it at face value.

Don't: include filler and fluff sentences beginning with ""In modern society"" or ""Throughout time.""Do: briefly mention the title, author, and publication date of the text you're analyzing.


, Each body paragraph should have 1) a topic sentence, 2) an analysis of some part of the text and 3) evidence from the text that supports your analysis and your thesis statement. A topic sentence tells the reader what the body paragraph will be about. The analysis of the text is where you make your argument. The evidence you provide supports your argument. Remember that each claim you make should support your thesis.Example topic sentence: The key to differentiating between the two attacks is the notion of excessive retribution.

Example analysis: Grendel's mother does not simply want vengeance, as per the Medieval concept of ‘an eye for an eye.’ Instead, she wants to take a life for a life while also throwing Hrothgar’s kingdom into chaos.

Example evidence: Instead of simply killing Aeschere, and thus enacting just revenge, she “quickly up” that nobleman and, with him “tight in her clutches,” she leaves for the fen (1294). She does this to lure Beowulf away from Heorot so she can kill him as well.
The formula ""CEE"" may help you remember: Claim-Evidence-Explanation. Whenever you present a claim, make sure you present evidence to support that claim and explain how the evidence relates to your claim.

, Quoting means that you take the exact text and, placing it in quotation marks, insert it into your essay. Quoting is good when you use the precise wording of something to support your claim. Make sure that you use the correct form of quotation, depending on if you are using MLA, APA or Chicago style. Paraphrasing, on the other hand, is when you summarize the text. Paraphrasing can be used to give background or compress a lot of details into a short space. It can be good if you have a lot of information or would need to quote a huge portion of text to convey something.Don't: quote from more than two passages per paragraph, as a rule of thumb.Do: support all subtle or controversial claims with quotes or paraphrasing.



Example of a quote: Instead of simply killing Aeschere, and thus enacting just revenge, she “quickly up” that nobleman and, with him “tight in her clutches,” she leaves for the fen (1294).

Example of a paraphrased sentence: The female Grendel enters Heorot, snatches up one of the men sleeping inside it, and runs away to the fen (1294).

, Your conclusion is where you remind your reader of how you supported your argument. Some teachers also want you to make a broader connection in your conclusion. This means that they want you to make a ‘bigger world connection’. This could mean stating how your argument affects other claims about the text, or how your claim could change the view of someone reading the text you analyzed.

Don't: introduce a completely new argument in your conclusion.Do: expand beyond your thesis statement by discussing its implications or wider context.



Example conclusion: The concept of an ‘eye for an eye’ was very present in the early Medieval world. However, by comparing the attacks of both Grendel's mother and the dragon, the medieval world’s perception of righteous vengeance versus unjust revenge is made clear. While the dragon acts out in the only way he knows how, Grendel's mother attacks with evil intent.

Example conclusion with a ‘bigger world connection’: The concept of an ‘eye for an eye’ was very present in the early Medieval world. However, by comparing the attacks of both Grendel's mother and the dragon, the medieval world’s perception of righteous vengeance versus unjust revenge is made clear. While the dragon acts out in the only way he knows how, Grendel's mother attacks with evil intent. As we saw from the study of other characters, these portrayals may tie into an early Medieval perception that women had greater potential for evil.

, A paper that contains many mistakes generally gets a lower grade than one that has been proofread and polished. Run a spell check, look for run-on sentences, and check for punctuation errors.


Make sure to also format your essay correctly. For example, using a 12-pt standard font (like Arial or Times New Roman) and 1"" margins is standard.

, Reading out loud helps you to find places in the essay that might sound awkward. This is also a great way to find run-on sentences that you might not have noticed before.

, are spelled correctly. Teachers will often mark you down if the name of a main character is spelled incorrectly throughout your paper. Go back to the text or article and confirm that your spelling is correct.


If you are analyzing a film, look up the list of characters online. Check two or three sources to make sure that you have the correct spelling.

, Do you get your point across clearly? Is the structure of your essay easy to understand? Does your paper explain why the topic matters?

, Is there anything they think you should add or remove? Do they understand the point you are trying to make?

Do not skip this step. Although this seems to be like a painstaking process, if you don't write an outline, you will have a lot more work in your essay owing to disorganized information. Use index cards and find similar information. Pair this information together in the same paragraph. Do not write the information on the outline. Number your index cards so that you can look at the information when you write the essay.

, You can also go back to your instructor.

, A thesis in an academic essay is usually written at the end of the introduction. It is the statement you intend to prove with the rest of the essay. For example, you can use a certain action by a literary character as ground that he or she is insane, and expand upon it.

, This will not be the final product, so you should not treat it as such. Write what first comes to mind following your outline, it is okay if it doesn't meet the length requirements quite yet.


Try to put in all the punctuation, capitalize beginning letters and proper nouns, and follow your outline.

, Each point on your outline should be its own paragraph. A paragraph should contain a minimum of three sentences to stand on its own.

, Then follow it with 'Impact'.


The claim is a statement, which is then supported by the evidence such as a reference or a quotation in context.
The impact is an intelligent review of how or why that claim is important in the context of the essay. The 'impact' then becomes the claim of the following paragraph, and so on.

, Beef up any paragraphs that don't provide much information or argument. Additional research may help you in this process.

, A transitional phrase eases the reader from one paragraph to the next. If your outline was written well, these phrases should link the content in one paragraph to the next.

, After you've written the second draft, edit it. Start in general: fix spelling, capitalize beginning letters, add periods, etc. If you are experienced with grammar, you can start sentence by sentence.


Eliminate rhetorical questions, or passive verbs such as was, were, is, etc, and make passive sentences active ones.

, Be sure this is in the correct format (many teachers and professors require you to use MLA format but ask first, assume nothing). Use both the computer's spell-check, and read it over yourself as well. If you are unsure of your spelling or grammar, have a friend, classmate or family member read it before you print the copy you plan on handing in.

Obtain a copy of the APA's Publication Manual.,
Check your word processing program for APA templates or style guides.,
Know the format of your soon-to-be manuscript.,
Get everything in the right order.",How to Write an APA Style Paper1," This can be found at a bookstore, your local library or online. It includes detailed information specific to writing an APA style paper and the newest edition includes sections on print ethics, Internet sources and tables and charts.


There are several different editions -- it's best to stay up-to-date and get the most current one; once in a while, standards change.;
, Microsoft Word, WordPerfect and EasyOffice have built-in features that automatically format bibliographies, endnotes, footnotes and citations according to APA style.


If you're not entirely sure that your computer has this format, don't guess. You'll be better off formatting it yourself than just hoping for the best.

, Formatting your paper in APA style means paying attention to mechanical details such as typeface, line spacing, margins, and page headers. In order to get full marks on your assignment, you'll need to meet all of these requirements.


Use a 12-pt serif typeface, like Times New Roman, for the text of your manuscript. Use a sans serif typeface, such as Arial, for figure labels.
Double-space the entire manuscript. Double-space between lines of body text and titles, headings, and block quotations. Double-space the reference list and figure captions.
Indent the line of every paragraph 1/2"".
Align the test to the left-hand margin, leaving a ""ragged"" right margin., Every page should be numbered, in specific order, and separate from other sections. When you submit your manuscript, number the pages consecutively starting with page 1.


Page 1 is your title page.
Page 2 is your abstract.
Page 3 is the beginning of your main text.
References begin on a new page after the main text.
Each table begins on a new page after the references.
Each figure begins on a new page after the tables.
Each appendix begins on a new page.

"
"
Start your title page.,
Insert a ""running head"" at the top of your title page.",How to Write an APA Style Paper2," Prepare it by centering the title roughly one-third of the way down. The title should not exceed 12 words. Hit ""Return"" or ""Enter"" and then type your name. Underneath your name, include your university or institution of learning.


Everything should be double-spaced and centered. Your title should contain no filler words or abbreviations.
If you have any ""Author's Notes,"" place them at the bottom of this page. This could include information on any grants received or where correspondence should be issued to., This ""head"" is a condensed version -- not to exceed 50 characters -- of your paper's title. The uppercase words ""RUNNING HEAD: "" should appear as the first page header and be left justified.


You'll need a header on every page. After the title page, do not include ""RUNNING HEAD."" Just the title of your work is required. Flush right should be the page number, again on every page."
"
Compose your abstract.,
Start the body of your work.",How to Write an APA Style Paper3," This should be between 150 and 250 words and on a new page. It is a description of your paper that focuses on its purpose, processes, outcomes and conclusions. The abstract should be on its own page right after the title page with the heading ""Abstract"" centered at the top. No bold, italics, or underlining is necessary.Don't forget your header! For this page, it's your title and page number.
In your abstract, be sure to include all the extras: your research topic, questions posed, information on participants, methods, results, analysis of data, and extra tidbits on your conclusion. You may also find including implications to be an interesting perk; what future work on the topic do you see looming on the horizon?You may also want to list keywords from your paper in your abstract. Type Keywords: as if it were the beginning of a new paragraph and subsequently list your keywords. This will let researchers (or otherwise) looking for topical material find your work in databases., This is, in short, your paper. The rest is formatting mumbo-jumbo that is required of you. In this section (on a new paper directly after the abstract), include the same header and page number, restate your title, and begin your work.


Once more, everything should be double-spaced and the paragraphs indented in on the first line.There are four main sections to the body of an APA style paper: introduction, method, results, and discussion. Title each section in bold font, centered; that is, not including the introduction -- the introduction's title should be the title of your paper, in regular font. Your professor should outline in class the basics of these sections. Each subject will have different requirements.

For methods, center Method wherever it falls on the page. Include Participants, Materials & Procedure, and Correlations (and whatever other subheadings you see fit) as sub-headings that are flush left and bold.
For the results section, center Results wherever it falls on the page. No subheadings or sections are necessary.For the discussion section, center Discussion wherever it falls on the page. No subheadings or sections are necessary."
"
Compile your references on a separate page following the final page of text.,
Learn how to cite in APA style.,
Attach any tables, figures, or notes.,
Proofread your work.",How to Write an APA Style Paper4," The word ""References"" should be centered at the top. Alphabetize the entries according to the author's surname. In cases where no author's name is provided, alphabetize the entry according to the initial word in its title. Word processing programs with built-in APA style features will automatically format your references.


Adhere to the author-date style when citing a reference within the text. This is done by inserting the author's surname and the year of publication, such as (Smith, 2010), with the entire reference listed under ""References.""

, For different types of sources, there are slightly different regulations. Once in a while, requirements change -- ask your professor if they require the most current of requirements.


While the APA manual provides many examples of how to cite common types of sources, it does not provide rules on how to cite all types of sources. Therefore, if you have a source that APA does not include, APA suggests that you find the example that is most similar to your source and use that format., If you have information that supports your work, but is a little wordy or excessive, include it after the bulk of your paper. Also include any tables or charts that illustrate your research.


Footnote lengthy explanations by placing a superscript number directly after the designated text. A separate page called ""Notes"" should be added at the end of the manuscript.

, As you go over your finished paper, you'll need to be monitoring for a few things: flow and clarity, punctuation, spelling and grammar, and if all APA guidelines are met. Go over your paper three different times, concentrating on a different aspect each time.


Take some of the stress of yourself by having a friend read your paper and go over your punctuation, spelling, and grammar. You have enough on your plate with the formatting and content.

Read and analyze the essay question.,
Research the foundation/school/etc before writing the essay.,
Outline your essay before you write it.,
Answer the question.,
Stay within the word count range.",How to Write an Application Essay for a Scholarship1," You’re going to want to make sure you understand the essay question before you write anything. But this isn’t just about understanding the question or prompt itself; you need to also understand why they’re asking the things that they are. What are they trying to find out about you by asking this? Analyze the question and try to figure out what they’re looking for so that you can respond appropriately.


For example, questions about your area of interest are really trying to gauge your passion for your subject and how well you know it. Questions about current events are probably trying to gauge how aware you are of the world around you and how well you understand complex issues.;
, Foundations, schools, and other organizations granting scholarships often have core values which drive their company. If you want to impress them, research and find some of the key terms and core values that they use consistently and work those ideas and terms into your essay., An outline is a road map to writing your essay, and without a road map you will get lost. Write down each of the points you want to make in answer the question, with a few notes on how you will make those points or evidence you will use. Figure out the best order for all of your paragraphs and write that down too.Consider also making notes about how you will transition between paragraphs. Good transitions will help your reader follow and understand your thought process, so it is important to do this well.

, Make sure that when you do write the essay, you actually answer the question they asked. This is important: don’t answer the question you think they asked, answer the question that they actually asked. Sometimes, especially when reading quickly or without enough depth, we tend to take the wrong message away from something. Make sure that what you’re writing is what they want to know.

, Staying within the word count will keep you from losing some serious points. Too long and no one will want to read it. Too short and you will seem incompetent. Try to stay within the upper 20% of the word count range.

Give your paper one final review.",How to Write a Two Page Essay Quickly," This is your first step towards completing your essay quickly. You will want to make sure your surroundings are comfortable, and that you have all the tools that you will need (computer, paper, etc.) easily accessible. Make sure that the atmosphere is right for you. If you work best in silence, head to the library. If you need a little background noise, try music or working in a coffee shop.;
, A successful essay will have a clear focus, so it is important that you clearly define the topic of your essay. It is easier to write about something that interests you, so if at all possible, try to tailor the topic of your essay to something that appeals to your curiosity. For a two-page essay, it's important to choose a narrow topic so that you can adequately discuss it in a short space.


If your instructor has given you a clear prompt, decide now how you will approach the question. For example, if the given assignment is ""Write an essay on the women's movement. Was it successful?"", you will need to decide which side you are going to take. Once you narrow your focus, your essay will be much easier to organize.
If you have a much broader assignment, it will be up to you to focus your topic. For example, if your assignment is ""Write about something that interests you"", you will not want to make the topic of your essay ""Sports,"" especially for a short two-page essay. Choose a very specific topic, such as ""Tailgating in the American South."", Make sure that you understand the assigned topic. For example, if you are writing an essay for an English literature class about the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, make sure that you have thoroughly read the book. Think about what you know about the topic. If you need to do any additional research, this is the time.


It's unlikely that you will need further research for a two-page paper, but if you aren't sure about the requirements, ask your teacher.

, If you have notes that you have made while researching the topic, make sure they are organized. Put them in an order that makes sense to you so that you can easily find information. If you are planning to use some online resources, try to have the webpages already pulled up, so that you don't have to break your concentration by searching for the information you need. This is a great time to make sure that you also have the instructions for your essay. Did your teacher or professor or boss give you instructions? They did that for a reason. Make sure to follow them.

, Are you thinking that maybe you need to take your dog for a quick walk? Go ahead and do that. If something is on your mind other than your paper, try to take care of it quickly if you can. Otherwise, concentrate and focus on your paper. The rest of your life will still be there when you get done. And that time will come much more quickly if you are organized and focused.

, There are several methods to help you formulate your thesis. One of these techniques is called questioning. To use this approach, think about what your or your reader might like to know about your topic. This can be as simple as starting with basic questions such as who, what, why, etc.


For example, if you're supposed to write a two-page essay about something that interests you, think about who your audience is (and how much explaining you'll have to do), what is the most relevant information, and why your topic is interesting to you.
Branching is another technique you can use while creating your thesis. Try to imagine your topic as a tree. Write your basic idea in the middle of your paper, and then ""branch"" out from there, adding ideas and thoughts to your central topic.
Another approach to try is brainstorming. To do this, write down anything and everything you know or need to know about your topic. Don't edit yourself, just get some thoughts down on paper. Once you can see your ideas, they will start to take shape. It's often helpful to do this before you try to write a formal outline, as you'll have a better idea of what you want to cover., The thesis is the most important part of your essay because it tells your reader exactly what you are arguing. In other words, it clearly and concisely explains the points that you are making in your essay. If you do not have a strong thesis, your essay will be vague and overly general. A strong thesis illustrates that you are going to use specific examples to help illustrate your points. For a two-page essay, keep your thesis specific and narrow.For example, if you were writing an essay about college sports, a poor thesis would be, ""College sports are very controversial in many ways."" This is too vague, and it does not clearly take a position to argue. It will leave your reader wondering what argument you are making in your essay.
An example of a strong thesis for the same topic might be, ""College athletes should be paid a salary for playing their sport."" This is more successful because it indicates the topic you will address. It's also limited enough that you can adequately discuss it in a two-page paper.

, Once you have the thesis, which will be the ""center of gravity"" that guides the rest of your paper, you can put the rest of your ideas down. Creating a detailed and thorough outline can make the rest of the writing process much faster and easier. An outline is a great way to get your ideas down on paper without having to worry that your writing is perfect. Just make sure that you don't get too hung up on this stage -- your essay will develop and evolve as you write it, and that's okay.


You don't necessarily need to do a formal outline to start with. Brainstorming or making a list-type outline, where you list out ideas that are related to your topic without putting them in a specific order, can help you know what you want to write about.
Once you have listed the ideas that support your thesis, you'll have a better sense of how to organize them.

, Thesis statements will often signal the specific examples you will use in your essay, such as this thesis: ""College athletes should be paid because they bring in a huge amount of money for their universities, provide profit for corporate game manufacturers, and often sustain physical damage during their college career that follows them into later life.""


Note that not all teachers prefer or even accept this type of thesis, which is often referred to as a ""multi-prong"" or ""three-prong"" thesis. However, this type of thesis is often appropriate for very short writing assignments such as a two-page essay. If you're not sure what your teacher's preferences are, ask before you begin writing.
It's helpful to list specific examples in your outline, so that you know what evidence you have for each point. This can also be helpful to show you whether you have gaps or imbalances in your approach. For example, do you have just one example for one point, but three for another point? It would be better to use roughly the same number of examples per point, or even see if the less-supported point could be incorporated elsewhere.

, This will save you time during the writing process. Make sure you know which style of citations is required. Some of the most common styles are MLA, APA, and Chicago, and you should make certain to ask your teacher which you should use.


One type of citation is known as parenthetical documentation. For this method, you provide information about the source within the text of your essay. An example of this would be, ""Brown argues that Einstein's theory of relativity is the most important scholarly achievement of the twentieth century (292)."" The name Brown refers to the author of the book in this example, and 292 is the page number where this information is found. There are different ways to cite various sources, so make sure you know how to properly credit all of the sources you plan to use.Sometimes you may be asked to use footnotes or endnotes. While less common in brief essays, some teachers and bosses prefer them. Footnotes and endnotes include more thorough information about the source used. Often, when they replace parenthetical documentation, a Works Cited page is not required., Now that you are extremely well organized, you're ready to write! This part should go quite quickly if you've made a thorough outline. An essay typically has at least 3 body paragraphs. These should each relate directly to your thesis. Their purpose is to support your argument.Make sure that each body paragraph has a topic sentence. This sentence makes it clear to your reader what each paragraph is about. For example, if you were writing an essay about the labor force during World War II, you might say, ""Women were an important part of the workforce in World War II because they learned new jobs that were previously reserved only for men.""
Include specific supporting examples in each body paragraph. For instance, if you were writing an essay about the labor force during World War II, you might say, ""Many women became welders during World War II, which illustrates that gender roles in the workplace were changing.""

, These are often the most difficult and time consuming parts of writing an essay. An introduction should be a road map for the rest of your paper, and it should also make your reader want to continue reading your paper. Your conclusion ""wraps up"" the essay, reminding your readers of your argument and its importance. It's often helpful to wait until you've drafted the body of your essay to write the introduction and conclusion, because you'll have a much clearer sense of your full argument and its significance.Start off with a broad contextual statement, but don't make it so broad as to have no relevance. Statements that begin like ""Throughout history"" or ""In modern society"" are ""fluff"" statements and don't provide any real context for your argument.
A good way to think of your introduction is as an inverted pyramid. Start with the broad statement that sets the scene, and then narrow down until you reach your thesis.
Include your thesis statement at the end of the conclusion.
Spend some time on your first sentence. It should be interesting and grab the attention of your reader. Try starting with a fascinating example or an exciting quotation.
Use your conclusion to tie together the strands of your argument. In some cases, such as persuasive essays, it's appropriate to include a call to action. You can also return to an anecdote or theme you brought up in the introduction to give your paper great symmetry.

, Don't try to sound ""fancy"". Make clear statements that your reader can easily understand. Always remember, if you can say it in one word, there is no reason to use more. Also, make sure to use words that your reader understands. There is no point in trying to jazz up your essay by relying too heavily on the thesaurus--your points should be clear and easily understood.Watch out for the passive voice. Beginning writers often use the passive voice because it's wordier, which may be mistaken for ""fancier."" Here's an example of the passive voice: ""It is believed by many that today's growing social violence is being caused by video games."" Be verbs are often signs of passive voice. Reword it actively this way: ""Many people blame video games for today's growing social violence."" This is a clear grammatical order: People (subject) blame (verb) video games (direct object).
Avoid wordy constructions such as ""It is believed that"" or ""This is suggestive of that."" You can communicate these ideas more clearly and concisely: ""People believe that"" or ""This suggests that.""

, Your prompt or course may give you specific guidelines about what's appropriate for your essay. The essay topic can also help determine what stylistic approach to take.Some short essays may be more appropriate in the first-person, using ""I."" If you've been assigned to write a personal or persuasive essay, the first-person voice is often more personal and effective than using third-person.
Aim for parallel structure in sentences. Often, sentences end up sounding clunky if you ignore parallel structure. For example: ""Paying college athletes is more important than to give them scholarships."" Convert the infinitive ""to give"" to the gerund form ""giving"" for parallelism: ""Paying college athletes is more important than giving them scholarships.""

, A successful essay clearly shows connections between each paragraph. These transitions illustrate that your points are related to one another, and they are all related to your thesis. Your transitions can either be at the end of a paragraph or integrated into the topic sentence of the following paragraph.Here are some examples of transition words: similarly, in comparison, as a result, otherwise. During the editing process, you can try using several variations to see which best fits your style of writing., You will need to edit carefully, and then edit again. A well-edited paper can often make the difference between a ""C"" or ""B"" paper and an ""A"" paper. But before you begin, give your brain a break. Clearing your mind can help you more objectively evaluate your essay once you begin the editing process. You'll be able to more easily spot errors if your mind is refreshed. Take at least a few minutes to step away from your essay before you come back to it., Of course, you will want to read through your essay, making sure to correct any errors. But don't be afraid to take advantage of spell check. Just remember to also edit on your own. Spell check can't help you with content issues.


Be aware that the ""grammar check"" in word processors is often incorrect about issues, and may even suggest changes that make your writing incorrect. Don't rely only on technology.

, Even if it feels strange, try reading your paper out loud to see if it flows nicely and sounds logical. This is also a great time to enlist outside help. Try asking a family member, friend, or classmate if they would mind listening to part of your paper. Even if you just read them the introduction, this can be very helpful in catching problems.

, This is the time to make sure that you have properly cited all of your sources. Remember, you need to give credit for direct quotes, specific facts, or any ideas that are not your own. It's important to properly cite sources so that your teacher or boss knows how you conducted your research. It is also important because you want to avoid plagiarism at all costs. When in doubt, cite your source., Go back through and look for any unnecessary words--if you don't need them, get rid of them. A thorough edit can help you to tighten the focus of your paper and ensure that your ideas are highlighted. A polish also helps you to make sure that your paper looks professional and sounds logical and organized., Try to make it creative, but keep it concise. The title should indicate the topic and be direct and easy to understand. During the editing process, keep your eyes open for possible title ideas as you reread your paper.


There are several methods for creating a title. One idea is to begin your title with a question, such as ""How..."" or ""Why..."". Another method is to choose a specific example that occurs within your paper and use that as a starting point for your title., Are your points clear? Are your transitions smooth? Are all of your errors corrected? In order to answer these questions, make sure to read every word, and read them slowly. If you're satisfied, your essay is ready to be turned in!

If you have plenty of time before the due date, set up daily goals to help you stay on track with all of the research and writing you might have to do. Spreading out your workload will definitely help take away some of the stress.;
,


Obviously this step isn't anthropology-specific, but it really is one of the most important steps when it comes to writing any paper.
Try to start and finish your outline in one sitting.  You can always edit it as you move along, but having a complete outline before you start the actual writing process will help you work a lot quicker and more efficiently.

,


American anthropology has four distinct sub-fields: archaeological, cultural, linguistic, and biological/physical.  Knowing how you can apply one or more of these sub-fields to help support your argument is crucial to anthropological writing.
How do you know which field applies to your paper's topic?  The answer is usually all of the above.  In very basic terms, everything that has anything to do with people can be observed and analyzed anthropologically.

,


The Internet is a magical and wonderful place for conducting research.  Just make sure that you know where to look when it comes to credible resources.
Know the difference between scholarly and public sources.
Get familiar with your school's library system.  Many universities and colleges have free and easy-to-access websites that can access great material.

,


This is the official formatting guideline for the American Anthropological Association.
You can access a free PDF of it here: http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm

Although you may not use this format in an introductory-level course, anyone who wishes to pursue their degree in anthropology will most certainly have to write a few papers using this.

,


Make sure you understand all of the vocabulary and key concepts from your notes and textbook.
Does your thesis statement makes sense and do your topic sentences support your claims?
Do you have enough sources for your assignment?  Are they credible, accurate, and relevant?

,


Remember to follow your outline and stick to your writing schedule (if you made one).
Take short breaks every hour or so to review your work, or to simply just give yourself a rest.

, Find yourself an editing buddy.


Ask them to look for things like logical flow of ideas, clarity, and get their overall opinion first.  Spelling and grammatical errors should be noted, but not the main focus of this part in the editing process.
Once you have their feedback, start working on your final masterpiece.

, You can either have someone else do this or do this yourself. Final checkpoints:


Have you completed all of the prompts or answered all of the questions that may have been listed in the rubric?
Did you meet the length requirements?
Does the format and citation style comply with the rubric as well?
Can you identify your thesis statement and topic sentences?
Did you successfully support your claim?
Did you cite your sources properly?
Are there any spelling or grammatical mistakes?
How did you apply your knowledge of anthropology in this paper?

Use firm language and a passionate tone.,
Tell your story.,
Show your strengths.,
Show why your shortcomings don’t matter.",How to Write an Application Essay for a Scholarship2," When you answer the questions, you want to sound like someone who does things on purpose and with conviction. This is the kind of person that people want to give scholarships to because it tells them that you’re actually going to go out, do things, and make their money count.


Don’t use words and phrases like “maybe”, “sort of”, “I try...”, or “I hope...”.
Do use words and phrases like “I’m sure...”, “I can...”, and “I will...”.

, You want your essay to be uniquely you. You want it to convey your story, not a story that could belong to anyone else. Find what makes you unique and work that into your essay. This can range from personal experiences to personal passions, and anything else you can think of., Use your essay to tell people what you’re good at. Show them your strengths and make sure to back up those strengths with examples. If you want to convey that you’re really organized, for example, tell them about how you helped your homeroom teacher completely revamp her storage system to be more efficient. Remember: don’t just tell...show.


For example, you can talk about your social skills. Tell them about how your frequent interactions with people have taught you to appreciate people from all walks of life and that

, You will also want to acknowledge that you do have failures or shortcomings. This humanizes you and makes you sympathetic. However, it is also very important to show how those shortcomings don’t hinder you. Talk about how you overcome them and how you work through your problems. This makes you look smarter and more competent.


For example, if you’ve had some bad grades in the past, talk about how you used to have trouble prioritizing but that you worked out a system to help you focus and stay motivated.
Another example would be if you didn’t have a lot of social extracurriculars, like cheerleading or clubs. Discuss how you are shy but that you are starting to find new ways to ease yourself into situations that make you uncomfortable so that you can improve your social skills.
Does your academic and activity background look really all over the place? Disconnected and random? Don’t worry about this making you look unfocused. All you have to do is play up how well rounded all of these activities have made you. “With these experiences, I am ready to handle any situation or hardship that comes my way with ease and excellence.”

Reread the essay to make sure you covered everything.,
Rewrite your essay.,
Have someone edit it for you.,
Wait to send it.",How to Write an Application Essay for a Scholarship3," Once you’re done writing it, make sure that what you wrote really answers the question or prompt and that your answer covered everything you wanted to cover. Rereading is a really useful step and can make a huge difference in the quality of any writing.


A useful trick is to wait a day or two before rereading your essay for the first time. This will help your brain to recognize mistakes because it won’t remember what you intended to write and fill in the blanks.

, As you reread, you will almost certainly find things that you could have explained better or mistakes that you made. Copy edit your paper and look for grammar and spelling mistakes, tense problems, or even sentences which are correct but sound weird. Rewrite as much or as little as you feel is appropriate and don’t be afraid to rewrite again.


One trick to making sure that your text sounds perfect is to read it out loud to yourself. This will make it easier to spot problems and awkward sentences. Try to replace awkward sections with text that mirrors how you actually speak.

, Editing is very important. You can be an excellent editor with a fantastic knowledge of grammar and spelling and still make mistakes. If you give the essay to someone with good editing skills, they can only help you improve it by catching things that you might not. You can give your essay to a parent, a teacher, or a guidance counselor.

, While you shouldn’t wait until the last minute, you should give it a little time before sending it in. This will give you time to think more about the answer and how you feel about what you wrote. If you still like it after waiting for a bit, send it in.

Don’t write the essay last minute.,
Avoid using boring language.,
Don’t ramble.,
Don’t whine.,
Avoid making yourself seem perfect.",How to Write an Application Essay for a Scholarship4," Don’t wait until the last minute to write your essay. This will make you rushed and lower the quality of your work. It will also take away from the time that you could have spent perfecting and editing your essay. How much time you need is really dependent on you, but do make sure that you give yourself enough.


Take into account that it might be harder than you thought. It could also be that you end up being a lot busier than you thought. You may not have as much time available as you plan to so make sure to leave yourself lots of wiggle room.

, Don’t sound cliché, and don’t use all of these overused descriptors. You really need to make your essay stand out so use language which is active, exciting, and engaging. A good way to do this is to follow the advice above about making it personal and passionate.

, Make sure that everything you write clearly ties back to the question you were asked and the unifying statement of your answer. You don’t want someone to get to the end of your essay and say, “What did I just read?” In fact, if you get too off topic, they probably won’t finish reading it at all.

, Don’t make your essay into some sob story. It shouldn’t be about someone giving you money because you’ve had such a hard time. Everybody has had a hard time at one point or another. You should instead make your story one of triumph in the face of adversity. They will want to give you money if they see you as someone who can defy the odds.Having a sob story and then defying the odds by trying to go to college isn’t really enough, by the way. Having a really tough time and still getting good grades or managing to hold down a job during high school is much better.

, This gives the impression that A) you have a very unrealistic view of yourself and your abilities or B) you’re lying or C) you’ve never had to work through problems and will be unprepared to handle the stress of college or whatever it is you’re studying.

The eight areas of knowledge covered in a TOK essay are:Mathematics
Natural sciences
Human sciences
History
The arts
Ethics
Religious knowledge systems
Indigenous knowledge systems;
, These titles, or essay topics, are created by the IB and will ask you to compare and contrast ways of knowing with one to two areas of knowledge. These questions change every exam period, so you can't fully prepare for the essay until you have the correct questions. You will need to remain objective throughout the essay and present both sides of the title in a clear and concise way.For example, two prescribed titles for the 2007 TOK essay were:“Compare the roles played by reason and imagination in at least two Areas of Knowledge.”
“When mathematicians, historians and scientists say that they have explained something, are they using the word ‘explain’ in the same way?”

, Look for a topic that contains an area of knowledge you are familiar with or interested in. But avoid grabbing on to a topic immediately because it sounds appealing or simple. Instead, reach each title carefully on the list and ask yourself several questions:Do you understand the key words or concepts in the title? You may not be clear on what a title is asking you to do. Go through the title and highlight any words or concepts you are unsure about. Some titles will use keywords from TOK courses, such as “belief”, “knowledge” “truth”. You may want to check back on your class notes and consider what these words mean in the context of the title.
Do you have a strong interest in the title? The title should play to your interests and you should feel you can write about the title with care and diligence. For example, if you are skilled or interested in the arts, you may choose a title like “Compare the roles played by reason and imagination in at least two Areas of Knowledge” and pick the arts as one area of knowledge. Keep in mind, however, you should balance your passion for the title with an objective perspective.
Do you have something relevant to say about the title? It’s important that you relate the question to the ideas you have covered in your TOK course, as well as the topics you have studied in class, and your own personal experiences or thoughts. The essay should have an objective tone, but you will still need to inject it with personality, passion, and clarity.

, Many TOK titles can seem confusing or convoluted when you first read them. You may struggle to understand key words or terms in the title, or you may not be sure what you are comparing and contrasting in the title. One option is to re phrase the title and break it down into one to two sentences so it becomes more clear.For example, in a title like: “When mathematicians, historians and scientists say that they have explained something, are they using the word ‘explain’ in the same way?”, you may re phrase it into two sentences. The title refers to three AOK: mathematics, history, and science. It is then asking you to compare and contrast the way these three AOK use explanation as a way of knowing about a topic or issue.
By breaking down the title into short sentences, you now have a clearer picture of what the title is asking you to do and how you might go about answering the title sufficiently.

, The IB uses four criteria to grade your essay, each of which carries equal weight. You should have a copy of these criteria and have them in mind as you write your essay. The four areas you will be assessed on include:Understanding the knowledge issues: your essay must be focused on the knowledge issues, link and compare at least two knowledge issues, show relevancy between at least two knowledge issues, and demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of the knowledge issues.
Knower’s perspective: your essay must demonstrate independent thinking, self-awareness, at least two different perspectives, and several supporting examples.
Analysis of the knowledge issues: your essay must show insight and depth, justify your main points, present arguments and counter-arguments, and explore any assumptions and implications of your topic.
Organization of ideas: your essay must be well structured, explain key concepts, be factually accurate, and cite references where applicable.

, Note the keywords in the essay instructions. You may be told to “assess” or “evaluate” a claim. This means you must consider arguments for and against the title, and take into account any ambiguities or grey areas related to the title.


You may also be asked “to what extent” or “in what way” a statement is justified. You will then need to present for and against arguments for the statement.
If you are asked a direct question, your essay should address to what extent or in what ways you are for and against an argument or position.

, Before you dive into your outline, get your ideas flowing by taking five to ten minutes to brainstorm. The TOK essay is primarily a reflective essay, so you will want to demonstrate you have thought about the title and are prepared to reflect on and analyze the title.


Start by doing a general, open brainstorm. Write down everything that comes to mind when you think about the title without passing judgement on any of the ideas, or stopping to read over your brainstorm.
After five minutes of brainstorming, read over your notes. Identify ideas that relate to each other or that contradict each other. If you are evaluating or assessing a claim in the essay title, create a for column and an against column. Group your brainstorming ideas into either column. Create a third column for grey area ideas, or ambiguities, and place ideas in that column.
Note any examples of the ideas that you wrote down. For example, you may be addressing a title like: “When mathematicians, historians and scientists say that they have explained something, are they using the word ‘explain’ in the same way?” You may create a brainstorm for each area of knowledge (mathematics, history, science) in relation to the idea of explaining something. You may then use examples of “something” that can be explained in each AOK: a mathematical equation, a historical moment in a battle or a trial, and a scientific theory.

, The knowledge issue will be a question or issue that refers to your understanding of the world, yourself, and others, in connection with the search for knowledge. You are trying to answer the question: “How do you know?” A knowledge issue in an essay title will relate to one or two eight AOK (Mathematics, Natural sciences, Human sciences, History, The arts, Ethics, Religious knowledge systems, Indigenous knowledge systems) and should examine the potential problems or conflicts in these areas of knowledge or between these areas of knowledge.


You should also identify the areas of knowledge you will be discussing in your essay. For example, for a title like: “Compare the roles played by reason and imagination in at least two Areas of Knowledge” you may choose two AOK: the arts and science. You may then compare and contrast the function of “reason” and “imagination” in the arts and in science.

, Use your brainstorming session and your chosen AOK to create an essay outline. This outline will act as your roadmap and help you structure your essay in a concise and clear way. Your essay outline will be dependent on the type of essay title you choose. If you are writing about one to three AOK, for example, in a title like: “Compare the roles played by reason and imagination in at least two Areas of Knowledge”, you may structure your essay using a simple five paragraph format.Paragraph 1: Introduction. You would provide an explanation and interpretation of the title and identify the key terms in the title. You would also state your thesis and explain or identify a knowledge issue related to the title.
Paragraph 2: First Area of Knowledge. For example, the arts. Discuss how the arts answers the title and provide supporting examples. You should also note any counter arguments against the title or any limitations of the supporting examples.
Paragraph 3: Second Area of Knowledge. For example, mathematics. Note how mathematics answers the title and provide supporting examples. You should also note any counter arguments against the title or any limitations of the supporting examples.
Paragraph 4: Third Area of Knowledge (if applicable)
Paragraph 5: Conclusion. Summarize your main ideas and restate your thesis. Conclude by answering the title fully, taking into account the counter arguments and limitations of the areas of knowledge.
You may also decide to structure your essay based on a main argument and a main counter argument. Your outline may contain four paragraphs total:Paragraph 1: Introduction and explanation of the knowledge issue.
Paragraph 2: Main argument, with justification and one to two supporting examples.
Paragraph 3: Main counter argument, with justification and one to two supporting examples.
Paragraph 4: Conclusion.

, Read over the essay title again, as well as your brainstorming notes and your essay outline, before you create your thesis statement. Your thesis statement is the fundamental claim you are making in the essay, and should link everything in your essay together.


Some students find it useful to draft their thesis statement once they have finished writing a first draft of the essay. By this point, you will likely have a better sense of the main arguments in the essay and be able to write a clear, concise thesis statement.
For example, you may need to create a thesis statement for this title: “Compare the roles played by reason and imagination in at least two Areas of Knowledge.” You have chosen two AOK: the arts and mathematics. Consider how reason and imagination function in the arts and in mathematics, as well as the different ways they function in each AOK. Your thesis may be: “Through reason and imagination play an important role in both mathematics and the arts, the imaginative thoughts of mathematicians must be provable, while the imaginative thoughts of artists need only be reasonable.”, Focus on expanding each section of your outline, keeping in mind the 1200-1600 word limit for the essay. Your introduction and your conclusion should be the shortest paragraphs in your essay, and the body paragraphs should be the longer sections of your essay.


You may want to also refer back to your brainstorming notes to identify the supporting examples for your two areas of knowledge, or your main argument and your main counter argument.

, You want to show the TOK assessment committee that you are writing a reflective essay, not a textbook definition heavy essay. Don’t rely on dictionary definitions to prove your argument or support a counter argument. This will demonstrate that you did not engage with the topic and bypassed complexities around the topic in favor of generic definitions.For example, you may be discussing the use of reason and imagination in the arts. Rather than discuss a familiar artist, like Picasso, or a familiar example of imaginative thinking, like the Sistine Chapel, use supporting examples that feel original and insightful. Though the essay should be objective in nature, it should also feel reflective and personal. Using a supporting example that you feel passionate about, like Pollack’s kinetic movement paintings, or Rodin’s sculptures, will show you have taken the time to explore unique examples.

, When you are writing your TOK essay, you will likely need to cite external sources when quoting a source or paraphrasing a source. MLA style is a common citation style used in essay writing. Use this guide when citing sources:Reference surprising or little known claims, but not well known facts or commonly held opinions. For example: “The sun is the center of the solar system” is a well known fact you will not need to cite. But “Rodin was a traditionally-schooled artist and had a craftsman-like approach to his work” will require a citation as it is may be a little known fact.
Reference any sentences or sections where you are closely following someone else’s train of thought or argument, even in your own words.
Reference exact quotes, and use quotation marks.
Be consistent with your citations and the way you reference certain sources.

, This will help you determine how precise and clear your language is, and confirm your arguments are well structured and well supported. There should be a natural rhythm to your writing and a certain flow from one section to the next.As you read your essay out loud, make sure there are no vague or abstract sentences or terms. You want to ensure you use your 1600 word count in a clear and concise way. Every word will count in your TOK essay.
Confirm you have addressed knowledge issues in your essay. Your essay should answer the question “How do you know?” and assess the strengths and weaknesses of knowledge claims in at least two areas of knowledge. You should also use arguments and counter arguments to support your thesis statement, as well as strong supporting examples.

, In your final pass through your essay, take the time to address any misspelled words or grammatical errors. Read the essay backwards so you can identify each word and ensure there are no obvious errors in the text."

Read and understand the prompt. Learn how many paragraphs it must consist of besides an introductory and closing paragraph. Most often times, it will need anywhere from two to three body paragraphs besides the intro and concluding paragraph.

Make sure the prompts wants you to write an essay and not just a simple short answer that could consist of a few sentences to one full paragraph.


Pick a position/argument to organize your essay. Think in terms of the pros and cons of the arguments and what supporting details lead you to the facts you'd like to present in the essay.
Jot down an outline on some scrap paper
Write the essay based on the outline! Don't ever write without some notes and knowledge of the subject at hand.
Proofread your essay. No reader ever wants grammatical and spelling errors to be present.
Submit on time.;
, For a longer or shorter essay, use this same time ratio for each step.

Read and understand the prompt = 1.5 minutes
Pick a position = 1.5 minutes
Jot down an outline = 2 minutes
Write = 21 minutes
Revise = 3 minutes
Submit = 1 minute

, For a 30-minute essay, it would look like this:

Introduction: 3 minutes
Paragraph 1: 6 minutes
Paragraph 2: 5 minutes
Paragraph 3: 5 minutes
Conclusion: 2 minutes

, If you don't know where you're going with your essay when you start, it's likely that the end product will not be as focused as you want it to be., That way, each paragraph leads into the next, making it easier to both write and read., Wearing a wristwatch is recommended so you don't have to rely on a clock in the room or on the proctor announcing how much time is left., You don't have much time to get your ideas across or revise, so you should focus on getting the message across well., Make sure that there are no grammatical errors nor any spelling errors nor any errors that would make you want to scratch your head wondering what you meant by your statements., Essays that aren't long enough, won't' be well understood and those that are too long can sometimes be quite wordy and loose the concept fairly quickly in each paragraph of the essay.,, Did you cite your sources, if external sources had to be used? Make sure that the reader can get the information from any applied sources or books that could be used to back up the information you presented., Perhaps it's a boss who wants to learn about why his employee is doing something wrong, or perhaps it's a teacher who wants the student to explain his viewpoints on things inside a book., Most often times, with teachers, you can say ""Thank you"" to them as you hand them the papers, but most want the essay as well as the notes you took and the test/answer booklets you wrote the essay on."

Show the essay to others for review.",How to Write a Theme Essay," A theme essay usually responds to a specific prompt given to you by a teacher or professor. Most essay prompts will ask you to identify the theme, or the overarching message, in a text. Look at the terms used in the prompt and highlight keywords or important terms. This will help you identify what you need to address as you write your essay.For example, an essay prompt may ask you to reflect on the theme of good versus evil in John Steinbeck's East of Eden.;
, Once you've read and considered the essay prompt, brainstorm how you can write your essay. In your essay, you will use research and evidence to support a central argument. Start to jot down examples you can use to reflect on the theme.Make a list of everything you know about the topic. This can be information you learned in class, as well as information you found on your own.
Write down keywords or key scenes in the text that respond to the essay prompt. Think about what words or scenes from the text come to mind when you think of a specific theme.
For example, when you brainstorm ideas on East of Eden, you may write down any moments in the text that seem to speak to the theme of good and evil.

, A thesis statement is a single sentence that summarizes the entire essay. You'll need to include this thesis statement in your introductory paragraph, and the rest of your essay will need to support it.


Your thesis statement will need to address the theme, your primary example or examples, and the stance you will take on the topic.
For example, your thesis might be: ""In East of Eden, John Steinbeck rejects the Biblical idea of good and evil and instead focuses on the contradictions and complications found in good and evil.""

, Once you've figured out your thesis, you can begin outlining your essay. Some teachers may require a 5-paragraph essay while others may want the essay shorter or longer. A typical essay outline has three main parts: the introduction, the body, and the conclusion.For example, using the East of Eden prompt, your outline might be:

Introduction: Discuss landscape as metaphor, include thesis statement.
Body: Describe mountains in opening scene, elaborate on how they symbolize good vs. evil, state how characters live between the mountains, showing how people are caught between good and evil.
Conclusion: Restate thesis statement, return to landscape as metaphor.



, Your introduction should have a first sentence that hooks readers in. From there, you can give a brief overview of what the essay will discuss. Your thesis statement should appear somewhere towards the end of your introduction.


Questions can make fun hooks for the reader. Ask a rhetorical question that relates to the theme of the essay, such as ""How does one decide what is good and what is evil?""
You can also use a quote from the text as the hook. Find a quote in the text that explores the themes and ideas you'll be discussing in your essay.

, In your body paragraphs, introduce your supporting ideas. The beginning of each body paragraph should introduce a main point. The main point should connect back to your thesis statement and your discussion of a particular theme in the text.


For example, you may introduce the role of nature plays in the text to discuss the theme of good and evil. The first sentence of your body paragraph should discuss the role of nature. This will set up the paragraph and let the reader know what the focus of the paragraph will be.

, Once you've introduced your supporting ideas, elaborate on them using quotes or references from the text you are analyzing. All your paragraphs should circle around the central theme or thesis of your essay, using the text as evidence.For example, you may discuss the use of nature in the text in one paragraph. The body of the paragraph should then use quotes and scenes in the text to support this idea.
You might write,""The descriptions of the Gabilan Mountains in the text symbolize good and evil. The characters in the story live in the Salinas Valley, trapped in a gray area between these two extremes.""

, A good conclusion should sum up your main ideas and leave the reader with a memorable closing line. Restate your thesis statement in the conclusion, using slightly different wording.Ask yourself, ""What do I want my readers to have learned through this essay?""
Remind readers about the essay's theme. Reference some of the arguments you made in the body of your essay, reinforcing how they support your original point.

, Review the essay to make sure there is an introduction, body, and conclusion. Check that your thesis statement appears in the introduction and conclusion of the essay. Make sure you have evidence in the body paragraphs to support your thesis.


Check that there are transitions between paragraphs. Look at the beginning of each paragraph to make sure they all flow well together.

, Read the essay backwards to catch any spelling or grammar errors. Circle all the punctuation marks in the essay to confirm they are correct.


Print out your paper and proofread it. Oftentimes, errors are easier to catch on paper. If you can't print out your paper, try changing the size or type of the font. Anything that alters how the work looked when you wrote it can help alert you to errors., It can be difficult to critique your own work, especially if you have been staring at it for a while. Ask a friend, peer, or family member to review your essay for you. Have them check the essay for grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Ask them if the essay flows well and explores a theme well.


Be open to constructive feedback from friends and peers. This will only improve the essay and ensure it is at its best when you turn it in.

Formulate your argument.,
The Introduction.,
The Body Paragraphs.,
The Summary.",How to Write a Texas Format Essay," There's no harm in planning your essay. You are normally given spare paper to do this in an exam situation. You will be marked up if the examiner can see that you followed some kind of process of planning.Once you have your ideas, create a rough essay plan, detailing where you will put your arguments and what examples you will use to back it up. Once you've done that, you can begin writing the actual essay.

, This a five line paragraph that tells the reader what you're going to talk about. The first line should state the problem you're arguing about. Some examples might be, ""Teenage drivers are irresponsible,"" or ""Saddam Hussein deserved to be executed."" You need to tell the reader you're talking about this before you actually talk about it. You'll also need to remember to:


Mention your individual points. But try not to describe them. Just briefly mentioning them is fine.
Banter, a brief sentence that is not quite on topic is a must.
Don't make your introduction too long. Try to keep to five lines, seven at the most. An essay I wrote about Overcrowded Roads began thus:
""Traffic Jams have become an issue in New Zealand. This is because of overcrowded roads, and is quite a problem in centers such as Auckland. Several government initiatives have been introduced to solve the problem, such as more roads, better traffic management and more public transport. However, I don't think these are the best solutions.""
Notice how the first line grabs the readers attention. I then go on to elaborate, revealing the actual issue I'm talking about. Then I mention the government initiatives (banter) and then set out my three main points in order of appearance. I tie off the paragraph by expressing my view. Your introduction needs to be a subliminal contents page. The reader has to know where you going before you go there. A common mistake people make in essay writing is saying, ""In this essay I will talk about..."" You will almost certainly be marked down for this. Be imaginative in replacing this phrase.

, This is where you'll do your arguing. You should have at least three of these. More is good, but you may run out of time if you go too long. This is where TEXAS really comes into play. Here's what TEXAS stands for:

T - stands for Topic. Here you state what you'll be talking about in the paragraph. It only needs to be one line, just enough to specify what you're talking about.
E - stands for Explain. Here you will elaborate on your Topic, giving the reader more information about what it is. One line will do here, but two is more beneficial for your mark.
X - stands for Example. This is where your paragraph comes to the crunch. You will have to use a real example. If you're to a Response to Literature, you'll need a real quote. If you're doing a formal writing essay you'll be able to get away with a looser interpretation of the word 'real'. You necessarily be judged on the content of your quote, but more on how you use it to back up your argument.
A - stands for Analysis. Here you discuss how your example backs up your argument. Two lines is a good bet here, the more you show how much you understand your example the better. Feel free to start it off with, 'This shows how..."" or ""Here we see..."" You shouldn't get marked down particularly, but you'll get marked up for a more original link.
S - stands for Summary. This often means repeating your Topic statement with more affirmative grammar. Rearranging the words never hurt either.
Put all of this together and you get a TEXAS paragraph. A paragraph trying to prove overcrowding on roads might go:
""New Zealand roads are seriously overcrowded. Everyone owns a car, and everyone uses them.This has lead to crowded streets and more traffic jams. A government report released in 2006 showed a 20% increase in traffic jams over the last 10 years. This is the direct result of too many cars on the road, and the government is concerned about it. If the government is concerned so should we be. New Zealand roads are far too overcrowded.""
Notice how my example wasn't accurate; I got a merit for this paragraph despite this. The reason I got merit was because I did not use the more complicated paragraph form TEXAXAS. This is simply where you add in an extra example and analysis. TEXAXAS is not a crucial component of getting an Excellence, but it helps. The real reason I got a merit on this paragraph was because I used a generalization in the second sentence. Try to avoid these, the markers don't like them. I'd have been better off if I'd said ""Most people own a car..."" instead of everyone.

, This is similar to the introduction in that there is a fairly loose structure code. You have to summarize your main points, mentioning examples if possible. You should try to finish the essay by tying it off with a snappy line, like I did in this next example. This was about whether or not success in sport is all about winning. I got excellence with this.


""All in all, success is winning. The two words are the same. And anyway, why would you play a sport if you didn't intend to win? Who would rather lose than win? The derogatory term 'loser' is not showered on the successful. Success is winning, so unless you win, you lose.""
Despite my 'excellence' grade here, I could have done better. If I'd used examples from earlier in the essay to back up the points mentioned here, I'd have done far better. Note how I used questions. Examiners love this, finishing with a question leaves the reader thinking. Although it may not get you extra marks, it will give the examiner a better opinion of your essay. Also note how I tied off, using a slightly rhetorical statement. This brings the impact of the entire essay home in one hit, leaving the reader knowing what my argument was.
Writing a TEXAS essay isn't difficult, anyone can do it. Writing one well is the trick.

Add your view to the end of the paragraph.,
Write the conclusion.",How to Write a Successful Essay," If your teacher or lecturer has already provided the topic for you, you're all set and you can skip onto the next step if you want. But if your teacher hasn't, then you need to think of one. An excellent topic should draw people's attention to read the article just by reading the title/topic. A couple interesting ideas are: Money isn't as Important; Looks Don't Matter; What Soda Can Do Besides Increase Weight (this is a really interesting topic, and, yes, it's true that soda has a good side)


Make sure that your topic relates to the assignment, and that you can support it using various mediums, such as the internet or a book.;
, Most people think that writing the introduction is the toughest part of the essay, but, really, the introduction is one the easiest parts. All you do is write a topic sentence, and follow-up with a couple interesting facts about it. Just a couple sentences (3-5) should complete your introduction.


Write a hook. Grasp the readers attention by adding facts or other interesting info about your topic. This is placed at the start of your paper, and if used correctly, will hook the reader into reading more.

, For example, if your introduction is: ""Everyone should help animals. If you ponder about this topic, we humans are extremely spoiled compared to the creatures, from colossal to puny. By joining hands and using our continuous-increasing technology, together we can help the animals at every chance we can, one creature at a time."", then your next paragraphs should be saying how you can help the creatures.

, A thesis statement is a one or two sentence summary about what your paper is going to prove. Make sure this is detailed, specific, and well written. The thesis statement is an essential element of any paper.

, A typical paper will have two-three sub topics for support. These will be stated at the start of each body paragraph, and also in your thesis.

, You already have your topic sentence, which is your claim. Now, use textual support and other data to prove this claim. Use books, the internet, and even videos to support your topic sentence. The commentary is the main part of any writing piece.

, Write your reaction to the support you have just provided. Include your opinions and beliefs about the topic.

, When writing a conclusion, you should put together your main point (this should be your last sentence of the entire essay), a little bit of the introduction, and a little bit of the in-between paragraphs (the paragraphs between the introduction and conclusion). In other words, your conclusion should contain bits of your other paragraphs, and the last sentence should be your main point.


For your conclusion, state your thesis in a different, unique way. Summarize your whole paper, and leave a lasting impression on your readers.

Avoid starting sentences with anything along the lines of ""And at that moment I knew"" or ""I learned that..."". Not only will these make your essay sound cheesy and fake, but they will also take away from your word count. Instead, use your words to show the admissions committee why your topic is important.
Don't repeat yourself. Remember that the admissions committee has already read your personal statement, so you want to keep things interesting for them. Not only do you want your topic to be fresh, but you want your voice to be fresh too. Use a different writing style—a different tone, different vocabulary. Access and represent a part of yourself that was not shown in the personal statement.

, At this point it would be a good idea to show your work to family or friends. Don't tell them your goal with the story—have them tell you what they took away from it. If they get a different message than you intended, or if they don't get a message at all, don't brush it off as a one time thing. Sit down with them and talk about ways to better make your intended message come across. Repeat the process once you've made the necessary edits; you'll likely need more than two drafts to reach an acceptable final product.


If your family members and friends don't think that your essay works, listen to them. While the idea may seem brilliant to you, other people's reactions are probably more indicative of what those of the Admissions committee will be like. Don't be afraid to start from scratch if you receive a negative response.

No reader is going to hinge her impression of your essay on your decision between two equally reasonable options. In fact, your reader isn’t even going to be aware of your choice. A decision over minutiae rarely makes or breaks an essay. If you’re in an advanced stage of writing and puzzling over two (or even three or four) compelling possibilities of sentence structure or word choice, chances are, all of them are fine.

Be positive.",How to Write an Essay Without Procrastinating," A good way to start organizing your work is to break it down into smaller and more manageable chunks. Doing this will mean you can progress through the essay piece by piece, stay focused and measure your progress more easily. Having clearly defined sections of work means you will never be too far from the end of one particular task.If you start from scratch with a blank page and want to write the whole essay in one sitting, you could find it a very imposing task. This could put you off and lead to procrastination.
The blocks you could use include: research, essay plan, introduction, first draft, part one of essay, part two of essay, conclusion, referencing, and proofreading.
Knowing you are only doing one thing at a time can make it easier to maintain motivation.;
, Some procrastinators suffer from a need to have a thorough knowledge of a subject before they can begin writing. For others, the research is the more enjoyable part of the assignment than the writing, where there is less pressure and you can browse the internet and books without having to put pen to paper.


Remember that you are writing an essay, not a book, so you need to limit the amount of research you do and ensure that you don't let it take up all your time. Ending up down a research rabbit hole will not help you finish your essay on time.
If you have made endless pages of notes on your research, you won't necessarily be able to use it all in your essay anyway.
Try to keep your research tightly focused to the topic of your essay and avoid the temptations to broaden it out too far.

, Once you have broken your tasks down into more manageable sections, you can organize your priorities. Drawing up a to-do list will help you to visualize the amount of work you have to do and the amount of time you have to do it in. Structure your list around the sections you have already identified and try to attach specific deadlines to each job. For example, if you want to finish your research two weeks before the essay is due, write this down on your list and stick to it.


When you are writing, you might give yourself a set number of pages or words to write each day. Two pages or 1000 words can be a good and reachable daily target.
Be sure to cross off items as you complete them. This can be a satisfying moment. You will see your list of tasks diminishing as you progress, which will help you to maintain motivation and focus., Once you have broken down all your tasks and organised them into a list of things to do, you need to plan your time around these jobs. Go through your diary or timetable and set aside time each day to work on your essay. Try to be as specific as possible and assign particular tasks to particular timeslots. For example, you might write Monday 7pm - 8pm: revise introduction.Try to be realistic about the amount of time each task is likely to take you. There's nothing worse than being too optimistic about how quickly you can work and finding yourself behind schedule right from the start.Writing is very personal and different people will have different approaches, so think about whether you are someone who writes freely but needs more time to proofread. Perhaps you write more slowly, but your writing is very accurate., When you are scheduling in the time you need to spend working on your essay, you should not forget about the world outside the essay all together. Go through your timetable and mark in all the times when you are normally occupied by other work, social, family and sporting activities. Try to protect some of these to give you a break from the essay.


This schedule will also reveal how much time you really have to do the essay, which is likely to be less than you think.
Once you have a clearer picture of how your time is occupied, you will be able to plan your work schedule more effectively.
You might think you have two weeks to do the essay, but once you have factored in all your commitments you could discover the number of free hours you have shrinks dramatically., When you are scheduling in time to work, you might think that you always need to set aside a couple of hours in order to make in worthwhile. This isn't necessarily the case. Experts believe that one hour blocks, or 50 minutes with a 10 minute break, may be the best way to organize your schedule, but if you have half an hour or 45 minutes free you can still get a good amount of work done if you concentrate., Once you have developed a schedule for your work it's important that you really try to stick to it and push through any tough patches. Having clear goals for each session can help to motivate you. Be prepared to be a little flexible, but if you lose essay time doing something else be sure to make it up later.


Reward yourself as you progress through your work. Anything from a cup of tea to a break watching an episode of something on TV can be a good reward to work towards.Taking scheduled breaks can help you study more effectively and be more focused.The Pomodoro Technique encourages you to set a timer for a certain period of time, such as 35 or 50 minutes, and then take a break when the timer rings.
Although it's important to have scheduled breaks, you need to be mindful not to let a 10 minute break extend into a 30 minute break, or a half hour break stretch into an hour.
If you notice that a break has run on, don't give yourself a hard time, but do make up for it by rescheduling the lost time. You may need to take time away from other fun things to make up for the extra break.

, You can use the experience of writing an essay to learn about how you work and how you can improve your work in future. Keep track of how long certain tasks take you compared to other ones. If you find yourself spending much longer on your introduction than you had imagined you would, remember this the next come you come to write an essay.


Learning how long tasks actually take you is an important part of improving your study skills and your essay writing.
Learn from the experience so you set aside enough time to write the best essay you can every time., Before you begin writing your essay you should make a complete plan that details the structure of your essay. The plan should give you the opportunity to organize your notes and thoughts before you start writing properly. One of the key things to remember when you are planning is to maintain focus on the essay question.


Plan your essay with a clear basic structure of: Introduction, Discussion, Conclusion.One way to plan an essay is to break the question down into sub-questions, but be sure you keep returning to the main question and answer it fully. For example, if your essay topic asks you to ""Discuss the impact of nature vs. nurture on human development,"" sub-questions could include ""What is the impact of nature?"" and ""What is the impact of nurture?"" You could even break it down further by asking questions of those, such as ""What are sources of nature and nurture?""
Planning makes it easier for you to have a clear trajectory and coherent argument in your essay., Often people procrastinate because they don't feel they have a complete enough knowledge of a topic, or a clear enough idea of their argument. The fear of failure or underachievement is thought to be a big factor in procrastination. Try to counter this by allowing yourself to write a first draft that is not up to your usual standard. Remember this is just a draft and is not the finished article, and nobody needs to see it apart from you.A first draft can give you the opportunity to get your basic ideas down on paper and get some momentum going with writing.
Analyzing a draft will also help you see where there are gaps and weaknesses in your knowledge and argument.
When you look through the draft, ask yourself if you are really addressing the essay question.If you aren't sure, ask a friend or fellow student to see if s/he thinks you're on track.
If you finish the draft before the due date, you can also ask your teacher or professor to look over your essay. You could also make use of facilities such as tutoring or a writing center consultation.

, One good tip to keep in mind when you are planning and writing an essay is to be aware of the word or page count. If you know how many pages or words you need to produce you should factor this into your plan and try to stick to the outlines you give yourself.


For example, if you say your introduction will be half a page long, stick to it.
Keeping the word count in mind will also help you see the progress you are making in the essay.
Monitoring the word count as you write and revise your essay will give you the best chance of producing a well-balanced and structured essay which doesn't end before you have fully made your argument.
If you're having trouble meeting your word goals, try something silly such as Written Kitten, a website that rewards you with funny cat pictures for every set number of words you write.If you respond more to fear as a motivator, you can try Write or Die, which will sound alarms or start deleting your writing if you don't meet your set goal in a certain timeframe.<re>http:

, It is always important to set aside time to proofread your essay and make some revisions before you submit it. As well as an opportunity to check and correct any grammar or spelling mistakes, reading through your essay thoroughly gives you the best chance to analyze its strengths and weaknesses and ensure that you are focused on the essay question.If you have gone over the word or page limit, proofreading enables you to see which parts you can cut out to get you back under the limit.
When you are proofreading, think about the precision and concision of your language, too. Things like the passive voice make your writing less clear. (In passive voice, that sentence would be ""Your writing is made less clear by the passive voice,"" which you can see is wordier and not as clear.)Be sure to check you have written and referenced it according to the appropriate style guidelines.
The more practice you get proofreading your essay critically, the better you will be able to analyze your writing in the future., If you are trying to write your essay but you have all sorts of distractions around you, it should not be a surprise to find yourself procrastinating. Try to avoid distractions by finding a quiet comfortable place to work, switch off your phone and think about turning off the wi-fi on your computer.


You can even install browser applications that will block specific websites like Facebook, but still allow you to use the internet for research.
Make sure everyone in your house knows you are studying and not to disturb you unnecessarily.
Only listen to music if it doesn't distract you. For some people instrumental music can help them focus, but this doesn't work for everyone., Sometimes it can be a major help just to try and modify your attitude towards the essay and think of it as an opportunity rather than a chore. Taking a positive attitude towards a task will help you stay focused and avoid procrastinating. Think about what you are learning and the writing and research skills you are developing. Talk to friends and classmates about the topics to try and develop your interest.You might consider starting or joining a writing group with friends where you sit and write quietly in the same room.
Being in a room full of people writing can be a good motivational tool, especially if you are going to discuss your essays together at the end.

Make sure that you understand the assignment.,

Consider your paper from multiple angles as your revise.,
Read printed version of your final draft out loud.",How to Write an Ethics Paper," Before you begin your ethics paper, take some time to read through the assignment guidelines, ask questions about the assignment, and think through what you need to do in this paper. Get answers to some questions before you start on the assignment. You should ask:What is the main objective of the assignment?
What specific things do you need to do in order to get a good grade?
How much time will you need to complete the assignment?;
, If you're writing the paper as a class assignment, the topic may already be given to you. If not, choose a topic that is both interesting to you and that you know a good deal about. Your topic should be very broad at first, after which you can develop it into a specific inquiry.For example, you might begin with a topic of ""ethical problems of euthanasia."" This is very broad, and so forms a good starting point.

, After you have selected a topic, you will want to narrow your topic down to a more specific issue. For example: ""ethical problems of euthanasia for patients suffering extreme, constant pain."" This will allow you to go into much more depth in your paper, and will help you avoid the pitfall of simply providing a broad overview of a subject without digging any deeper.Remember, you may refine your topic even further after you have begun writing your paper. This is perfectly acceptable, and is part of the advantage of writing a paper in multiple drafts.

, Once you have decided on a specific topic, make a list of all the specific issues that could be used to argue for or against positions within that topic. This list does not have to be ordered in any specific way.For example, you might include issues such as: ""describing specifically what is meant by 'extreme, constant pain.' ""Other issues might include, ""the rights and responsibilities of physicians regarding euthanasia,"" and ""voluntary versus involuntary euthanasia.""
After making this list, group or order them in some way. For example, you might imagine yourself taking the position that euthanasia is acceptable in this circumstance, and you could order the issues based on how you would draw supporting evidence and build your claim.

, The thesis is the central position you will be arguing in your ethics paper, but keep in mind that your thesis may change as you continue to work on your ethics paper. Write out a tentative (temporary or changeable) thesis statement and use it to help focus your argument and write your paper.In your thesis, you should take a specific stand on the ethical issue. For example, you might write your thesis as follows: ""Patients should not undergo euthanasia even when suffering constant, extreme pain.""

, Words like “could,” “would,” “might” “seems,” and ""should"" are ambiguous. These words may affect the clarity of your thesis statement so try not to use these words in your thesis statement.For example, in the thesis statement ""Patients should not undergo euthanasia even when suffering constant, extreme pain,"" it is unclear whether you mean that euthanasia should be outlawed, or that it is morally wrong.
One way to clarify your thesis is: ""It is immoral for patients to choose euthanasia even when suffering constant, extreme pain.""

, The focus of your paper will depend on the wording of your thesis, so it is crucial to make sure your thesis is worded how you want it to be. Otherwise, you may end up confusing your readers.For example, in the thesis, ""It is immoral for patients to choose euthanasia even when suffering constant, extreme pain,"" the moral burden is on the patient's actions. The author of this thesis would need to make sure to focus on the patient in the essay and not to focus on the moral implications of the doctor's actions.
If the thesis you have written does not reflect what you want to argue in your paper, start over and draft a new thesis statement.

, To strengthen your argument for a certain ethical position, you will need to cite reputable sources in your paper. University and public libraries provide the best place to obtain material to research and cite.Ask a librarian for help finding sources if you are not sure how to access your library’s databases.
A simple way to strengthen your argument through citations is by incorporating some relevant statistics. Simple statistics can have a major impact if presented after you've made a bold assertion. For instance, you may claim that the patient's family members would be unduly traumatized if the patient chose euthanasia, and then cite a university study that catalogued a majority of families reporting trauma or stress in this situation.
Another helpful citation is one in which the broad issue itself is discussed. For instance, you might cite a prominent ethicist's position on your issue to strengthen your position.

, Use only trustworthy sources in your ethics paper or you may damage your credibility and/or earn a bad grade. Use your school library’s databases to ensure that you are getting trustworthy sources for your paper. Some things to consider when trying to determine if a source is trustworthy include:The author and his or her credentials. Does the source provide the author’s first and last name and credentials (M.D., Ph.D, etc.)? Steer clear of sources without an author attached to them or that lack credentials when credentials seem crucial, such as in an article about a medical subject.Citations. How well has the author researched his or her topic? Check the author’s bibliography or works cited page. If the author has not provided any sources, then you may want to look for a different source.Bias. Has the author presented an objective, well-reasoned account of the topic? If the sources seems skewed towards one side of the argument, then it may not be a good choice.Publication date. Does this source present the most up to date information on the subject? If the sources is outdated, then try to find something more recent., Once you have gathered all of your sources, you will need to read them. Read your sources well and keep your topic in mind as you read. Read a source more than once if you don’t understand it the first time. It is important that you fully understand all of your sources.To check for comprehension after reading a source, try to summarize the source in your own words and generate a response to the author’s main argument. If you cannot do one or both of these things, then you may need to read the source again.
Creating notecards for your sources may also help you to organize your ideas. Write the citation for the source on the top of the notecard, then write a brief summary and response to the article in the lined area of the notecard., As you read your sources, it is also a good idea to highlight and underline significant passages so that you can easily come back to them. You may also want to jot down quotes that you may want to use in your paper.Remember to indicate when you have quoted a source in your notes by putting it into quotation marks and including information about the source such as the author’s name, article or book title, and page number., Getting started on a draft can be a difficult process, but your outline provides you with a kind of roadmap. By expanding on the ideas in your outline you will generate more useable, relevant text for your draft. To expand on your outline, write a couple of sentences describing and/or explaining each of the items in your outline. Include a relevant source for each item as well.

, While your professor may have some specific guidelines that you need to follow, there are some items that are often included in ethics papers. A paper defending an ethical position should first take and defend a stand, then present strong counterarguments, then refute those counterarguments, and then conclude the paper.Check your outline to see if you have covered each of these items in this order. If not, you will need to add a section and use your sources to help inform that section.

, After expanding on your outline, you can begin writing the first draft of your ethics paper. It is possible that you will need to write multiple drafts of your paper to get it right, so make sure that you give yourself plenty of time for this process. Don’t try to draft your paper until you have developed your thesis, completed an outline, and read and annotated all of your research.In your first draft, focus on the quality of the argument, rather than the quality of the prose. If the argument is structured well and each conclusion is supported by your reasoning and by cited evidence, you will be able to focus on the writing itself on the second draft.
Unless major revisions are needed to your argument (for example, if you have decided to change your thesis statement), use the second draft to strengthen your writing. Focus on sentence lengths and structures, vocabulary, and other aspects of the prose itself.

, By taking a break after you have finished drafting your paper, you will give your brain a chance to rest and process difficult concepts. When you revisit the draft, you will have a fresh perspective.


Try to allow yourself a few days or even a week to revise your paper before it is due. If you do not allow yourself enough time to revise, then you will be more prone to making simple mistakes and your grade may suffer as a result., As you revise your paper, ask yourself questions about the way you have written your paper. Taking the time to ask and answer some questions about what you have written will help you to improve what you have written. Consider the following questions as you revise:


What is your main point? How might you clarify your main point?
Who is your audience? Have you considered their needs and expectations?
What is your purpose? Have you accomplished your purpose with this paper?
How effective is your evidence? How might your strengthen your evidence?
Does every part of your paper relate back to your thesis? How might you improve these connections?
Is anything confusing about your language or organization? How might your clarify your language or organization?
Have you made any errors with grammar, punctuation, or spelling? How can you correct these errors?
What might someone who disagrees with you say about your paper? How can you address these opposing arguments in your paper?, Before you hand in your paper, read a printed version of your paper out loud to detect any typos, minor errors, or other oversights. These minor mistakes may have a negative effect on your grade, so it is important to find and fix as many of them as you can before you submit your paper.


As you read your paper out loud, highlight or circle any errors and revise as necessary before printing your final copy.

Conclude your paragraph by writing a sentence that finalized your main thought.",How to Write an Essay Using the TIEAC Method," Before you can write a TIEAC paragraph, it is essential to understand what a TIEAC paragraph is. Think of TIEAC as a structure of academic writing that will help you organize your thoughts. The acronym is as follows:


T - topic sentence
I - introduce evidence
E- evidence
A - analysis
C - conclusion;
, Jot down your ideas and what you are trying to prove: What is your argument? Identify evidence that you will use in your TIEAC Paragraph.

, For example, if you are trying to prove that polar bears are on the brink of extinction, you might write: ""Polar bears numbers have been diminishing every by 10 percent since 1998.""


Notice how you must make a statement that supports an argument that you will be making in the rest of your paragraph. This sentence should tell your reader what they will be reading in the paragraph.

, Write a sentence that will introduce the evidence that you will be discussing in the next sentence. Essentially, you are leading your reader to the evidence or proof that you will use to support your claim in your topic sentence.


You might write: ""According to National Geographic, the ice caps are melting due to global warming, which is forcing polar bears drown."" Notice how this sentence is leading your reader to proof or a quotation that will back up the claim that polar bears numbers are diminishing.

, Write a sentence or quotation that backs up your claim and the evidence that you just introduced in the last sentence. You might write: ""Polar bear numbers have seen alarming reductions, as much as 100 per day die due to drowning.""


Your teacher may want your to cite your source.

, Provide analysis that answers how your evidence proves your claim. You might write: ""Since numbers have been diminishing by 100 polar bears a day, it clear that something must be done to prevent this from happening.""


Note: Analysis can be more than one sentence.

,


You might write: ""Therefore, in order to prevent this horrific tragedy or risk polar bear extinction, we must stop global warming.""
Restate your topic sentence in a different way: ""Polar bear numbers are a tragic, yet noticeable trend in the world today.""

In fact, research consistently shows that washing your chicken will only spread potentially harmful bacteria around your sink and prep areas.Cooking your chicken to an internal temperature of 165 degrees will be sufficient to kill any harmful bacteria. , The heart of this dish is chili powder, so you can choose your favorite. If you are unsure what to use, Kashmiri Chili powder is often highly recommended. If you aren't able to locate this easily, you can always substitute regular red chili powder.


Kashmiri Chili powder is an Indian chili powder which is somewhat more mild than regular chili and which is known for its distinctive deep red color., Because this is such a popular and flexible dish, chefs and home cooks are inspired to put their own spin on the classic. Try to be creative! Use your cooking knowledge to put together a spice mixture that you think would appeal to you personally.


One option is to create a blend of ground clove, cinnamon, and cardamon. You may be able to find this pre-mixed in your grocery store (or specialty market), or you can blend your own.
Another possibility would be an earthier blend of spices (cumin, turmeric, and coriander) with a dash of garam masala (a traditional Indian spice mixture, which can include black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, cumin, mace, fennel, and many other spices).Don't worry if you don't have all of these spices on hand. You can mix and match with spices from both lists.

, Try different substitutions and amounts of spices each time you make it to find the spice blend that perfectly appeals to your palette. That’s part of the fun.

, The recipe calls for ginger-garlic paste. This is sometimes a little difficult to find. If you can't find ginger-garlic paste at your local grocery store or specialty foods market you can easily make your own ginger-garlic paste at home. East Asian and Indian specialty markets are usually good places to look.


If you don't want to go to this work, then you can simply substitute ½ teaspoon of minced garlic and ½ teaspoon of minced ginger.

, Once you have gathered together all of your ingredients, this dish is a snap to put together. Simply put aside the chicken, oil, and coriander leaves, and mix all of the other ingredients together in a large bowl.

, Your final marinade will be fairly thick, resembling a batter. Indeed, the marinade will serve as the batter for the final fried chicken dish. If it's too thick, you may add a splash or two of water to thin it out.

, You can’t marinate the entire chicken all at once. You want to marinate each strip of chicken separately so that each piece you eat will have a strong flavor.

, As you put the chicken pieces into the marinade turn them front and back so that the marinade gets on both sides. You don’t need to roll it around in there, just make sure no part of the chicken piece is dry. Otherwise you risk the chicken piece drying out in the fridge.

, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for a minimum of one hour and up to overnight. This will allow the flavor to really soak into the chicken. If you don’t refrigerate the chicken you risk it going bad, so don’t leave the marinade out on the counter.


The longer the chicken marinates, the more tender and flavorful it will be. Try to plan ahead.

, Once your chicken has had time to soak up all the spicy goodness from the marinade, you're ready to finish the dish. Fill a large saucepan, deep skillet, or deep-fryer with the oil.


You've cut your chicken into small pieces, so the oil doesn't need to be too deep, but it should fill about 1/3 of the pan.
The ideal frying temperature for oil is usually listed as around 365ºF (or 185ºC).You can test the oil by dropping a cube of white bread into the oil. When it browns in fifteen seconds, your oil is ready. , It's a good idea to begin with frying just one or two pieces of chicken. This will help you verify that the oil is hot enough and give you an idea of how long it will take to fry the chicken. If you don’t want to risk messing up a whole piece of chicken you can cut one piece in half and use that.


If the oil doesn't cover the chicken piece entirely, be sure to rotate it after a couple of minutes.
If you rotate too early, the chicken may stick, so allow for a crust to form.
Once the chicken is browned and crisped remove it from the oil. Now cut it in half to make sure that it's cooked through. This should take about 5-8 minutes.

, Once you've finished frying your test pieces, continue frying the remainder of the chicken. Depending upon the size of your pan, you may want to do this in batches.


If you fry in batches, place your finished chicken on a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. This will help soak up any residual oil and keep the chicken from getting soggy.

, Keep the oven on a very low setting, around 200ºF or 93ºC. If you fry in batches, you will need to allow the oil to get back up to temperature before adding a new batch. Your finished chicken could get cold in that time.

, Once you've fried all of your chicken pieces, garnish with finely chopped fresh coriander leaves. You may also want to give the dish a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. All that you need to do now is enjoy this spicy savory treat!

You could buy these spices powdered, yes – however, when they're whole and powdered yourself, generally they're fresher and more pungent.;
, Cut lightly into the chicken so the flavors get inside the meat and can be absorbed into its juices. This will give the chicken an enhanced flavor, letting the marinade get to work.


Mix it all together until you get a spicy, yoghurt-y concoction. It should be uniform and smooth.

, This is the basis of the flavor of your korma. With the chicken adequately marinaded, there will be a subtle yet pungent kick of flavor embedded into the meat.


To marinate, you can either place it all together in a resealable bag or just leave it covered in the refrigerator in the dish it's presently in. Just make sure the marinade reaches all sides of the chicken so every bit is as equally flavorful.

, Cook uncovered on high heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring once or until a dark brown.


These are not your normal sauteed onions – you want these browned and starting to become crispy – not golden and still at their juiciest.

, However, put aside 1 tablespoon or so for garnish when serving. The ""paste"" will likely be a bit crumbly – this is normal.


Alternatively, you can use a food processor or hand blender to get the job done.
For the record, in select markets, you can buy onions already in paste form.

, The onions don't need long to infuse into the flavor. Blast the heat on high and turn halfway through to cook both sides of the chicken.

, At around 10 minutes, pierce into a large piece of chicken to see if it's done. If it's white all the way through, it's ready.


If the chicken is at all pink, it still needs to finish cooking. Give it a few more minutes and come back, checking that piece and a new piece (one that hasn't been cut).

, This dish goes incredibly well over rice and is best served hot. It will easily serve four hungry individuals, and can serve 6 with moderate appetites.


Keep the lid on to contain the heat while serving. It'll stay warmer for longer and your guests can go back for seconds.

If you'd like, you can use a healthier oil, like olive or grapeseed.

, In the same pan as the onion, add the chopped garlic and ginger. Cook the onion in the spices for 1 or 2 minutes more. When the time is up, add the salt, turmeric, and ground cumin. Cook for another 60 seconds or so.Don't feel like scrolling? That's 2 cloves of chopped garlic, 1/2 teaspoon julienned ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon turmeric, and 1 teaspoon ground cumin.

, Stir up the sauce well so the flavors are uniformly combined. Every bit of chicken should be immersed in a concoction of equally tangy, garlic-y, cumin-y, onion-y goodness.

, Those spices by themselves wouldn't make for much of a korma (though it would have quite the kick). To turn them into a veritable sauce, add 1 cup of water and stir well. At this point, the chicken should be immersed on all sides.


Stir it up well – you don't want a cup of water marinating your chicken on top of a layer of spices. At this point, it should be reminiscent of a spicy broth.

, Take the pan down to medium-low to finish cooking. Add the 1/4 cup of cream and 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala and stir, mixing well. Instead of a broth, you now have a creamy, delicious korma just about ready to eat.

If the mixture does not become foamy, it could mean that the yeast has died. Dead yeast will not be able to provide any lift for the dough, so you should discard it and start over with a new packet.;
, Add the sugar, milk, beaten egg, salt, and flour to the bowl. Mix well to combine into a soft dough.


Add the flour gradually for best results. Once you have added enough flour to form the dough, stop and do not add any more, even if you have not yet used the full amount called for in the ingredient list.

, Lightly flour a clean kitchen counter or working surface. Turn the dough out into the flour and knead, by hand, for 6 to 8 minutes or until it becomes smooth and elastic.


You may also need to dust your hands with flour while kneading the dough to prevent it from sticking to your skin.

, Lightly oil the sides of a large mixing bowl with vegetable oil or nonstick cooking spray. Place the dough inside this bowl, and cover the whole thing with a clean, damp dish towel. Set it in a warm location and let it rise until doubled in volume.

, Punch the dough down using your hands. Scatter the minced garlic over it, then knead firmly to distribute the garlic throughout the dough.


The garlic is only optional. If you do not wish to add it, simply punch down the dough and do not worry about any additional kneading.

, Break off a small ball of dough roughly 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) in diameter. Roll it between your hands until the ball becomes rounder and smoother, and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the rest of the dough.


Note that you should keep at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space in between the dough when you arrange the portions on the baking sheet. The dough should have enough room to expand without the individual portions brushing into each other in the process.

, Cover the dough with a damp dish towel and allow it to rise for another 30 minutes, or until doubled in size again. Once risen, use a floured rolling pin to flatten each ball of dough into a circle less than 1-inch (2.5-cm) thick.

, Lightly oil the grill before putting the naan on it.


Place a circle of naan on the prepared grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. It should become puffy, and the bottom should turn light brown in color.
Brush the uncooked side of the naan with melted butter and flip the portion over. Brush the cooked side with butter, as well.
Cook this second side for another 2 to 4 minutes, or until it also begins to brown.
Remove the finished naan from the grill.
Continue cooking the naan in this manner until all the dough has been used.

, Keep a baking stone or baking sheet in the oven as it preheats, so the stone is just as hot as the oven when you place the uncooked naan on it.


Dip your hands in water and lightly wet each piece of dough.
Place a few rounds of uncooked naan onto your preheated baking stone in a single layer. Do not let them touch or overlap.
Bake for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the naan turns golden brown.
Remove the finished naan from the oven and immediately brush with melted butter.
Repeat until all the naan is cooked. Wait 3 to 4 minutes in between batches so that the baking stone has time to heat up again.

Stir the mixture until it's well combined., Fill a small jug with water and add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the water to the dough mixture. Use a wooden spoon or firm spatula to stir the dough. Continue stirring in a few tablespoons of water at a time until the dough comes together and becomes soft.Avoid adding too much water or the dough will become sticky and difficult to work with.
The amount of water you'll need depends on your flour and the humidity in your kitchen.

, Spray a sheet of plastic wrap with cooking spray and place it over the bowl with the paratha dough. The greased side should be facing down towards the dough. Set the dough aside for 20 to 25 minutes to rest., Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl and scoop the dough onto your work surface. Divide the dough into 7 even pieces. You can use a knife or bench scraper to cut the dough into equal-sized pieces or use a digital scale to portion out the pieces., Sprinkle your work surface with extra whole wheat flour and set one of the dough pieces on it. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into an 8-inch (20 cm) circle. Roll out each piece of dough into a circle.You may need to add extra flour to your work surface if the dough begins to stick.

, Melt 7 teaspoons (33 g) of the ghee. Dip a pastry brush in the ghee and spread about 1 teaspoon (4 g) across each circle of dough. Sprinkle some extra whole wheat flour over each of the coated circles., Start at one end of the circle and fold the dough over about 1/2-inch (12 mm). Hold the folded part of the dough and fold it underneath the circle about 1/2-inch (12 mm). Keep doing this across the circle so you end up with pleated dough as though you were folding a fan.Try to press the folds together gently so they don't come unfolded.

, Pick up both ends of the pleated dough with both of your hands so the dough hangs between them. Gently twists your wrists while you hold the dough. This should make the paratha dough swing a little which will make it stretch.Stretching the dough a little will make more rings in your paratha.

, Place the pleated paratha circles back on your work surface. Hold one end of the paratha dough in place and take the long strip of pleated dough in the other hand. Twist the long end around the end that you're holding in place. This should make a circle (as though you're rolling a Swiss roll). Press the end of the dough to the circle to form a seal. Repeat this for each circle of paratha dough you folded.You can seal the end to the side of the dough or tuck it underneath near the center of the dough.

, Sprinkle your work surface with more whole wheat flour. Set the folded circles of paratha dough on the work space. Use a rolling pin to roll each one out to a 6-inch (15 cm) circle.You may need to sprinkle more whole wheat flour to the surface or your rolling pin if the dough sticks.

, Set a nonstick skillet or tava on your stove. Turn the heat on to medium. Allow the skillet to fully heat before you add your paratha., Melt another 7 teaspoons (33 g) of ghee. Dip the pastry brush in the ghee and brush some over each paratha circle. Turn the parathas over and brush the other side with ghee., Place one paratha in the heated skillet or tava. Cook the paratha for about 5 to 10 seconds. Use tongs to carefully flip it over and cook it for 10 to 15 seconds on the other side. Keep turning and cooking the paratha until both sides are lightly golden brown. This should take less than a full minute for each paratha. Serve the lachha parathas while they're warm.Store leftover parathas at room temperature for up to one day. You could also store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.

Drain and serve.",How to Make Indian Bread3,", Add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of water to the flour mixture and stir to moisten. Then, add another 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water and blend it in until a soft dough forms.


Note that you may have difficulty mixing the dough with a spoon after you add the 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water. If this is the case, put the spoon down and begin mixing the dough with your hands.

, Lightly flour a clean kitchen counter. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead it for 2 or 3 minutes, just long enough for the dough to become smooth.


If your hands stick to the dough while you knead it, sprinkle a little flour onto the surface of the dough or dust your hands with flour. Do not add too much, though, since too much flour can cause the dough to crumble.

, Cover the dough with a clean, damp dish towel and allow it to rest at room temperature.


This dough will not rise as much as a dough with yeast in it would rise, but the resting period does still allow the dough to settle and form air pockets.

, Break off 2 to 3 inch (5 to 7.6 cm) portions of dough and roll them into balls. Arrange the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet, then cover them with a moist dish towel for a few minutes.


A large plate would work just as well as a baking sheet here. You will not need the baking sheet to cook the bread. Instead, you only need something to place the uncooked dough on as it waits to be fried.

, Apply a light coating of olive oil to the balls of dough. Use your hands or a lightly oiled rolling pin to roll them out to circles with a diameter 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) long.


Place the dough back on your baking sheet or plate when done rolling it out.

, Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil into a deep, heavy skillet. Warm it on the stove using high heat.


The oil should reach a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) before you move on to the next step. If you do not have a food-safe thermometer to use for checking oil temperatures, test the oil by dropping a small piece of dough in it. If the dough steadily rises to the surface of the oil, the oil is hot enough.

, Gently place one circle of dough into the hot oil. After 1 to 2 minutes, or once the oil stops sizzling and the bottom side turns a deep cream color, gently turn the dough over and fry the other side for another minute or so. Each piece is done once both sides take on a golden-cream color.


Remove the bread immediately after it finishes cooking.
Repeat until all the circles of dough have been cooked.
The bread should become puffy as it fries. You can enhance this effect by gently nudging the bread with a slotted spoon as it cooks in the oil.

, Remove each finished luchi from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with clean paper towels. Let the excess oil drain off for a few minutes before eating and enjoying the luchi.

They will get nice crispy as they cool down.Ad, Take a deep, wide mouth vessel and heat 3 to 4 tablespoons of oil in it. In this, add the bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, cardamoms, little bit of shahi jeera and allow to crackle. Add a tablespoon of ginger garlic paste and stir a little. Tip out all the marinated chicken and the marinade.

Cook on a high flame so that the water gets evaporated quickly.
Add the chopped tomatoes, mint, green chilies, all dry powders( coriander, chili), and salt.
Cook till the chicken is cooked and the gravy (masala) is not watery.
Add one third of the fried onions. Mix well. Keep aside.

, Boiling rice is one of the most important part of cooking a biryani. The rice needs to be parboiled, meaning that it should be three fourth cooked. The rest of it gets cooked on dum (when you layer the chicken and rice, seal it and put on a very slow fire).

Take a big deep wide mouth vessel, add lots of water (at least 10 times more than rice).
Add ample salt (this is very important because the rice needs to be salty when cooked). Also add a cinnamon stick, a couple of green cardamoms, a few cloves and the rest of caraway seeds (shahi jeera), for flavoring the rice.
Boil all this for a few minutes on a high flame (7 minutes or so).
Check for readiness. This is how to check if the rice is done. Without burning your fingers, take a few grains of rice (use a clean spoon to take some out of the boiling water), break a grain, if it breaks into 3 parts easily, the rice is done.
Strain the rice and spread it on a clean surface (a tray or something), so that it cools faster. If you want to pick out the whole spices which you added, you can do that now. Or else just let them be.

, Now that the rice and chicken are cooked and the fried onions are ready, you just need to get a few more things organized, so that the layering can be done.

Chop the coriander leaves.
Boil the milk and add crushed saffron in it. Give it a stir.
In desi ghee, fry the cashew nuts till golden brown. Also the almonds and raisins, if using. Keep aside. Keep some melted desi ghee aside.

, Take some melted ghee and grease the bottom of the pan with it.

Then put a layer of rice, then a layer of chicken followed by a layer of fried onions.
Then a layer of chopped coriander.
Repeat and finish off with the rice layer.
Lastly, sprinkle the leftover fried onions (if any), cashews and other nuts.
Pour the saffron milk on top. Also pour some desi ghee down the sides of the pan and some on top of the rice. It will trickle down with the heat.

, Seal the lid by sticking it with some chapati dough or simply fix a big foil before placing the lid. The idea is to restrict the steam from escaping. Place this pot on a very slow flame. Ideally place this vessel on top of another flat pan or tawa, so that the bottom of the pan doesn't come in direct contact with the heat source., When you open it, what you get is the magical, flavorsome and aromatic chicken biryani.

Fold the fried cauliflower into the sauce.,
Serve hot.",How to Prepare Gobi Manchurian," Use a sharp knife to separate a medium head of cauliflower into bite-sized florets.


Peel off the outer leaves, then slice off the heavy stem at the cauliflower base.
Hold the cauliflower in your non-dominant hand and the knife in your dominant hand. Slice into the smaller branches, working your way around the entire cauliflower using a circular motion.
Inspect each floret and trim off any blemishes or large, woody stems. Cut large florets into smaller pieces as needed.;
, Blanch the cauliflower florets in lightly salted, boiling water for 3 minutes.Boil approximately 1 gallon (4 L) of water per 1 lb (450 g) of cauliflower. Add the salt after the water reaches a boil.
Add the cauliflower to the water after it reaches a rolling boil. Cover and cook for only 3 minutes; do not cook the florets any longer than that since they still need to remain crunchy.

, Immediately transfer the blanched florets to a large bowl of prepared ice water. Keep them in the water for 2 to 3 minutes.


Dunking the cauliflower in ice water stops the cooking process and prevents the florets from becoming too soft or overdone.

, Drain the water and spread the cooled florets out over several layers of clean paper towel. Allow the excess water to drain.


You should also use additional paper towel to pat the cauliflower. The florets should be as dry as possible before you use them in this recipe.

, Pour at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vegetable oil into a deep, heavy skillet or saucepan. Set the pan on your stove over medium heat.Watch the temperature of the oil closely as it heats. It needs to reach a range between 350 and 375 degrees Fahrenheit (175 and 190 degrees Celsius) before you add the cauliflower, and it should remain within that range throughout the entire cooking process.
If you do not have a frying thermometer, you can check the temperature of the oil by tossing in a 1-inch (2.5-cm) cube of white bread. Once the oil is ready, the bread should brown within 60 seconds.

, Place the flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper into a medium mixing bowl. Stir the four ingredients together until evenly combined.

, Slowly pour the water into the bowl while simultaneously mixing it into the dry ingredients. Continue until a thick liquid batter forms.


You may not need the full amount of water, so you should add the water gradually to avoid adding too much. Batter that is too thin will not stick well to the cauliflower. The ideal batter will be the same consistency as pancake batter or dosa batter.

, Dip the cauliflower florets into the batter one at a time. The batter should completely cover the entire floret.


Pinch the stem of the florets and dip the entire piece into the batter. If you want to keep your fingers clean, you could hold the floret with a fork, instead.
After coating each floret, hold it above the bowl and allow any excess batter to drip off.

, Immediately after coating each floret, carefully drop it into the hot oil. Allow the cauliflower florets to cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until all sides turn golden to medium brown.Work in small batches (four to six florets each) to avoid overcrowding the pan. If you fry too many at once, you'll drop the temperature of the cooking oil, and the cauliflower will take too long to cook.
Lower the cauliflower into the hot oil very carefully to avoid splashing the hot oil. Space each piece apart, and do not allow the pieces to touch or overlap.
Use tongs or a fryer scoop to turn the florets as they cook. All sides must be exposed to the hot oil so that they cauliflower browns evenly.

, Carefully scoop the fried cauliflower out of the hot oil and transfer it onto a plate lined with several layers of clean paper towels. Allow all the florets to drain for at least 30 to 60 seconds.


Leave the cauliflower on these paper towels until you're ready to add it to the sauce.
Prepare the sauce after you finish frying all of the cauliflower florets.

, Whisk together the water and cornstarch in a small bowl until a thick, smooth slurry forms.


Set this slurry aside once combined. You'll use it to thicken and increase the sauce later on.

, Pour the oil into a wok or skillet, then set the pan on your stove over medium-high heat.


Allow the oil to heat for 30 to 60 seconds. Turn the pan by its handle to coat the entire bottom with the hot oil before continuing.

, Add the green onions, ginger, garlic, and green chillies to the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes.


Wait for the vegetables to lightly deepen in color and release a stronger aroma.
You'll need to keep stirring the vegetables as they cook to prevent them from burning and sticking to the pan.

, Stir the red chilli sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and salt into the vegetable mixture. Cook the contents of the pan for another 2 to 3 minutes.


Continue to stir the sauce mixture as it cooks. Watch closely; once the oil starts separating from the mixture, you can proceed to the next step., Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pan and whisk it into the other ingredients. Cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the sauce boils and thickens.


Whisk the cornstarch slurry again before adding it to the pan. It may separate as it sits, but it needs to be a well-combined slurry when you add it to the pan.
If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little more water to thin it out to your liking. Add the extra water in small amounts, however, to avoid thinning out the sauce too much.

, Add the fried cauliflower to the sauce and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, for another 2 minutes.


Since both the cauliflower and sauce are ready when you combine them, you don't need to cook them at a high heat or for a prolonged period of time. Only cook the mixture long enough to heat everything through.

, Transfer the coated, fried cauliflower to a serving platter and enjoy it immediately.


If desired, garnish the finished dish with additional chopped green onion.
Gobi manchurian is typically served as a side dish or appetizer.

""SPICES"";
,
""Zeera/Jeera"" or Cumin Seeds: These are seeds that have a lovely smell and add a unique flavour to the food.,
""Haldi"" or Turmeric: This yellow root is mostly used in the powder form.,
""Sarson/Saasvi"" or Mustard: This spice is used mostly in the whole form.,
""Mirchi"" or Chillies: This is also what forms a part of the Tadka.,
""Methi"" or Fenugreek Seeds: These seeds are slightly bitter, but they are quintessential to south Indian and Bengali cooking.,
Ajwain or Carom Seeds or Bishop's Seeds: This spice is generally roasted and powdered and used a masala.,
Saunf or Fennel seeds: These seeds look almost like jeera, but are not as spicy.,
""FATS""


,
Oil: Several varieties of oils are used in India, depending upon the region.,
Ghee or Clarified butter.,
Garam Masala: The mixture of many spices is called as garam masala.

,
Coriander powder: A perfect spice for giving taste and aroma.

,
Cream: Cream is mostly favored in the North Indian style of cooking.,
""FLAVORS""


,
Indian food in a lot of parts (Gujarat, Bengal,Karnataka, Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra) is a blend of all flavors, sweet, sour, spice and salt.,
Imli/Hunshehannu or Tamarind: This is the ""sour"" factor in our food.,
Amchur or Dry Mango Powder: This is actually exactly that.,
Lemons: This refers to the tiny green things that in America is called Lime.,
Kaala Namak or Black Salt: This pungent salt is one of the major features of most chaat items.,
Rock Salt: Many south Indian houses still use rock salt for cooking.,
Gud or jaggery: This is actually the by-product of boiling sugar-cane juice to make sugar.,
Sugar: Indian sugar is made of cane juice and hence is really very sweet, compared to sugar made from beet juice or any other source.,
""HARDWARE""


,
Rolling pins: Indian rolling pins are thinner, with a good grip.,
Kadai/Wok: Indian kadais, are almost like the Chinese wok.,
Tawa or Skillet: This can be your flat omelette making skillet, the shape rarely matters, except when you are making dosas.,
Pressure Cooker: Every Indian household swears by this item.,
Idli stand: This useful item is used for steaming idlis, momos, modaks and can be used for steaming idiappams etc.",How to Stock up Your Kitchen for Making Indian Food,", It is one of the ""spicy"" elements. Zeera is usually added to the ""tadka"", (tempering) a little hot oil, with various spices. This Tadka forms the base of most Indian dishes. Zeera is used as a whole or in the powdered form. The powdered form can be mixed with Yogurt to make a good raita or salt lassi.

, It adds to the color of the food. Turmeric is also well known for its medicinal properties. It can be used for curing various skin ailments.

, Usually added to hot oil, so that it sparkles. Some recipes call for grinding mustard, do not at any time try to use mustard paste available off the counter. It does not suit Indian cooking and ruins the flavour.

, This of course is an extremely spicy item. If you are not used to spicy food then use it sparingly. The red chillies are also used in the powder form. Do not bother making it at home; buy it from the store. It works best that way. South Indians have a different sort of dry red chili, which is very spicy and very small. However, powders can be chosen on the basis of potency (the spicier the better), color (redder is better) and texture (finely powdered).

, They are also a part of the tarka. Powdered methi is sometimes added to dosa (Indian salty pancakes) batter so that the dosa comes out crisp.

, It is also used for making garam masala.It has a sharp smell and only tastes good after it is roasted.

, They taste really nice and are used as mouth fresheners in India. They are also known for their digestive quality, and ability to clear blood. Saunf is also used to make up the famous Bengali blend of spices called ""panch phoron"".

,, In some areas of Kerala, coconut oil is used. In Bengal, mustard oil is used. These oils are quite pungent and give their own flavour to the food. If you do not like their smell or flavor, then you can always use vegetable oil, sunflower seed oil, or peanut oil. The lighter the oil the better the flavor.

, Ghee is available off the counter also. However, the preferred ghee is always home-made. You can find the method for making ghee here.

,,, You can again find this off the counter. You can find it in any shop, not just an Indian grocery store.

,, Indian food has a unique standing because of this blending.

, In the south, it is used for making sambhars/sambars, rasams and some daals. It is extremely mouthwatering, and is a favourite of many a pregnant woman!!!

, It is dried powdered mango, before it ripens. It is quite sour and has a tang to it. However, it has a sweetish note, also.

, So when in Indian recipes we say use 1 lemon, we are actually referring to around 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. We use this as the ""sour"" in our food. Again you can find this anywhere.

, It is used for making ""chaat masala"" and churans. If you find the smell offensive you can use plain salt, but the flavor of this salt is quite different.

, It gives a subtle flavor, and is less salty than processed salt. You do not HAVE to buy this.

, This also refers to the by-product of date-palm sugar. This is the ""sweetness"" in indian food and often used for making many varieties of sweets.

, Therefore, if you find sugar in Indian stores, buy it once and try it. You can accordingly adjust the quantity of your local sugar up to the sweetness of Indian sugar.

,, If you are comfortable using your own rolling pin, go ahead. If you don't have one, then get the one from the Indian store.

, However, woks have a rounder base than our kadais. However, you can safely buy a kadai.

, Try to go for a skillet without edges.

, A bit noisy, but the most viable and eco-friendly items (it takes less time to heat and cook items). The pressure cooker comes in a variety of sizes and the sizes are 1 liter (0.3 US gal), to 10 liters (2.6 US gal). You can boil potatoes, meats, veggies, dals, etc. in a matter of minutes. Sometimes, Indian recipes will speak about the number of whistles for cooking food. This is when the weight is placed on the lid, and the pressure builds up. The cooker ""whistles"" loudly, as in lets off steam in one go. To cook rice, you need three whistles, same for potatoes. So and so forth. If you buy this from an Indian store, it sometimes comes with a booklet containing recipes. You can also use those to get used to your pressure cooking.

, Non-stick and stainless steel versions are available. They also come in various sizes. Depending on the size of your pressure cooker.

Plan your menu in advance.,
Read the recipes carefully.,
Structure your dishes according to when they are to be served as well as how long they need to cook or be prepared.,
Prepare all your ingredients in advance.,
Keep a regular check on the time.,
Have the serving dishes ready.",How to Prepare Indian Food in Less Time," Are you serving an appetiser, such as bhajjis, a dhal soup or another form of entrée? Will your menu include a dessert? Will you be serving the meal as a buffet or in courses?


Its useful to be able to organise how long the meal is expected to take as that way you can organise your schedule better.
If you choose a lot of quick dishes, this can make a problem as you will be very busy organising everything at once. Its usually best to have a quickly prepared dish and a slow one, that way its in better balance and easier to prepare.;
, You may have memorised your favourite curries and other recipes, but some vary according to time which can give you an advantage when you prepare your food. Some ingredients need marinading, some need slow gentle cooking, where some are quickly prepared and served.

, Chapati and Naan dough can be made in advance and left to prove while you prepare other ingredients.


Ideally, the meal that takes the longest to cook or prepare should be done first. While this cooks gently in the background, you can prepare other dishes, garnishes and accompaniments.
Evaluate the cooking method. Some curries can be made well in advance with a slow cooker or crockpot (however the flavour is not as distinct), or you can use a pressure cooker. This process can save time or add time to suit your needs.

, Especially if you use whole or individual ground spices. You don't want to be wasting time looking for the asafoetida or measuring turmeric while other ingredients burn in the pan.


You may also try to do things in parallel, but this is for more experienced cooks as it needs far better control. For example you can put the pan of oil on the gas stove to warm up and this time can be used for cutting the onions. When the onions are frying in the hot oil, with this time you can cut tomato and other ingredients.
Involve other family members. This can be to chop vegetables, wash rice or monitor the Naan bread cooking, or more simply to prepare the table and cutlery.

, Generally you want to put your rice on soon before serving, it is best to keep an idea of how long the rice will take to cook so that it will be ready to serve by the time the other dishes are ready. This should also be considered for frying chapati or papad or any breads and other fried foods that need to be served hot and crisp.

, Whether you plan to serve in a bowl or a kadai, or on a plate or other serving platter, its best to have all the serving dishes, garnishes, pickles and chutneys ready and waiting.

, Do this over a sink, table, or garbage can so the peels don’t drop everywhere. Always direct the peeler away from your body, and be careful not to cut your fingers during this process. You’ll peel:


Two medium-sized carrots
One russet potato

, You don’t want small pieces, as you often do when chopping vegetables. Chop them into fairly large chunks. The vegetables you’re preparing are:


10-12 cauliflower florets
Two peeled carrots
One peeled potato
One medium yellow onion
Three or four green chili peppers. Feel free to use fewer if you don’t like spicy food.

, Roll each bunch of herbs into a tight roll shaped like a pencil and hold it stable with your off-hand. Run your knife through it by chopping down the length of the roll you’ve made.


It doesn’t matter if you keep the mint and cilantro separate or not, once you’ve chopped them, as they’ll be added together.
It is important that you have equal portions of each herb.

, You may be able to purchase this in a store (especially an international market), but it’s so easy to make, you might as well make it at home.


Place about five cloves of garlic and a two-inch thumb of ginger into a blender and begin blending.
Add about 1 teaspoon of oil or water — however much it needs to get your mixture to a smooth paste.
You can save the leftover paste in the fridge, or freeze it if you want to store it for a longer period of time.

, You should use about four cups of water, and salt it to both regulate the temperature, ensuring an even cook, and to add taste to the rice that’s cooked in it.

, Though you can purchase garam masala powder at the store, to get the best flavor out of your biryani, you should use the actual individual components that go into the powder. Use one cinnamon stick, three or four cardamom pods, and four or five cloves. Add that with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in the water.


It’s important to pack every component of the dish with flavor. You don’t want flavorful vegetables mixed in with bland white rice.

, Pour it into a colander or strainer to make sure you’re not adding too much water to the pot, which might cause it to boil over later.

, Because you’ve soaked your rice for at least half an hour, it’s going to cook much faster than it normally would. If you soak it for an hour, it could cook through completely in 3-4 minutes, so keep an eye on it.

, You’re going to finish cooking it with the vegetables, so remove it from the boiling water early. Test how cooked through it is by spooning some out and chewing it. It should still be toothy when you decide to stop boiling it.


Drain the rice in a colander or large strainer.
Set it aside.

, Use the same garam masala ingredients used when cooking the rice: one cinnamon stick, three or four cardamom pods, and four or five cloves, but don't add the cumin seeds yet. Sauté them until the scents start to come out.


Bite the cardamom pods to break them open slightly before adding them to the oil. This helps their flavor get out.
Don’t let the oil get too hot before adding the garam masala, as it will splatter and could burn you.
If you can’t find any of the ingredients in this recipe (cardamom pods, for example) at the regular grocery store, try your local Indian grocery. Mexican grocery stores and East Asian grocery stores may also have some of these ingredients.
If your town does not have any international grocery stores, you can purchase these spices easily online.
If you don’t have any deep pans, use a pot with a broad base. It’s important that your vegetables have a lot of room to cook.

, If you add them too early, they may have a burnt taste and smell, so don’t add these to the fresh oil in the previous step. Stir it around until the seeds are distributed throughout your pan.

, This paste has a strong taste that some people will want in moderation, while others won’t be able to get enough of. Use at least 1 ½ tablespoons of the paste, but add more if you’d like.


Stir the paste around until it’s been distributed throughout your pan.

, This will include carrots, potatoes, onions, and cauliflower, and green chili peppers.


Add salt to taste.
Cook them in the ginger garlic paste mixture until they’re about ¾ as cooked as you’d like them to be. They should still have a little bite and resistance to them when you bite into them. They’ll be slightly browned, but not cooked all the way through.
Stir occasionally to make sure the vegetables aren’t burning to the pan.

, You’ll ad the rest of it later, as finishing herbs, so don’t dump all of it in there now!

, Again, this can be purchased either in an international or Indian market or online. Use the entire packet, and mix it evenly into the vegetables so they are evenly coated with the biryani spice mix.

, Just hold onto the rest of the yogurt for a little bit. We’ll use it soon!

, Stir the pan until all of the ingredients have been evenly coated in the biryani mix.

, Both of these components have been cooked about ¾ of the way, and you want to finish cooking the together. This way, their flavors will start to meld together, and you’ll have a more flavorful final dish.


Remove half of the vegetables from the pan and set them aside.
Spread the remaining vegetables into an even layer at the bottom of the pan.
Add the rest of the yogurt (1/4 cup), along with 4 oz of cashew nuts. Stir to combine, and check the seasoning at this point. Add salt if you need to.

,


Add the remaining vegetable over the bed of rice and spread them across the surface
Top this layer with the rest of the rice, and spread it out in an even layer

, Sprinkle the rest of the chopped cilantro and mint leaves that you set aside earlier onto the top bed of rice.

, You’ll know it’s finished when the rice is light and fluffy and soft without being mushy.

, Including peanuts will give the stuffed bhindi a thicker texture, and provide an additional flavor. If you have whole peanuts, you may increase the flavor and aroma by roasting approximately 2 tbsp (30 mL) peanuts in a dry pan over medium heat. Stir continuously for 3–4 minutes, then remove the nuts from heat.Wait a couple minutes for them to cool before chopping with a knife or crushing roughly with a mortar.


If you have pre-crushed peanuts, or pre-roasted peanuts, skip this step. Crushed nuts area easily burned by roasting, which ruins the flavor., These ingredients benefit from additional frying before the okra is cooked. Cover the bottom of a pan with a light layer of oil, then fry the following over low heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onions start turning brown:1 jalapeño, or other spicy chili, deseeded and chopped
1/2 small white or red onion, peeled and finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped

, Mix the chickpea flour, chopped peanuts, chile, onion, and garlic together, along with the remaining stuffing ingredients. The masala spice mix used varies from chef to chef, so feel free to experiment with your favorite spices. A typical mix adds all of the following spices to the ingredients listed above:


1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) cumin seeds
1/4 tsp (1 mL) turmeric powder
1 tsp coriander powder
1/2 inch (1.25 cm) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated. You may substitute 1–3 tsp (5–15 mL) ground ginger according to taste.
1 tsp (5 mL) dried mango powder (amchoor), available in South Asian grocery stores

, If you prefer a sweeter dish, you may add 3 tbsp (45 mL) grated coconut, and 2 tsps (30 mL) sugar of any kind.Other optional ingredients are listed with suggested amounts in the ingredients section, but read the following descriptions before you decide to add them:


Cilantro, also known as coriander, tastes like soap to people with a certain gene, making it a controversial ingredient.Fenugreek, or methi, is often used in Indian cooking, but often has a strong, bitter aroma and taste. Taste it before using in your dish if you are not familiar with it.
Garam masala is a spice mix that varies greatly, depending who makes it. Taste it first or read the ingredients. Typically, it contains at least cinnamon, clove, pepper, and cardamom.

, Wash the okra while rubbing its skin, then wipe dry with a clean towel. Leaving the okra wet may cause the vegetable to become slimier. Cooks disagree over whether this slimy texture is reduced or increased if you wash it in advance, rather than directly before cooking.Select small okra pods if possible, as these are more tender and flavorful.

, Remove the pointed tips from each end of the okra. Cut a slit lengthwise in the okra, stopping about 1/4 in (6 mm) from one end. Gently pry apart the okra enough to reveal the seeds and opening inside, without breaking it in half.

, Spoon the stuffing into the okra pods, filling them completely. If you have leftover stuffing, set it aside for later.

, Add enough oil to cover the base of a pan or skillet. Heat on medium heat until an okra seed dropped it in sizzles. Ideally, avoid pans made from iron, copper, or brass, which may turn the okra skin black. Steel, enamel, or nonstick surfaces are all unlikely to cause this problem.


You may use any type of oil, but oil with a medium or high smoking point is less likely to burn. Canola oil and peanut oil are examples of oils with high smoking points., Reduce the heat to low to avoid burning the masala stuffing, then add the stuffed okra to the pan. Stir the ingredients occasionally, turning the okra over once the cooked side become dark green. This typically takes about 5–6 minutes on each side. It may take less time if you cover the pan, but the trapped moisture may cause the okra to become slimy, which many people do not enjoy.


If you have leftover masala, you may add it after the other ingredients have cooked for two or three minutes.

, Stuffed bhindi can be a side dish to a large meal, or the main entreé. It is often served with South Asian bread, such as roti or chapati.Raita or yogurt is commonly served with it as well, to balance out the spicy flavor.

Grind the ingredients together to make a fine powder.",How to Make Sambar Powder1," It's important you are using dried red chilli peppers and dried coriander as opposed to fresh versions. If you dry roasted the fresh versions of these ingredients, the sambar powder would not be as spicy and make it more difficult to grind them into a fine powder.You will be using each bowl to cool each ingredient after dry roasting. Alternatively, you can mix all your ingredients in a large bowl after roasting. However, it may take longer to cool if you mix all the ingredients together after dry roasting.;
, In general, you should dry roast each ingredient separately until fragrant or until it becomes slightly browned. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to keep the ingredients moving and prevent it from burning. Dry roasting times will vary depending on each ingredient.


If you are using dried hing, or asafoetida, powder, dry roast it for 2 minutes with the coriander seeds. If you are using whole asafoetida, save that ingredient for later and just dry roast the coriander seeds alone for 2 minutes.
For dried red chilli peppers, cumin seeds, peppercorn, dry roast them each and separately for 2 minutes.

Cut the lime in half, then squeeze each half into a small bowl., Place two cups of chopped coriander leaves, the diced green chilies, ½ teaspoon (2.4 ml) of cumin powder, ½ teaspoon (2.4 ml) of chaat masala, the diced ginger, 1 teaspoon (4.8 ml) of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt into a food processor. Grind until the ingredients form a smooth paste.Place the green coriander chutney aside in a small bowl. If you are preparing the chutney in advance, put it in a sealed container and store it in the fridge.
Some people prefer to prepare their chutneys a day in advance to give the flavors time to blend and mature.
Wash out the food processor between each use so that the flavors of one chutney don’t carry over into the next one you are preparing.
Reserve the lime juice for later use.

, To begin making the sweet tamarind date chutney, place 2 cups (473.1 ml) of water, ½ cup (118.2 ml) of seedless tamarind and ½ cup (118.2 ml) of seedless dates in a pan over low heat. Cook until the fruit softens, about 8-9 minutes., After the dates and tamarind have softened, add the ½ cup (118.2 ml) of powdered jaggery. When the mixture has thickened, about two minutes, add the red chili powder, coriander powder, dried ginger powder and the roasted cumin powder.Let the mixture simmer for one to two minutes.

, Once the mixture has simmered for a few minutes, add a pinch of salt and stir. Then take the mixture off the heat and allow it to cool down. Once it has cooled to around room temperature, place the mixture in a chutney grinder or food processor. Grind until the chutney is smooth.

You may have to add water to the mixture for it to grind properly. If you added water, pour the chutney into a fine mesh strainer after blending so that all the watery liquid drains out.
When you are done making the sweet tamarind date chutney, put it in a bowl and set it aside, or put it in a sealed container in the refrigerator if you’re making it in advance.

, Slice the red chilies in half, and remove the seeds if you wish to make the chutney less hot. Then place the chilies in a bowl of water and let them soak for 30 minutes. While they soak, peel and dice the garlic.Make sure not to touch the area around your eyes when you are handling the chili, and wash your hands after you transfer them to soak.

, Use a spoon to scoop up the dried chilies and put the chilies and the diced garlic in a food processor. Then add one teaspoon (2.4 ml) water. Grind the ingredients until they form a paste.

Scoop the red chutney out of the food processor and place it aside in a bowl, or put it in a sealed container and refrigerate it if you are preparing it in advance.

, Scrub and wash the potatoes, then place them in a medium sized pot. Pour in enough cold water to cover the potatoes in an inch or so of water. Then add in a pinch of salt.Starting to cook the potatoes in cold water ensures that they cook evenly.

, Place the pot of potatoes on the oven over medium heat. Heat until the potatoes start to boil. Once they start boiling, reduce the heat to low and let them simmer uncovered., After around ten minutes of simmering, check the potatoes by piercing them with a fork. If the potatoes are tender, it means that they have finished cooking. If they are still hard, check them after another few minutes., After the potatoes have finished cooking, remove them from the heat. Pour them into a colander to drain out the water. Run them under cold water to help cool them. Then chop them into small, ½ inch (1.2 cm) pieces.Salt the potato pieces if you wish.

, Peel the onions and dice them into ½ inch (1.2 cm) pieces. Then wash the tomatoes and cut them into ½ inch (1.2 cm) pieces as well., Now that you have made each component of the sev puri, it’s time to put them together! First, arrange the puris on a plate or platter. Then carefully use your thumb to poke a hole in the center of each puri puff, so that you will be able to stuff ingredients into the hollow insides.Puris are very fragile, so be sure to use the no more force than is necessary when you poke the holes.
Some puris are puffier and more rounded, while others are flatter with less space inside. Even if you have flatter puris, still poke holes so that you can fit some ingredients inside them.

, Use a spoon to dole out a couple of cubes each of the chopped potatoes, onions and tomatoes into the center of each puri., Add about a tablespoon of the chutneys to each puri. You can adjust the amount of chutney you add depending on your taste preference and your spice tolerance.If you want to make you sev puri milder, add only ½ teaspoon (1.23 ml) of the red chutney or leave it out entirely.
It's ok if the puri fillings are beginning to pile on top of, rather than inside, the puris.
You can also add dollop of plain yogurt if you wish.

, After you add in the chutneys, add a pinch each of the red chili powder, chaat masala, roasted cumin powder, and black salt.Adjust the amount of chili powder and masala depending on your spice tolerance.

, Generously sprinkle each puri with the crispy sev. The chutneys should catch the sev so that it sticks to the puri. Make sure that each puri has a substantial heap of sev at the top.You can find sev at most Indian stores.
You can also add in a dash of lime juice and place chopped coriander leaves on top of the sev as garnish if you wish.

, Sev puri should be eaten immediately before it gets soggy. Once you assemble the sev puri, use your fingers to eat this zesty snack. Enjoy sev puri while sitting down or on the go!"

Knead the dough for approximately 2-3 minutes or until it is smooth.,
Break off one walnut-sized piece of dough at a time and then roll it.,
Sprinkle each thin circle with cayenne pepper.",How to Make Poppadoms1," Put 2 cups of flour, 1 tsp. of ground pepper, 1 tsp. of ground cumin, and 1/2 tsp. of salt in a large bowl. Though Urad flour is the most traditional flour used for making poppadoms, it can be a little difficult to find if you don't have any luck at your local Indian or Asian markets. If you can't find it, you can use garbanzo bean or chickpea flour instead., Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly stir the ingredients together until they are blended. Make sure that the garlic is fairly well distributed throughout the dough. Once you've stirred the dough for at least 30 seconds to a minute, make a little depression in the top of the dough for the water you'll add.

, Now, pour 1/4 cup (2 oz.) water into the little depression you've made.

, At first, you should use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients together, if you wish. As the mixture gets a bit more formed, you can start using your hands. Alternately, you can just use your hands to incorporate the water right away.

, Now, just use your hands to knead the dough in the bowl until you've made a nice, substantive mixture that you can work with and all of the ingredients are incorporated. The water should help everything stick together.

, Use a roller to roll each piece back and forth until it is nice and thin. You should use a lightly floured, lightly oiled surface for best results, so that the poppadom pieces are easier to cook. Many poppadom recipes call for you to actually shape each piece into a circle, using either a shaper or an old CD or DVD to get the shape you're going for, though it doesn't really matter because the shape won't perfectly stay as it is.


You can also brush a bit of extra oil or ghee on each piece of dough to make it even easier to cook.

, This can add an extra spicy kick to your finished poppadoms later on. You can turn the poppadoms over and even sprinkle them with the spice on both sides if you really want to go for the full effect.

Remove the poppadoms before they begin to brown.,
Place your homemade poppadoms onto paper towels while you continue cooking the rest.,
Serve.",How to Make Poppadoms2," Now that you've prepared your poppadoms for baking, all you have to do is carefully place them on a baking tray lined with foil. You can even oil it a bit to keep the poppadoms from sticking. Make sure you leave enough room between each piece of dough so they don't stick together when they expand a bit during cooking.


You may need to fit several baking sheets in the oven at a time, or to bake your poppadoms in several shifts if you only have one sheet.;
, Keep an eye on your dough after the first 10 minutes or so to make sure it doesn't burn too fast. The finished product should be crisp and dry, but not so dry that it instantly breaks at the touch.

, Set the baking sheet aside and wait for them to cool completely before you fry them.


If you are not ready to serve your poppadoms, you may store them in an airtight container once they have cooled.

, Now, you should heat 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) of oil in a frying pan and wait a minute for the oil to start bubbling a little bit.


If you don't want to fry your baked poppadoms and enjoy the crisp and dry baked version, then you can stop before frying them. However, frying your poppadoms after baking them will give you that delightful, authentic taste you may be craving.

, This should only take about 30 seconds to a minute on one side, and even a bit less time on the second side. Use tongs to carefully turn over the poppadoms once they have cooked on the first side.

Of course, you can deep fry more than one poppadom at a time if you're getting really impatient, but this can lead to problems because they may fuse together, or you may lose track of one of them and lead it to burn a bit. The poppadom will begin to ""pop"" out a bit, and will take on a more full, airy texture., Once it has cooked on one side, use a slotted spoon to flip it over so that it cooks on the other side. It won't need to cook for as long on the second side as on the first, though you should watch to make sure it is cooked evenly on both sides and cook it for a bit longer or for a bit less time on the second side if necessary. The finished product should be a nice rich golden brown color.

, Carefully use a slotted spoon remove the poppadom from the oil. You can hold it over the oil for a few seconds to let the excess oil drip from the bottom of the spoon.

, The paper towel will absorb some of the extra oil. You can even flip the poppadom over after a minute or so, so that the oil from both sides is absorbed a bit.

, Now, continue to deep fry the poppadoms until they are all cooked to your liking. You may want to line multiple plates with paper towels so that more of their oil is absorbed.

Throughout this recipe, there are few times where you will be instructed to allow the dough to rise. This is important because it gives the bread a light and fluffy texture. If the dough is not left to rise after each step that states to, the bread will be very dense and hard.

, Let stand for 5 minutes. Strain and discard mahlepi. Let cool. It is important to bring the mahlepi to a simmer this way the flavoring is extracted form the nutty seeds. The seeds can be cracked to let out a stronger flavor.

, The addition of the mastic gum and sugar mixture is optional, though it does give compliment to the orange and lemon zest that will be added later on. The reason why it's important to break down the mastic gum with sugar is because when broken down, mastic gum is very stick. The sugar helps to coat the gum and the utensils used to break it down, so you don't end up with a sticky mess!

, Add orange and lemon zest. Sift in flour, sugar, sugar and mastic gum mixture, and salt

, Knead the dough in a bowl until it is smooth. This should take about 10 minutes. It is the chef's preference to use either their hands, or a wooden spoon for this step. It is important to keep in mind, if kneading the dough with your hands, to not over work the dough. If the dough is over worked, it can result in a dry, dense or hardened finished product.

,,


The reason why we butter the bowl and pour the remanding butter on the dough is so that when the dough rises it does not stick to the plastic that is covering it, and to add more flavor as well as a shine to the dough.

, Dive the dough into six equal pieces.

, Tightly braid three pieces of rope together. You can begin braiding wherever you wish, though it might be easier to start from the middle. Repeat with the remaining three pieces of dough. If you choose to add the red died hard boiled eggs, make sure you coil the dough around the egg to hold it in place.

, You want each loaf to rise to approximately twice its size. It is important to have the surface lightly flowered so that it is easier to roll the balls of dough into ropes without them sticking to the surface.

, Beat the remaining egg with one tablespoon of water. Uncover the loaves if they have risen to be twice their original size, and brush them with egg wash and sprinkle them with the sesame seeds or slivered almonds.


The reason why the loaves are egg washed is to give them a nice shine and so that the sesame sees or slivered almonds stick better to the surface of the loaf once cooked.

, They should take about 50-60 minutes to cook them thoroughly.

Add the rice and stir well.,
Garnish with cilantro and lemon juice and serve hot.",How to Make Poha (Indian Snack)1," When the poha can be lightly mashed between your fingers, it is ready. There is no need to soak it for a long time. Soaking the rice now makes it tender when you cook it later.;
, This will partially cook the inside of the potatoes, as they take a long time to cook in the oil by themselves. Your potatoes should be roughly 1/2-inch cubes., In a fine mesh colander, drain the water and press the poha lightly with your fingers to get out any excess water. Transfer it to a bowl when you are done and set it aside to use later., If you have a wok, use that. However, a normal saucepan will work fine as a substitute.


The pan will be lightly smoking when it is hot enough, as if small bits of steam were coming off the surface.

, The seeds will start to dance and hiss, usually after 25-30 seconds. Once they've started to crackle a bit you can move on to other ingredients.


If you do not have a microwave, add the potatoes now.
If you are adding a pinch of asafoetida to the recipe, add it now.

, Chop up a small onion and 1-2 green chilies and throw them in the pan, along with the potatoes from the microwave. Stir well and let them cook for two or three minutes. The onions should be translucent (mostly clear) when you are done.

, Add everything except the cilantro and lemon to the wok and stir together. Let them cook, well mixed, for a minute or two. Make sure the potatoes are completely cooked before moving on -- you should be able to easily pierce an entire potato chunk with a fork or toothpick.


For spices, start with a pinch of salt, 3/4 tsp turmeric, and curry powder, garam masala, chile powder, and/or garlic powder to taste.

, Mix everything into the poha and lower the heat to medium-low. Keep cooking everything together until the poha is hot and ready to serve.

Try adding 1 cup of green peas for a more vegetable-based Poha.,
Serve with a little bit of yogurt to counteract the spicy kick of hot poha.",How to Make Poha (Indian Snack)2," Because of its relative simplicity, there is a lot you can add to poha to suit your tastes. Some additional spices to consider alongside the onions include:


3 pods green cardamom
1 tsp ground or freshly cut ginger
1/2 tsp chili powder
A pinch asafoetida (found at Indian grocer)
1/2 tsp garam masala, This recipe gets a light, crispy texture to the potatoes that matches well with the peanuts. Use an extra 1/2 tb of oil and fry the potatoes in the oil before they are a light golden color on the outside, then add the mustard seed and continue with the recipe.


Do not fully cook the potatoes before continuing -- they will continue to cook with the onions and spices., Chickpeas, known as ""chana"" in Indian cuisine, can go in right before the onions, getting a nice golden brown outside in the final dish. For some people, chana is essential to a good poha recipe., Though not in many traditional poha recipes, modern chefs have begun to incorporate a variety of vegetables from around the world into poha with wonderful results. The light sweetness and quick cooking time of green peas make them perfect for poha.Try adding 1/2 cup of chopped tomatoes right before serving as well.

, This little breakfast tip is a perfect pairing of savory and spicy. Add a scoop of plain yogurt your bowl right before serving if you think it is too hot, or if you want a little tangy flavor in the poha."

After two minutes, remove it and drain off the boiling water.Add a tablespoon of salt to the water, like making pasta, for stronger flavored spinach.
The timing here is important. Do not leave the spinach on for more than 3 minutes.;
, This immediately removes the heat from the spinach, halting the cooking process to keep the spinach nice and green.

, Some people like a few chunks of spinach in their dish, while others want a completely smooth green curry. You can blend the spinach for as long as you want to get your desired consistency. If you didn't salt the water when blanching, add a pinch of salt now., Turn the stove on medium and plop in a tablespoon of ghee. Chop one large onion finely and get it cooking once the oil is hot. Add a pinch of salt as soon as the onions hit the pan, and stir occasionally to prevent burning.

, Add them to the onions shortly after they start cooking, then stir well to make sure everything is coated. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the raw smell is gone and the onions are starting to turn clear., Some recipes call for one can of crushed tomatoes, or freshly cut tomatoes, and some Indian chefs like to spice their curry with a few different flavors. If you want a simple, but still delicious curry, just move on. If you're a little more adventurous, now is the time to add the following ingredients. Cook for about a minute, stirring constantly.


1 12oz can crushed red tomatoes OR 1 cup chopped cherry tomatoes.
1 teaspoon dry fenugreek leaves (sold sometimes as ""kasuri methi; highly recommended)1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper and/or cayenne
1/2 teaspoon turmeric and/or ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamon, Keep the heat on medium and add in your spinach mixture. The cream or milk will help cut some of the spice and lead to a richer, fuller dish, but you could also use coconut milk, water, or chicken stock for a lighter dish.


The mixture should be brought to a light simmer, with small bubbles breaking the surface.

, This is the point where you should be sampling heavily. If it tastes great, leave it alone as it cooks. More likely than not, you'll want to play with the seasonings, and garam masala is highly recommended to get a subtle, rich, and restaurant-quality taste.

, The paneer just needs to get hot, and the dish is ready to serve. For an even tastier dish, fry the paneer cubes until the edges are golden brown in a separate dish, cooking them in a little bit of ghee or olive oil.Then toss them in the paneer for 2-3 minutes and serve!

Bring half a gallon of whole milk to a simmer over medium heat.,
When the milk is foamy and steamy, add 1/4 of lemon juice and remove from the heat.,
Stir in the lemon juice and let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 10 minutes.,
Line a strainer with cheesecloth and place the curdles in, squeezing the excess liquid out.,
Gather the paneer curds in the cheese cloth and press into a rough square on a cutting board.,
Place a flat plate on your paneer cube and weight it down, pressing it for 20-60 minutes.",How to Make Palak Paneer2," Use a medium sized saucepan, stirring occasionally and making sure there is no burning or scalding on the bottom. Make sure you do not use UHT pasteurized milk. This milk won't curdle, meaning it cannot be used to make paneer.


For a slightly healthier but less rich paneer, you can use 2% milk. Do not use 1% or skim, however, as they both struggle to curdle correctly.You do not want the milk to boil. If you have a thermometer, you want it around 190-200°F

, The acid in the lemon will actually break down the milk and cause it to curdle, which allows it to form solids.


You can also use 1/4 cup of white vinegar, in place of lemon, though it will have a slightly different taste.

, This will let the acid do its work, and by the end of the 10 minutes the milk should look watery and yellow. If it doesn't, add another tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and wait an extra 2-3 minutes.


If it still doesn't curdle, you're likely using UHT pasteurized milk., Once the majority of water has drained out the bottom of the colander or strainer, wrap the cheesecloth around the curds and press down to squeeze out any extra water. A gently, slow, but firm squeeze should get out any last bits of whey.For added flavor, salt the paneer after you're done with a 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

, Pull the cheese cloth out of the strainer and use it to mold the paneer inside it into a block. It should only take some gentle pressing and shaping to get a rough cube.

, A couple of large books, a mixing bowl filled with water, or a cast-iron pan should be heavy enough to press the cheese out. This will remove any last liquid and form the dense, delicious cheese cubes that will make your Palak Paneer really stand out on the table. Once it is done pressing, cut and serve.


You can keep paneer in the refrigerator for up to four days after making it."

Check for doneness.,
Serve the murukku.",How to Make Murukku," Place the sifter over the large mixing bowl. Next, pour in the rice flour and shake the sifter gently. Once all of the flour has fallen into the mixing bowl, add the urad dal flour to the sifter. Gently shake the sifter and allow the urad dal flour to fall into the mixing bowl.

Use a whisk to mix the two flours together.
Discard any lumps left in sifter.;
, First, add the cumin seeds and salt to the mixing bowl. Whisk the mixture until it’s combined. Next, add the room temperature butter. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to press the butter into the flour. This will absorb the butter into the flour and create small pearls of dough., Slowly add a few drops of water into the mixture. Use your hands or a spoon to mix everything together. Continue adding water and mixing until a soft, pliable dough is formed. You will be done mixing when the dough comes together and no flour is left in the bowl., The surface of the dough ball should be free of cracks, but not sticky.Cover the dough with a damp towel until you’re ready to form the murukku.

If the dough seems dry and crumbly, add a few more drops of water.
If the dough becomes sticky, knead in a sprinkle of rice flour.

, Either place a large piece of wax paper on a baking sheet or lay it out directly on your counter. You will form the murukku on this wax paper., A murukku mold is a small metal cylinder with a variety of disk attachments and a metal tamper. Find the disk attachment with a small star shape in the center. Next, place the star attachment disk over the opening of the mold and screw it into place.

If you don’t have a mold, you can also use a pastry bag with a small star attachment on the end.
You can buy murukku molds online or at your local Indian grocery store.

, Use your finger and a small amount of butter to grease the inside of the murukku mold and the end of the tamper. If you use a pastry bag instead, you can skip this step.

If you don’t grease the murukku mold, the mold is much harder to clean.

, Pinch off a walnut-sized ball of dough and press it into the opening of the murukku mold. If you have a larger mold, you may need a larger piece of dough. Fill the murukku mold with dough, leaving a few centimeters of space at the top for the tamper.


If you’re using a pastry bag, fill the bag about halfway full. Press the dough gently towards the star attachment to remove any air bubbles.

, Hold the mold or pastry bag just above the wax paper. Next, gently squeeze the dough out by pressing the tamper or squeezing the pasty bag. Move the mold or pastry bag in a circular motion to create small spirals of dough.Once the spiral is as big as you’d like, use your finger to break the dough away from the mold or pastry bag.

Press the tail end against the spiral to secure it.
If the dough breaks while forming the spirals, remove the dough from the pastry bag or mold and knead in a few drops of water., Dampen a clean dish cloth and squeeze out as much water as you can. Next, gently drape the dish cloth over the murukku spirals. This will prevent drying., Use a deep stainless steel pan or stock pot. Fill the pot with your frying oil of choice and place it over medium heat. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan with three inches (7.5 centimeters) of oil. Avoid using burn-prone oils such as olive oil and butter. Some examples of suitable frying oils include:


Coconut oil
Avocado oil
GheePeanut oil (Avoid this if you have nut allergies)

, To deep fry food, the oil needs to be 350-375°Fahrenheit (176-190°Celsius.) However, if you don’t have a cooking thermometer, you can still check the temperature of the oil. To do so, drop a small amount of batter into the hot oil. If the oil bubbles vigorously around the batter, the oil is hot enough.If the oil barely bubbles around the batter, continue to heat the oil before adding your murukku.
Wait until the oil is hot enough before cooking the murukku. Otherwise, they will soak up the oil and won’t cook.

, Use a metal slotted spoon to transfer the murukku from the wax paper to the hot oil. Depending on the size of your murukku, you may be able to add three or four at once. However, don’t overcrowd the pan. If you do, the murukku will stick together and cook too slowly.


The murukku should lift away from the wax paper easily. If not, let them dry out on the counter without the damp towel for a few minutes.

, The murukku will only take a few minutes to cook in the oil. Use the metal slotted spoon to turn the murukku in the oil and examine both sides. Look for a light golden brown color and a crispy texture.You don’t need to flip the murukku while frying them. The oil will cook both sides at once.

, Once the murukku are a light golden brown, use a metal slotted spoon to remove the murukku from the oil. Place the hot murukku on a plate lined with a clean paper towel. Serve them as soon as they’ve cooled to room temperature.


Leftover murukku can be placed in an airtight container and stored on your counter or in the pantry.Eat the murukku within one week of cooking them. Otherwise, they will become stale and chewy.

Add approximately 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) of lukewarm water to the container, so the kokum are completely covered with liquid. Allow them to soak for 5 to 10 minutes.Kokum, also known as kudampuli or gambooge, are the outer skins of fruit from the kokum tree that have been dried in the sun and used to provide a tart flavor to the curry. You can usually find them at Indian grocery stores.;
, Add 6 tablespoons of canola, vegetable, or another neutral cooking oil to a large skillet. Set the burner to medium high, and heat the pan until the oil is hot, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.Kerala fish curry is traditionally made in an earthen clay pot known as a meen chatti. If you have one, you can use it. Otherwise, a standard skillet or pan can work well.  

, Once the oil is hot, mix in 1 teaspoon (4 g) of mustard seeds and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of fenugreek. Heat them over medium high heat until they start to sizzle and pop, which should take approximately 3 minutes.You can also tell that the spices are ready when the seeds start to take on a darker color.

, After you’ve sauteed the mustard seeds and fenugreek, stir 6 shallots that have been finely chopped, 2 fresh green chillies that have been deseeded and sliced, and 1 ½ tablespoons (13.5 g) of garlic and ginger that have been crushed together into a fine paste into the pan until thoroughly combined. Allow the mixture to saute for 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly fried.The easiest way to make a paste with the garlic and ginger is to place them in a food processor and grind until they are combined.

, When the shallot mixture has sauted for several minutes, lower the heat to medium low, and add 1 ½ to 2 tablespoons (12 to 16 g) of chili powder, 1 ½ to 2 tablespoons (12 to 16 g) of coriander powder, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) turmeric powder to the pan. Mix until well combined, and let the mixture cook until the spices turn golden brown, which should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes.You can adjust the amount of chili powder based on how spicy you want the curry to be. If you use 2 or more tablespoons (16 g), it will be very spicy. Stick to just a 1 tablespoon (8 g) if you want the flavor to be more mild.
Using Kashmiri chili powder instead of regular chili powder can also help make the spice in the curry more mild. It has a vibrant red color as well, so your finished curry will have a more vivid color.

, Once all of the spices have been added to the pan, mix the kokum, the water that it has soaked in, an extra cup (237 ml) of water, and salt to taste into the pan. Cover the mixture, and allow it to come to a boil, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.Be sure to taste the mixture before you add the salt so you know how much is needed.

, After the kokum mixture comes to a boil, remove the lid from the pan and add 1 pound (½ kg) of firm white fish that’s been cut into medium size pieces, along with as much water as is necessary to just cover the fish. Cover the dish and allow it to come to a boil again.Be careful when you add the fish because it can break easily. Instead of mixing or stirring it in with the other ingredients, swirl the pan around to incorporate the fish without breaking it.

, When the fish mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and allow the mixture to simmer until the fish is cooked through and the sauce thickens. That typically takes 20 to 30 minutes.Make sure to swirl the ingredients in the pan periodically while it’s simmering to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, Once the fish is cooked and the curry sauce is thick, use a wooden spoon to gently stir the ingredients. Work slowly so you don’t break the fish into pieces., When the fish curry is fully mixed, turn off the burner and take the pan off the heat. Drizzle coconut oil to taste over the top of the curry to give it a delicious aroma.Coconut oil is a solid at room temperature, so you need to melt it in order to add it to the curry. Simply place the jar of coconut oil in a pan or bowl with very hot water for several minutes or until it liquefies., After adding the coconut oil, transfer the curry to a serving dish or platter. Place 6 to 8 curry leaves on top as a garnish, and serve.Kerala fish curry is usually served with cooked rice and warm naan bread.

You may also use garam masala or potli ka masala spice mix.;
, Nihari spice mixes vary from chef to chef, but most of them use at least the spices described here. If you have not had nihari masala before, you may wish to try the basic recipe out first before you make major adjustments. You could, however, add a few dried red chiles for a spicier dish, or add spices that you know were used in a nihari you enjoyed in the past. If you want to experiment more, there are many additional spices you could add to taste:


Besides dried red chiles, you could add mace, star anise, poppy seeds, paprika, or rock salt.
Spices that may be difficult to locate outside of Pakistan or India include amchoor (green mango powder), and jeera. The word ""jeera"" is used to mean several different spices, any of which can be used in masala. It is sometimes sold as black caraway or black cumin, or a mix of the two., Add the cumin and fennel to a dry, non stick pan and heat while stirring. If you are using dried red chiles or mace as well, add these at the same time. Keep heating and stirring for a minute or two, until you spices release a stronger scent and the color just begins to change.


Stop roasting immediately if the chiles turn black., The remaining spices take less time to roast, so add them to the mix later. Roast the cloves, peppercorns, cumin, nutmeg, ginger powder, both types of cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaf with the other ingredients for about a minute longer, while stirring.Add any remaining optional ingredients at the same time.


If the initial spices are already much darker colored and more fragrant, and you do not want to risk burning them, you may skip this step and add the remaining spices to the mix un-roated., Pour the roasted spices into a food processor, spice mixer, or mortar and grind until it has formed a powder. Remove the hard cinnamon stick if present. If using the masala immediately, grind the bay leaf along with the other spices. Otherwise, set aside the bay leaf for later.


Some people add a little chana dal powder to this mixture as well, a powder formed from lentils, chickpeas, or peas. This is not vital for meat dishes such as nihari, which already have a good source of protein.

, Use immediately, or store in a sealed container. Place a bay leaf in with the spice mix to add additional bay flavor. Keep in a dry, dark location, or in the refrigerator if keeping it more than a few days.

, Pour the water into a large, soup pot. Bring to a boil.

, Most commonly, nihari is made with beef shank or shoulder, but lamb, mutton, and goat meat are also popular. Cuts of red meat that include cut bone will create a more flavorful stock due to the presence of bone marrow.


If no cuts with bone are available, use 1–1.25 lbs (450–550g) of boneless meat instead., All the spices intended for the stock can be added at the same time. While you may add any savory spice, especially those also found in the masala spice mix, the ingredients listed here are a good selection.This includes 1.5 tsp (7.5 mL) ginger paste, 1.5 tsp (7.5 mL) garlic paste, one bay leaf, one cinnamon stick, and 1 tsp (5 mL) salt.

, Bring the water to a boil again, then cook the meat on medium low heat until it becomes tender. If you are short on time, you may cook for as little as one hour, but a cooking time of two or more hours is recommended for a more flavorful stock. For maximum flavor, cook for six hours on the stove, or for two hours in a pressure cooker.


Check the water level periodically, and add more if necessary. The water should always be above the level of the meat.

, Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator before the soup cools down. If you are making the rest of the nihari today, remove the meat with a slotted spoon and set aside 4 cups (950 mL) of the stock for immediate use.Remove and discard the bay leaf and cinnamon stick before storing.

, Add 4 tbsp (60 mL) ghee to a large pan with a heavy base, or use an oil with a medium to high smoking point, such as safflower oil. Heat over medium heat.


Avoid olive oil, which is more likely to burn at this temperature., Finely slice or chop half an onion, or a full one according to taste. Add this to the pan, then add 2 tsp (10 mL) garlic paste and 1.5 tsp (7.5 mL) ginger paste a minute or two later.


Note that this is in addition to the ginger paste used in the soup stock. These ingredients are all listed at the top of the page in separate sections.

, Immediately add some soup stock from the last section over the frying vegetables. Cover the pan and heat on low for 5-6 minutes, or until the pan is about to dry out, whichever comes first., Remove the meat from your stock and add it to the pan. Stir in the masala spice powder, either a store-bought mix or the one you made earlier in this recipe. Coat the meat well.


Add a splash more stock if necessary to help coat the meat.

, Fry the meat for one or two minutes on each side, over medium heat. You may need to rotate the meat more than once if it is in large or unwieldy pieces.

, Add in the remaining stock you set aside at the end of the last section. Stir this gently together with the meat and spices, cover the pan again, and cook over low heat for 10 minutes.

, In a separate bowl, mix together 2 tbsp (30 mL) flour and 6 tbsp (90 mL) water until it forms a consistent paste.Stir this into the pan of meat. Cover again, then simmer another 10–15 minutes. Add more water if the pan is drying out.

, Many people garnish nihari with strips of ginger and coriander leaves for additional decoration and flavor.A lime or lemon squeezed over each plate is a simple way to add tang.


Serve with rice, naan, or any type of bread.

Wash the rice and put it into a large microwave-safe bowl.,
Add 2 cups of water to your rice.,
Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes.,
Add your oil, seasonings, and any other flavors.,
Place the bowl in the microwave uncovered and begin cooking.,
After that time has lapsed, cover the bowl.,
Let the bowl stand for 10 minutes to steam.,
Fluff and serve.",How to Make Indian Style Basmati Rice1," It's important to wash the rice beforehand, otherwise you may end up with residue on your rice or dirty water. Once washed, place it directly into a microwave-safe bowl so you don't have to switch out bowls later.


The bowl needs to be big enough to hold 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of water, in addition to extra room for stirring.;
, Whenever you're making rice, always add double the amount of liquid. You can also use chicken, beef, or vegetable stock instead to give it a richer flavor.


If you soak your rice beforehand, you may want to use a tablespoon or two less water.

, The longer you let it soak, the better. You could skip this step if you're in a rush, but you will be sacrificing taste. Soaking the rice allows the rice to open up, expand, and separate. Some say it allows the grains to ""bloom.""

, After the rice has soaked, now is the time to add any flavors you'd like to see in your rice. A splash of oil (vegetable, olive, etc.) is wise as that will give your basmati rice its glossy look. Here are a few other ideas:


Salt
Cumin
Cardamom
Cinnamon
Onion
Turmeric

, This is the easiest method as you can watch your rice cooking if you'd like. Initially, it should be uncovered. Brown and white rice vary in how long they need cooked:


Brown rice: 15-18 minutes
White rice: 10-12 minutes

, You can use a thin cloth or a couple of paper towels. Every microwave is a little bit different, so towards the end, keep an eye on it. When no liquid is on top, it's done. Here's how long it should be cooked when covered:


Brown rice: 5-7 minutes
White rice: 7-10 minutes

, The rice continues the cooking process and will steam and soften if you leave the cover on. Give it 10-15 minutes to sit and soak up the steam.


The fewer times you uncover the rice, the better. Covering and uncovering it can lead to the rice hardening.

, Keep the rice covered as much as possible to keep it warm. Fluff it with a fork to give it that restaurant appeal. Then serve as an addition to your table, or just chow down! It's delicious enough to eat on its own.

Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes in warm water.,
Boil 1 3/4 cup of water.,
Add a large pinch of salt.,
Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil.,
Add the washed rice and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.,
Once cooked, let the rice sit for 5 or so minutes.,
Finished!",How to Make Indian Style Basmati Rice2," You will find that starch comes out of the rice and turns the water milky. This means the rice is opening up and separating, which will give your rice a fuller texture.


If you'd like, rinse the rice with cold running water prior to soaking to make sure the grains aren't clumping together.

, The amount of water should be double the amount of rice if the rice is not soaked. If the rice is soaked (which is best), you can leave off a couple of tablespoons. That's why this recipe is 1 3/4 cup of water and not 2!


Once it comes to a boil, it's time for the rice – you don't want all the water to disappear! Do the next couple of steps as the water is coming to a boil, not while it's fully boiling.

, This is optional, but most people believe that even just a dash of salt can greatly change the taste of the rice, and for the better. However, if you're watching your salt intake, feel free to skip this step.


Add any other seasonings if you'd like, too! Maybe some cumin, cardamom, garlic, chile, or turmeric? Experimenting with seasonings means each time you make rice, you'll be experiencing a completely different dish.

, A splash of oil will give your basmati rice that sheen you see in restaurants. It won't change the flavor too much, unless you use a flavored oil.


Vegetable oil is the most common, but you can use whatever type you like. Olive oil is a common substitute if vegetable oil isn't in your cupboard.

, Once the rice is in, reduce the heat to low. Stir only once, maybe twice while cooking. Opening up the pot may result in the rice hardening and losing its flavor. A large part of making rice is trusting it'll all work out.


Make sure the heat is on low, not medium-low. If the stove is on any higher than that, you risk the rice burning. Turning it on higher will not reduce the amount of time needed; it will just fry your rice and boil out the flavor.

, Take the rice off the heat and let it sit, covered. This allows the grains to soften and steam. Any additional liquid will be soaked up, too.


After this time is up, check the rice is cooked by squeezing a grain between your forefinger and thumb. The rice should break into pieces.

, Fluff with a fork and serve. If you've done it right, you'll see that each grain stands on its own and is a little longer than it was when raw. Now that's how you make rice!

Remove the rice from the stove and let it stand for 5 minutes.,
Fluff with a fork before serving.",How to Make Indian Style Basmati Rice3," You'd be surprised how much of a difference this seemingly insignificant step makes. Soaking the rice prior to cooking allows the grains to separate from each other and bloom. This makes a huge difference in taste and texture!


Get as close to the 30-minute mark as possible. A little soaking is good, but a half an hour of soaking is better. The more you soak, the fluffier your rice will be.

, Even though you're only heating 2 tablespoons of oil right now, this pot is where everything is going to go, rice and water included.


Grab a pot that has a lid – you'll need it for covering later.

, After oil has heated for a minute or so, it's time to add in your seasonings. They'll need to be cooked and stirred for another minute. In no particular order, add:


1 cinnamon stick (about 2 inches long, preferably)
2 pods of green cardamom (or 1 teaspoon if you don't have pods)
2 whole gloves (or 1 teaspoon if ground)
1 tablespoon of cumin seed

, After the seasonings have had a minute or so to cook and absorb some oil, add your sliced onion. Sauté the onion and seasonings until the onion starts to turn a rich, golden brown. You'll see it turning colors and growing softer and softer.


This will probably take around 10 minutes, depending on the heat radiating through the pot and the size of your onion.

, With a colander, drain your soaking rice. Try to get as much water out as possible. Then, throw it into your pot with the spices and the onion. Cook and stir the rice for 2-3 minutes; you want the outsides to be just lightly toasted.


After that time is up, add in your teaspoon of salt. If you're on a low-salt diet, you may skip this part, though!

, Give the rice a stir to separate the grains and to fully immerse it in with the oil and seasonings. Give it a couple of minutes to come to a boil, and then immediately move onto the next step.

, Once the water starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover it with a lid. Make sure it's on low! Any higher and the water will evaporate too quickly and your rice will burn.


Don't be tempted to keep checking on the rice in this 15 minute period. The more you uncover the pot, the more steam can escape, and the harder your rice will be. Just trust that 15 minutes is around the right time.

, Check and see what your rice looks like – if it seems just a teeny bit moist, that's great. In these next 5 minutes, it will finish steaming and cooking (covered, of course).

, That is some tasty looking rice, eh? Fluff it with a fork to watch the grains come to life. Then remove the cinnamon stick, cardamom, and cloves (if you used the whole kinds, of course). All you have to do from here is enjoy!


Keep the pot covered as much as possible to keep the heat in. The rice tastes best fresh and warm, though it will keep for a few days covered and in the refrigerator.

",How to Make Cauliflower Gratin," Cut the cauliflower in medium sized florets and remove any out leaves. If you desire, peel the lower part of the stem to remove the tough outer skin, however if the cauliflower is very fresh and in season its not always necessary.


The size of the floret should ideally be large enough to place in the mouth, rather than being too small so a spoon is needed, or too large, where they may be watery.;
, Blanch the cauliflower for 2-3 minutes or until just tender, drain and put aside. Do not overcook them as they will be reheated later.

, Heat the butter in a medium saucepan and when melted, add the flour to form a roux, stirring until the paste is formed. Allow to cook gently at least one minute.

Add half the cheese, salt and pepper and stir until melted. Check for seasoning.


The sauce may be microwaved, however it is never as good as cooked on the stove.

, Pour the cauliflower on top of the sauce and pour the remainder of the sauce on top.


Some methods advise to add the cauliflower to the sauce and then the mix to the pan, which is fine. You just want enough sauce to coat the vegetable, rather than the vegetable to be lost in sauce.
Any precooked vegetable, or any fresh vegetable such as broccoli may be cooked and added at the same time.

, They should be lightly golden brown, but the bacon should not be crisp. Pour out most of the fat and return the chicken to the pan. Add the brandy to the pan to deglaze.


If you use gas and do not wish to flame the brandy, turn off the flame before adding the brandy and cover immediately with a lid. Flaming the brandy should only be done by experienced cooks with adequate ventilation. If you use electric and wish to flame the brandy, pour in the liquid into the hot pan and use a long lighter such as a barbecue lighter, or a long match taking all safety precautions.

For more flavour, add some chopped red shallots to the mushrooms.

, Ideally use 1 tablespoon of the remaining chicken and bacon fat if available or use butter. Cream the two together to a paste and stir into the chicken. Simmer 10 minutes more or until thickened and there is no floury texture. You may also use cornflour which cooks out much quicker, but does add a different texture to the sauce.


Some purists will not add any thickening agent other than cockerel or chicken blood (which is both hard to get and expensive), so if you do not wish to use any thickening agent, transfer some of the sauce to another pan and boil briskly until reduced, then add back to the chicken. This can however make the end result more stronger tasting and salty.

Drink slowly.,
Don’t drink the powdery grounds at the bottom.",How to Make Greek Coffee," Greek coffee is different from other coffee in many ways, and it all starts with the beans. For Greek coffee, Arabica beans are lightly roasted and ground to a fine powder. The type of bean, the roast, and the grind all contribute to the unique flavor of Greek coffee.


Two of the most popular brands of Greek coffee are Loumidis and Bravo.Greek coffee does sometimes use dark-roasted beans, but a light roast is more common.;
, A briki is a special metal coffee pot that’s used specifically to make Greek coffee in the traditional way. It’s usually an hourglass- or cauldron-shaped metal pot with a long handle. Greek coffee is made right in the briki, which is warmed over a gas stove.You can heat a briki on an electric range as well, though Greek coffee is traditionally made on a gas stove or over an open flame.
If you want to make traditional Greek coffee but don’t have a gas stove, you can use a small single-burner camp stove as well.
A briki comes in many different sizes, and you should use the correct size for the amount of coffee you're making.

, A demitasse is a small cup used for serving small amounts of coffee or espresso. Each one holds between 2 and 3 ounces (59 and 89 ml). Greek coffee is traditionally served in a demitasse cup with an accompanying saucer.These small cups can be found in many kitchen stores, but you can also use espresso cups if you don’t have demitasse cups.

, The traditional way to measure water for Greek coffee is by using a demitasse cup to measure. Fill the demitasse with water, and then pour that water into the briki.By using the same cup you'll be serving coffee in, measuring with the demitasse ensures that you make exactly the right amount of coffee.

, For each cup of coffee you're making, measure in one heaping teaspoon of Greek coffee grounds. Unlike Turkish coffee, you don’t add spices like cardamom to Greek coffee, but you can add sugar if you like. Depending on the level of sweetness you want, add:No sugar for plain, or sketos
½ teaspoon (2.5 g) sugar for half-sweet, or me oligi
1 teaspoon (5 g) of sugar for medium, or metrios
2 teaspoons (10 g) of sugar for sweet, or glykys

, Swirl the coffee, sugar, and water together to combine all the ingredients in the briki. Turn the gas to medium and transfer the briki to the heat.As the coffee heats up, it will begin to bubble and foam as it simmers. Do not stir, swirl, or otherwise disturb the coffee at this point, or you will destroy the foam, which is an integral part of Greek coffee.
Don’t let the coffee boil over either, or you'll lose the foam.
When the coffee nears the rim of the briki, remove it from the heat., When you take the coffee off the flame, pour it immediately into the demitasse, along with the foam and grounds. Be gentle so you don’t disturb the foam.


If you're making more than one coffee, make sure you distribute the foam evenly among all the cups. Use a spoon to transfer foam from one cup to another if necessary., In Greece, Greek coffee is typically consumed when you get up in the morning, and then again when you wake from an afternoon nap.In most Greek cities, islands, and towns, the hours of 2 to 5 p.m. are considered quiet time, and many people nap during these hours. After the nap, coffee is served again.

, Greek coffee is almost always served with a glass of cold water or ice water. And while it’s not necessary, the coffee is often served with a cookie or some other type of sweet as well., Because Greek coffee is unfiltered and served with the grounds, it’s best to let the coffee settle for a minute or two after it’s poured. This gives the grounds time to settle on the bottom, so you can enjoy the coffee., Greek coffee is meant to be sipped and enjoyed leisurely over the course of a couple hours. To get the most flavor from the coffee, take small, slow sips so the coffee has time to roll around in your mouth.Espresso, on the other hand, is consumed quickly while standing up, whereas the coffee is sipped slowly while sitting down and chatting with friends, family, or neighbors.

, When you get near the end of the coffee, you will run into the powdery coffee grounds that settled on the bottom. When you get to that point, your coffee is finished, as you aren't meant to drink the grounds."

Use a pressure cooker.,
Use time conservatively.,
Make some bread.,
Learn to sprout mung.,
Boil lentils in advance and keep it in the fridge.,
Always have staples in stock.,
Now let's see what quick dishes we can come rustle up:

,
Do your tadka with mustard or cumin seeds, add chopped vegetables, salt, a pinch or more of curry powder,a little amount of 'garam masala'(if available), cover and let it cook for 15 minutes.,
Soak a cup of rice in water.,
Add Daal (pressure-cooked in advance) with plain rice or frozen rotis heated up is a nutritious and feel-good combination.

,
If you have figured out how to sprout mung and other beans, sauté tomatoes and onions.,
Make some Raita.,
Make a side dish.,
Pick up a packet of grated, frozen coconut from the Indian market.",How to Make a Quick Indian Vegetarian Meal," Try frozen because nutrition experts say this method preserves vitamins and minerals unlike food in cans which is full of sodium and other preservatives.;
, Whenever your local supermarket holds a frozen/canned food sale, be the first one to take advantage.

, It saves you precious time and you can cook multiple items in the same cooker. For example, rice and lentils (daal) can be cooked by putting them in different compartments in the cooker. The compartments are usually two different vessels which can be taken out for cleaning or storage purposes.

, Chop vegetables ahead of time while watching TV or talking on the phone (you can cradle your cordless or cell phone in one ear and chop, chop away). Vegetables like okra (ladies finger), tindora ( the ivy gourd, also known little gourd or gentleman's toes), beetroot, carrots can be cut whenever you have some free time and kept in the refrigerator. But remember to use it the next day!!

, Frozen rotis (Indian bread) are available in the Indian store - different brands mean different results in the softness and taste of the rotis.

, You can also use other types of dry beans which your Indian market will definitely have in stock.

, So if you come back exhausted from work, all you have to do is temper (tadka) the daal and add curry/cilantro leaves

, Like tomatoes, potatoes and onions. Curry leaves, green chillies, cilantro or coriander leaves are the staples in Indian cooking - you can pick up cilantro and some varieties of green chillies at your local supermarket also.

,, When it is done, add some fresh cilantro and lime juice if you think it might work well with the vegetable.

, After ten minutes, pressure cook for one whistle, stop the cooker and let the rice cool inside. You can make pulao out of the cooled rice. Add frozen corn, peas, carrots and fragrant cinnamon, cloves to a tablespoon of ghee(clarified butter) and add the cooled rice. Don't forget to add salt!!!

,, Pressure-cook the beans for about 10 minutes. Add the mung to the sauteed tomato-onion mixture, add any kind of masala powder and enjoy with plain rice or rotis.

, Raita is a cool accompaniment to most rice dishes and curries. Chop onions, tomatoes into tiny pieces, add a few tablespoons of thick yogurt and top with a sprig of cilantro.

, Kachumbar can be an instant side-dish. Chop tomatoes and cucumber into small pieces,add some chickpeas if you want, squeeze some lemon juice, add cilantro and mix it up.

, Temper (canned and rinsed) chickpeas with mustard seeds and green chillies. Add two tablespoons of grated coconut, salt and mix well and let it sit for 10 minutes. Voila! A protein-rich dish is ready. This goes by the name of ""chundaal"" in south India and can be eaten as a snack also.

Freeze the paste.",How to Make Ginger Garlic Paste," Any moisture will shorten the shelf life of the paste. Pat the ginger dry thoroughly before you continue, and make sure your kitchen equipment is dry.;
, If you have mature ginger with wrinkly, brown skin, peel it before chopping. You do not need to peel young ginger with soft, yellow skin.Start with 4 oz (113g) of ginger, or about 1 cup after chopping. Some cooks prefer to add more ginger (up to double this amount), but wait until you taste the final product. It's easy to overpower the garlic.


Young ginger has a less pungent taste than old ginger.You can use much more without overpowering the garlic.

, As garlic ages, its aroma and flavor becomes stronger and stronger. Besides overwhelming other ingredients, these aromatic compounds can turn your paste a surprising blue-green color.Start with fresh garlic to avoid these effects.


Cut out any green sprouts from the garlic, which have a harsh burning taste., You'll need about two large heads of garlic, or roughly 20 cloves. Save yourself some time by peeling them all at once:Separate the cloves and drop them in a large, metal bowl.
Take a second metal bowl the same size. Place it upside down over the first bowl.
Shake the two bowls vigorously for a couple minutes to remove the peels.

, Combine the ginger and garlic in a food processor or blender. Add a generous pinch of salt so the paste lasts a little longer. Scrape down the sides between pulses.

, Pour in about ½ tbsp (8 mL) of vegetable oil near the end of the blending process. Choose an oil without a strong flavor, such as canola, corn, or safflower oil.Slowly pour in more oil if the blender is stuck, a dash at a time.

, Place the paste in a clean, dry jar. Put it in the coldest part of your fridge, usually at the far back.If the jar is sealed against air and moisture, the paste can last two or three weeks.However, even in the fridge, there is a risk of very dangerous botulinum contamination. If you keep the paste for more than three days, make sure to heat it thoroughly for at least ten minutes to destroy this toxin.The top surface of the paste may turn brown. This is a harmless reaction with oxygen, and not a sign of spoilage unless the color extends below the surface.
Keep a clean spoon in the same container as the paste, or make sure every spoon you use is completely clean and dry.

, Garlic may be contaminated by botulinum, a potentially fatal bacteria. When the garlic is crushed and stored in a low-acid recipe such at this one, the bacteria produces dangerous toxins even in the refrigerator. Cooking the paste thoroughly for at least ten minutes destroys this toxin. However, since this is such a dangerous toxin, it's best to store only as much paste as you plan to use over the next three days. Freeze the rest as described at the end of this section., Salt is a good preservative, and you can add a generous handful to the recipe above as long as you remember not to over salt the dishes the paste is used in. To completely remove any moisture that may spoil the paste, roast the salt in a dry pan first over medium high heat. The salt is ready when it has turned a light golden color.Let the salt cool to room temperature before adding to the paste.
A large amount of salt can preserve the paste for as long as two or three months in the refrigerator., White vinegar is an alternative preservative that doesn't affect the flavor as much as salt. Pour it in instead of oil when blending, adding it in dashes until the paste is smooth or until you've added about 2 tbsp (30 mL).


Unfortunately, acidic ingredients such as vinegar can turn garlic paste blue-green., Turmeric has anti-bacterial properties that can extend the shelf life of your food.In addition, the yellow color can keep your paste looking vibrant as it ages.

, To minimize spoilage, sterilize glass canning jars in a pot of boiling water. Dry with brand new paper towels to avoid contamination while removing all moisture.


This is especially important if you do not have a refrigerator.

, If you plan to use the paste for more than a month, make a large batch and freeze the extra. Store the frozen paste in glass bottles with 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) headspace at the top to allow for expansion. Thaw within 6 months for best quality."

Serve while hot.",How to Make Idiyappam," Place a large pan over medium heat, then drop in the cup of rice flour. Spread out the rice flour so that it’s in an even layer on the pan. Keep checking on the rice flour and take it out of the pan when it’s hot to the touch., Pour 1 ¼ cups of water in a small saucepan. Place it over medium heat and heat until the water begins to boil. The water doesn’t have to come to a full boil, as long as it begins to bubble., Place one cup of rice flour into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add in a pinch of salt, then take the heated water off the stovetop and pour it into the bowl of rice flour., Use a spoon to stir together the rice flour and the hot water. Don’t use your hands yet, as the water will be very hot. Keep stirring until the flour and water mixture is almost too thick to stir., Once you have done as much mixing as you can with the spoon, the mixture should be cool enough to handle. Use clean hands to start to knead the rice flour dough for a minute or so on a counter top until the dough is smooth and soft., Add a tablespoon of ghee to the dough when the dough is almost fully mixed together. Use your hands to knead the ghee into the dough until it is incorporated and the dough is uniform.Ghee is a clarified butter that adds flavor to the dough and helps to bind it together.

, When the dough has become uniform, stop kneading it and cover it immediately with a damp, clean cloth either in the bowl or on the countertop for 10 to 12 minutes., Before you start pressing the dough, you need to grease your idiyappam equipment so that the dough doesn’t get stuck during pressing or cooking.Rub ghee on the idli mould, which is the small tray with cup-like insets in which you will place each idiyappam to steam. Idli molds are usually used to make idli, which are South Indian savory lentil cakes, but they can also be used to form the shape of the idiyappam.
Grease the cylindrical compartment inside the idiyappam press with ghee.
Also rub ghee on the disc attachment of the idiyappam press. Consult the package of your press if you’re not sure how to take out the disc attachment.

, Heat about an inch of water in the bottom of a steamer. When the water is hot or almost boiling, place the idli mould in the steamer to warm it., Uncover the dough and separate it into four equal sized parts. Roll each quarter of dough in a slightly cylindrical shape, roughly the shape of a potato.Try not to over-handle the dough.

, After the idli mold has warmed, take it out of the steamer. Use tongs if the mold is too hot to touch. Then place the idli mold on the countertop next to the idiyappam press., After you have separated each quarter of dough, place one quarter of dough into the cylindrical container of the idiyappam press. Then use the presser attachment to press the dough inside. The dough will be pressed through the disc with the small holes to create thin, noodle-like shapes.Make sure to press the dough above the idli mold so that the noodles fall into one inset of the mold.

, After you press the first quarter of dough, press the rest of the dough with the idiyappam presser. Make sure that you are pressing above the idli mold so that the noodles formed by each quarter of dough fall into a compartment of the mold.When you have finished, you should have a separate noodle patty in each compartment of the idli mold.

, After you have finished pressing the idiyappam, place the mold with the idiyappam patties inside the steamer, then cover the top of the steamer., Keep the idli mold inside the steamer and steam for 7-9 minutes. Steaming cooks the noodles and gives them the right texture. Make sure not to over-steam, as this will made the noodles limp., After 7-9 minutes remove the idli mold from the steamer. Try a corner of one idiyappam; if the noodles are still tough, steam them for another minute., Take the idiyappam out of the idli mold and place them on a plate. Serve while hot alongside your favorite curry or side dishes. Many enjoy pouring the curry or sauces over the idiyappam to enjoy the two dishes together!

,,,,


When you use a pressure cooker (this is mostly a utensil that is used in Indian homes), which is an airtight utensil, put on fire, the steam is not let out automatically. And it is in this steam that the meat gets cooked. So whistles come out of the steam that is getting accumulated inside. The more the number of whistles, the more the meat gets cooked, as the meat is in the steam for a longer time.

, This is when we start the drying process.

, This is essential as without this, the meat at the very bottom of the cooker may tend to get burnt.

Get everything ready.",How to Make Haleem (Minced Meat)1," Cooking this recipe does not take too much time, but it does require forethought and advanced action. Before you go to start cooking, make sure your ingredients are prepped.


Soak your wheat overnight; it should be drained, pounded, and husked.
Soak your channa, moong, and masoor dals for 1/2 an hour prior to cooking.

Channa dal is similar to split, black chickpea. Moong dal is a variation in wording of Mung bean.


Slice 2 onions fine and fry them up crispy in a frying pan with olive oil.
Grind your ginger (about a 2"" (5 cm) piece) and garlic (6-8 flakes) into a paste. If you like it spicier, add 1 1/3 tbsp (20 g) of fresh green chilies.

You can use this paste during cooking or you can marinate the lamb in it, with salt (to taste), for an hour prior.

Stir occasionally to prevent a film from forming on the top. If too much liquid evaporates, add an extra 1/4 c (25 g) of water to the mixture.

, This could take a while -- be patient. When the meat practically falls apart, mash the mutton into a paste-like substance.


A potato masher works just fine for this part, though a fork or meat tenderizer would also do.

, Mix it well. Keep stirring on a low flame till the mixture leaves the sides of the pan. Then, heat the ghee and pour the contents over the Haleem.

Gently stir the rice as the water heats to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Do so slowly to avoid breaking the grains.

, As soon as the water reaches a boil, sprinkle the contents with salt and turn off the heat. Cover the pan and continue cooking the rice until it becomes tender.


Do not remove the pan from the stove. The rice should continue cooking in the residual heat.
The rice should finish cooking in approximately 15 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir the contents of the pan during this time.

, Gently fluff the cooked rice with a fork. Set it aside while you continue preparing the rest of the recipe.Ideally, the rice should cool to room temperature before you add it to the other ingredients.

, Place the ghee in a skillet or wok. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat.


Allow the ghee to heat for at least 30 to 60 seconds. It should become somewhat glossier and more fluid, making it easier to spread across the bottom of the pan. Do not allow the ghee to start smoking, however.

, Place the cashews and raisins in the hot ghee. Stir fry for several minutes, or until the nuts look evenly toasted on all sides.Once the cashews and raisins are ready, transfer them to another plate using a slotted spoon, leaving as much ghee in the pan as possible. Keep the nuts and raisins warm while you continue working.

, Place the sliced onions, minced garlic, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, and star anise in the remaining ghee. Fry the seasonings, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes.


During this time, the garlic and onion should both become golden-brown in color. The bay leaf should turn crisp and the whole spices may make gentle popping noises.

, Add the cooked basmati rice to the pan. Fry for 2 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently.


As you stir the rice, evenly mix the ghee, garlic, onions, and spices into the grains. Work carefully to avoid breaking the grains.
When ready, the rice should have a slightly darker hue but should not turn fully brown.

, Transfer the rice to serving plates and garnish each serving with the reserved cashews and raisins. Eat the ghee rice while it's still hot.


You can also serve the rice with fried onions, vegetable korma, or spicy gravy.

Serve hot.",How to Make Ghee Rice2," Place the rice in a fine metal colander. Rinse it under running water until the water draining beneath the colander runs clear.


If you do not have a colander or running water, you can drain it using an alternate method.

Place the rice in a glass dish and cover it with water.
Use your hands to gently squeeze and stir the grains, making the water turn cloudy.
Drain the dirty water and repeat the entire process, once or twice more, or until the water remains clear.



, Place the rinsed rice in a glass bowl and cover it with 3 cups (750 ml) of cool, clean water. Allow the rice to soak for 20 minutes.Soaking the rice should make it softer and less sticky. It should also reduce the overall cooking time.
After you finish soaking the rice, drain and discard the water. Set the rice aside until it's time to add it to the rest of the ingredients.

, Place the ghee in a pressure cooker and warm it over medium-high heat.


Ideally, you should use a pressure cooker with an approximate 3.5-qt (3.5-L) capacity when preparing this much ghee rice.
Allow the ghee to heat for 30 to 60 seconds before continuing. It should be easy to turn the pressure cooker and coat the bottom with the ghee once it becomes adequately warm.

, Add the cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, peppercorns, and bay leaf to the hot ghee. Cook for several seconds, stirring constantly.


The spices should begin to sputter and release stronger scents, but you should not allow them to burn or deepen in color. The edges of the bay leaf may begin turning up, however.

, Add the cashews and raisins to the pressure cooker. Cook, stirring frequently, for another minute.


When ready, the nuts should look toasty brown and the raisins should become somewhat puffy.

, Place the prepared onion, chilli pepper, garlic, and ginger in the pressure cooker. Cook, stirring frequently, for another 1 to 2 minutes.


Allow the ginger and onion to change color. Both should become more golden or lightly browned, but do not allow either one to burn. Frequent stirring should minimize the risk of burning.

, Add the drained rice to the pressure cooker. Reduce the heat to low and saute for about 2 minutes.


Stir the rice to coat the grains with the ghee and other seasonings. Occasional stirring should also prevent the rice from sticking to the pressure cooker, but you should work carefully to avoid breaking any grains.

, Pour 2 cups (500 ml) of water over the rice. Sprinkle the contents with salt.

, Close and seal the pressure cooker. After achieving full pressure, cook the ghee rice for 10 minutes.When you close and seal the pressure cooker, switch the heat to high. As soon as steam pours out from the vent, place the pressure regulator or weight on the nozzle and switch the heat back down to low. Continue cooking for 10 minutes before turning the heat off completely.

, Wait for the pressure cooker to naturally release the built-up pressure. Once this happens, carefully open the lid and fluff the rice with a fork.


Do not open the pressure cooker before the pressure drops. It should usually take 5 to 8 minutes for the device to release the built-up pressure.

, Stir the rice and transfer it to individual serving dishes. Enjoy while it's still hot.

Heat the mixture for 5 - 6 minutes.,
Remove your mixture from the heat and coat your ghevar.",How to Make Ghevar," Start with each of these ingredients separated, then add your ghee (clarified butter) and milk to your mixing bowl and whisk it thoroughly. Whisk the mixture until it reaches a smooth consistency and the two ingredients do not separate.

Using a mixer or blender can save you time and effort while mixing your ghee and milk together. However, be careful not to mix too long, as this can cause the ghee to separate.;
, Use a whisk to stir in your arrowroot to your ghee/milk mixture a little at a time until no arrowroot remains, then do the same for your flour. After you have done so, whisk in about 2 cups of water a little bit at a time to your mixture, or until the batter is of coating consistency.

""Coating consistency"" implies that your batter can easily be poured or drizzled onto something to coat it.
At this point, your mixture should have the consistency of somewhat thin batter. Stir/whisk it well to remove lumps.
If you don't have arrowroot available, cornflour will work just as well as a substitute.
Take care not to over-stir these ingredients. Doing so can cause the water and the ghee to separate., In most cases, 2 cups of water will give you the ideal consistency for your ghevar batter. However, in especially dry or moist climates, the level moisture in the air may require you to adjust the water added to your batter.

Dry environments will steal moisture from your batter. If you live in an arid or semi-arid region, you may need to use additional water in your batter.
Moist environments, like the jungle or many tropical, equatorial regions, will add moisture to your batter. In these regions, you may find you need less water than usual., Plain ghevar batter will yield fried batter that is golden-to-off-white in color. However, at this point in your ingredient preparation, you can add food coloring to give your ghevar batter fun color. A little food coloring goes a long way! Add your food coloring sparingly. From this point on, your batter should be kept in a cool place away from heat.

If you have a few different mixing bowls, you can divide your batter between two or more bowls and then add a different dye color to each. In this way, with one batch of batter, you can make several different colors of ghevar batter.
Mix your food coloring into your batter thoroughly with your whisk to prevent your color from being improperly distributed throughout., A ghevar mold is a single or multi-ringed mold that forms the shape of your batter as it is heated in ghee. For this reason, flat bottomed, deep vessels, like a pressure cooker pot, are ideal for frying your ghevar batter. To prepare your mold and vessel for frying, you should:

Place the mold into your frying vessel. If you do not have a pressure cooker pot, you might also use a karahi, flat-bottomed wok, or pot.
Pour ghee into your frying vessel until it covers roughly ¾ of the mold. If you overfill your vessel, you may need to drain out some of the ghee.
Heat the ghee to a high temperature. Use a high heat on your stovetop to heat the ghee in your vessel.
If you don't have ghevar molds, you can use the entire bottom of your frying vessel to make one big ghevar at a time. In this case, your ghee height should be about 2½ inches (6.35 cm)., After a few minutes have passed, test the temperature of your ghee. You can do this by drizzling/dripping a little bit of batter into the heated ghee. If the batter drops into the ghee and then bobs immediately back up to the surface of the ghee, your ghee is the right temperature., Now that the ghee in your frying vessel is the right temperature, you're ready to fry. Drip a single spoon's worth of batter into the center of your mold(s) a spoonful at a time. As you do so, you should:

Notice the batter drip down into the heated ghee, then rise back its surface and spread to take the shape of your mold.
See froth build up on the surface of your ghee. If you have a single mold, you may have to wait 1 - 2 minutes for the froth to bubble down before adding more batter.
Alternate between the rings of multiple-ringed molds so that while the froth settles in one ring, you're adding batter to a new ring, and so on. This way you can return to the first ring you added batter to after all others for the next round of batter.
Add several spoonfuls of batter to your molds. The more batter you add, the thicker your ghevar will be. Thin, crispy ghevars can be made with only a few spoonfuls., As the froth settles and you add spoonfuls of batter to your heated ghee, you should also notice the batter browning as it cooks in the ghee. Once the batter is golden brown in color, remove your ghevar from the ghee with a pair of tongs or wooden skewer.

Fresh from the ghee, ghevar can be quite oily and buttery. You may want to absorb some of this by laying your ghevar on paper towel or tissue paper.
The top of your batter will likely cook slower than the rest of it. For consistent frying, you should ladle your heated ghee on top of your batter. After 2 or 3 ladles, your ghee should be mostly fried., During this process, you may need to add some ghee to your frying vessel to continue cooking your ghevar at the proper ¾ height of the mold. As you remove finished batter from the vessel, add more batter to continue making your ghevar in the same fashion as before.

Depending on the size of the ghevar you are making, this may make as many as 25 small ghevars or approximately 15 large ghevars., Cooking at a high temperature for a sustained period of time will have made your ghee very hot. You'll need to allow it to mostly cool before disposing of your ghee.

Ghee used for frying can be reused for other cooking projects, but it will no longer be pure and may influence the outcome of those cooking projects.
Ghee can build up in your pipes and cause blockages. For this reason, you should throw out used ghee that you are not reusing instead of washing it down your drain., Add your sugar and water to a small to moderate sized sauce pan or pot and bring the contents to a boil. After reaching a boil, reduce your heat to low and simmer.

While you're heating your sugar and water, you should occasionally stir the mixture with a wooden spoon, ladle, or other kitchen tool., As the mixture is heated, the sugar and the water should combine to form a syrupy consistency. At about the five minute mark, you should check your mixture for consistency. To check your consistency you should:

Use a spoon to scoop up and drizzle a little of the mixture onto a spare plate. Allow it to cool for a few seconds.
Feel the mixture with your fingers. If it is sticky and forms a tacky kind of strand, your syrup is ready., Turn off your heat. Your sugar syrup is now ready to be used on your ghevars. You may need to warm the mixture occasionally to prevent it from separating or solidifying. Dip your fried ghevar in the syrup to finish this delicious treat.

Excess oil from your heated ghee might cause the sugar syrup to coat your ghevar unevenly. You may want to pat your fried ghevar with paper towel before dipping them into sauce to prevent this.
Your ghevar should be dipped into your sugar syrup shortly after being fried. Drain excess syrup, and then your ghevar are ready to eat."

Change the water 2-3 times, until the water is mostly clear.You should always rinse rice before you cook it. Rinsing the rice gets rid of surface starches and helps prevent clumping. Rinsing can also give a fresher taste to the dish.
Wash the rice by stirring it in circles with your fingers. You can also rub the rice gently to loosen the starches.;
, Use a pressure cooker to cook the rice with 1 3/4 cups of water for 5 whistles over a medium flame.You can also pressure cook the rice with 2 cups of water for 4 whistles, or on a low flame for 1 whistle.The rice should be mushy and overcooked.
You can also cook the rice in a pot. To do this, keep the rice covered in water for 30 minutes. Bring 6 cups of water to boil in a pot, then add the rice. Bring to boil again. Boil for 12 minutes. Drain and put this in a bowl.Add salt immediately to prevent clumps as it cools., Add warm milk to the rice and mix well. Then, add butter and mix until it becomes creamy.Let the rice completely cool.

, Add the yogurt to the rice and mix well. Get rid of all the lumps in the rice. Don't add yogurt to hot rice. It can kill the live cultures and upset your stomach. Set it aside after you have mixed it together.


For a tangier taste, add more yogurt. For a creamier taste, add more milk and butter., You need to temper the next set of ingredients. Tempering is the process of gradually heating up the ingredients from room temperature to prevent the mixture from curdling unnecessarily when mixed with the other ingredients. To start, place the black mustard seeds in the pan. When the seeds start to pop or crackle, add the urad dal, curry leaves, red chilies, and green chilies. Stir continuously as you sauté over a medium flame for about a minute.Make sure the coriander and curry leaves are chopped finely. Chop the green chili into big pieces.You can also add the ginger into the sauté instead of adding it later if you want., After sauteing the ingredients, immediately pour them over the bowl of rice.Take out the chilies after you have mixed the tempered ingredients into the rice., After stirring in the tempered items, add the ginger, cashews, and cilantro. Mix well.


Make sure the cashews are finely chopped.
You can also garnish curd rice with fruit. Add pomegranates, seedless green grapes, pineapple pieces, coconut, apple, raisins, or chopped mango.You can also add vegetables, such as carrots and cucumbers.

, You can serve the rice hot or cold.This dish works great at the end of a meal. South Indian pickles compliment this dish very well.

, Measure out half a cup of flour and add it to the egg mixture. Whisk it into the eggs until you see just a few small lumps. Now add half a cup of milk to the mixture and whisk until combined. Keep alternating flour and milk until you run out of both.


Whisking milk and flour in small parts helps to incorporate the ingredients; otherwise, you would end with lumpy batter.
When you are finished adding all the milk and flour, the batter should look smooth.
If you would prefer to use low fat milk, you can use that as a substitute.


, Finish the batter by whisking in the sugar first, then adding the butter. Continue whisking until the batter is smooth, lump-free, and light yellow. The final consistency should be thin, like whole milk; if it seems more like pancake batter, add another 1/2 cup of milk.

, Use a nonstick skillet, a crepe pan, or a regular skillet. Choose a pan that is 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter. Place the pan on the stove and turn the burner to medium heat, and let the pan get hot. Spray on nonstick cooking spray or else the crepes will stick to the pan.

, Ladle about 1/4 cup of batter into the center of the pan. Using too much batter will result in thick crepes, and you want them to be thin. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup or a teacup to get the right amount.

, Lift the pan and move your hand in a circular motion to swirl the batter from the center of the pan out around to the sides, so it full coats the bottom of the pan in one thin layer. If you need to add a bit more batter to coat the pan, do so., Set the pan back on the burner and let the crepe cook until the top is just a bit moist. Use a spatula to lift the side of the crepe gently; it should lift easily and have a fine lace pattern developing on the other side. That means it is time to flip the crepe.


If the crepe still looks wet in the middle, give it a bit more time.
Don't overcook the crepe, or the texture will become rubbery. Crepes cook quickly, so it will probably be ready to flip within about 45 seconds.

, Slip the spatula under the crepe so it is supporting the center of the crepe and most of its weight. Carefully turn the crepe over to the other side. Straighten out folds and wrinkles in the crepe to ensure it will cook evenly. It only needs to cook on the other side for about 20 - 30 seconds.


Practice makes perfect when it comes to flipping crepes. If you break one, pop it in your mouth and move on to the next.
Skilled chefs can flip crepes without using a spatula. Try it if you would like!

, Carefully slide the crepe from the pan onto a plate, using the spatula to help guide it. Continue making more crepes until you run out of batter.

, This is the most popular crepe filling in France. The simple flavors of butter and sugar let the light flavor of the dough shine through. Heat a pat of butter in the skillet. When it begins to sizzle, add a crepe to the pan. Let it cook in the butter for about 45 seconds, and then flip it to the other side. Sprinkle a teaspoon of sugar over the crepe. Fold it in half, then in half again. Place the crepe on a plate and serve.


A squirt of lemon juice is also delicious in this simple crepe filling.
Experiment with different types of sugar. Brown sugar and powdered sugar are great substitutes for granulated sugar.

, Crepes make excellent desserts for rich chocolaty fillings, too. The process for serving a crepe this way is simple: melt butter in a pan, add a crepe and cook it on one side for 45 seconds, then flip it over. Sprinkle chocolate chips or dark chocolate pieces over the crepe. Fold it in half, then in half again. Set it on a plate and serve.

, Strawberries, peaches, apples, and plums make delicious crepe fillings, especially when sprinkled with a little powdered sugar. Use either preserves or fresh fruit to stuff the crepes.

, Crepes make a good lunchtime substitute for sandwiches. Melt cheese over a crepe, and then top it with diced ham, asparagus, spinach, or other vegetables. Fold the crepe in half, then fold it in half again, and serve.

Stir with a straw.",How to Make a Traditional Greek Frappe," Put two to three teaspoons of high-quality instant coffee into a shaker.


The original frappé from 1957 used Nescafe,and most recipes for the drink call for the use of Nescafe Classic.If you can get the Greek version of Nescafe Classic, it is said to produce the best foam.;
, Depending on your personal preference, you can add anywhere from one to four teaspoons of sugar, or none at all.In Greece, a frappé with no sugar is described as ""sketo,"" one with a moderate amount of sugar (one or two teaspoons) is referred to as ""metrio"" and one that is very sweet is called ""glyko."", Next, add a small amount of water. Recipes vary with respect to how much water to add, with some calling for as little as two to three teaspoons (10-15ml),and others as much as three tablespoons.You may need to experiment with this some to get it right. It's important that your coffee and sugar be covered with water, but too much water will decrease the foaminess of the drink., If you wish, add two ice cubes in the shaker and close tight.


While some recipes suggest adding a couple of ice cubes to the shaker,others indicate the water should not even be chilled.Again, you may wish to experiment with this to get the consistency you like best.

, Close the shaker tightly and shake aggressively and quickly to create a thick, creamy foam.


You should shake the coffee for at least 15 seconds.Many recipes call for a shake of 30 seconds or more.Instead of shaking, you can also use an immersion blender to mix up the coffee. Some prefer this shaking, both for ease and quality of foam., Open the shaker and pour its contents into a tall glass., Add some ice cubes to the glass, filling it up half to two-thirds of the way.Some recipes suggest a smaller amount of ice, some as few as three to four ice cubes.Once again, you can experiment with this and find the amount that's right for you.

, Some people like milk in their frappé, while others find it more refreshing without.If you want milk in your frappé, you can either add one to two tablespoons of chilled milk,or add two tablespoons of evaporated milk.In Greece, when ordering a frappé with milk, you order it ""me gala."", Add cold water to fill the glass. Again, different recipes call for different amounts, with some calling for as little as two ounces,and others as much as eight.Experiment and find the amount that you like best.

, Always serve with a straw, as the drink will need to be stirred periodically during consumption to combine the froth with the liquid.Don't stir too much or too vigorously, or you will break up the froth.

Enjoy the product of your labor!",How to Make Roti," Traditional roti recipes call for chapati (sometimes spelled “chapatti”) flour, which is also known as durum wheat atta. Some recipes just list “atta” in the ingredients list; they are typically referring to chapati flour (indeed, the terms “roti” and “chapati” are sometimes used interchangeably—they are both unleavened wheat flatbreads).


Atta/chapati flour is a finely ground whole wheat flour.It's the traditional choice for making roti.
If you can't find chapati flour or don't have it on hand, you can substitute whole wheat flour. Because it is a heavier flour, though, you should consider using a mixture of half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour to more closely approximate the texture of chapati flour.
You may even use only all-purpose flour in the recipe if that's all you have available. If you go this route, though, you may need to use less water. Be sure to pay attention to the consistency and texture of the dough as you mix; we'll explain more about this in the following steps.
Additionally, if you use only all-purpose flour, your roti won't have as chewy and nutty of a flavor as traditional roti.;
, You'll need to have a small amount of oil on hand to brush the finished rotis with, and optionally, a bit to add to the dough. You can use any cooking oil: olive oil, vegetable oil, melted butter or ghee, but ghee is recommended.


Ghee is a clarified butter which has been simmered until all of the moisture has evaporated and the milk solids have begun to brown. Ghee has a nutty, carmel-like flavor and color. Ghee has a very high smoke point (almost 375°) and is thus well-suited for frying. It's readily available at Middle-Eastern and Indian markets and specialty food shops, or you can make your own ghee at home., Place the flour in a large mixing bowl, your mixer, or the bowl of your food processor (fitted with a dough blade). Add the salt, and mix thoroughly.

, Not all roti recipes call for adding oil to the dough, but doing so can add a bit of flavor to this otherwise simple bread and can also soften it a touch. Add ghee to taste, up to approximately 1 teaspoon. Slowly mix the dough until flakes appear.


Make sure that you hands are clean if you are mixing the dough by hand. If using a mixer, mix on low speed, and if you are using a food processor, pulse a few times until you see flakes.

, Slowly begin to add lukewarm water to the dough. The dough will be sandy at first, but as you add more, it should start to pull together to form a ball.


Be sure not to add the water too quickly; you don't want your dough to be too sticky or you won't be able to roll it out.
If you are using a mixer or a food processor you may have to stop on occasion to scrape down the sides of the bowl before mixing/pulsing more.
The finished dough should be soft and slightly sticky, though you should be able to peel it off your hand. If it sticks to your hands, it is too wet, and you should add a bit more flour.

, Once your ball of dough has formed, let your mixer or food processor run for another couple of minutes and/or knead by hand for about five minutes. This will help gluten proteins form.


The amount of time you need to spend kneading the dough is flexible, and depends upon the strength of your kneading or your kitchen appliance. You are aiming at producing a pliable, stretchy dough that you'll be able to roll out.







, Once you've finished kneading the dough, brush it lightly with oil or ghee, and cover it with a damp paper towel or cloth. Let the dough rest for approximately 30 minutes (it's fine to let it rest longer).


Letting the dough rest will result in softer rotis. The gluten you formed during the kneading process will relax, and any air bubbles will have a chance to be worked out of the dough., To cook your rotis, you will need a griddle, a cast-iron skillet with a diameter of at least 8-9 inches, or a traditional iron tawa. Place the griddle on medium-high heat.


You can test the heat of your griddle by dropping a pinch or two of flour on the surface. When the flour browns, you'll know that your cooking surface is hot enough.
Most roti recipes recommend heating your cooking surface while you are rolling out the dough. If you are new to this, though, the rolling process may take a bit of time, in which case you don't want your griddle to get too hot or start smoking. If that is the case, you can wait to heat up your griddle.

, You will need a large flat space for rolling the dough. A marble slab or traditional chapati block are ideal choices, but a large wooden cutting board or even a countertop will work. Lightly dust the rolling surface with flour, and keep a small amount (about a ¼ cup) nearby for dusting on your hands as you work with the dough. Powder your rolling pin as well.

, Take the rested dough and knead it for a minute or two until the dough relaxes. Divide the dough into even balls of the same size (approximately 2"" in diameter).

, Take one ball and begin to flatten it between your palms. Lightly dust both sides with flour, and begin to roll out the ball on your powdered surface with your powdered rolling pin.


Move your rolling pin constantly in order to get as circular of a shape as possible. Envision a clock when you roll: Roll up from six o' clock to twelve o' clock, then up from seven o' clock to one o' clock, etc.
Be sure to flip the dough circle regularly so that the underside does not stick to the surface, and be sure to sprinkle more flour on the dough and the rolling surface as needed.
Aim for a circle that is about 6-8"" in diameter, but be sure not to roll the dough too thin. If it's too thin, holes will develop or the dough will stick.

, Place your flattened dough on the hot pan or tawa for about 15-30 seconds. The roti will be ready to be flipped when you start to see bubbles form on the top side. Observe the texture on the upside as well: it will begin to appear more dry when the underside is cooked. You can also peek at the underside using a spatula or a pair of tongs: flip it when you see brown spots.

, Cook the other side of the roti for about another 30 seconds. The roti will begin to puff (which is good!), but take a clean, dry towel and gently press the roti, focusing on areas that are puffing (this will help the air pass more evenly through the dough and help it puff more uniformly) and any areas that aren't touching the griddle.


Don't be afraid to rotate the roti so that it doesn't stick or overcook in any one area. You can also flip it back over to brown up the other side a bit more.
Depending upon how hot your cooking surface is, you may need to take more or less time in between flips. Pay closer attention to how the roti is browning as opposed to how long it has been cooking.

, Place the finished roti on a clean, dry towel and lightly brush with ghee or oil, then fold the towel over it. This will help keep the roti warm and soft while you continue cooking the remainder of your batch.

, For a complete Indian feast, try your hand at making raita, curry, and Tarka Dal. Serve with your freshly-made rotis!
