Dip it in the pani.,
Eat it while it's still crispy.",How to Make Pani Poori," In a mixing bowl, combine the flours and a pinch of salt. Add one teaspoon of warm water and mix it with your fingers. Add another spoonful of water and mix more. The dough should be course and loose in texture, rather than moist.


Add the water very slowly, in small increments, so that you don't end up mixing in too much. Poori dough should never be wet or sticky.
If the dough seems very moist, work in some extra maida (or cake flour) to absorb the extra moisture.;
, Use your hands to knead the dough for about 7 minutes, until it becomes tight, stretchy and shiny. This will encourage the formation of gluten, which is essential to the texture of the finished pooris.If the dough feels loose and falls apart, keep kneading. You should be able to stretch the dough without it breaking.
If you wish, you can knead the dough using the dough hook attachment on a stand mixer.

, Pour the oil over the dough and knead it into the dough for another 3 minutes. This will improve the flavor and texture of the dough.

, Form it into a ball and place it in the a bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp dishcloth. Set the bowl in a dry, warm place. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes to rest. This will further improve the texture of the finished pooris.

, Place the ball of dough on an oiled surface and use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a circle no thicker than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm). The dough should be easy to roll thin without tearing. It may snap back when you attempt to roll it, but with a little work you'll be able to create a large, thin circle of dough.

, You can use a biscuit cutter or the rim of a cut. Cut out as many dough circles as possible from the rolled-out dough.

, Pour 2 inches (5.1 cm) of oil into a stockpot or high-sided frying pan. Heat the oil until it reaches 400 °F (204 °C), or a bit of dough dropped into the oil sizzles and browns.

, When the oil is hot, place a few dough circles into the oil to cook. After just a few seconds, they'll begin to puff up and crisp. When they are crispy and very lightly brown, after about 20-30 seconds, use a large slotted spoon to place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Continue frying the remaining dough circles.


The pooris will cook very quickly, so it's necessary to watch them the whole time they're in the oil. Remove them before they turn dark brown, or they'll have a burned taste and fall apart easily.
Cook only a few pooris at a time. If you crowd the pot, it will be difficult to control the cooking time of each poori.
Don't cover the pooris when they're finished cooking, or they won't stay crispy.

, Peel the potatoes, then roughly chop them. Put them in a pot and cover them with cold water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer. Cook the potatoes until they're completely soft, and a fork slides through them easily. Drain the water. Mash the potatoes roughly with a fork.

, Put the red chili powder,chopped green chilli,chopped onions, chat masala and coriander leaves in the pot with the potatoes. Add a pinch of salt. Use a fork to mash the spices in with the potatoes to thoroughly distribute them. Taste the mixture and add more spices or salt if you wish.

, Stir in the and chickpeas with a spoon, so that everything is completely mixed. If you wish, add a few drops of oil to moisten the filling. It doesn't need too much moisture, though, since you'll be adding pani as the finishing touch, It will ruin the taste. Place all the spices and herbs together in a blender, food processor or mortar. Process them until they are ground into a fine paste. Add a little water if necessary to loosen the ingredients and make them easier to grind.

, Place the paste and water in a mixing bowl and mix well. Taste the mixture and add more black salt or spices as necessary.

, It's often served cold with the poori. If you wish to chill it, cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve pani poori.

, Do this with the tip of a knife or your fingertip. Be sure to tap gently, since the poori is crispy and fragile.

, Scoop in some of the mashed potato and chickpea filling. If you wish, you can add other fillings, too, like chutney, yogurt sauce or green moong dal sprouts. Spoon in enough to fill about half of the poori.

, Submerge the filled poori in the bowl of pani so that the extra space fills with the spicy water. Don't keep it underwater too long, or it will get soft.

, It's necessary to serve and eat pani poori right away, before it gets soggy and falls apart. Eat the whole thing in one or two quick bites. If you're serving guests, you can have them assemble their own pani poori so they experience the best texture possible."

",How to Make Slow Cooker Bolognese Sauce," Place a large skillet on the stove, and add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil. Turn the heat to medium, and allow the oil to heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until it starts to shimmer.You can substitute a dutch oven for the skillet if you prefer.;
, Add 1 finely chopped medium onion, 2 finely chopped celery stalks, and 1 finely chopped medium carrot to the skillet. Allow the vegetables to cook until the onion is translucent and they’re all soft, which should take 8 to10 minutes.Stir the vegetables periodically to ensure that they cook evenly.

, Once the vegetables are soft, add 2 to 3 minced cloves of garlic and 2 tablespoons (33 g) of tomato paste, and stir to combine. Cook the mixture for approximately 30 seconds or until you can smell the garlic.If you like, you can also mix in ½ cup (12 ½ g) of finely chopped parsley to the sauce base.

, After you’ve cooked the garlic and tomato paste into the mixture, turn the heat up on the pan to medium-high. Next, mix in 2 pounds (900 g) of ground beef. Use a wooden spoon to break it apart, and allow the meat to cook until it is just browned, which should take 5 to 10 minutes.For the best results, use ground beef that has a 15 to 20 percent fat content., Once the ground beef is browned, add 2 teaspoons (11 g) of salt, ½ teaspoon (½ g) of dried thyme, ½ teaspoon (½ g) of dried oregano, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of pepper to the skillet. Stir until the spices are fully incorporated.You can add any other seasonings that you like, such as crushed red pepper flakes or dried basil.

, When the spices are incorporated, pour 1 cup (240 ml) of milk into the skillet and stir well. Allow the mixture to come to a rapid simmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.For a thick, rich sauce, use whole or 2% milk.

, After you’ve brought the mixture to a simmer, allow it to continue cooking until the milk is reduced and there isn’t much liquid in the pan. It should take approximately 10 minutes., Once the beef mixture has fully reduced, use a slotted spoon to place it in the bowl of your slow cooker. Try to add as little liquid to the slow cooker as possible.For this recipe, your slow cooker must hold 6-quarts (5.7 l) or more.

, Open 2 28-ounce (794 g) cans of whole, peeled tomatoes. Use a strainer to remove the juice from the tomatoes, and reserve it for later., Transfer the whole tomatoes to the slow cooker bowl with the ground beef mixture. Use a spoon to mash the tomatoes against the side of the slow cooker to break them into smaller pieces.If you prefer, you can mash the tomatoes with clean hands as you add them to the slow cooker.

, Once you’ve added the tomatoes to the slow cooker, drop in a bay leaf. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly mix the ingredients together. It should have a thick, sauce-like consistency.If the sauce appears too dry, add some of the reserved juice from the tomatoes.
If the sauce appears too liquidy, leave it as is. You can evaporate the excess liquid can at the end of the cooking process.

, Once all of the ingredients are mixed in the slow cooker, place the lid on it. Turn the heat to low, and allow the sauce to cook for 8 hours.If you want your sauce to be ready sooner, cook it on high for 3 to 4 hours.

, When you reach the last 30 minutes or so of cooking, remove the lid from the sauce to determine its consistency. If it’s too liquidy, leave the lid off for the final half hour so the excess liquid will evaporate.If the sauce appears too thick, mix in some of the reserved juice from the tomatoes to thin it out.
The sauce will be creamy and rich when it’s finished cooking.

, When the sauce is finished cooking, toss it with your favorite pasta. It typically pairs best with ribbon-like pasta or tube-like pasta. Before serving the pasta and sauce, you may want to grate some parmesan cheese over the plate.If you prefer ribbon-like pastas, consider pairing the bolognese sauce with fettuccine, tagliatelle, or pappardelle.
If you prefer tube-like pasta, consider pairing the bolognese sauce with rigatoni, penne, or macaroni.

Bake the semolina gnocchi.",How to Make Semolina Gnocchi," Pour 6 cups (1.4 liters) of milk into a large saucepan and turn the heat to medium-high. Whisk the milk every once in a while as it heats. When the milk steams, add a few pinches of salt and gradually whisk in 1 1/2 cups (250 g) of semolina flour.It's important to whisk the semolina constantly and add it slowly. This will prevent lumps from forming in the dough.;
, Turn the heat to medium-low and use a wooden spoon to stir the thick semolina mixture for 10 to 15 minutes. You should stir constantly until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the pan. The semolina dough will become elastic and stretchy.You can also use a thick rubber spatula to stir the semolina as it cooks.

, Turn off the heat and remove the pan from the stove. Stir in half of the unsalted butter (4 tablespoons or 56 g), so that it melts completely. Stir in 1 cup (100 g) of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, so that it's combined. Add 3 egg yolks and stir the semolina gnocchi dough well.Adding the egg yolks last will give the semolina dough a chance to cool down a little, so the egg yolks won't cook.

, Spread a little butter across a rimmed baking sheet to prevent the dough from sticking. Dump the gnocchi dough on the pan and use your fingers or a wet rubber spatula to press the dough into a large layer. Try to press the dough down to 1/2-inch (12 mm) thick. You don't have to completely fill the baking sheet, since you'll be cutting out the gnocchi.If your fingers stick to the dough, dip your hands in warm water and then press down into the dough.

, Tear off a large sheet of plastic wrap and press it against the dough, so it doesn't dry out. Put the sheet of dough in the refrigerator and chill it for 40 minutes. This will make it easier to cut and handle.You can chill the semolina gnocchi dough for several hours or even until overnight.

, Turn the oven on to 450 degrees F (230 C). Get out a 3-inch (7.5 cm) round cookie cutter or glass. Remove the gnocchi dough and take off the plastic wrap. Use the cookie cutter to cut the dough into rounds. Avoid rerolling and cutting the scraps.If the cookie cutter sticks, just dip it in water.
You can fry the scraps or form smaller gnocchi rounds to cook separately. You can refrigerate the scraps for several days before using them.

, Spread a little butter in a large baking dish, so the gnocchi won't stick to the dish. Run a thin metal spatula under each gnocchi round and carefully transfer them to the baking dish. Set them in the dish so they overlap a little.You could also use a large oven-safe skillet instead of a baking dish.

, Melt the rest of the butter (4 tablespoons or 56 g) and slowly pour it over the gnocchi in the baking dish. Grate some extra Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top of the gnocchi.You can use as much extra cheese as you like. The cheese will give the dish extra flavor and will help it brown as it bakes.

, Put the dish of semolina gnocchi in the preheated oven and bake it for 15 minutes. The gnocchi should turn golden brown and will sizzle a little. Carefully remove the pan from the oven and serve it immediately.Consider serving the semolina gnocchi with a classic green salad and extra grated parmesan cheese.

Regular or mild pork sausage works well for these, but if desired, you could alter the flavor slightly by using hot sausage or Italian seasoned sausage.
If you don't want to mix the ingredients by hand, place them into the bowl of a stand mixer and combine them using the paddle attachment at low speed.
Note that the resulting dough will be crumbly, but it should hold together when pressed.;
, Use your hands to roll the dough into 1-inch or 1-1/2-inch (2.5-cm or 3.75-cm) balls. Place the balls 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart on a prepared baking sheet or plate.


As you grab the dough, squeeze the mixture in between your hands to help press and hold it together. Gently roll each portion in between the palms of your hands until it forms a ball.
Alternatively, use a melon-baller or small cookie scoop to portion and shape the dough quicker.
You can cook the sausage balls immediately using either the oven or stovetop. Note that you can also cover and store them in the refrigerator for 24 hours or the freezer for up to one month.

, Place the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Mix until evenly combined.

, Add the butter or shortening to the dry ingredients, then cut it into the ingredients until the mixture takes on the consistency of coarse crumbs.


Adding the butter in small chunks could make it easier to cut in. Use a fork or pastry blender to mash and slice the butter into the dry ingredients.

, Use your hands to mix the sausage into the other ingredients. Continue mixing until everything seems evenly distributed.


Nearly any type of ground sausage will work for this recipe. Use pork sausage for the most traditional flavor or turkey sausage for a healthier alternative. You can stick with mild sausage or use seasoned (hot or Italian) sausage.
Mixing the dough with your hands will be the quickest, most thorough method, but if you prefer to keep your hands clean, place the mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine on low speed using the paddle attachment.

, Add the cream cheese and shredded cheddar cheese to the sausage mixture. Use your hands to thoroughly work both cheeses into the dough.


Note that the cream cheese must be softened before you add it to the mixture. Cold cream cheese will be harder to spread.
Consider working the cream cheese into the mixture before adding the shredded cheddar. You can add both at the same time, but doing so may make it slightly harder to evenly distribute the cream cheese.

, Use your hands to form the sausage into 1-inch (2.5-cm) balls. Place the balls onto a prepared baking sheet or plate.


The dough should hold together fairly well, but if it seems a little crumbly, squeeze each portion in between your palms to help press it together. Roll the dough into balls immediately after doing so.
For a faster, cleaner alternative, you can use a cookie scoop or melon-baller to form the balls instead of using your hands.
Cook the sausage balls immediately after forming them or cover and store them until later. When stored in airtight containers, the sausage balls should hold for 24 hours in the refrigerator or one month in the freezer. Note that both the oven and stovetop cooking methods can be used for this recipe.

, Before forming the sausage balls, cook the quinoa and allow it to cool down to room temperature.


You only need 1 cup (250 ml) of cooked quinoa for this recipe, so that means you'll need roughly 1/3 cup (85 ml) of dry quinoa and 2/3 cup (170 ml) water.

, Place the cooked quinoa, cornstarch, black pepper, cheddar cheese, and pork sausage into a large mixing bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until evenly combined.


To keep this recipe relatively healthy, use reduced-fat cheddar cheese and reduced-fat ground sausage. The sausage can be made with either pork or turkey.
If you don't want to use your hands, you can mix the ingredients together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Use the paddle attachment and combine the dough on low speed.

, Roll portions of the dough in between the palms of your hands, forming 1-inch to 1-1/2-inch (2.5-cm to 3.75-cm) balls. Place the balls on a prepared baking sheet or large plate.


If the dough seems crumbly, gently press each portion in between your palms before rolling it into a ball. Doing so should help the ingredients hold together more effectively.
A cookie scoop or melon-baller could also be used to form the balls if you do not wish to form them by hand.
You can cook the sausage balls immediately or cook them later. Cover and store uncooked sausage balls in your refrigerator for up to 24 hours, or in your freezer for up to one month. When you're ready to cook them, both the oven and stovetop cooking methods will work.

, Prepare one or two baking sheets by lining them with nonstick aluminum foil.


If you don't have nonstick aluminum foil, you can coat the baking sheet with parchment paper, nonstick cooking spray, or a silicone baking mat.
When arranging the sausage balls on this prepared baking sheet, space them roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart to prevent them from baking together.

, Place the sausage balls in the preheated oven and bake until the bottoms are lightly browned. This should take 20 to 30 minutes.


The baking mix and reduced-calorie sausage balls will usually take between 20 and 25 minutes, but the scratch sausage balls may take up to 30 minutes.
If you're using standard aluminum foil or ungreased parchment paper, use a spatula to turn the sausage balls halfway through the cooking time. Doing so may prevent them from sticking.
To cook frozen sausage balls, allow them to thaw in the refrigerator for 12 hours before baking or bake them for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.

, Remove the sausage balls from the oven and cool for approximately 5 minutes. Pierce each one with a toothpick and serve as appetizers or snacks.


If desired, sprinkle the sausage balls with chopped fresh parsley before serving.
You can enjoy the sausage balls plain or with your favorite dip. Consider serving them with grape jelly, a mustard-mayonnaise dip, or barbecue sauce.

, Spray a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray and set it on your stove over medium heat.


Allow the pan spray to warm up for roughly 30 seconds before continuing.

, Place half of the sausage balls in the warm skillet and cook for 15 to 17 minutes or until done.


Turn the sausage balls frequently using a heat-resistant spatula to prevent them from sticking.
Note that you'll need to cook the sausage balls in batches. If you crowd the skillet, the balls may stick together or may not cook evenly.

, Set aside the cooked sausage balls and cook the remaining half in the warm skillet for another 15 to 17 minutes, or until browned.


Before cooking the second half, transfer the first half to a shallow baking pan, arranging them in a single layer. Keep them warm while the remaining sausage balls finish cooking.

, Pierce the finished sausage balls with toothpicks and enjoy them as appetizers or snacks.


Sprinkle the finished sausage balls with chopped parsley before serving, if desired.
You can serve the sausage balls plain or enjoy them with a dip. Grape jelly, mustard, and barbecue sauce are popular options.

Store opened jars in the refrigerator.",How to Make Chutney," Use only fresh, ripe vegetables and fruits. If you’re not following a recipe, you will have to choose your own base produce. The base produce of your chutney will be the featured fruit or vegetable. For example, if you’re making mango chutney, your base produce will be mango. Other popular choices include:


Tomatoes
Onions
Carrots
Raisins;
, You use both sugar and vinegar to preserve your chutney. For every 3 kilograms (6.5 pounds) of veggies, you will need 1 liter (0.26 US gal) (4 cups) of vinegar and 500 grams (17.5 ounces) of sugar.The vinegar must have at least 5% acidity, but you can use any sugar you choose.


Appropriate vinegars include malt vinegar, distilled malt (white) vinegar, and wine vinegar.Brown sugar will make your chutney appear darker. White sugar will not affect the color.

, Select seasonings that pair well with your produce. Seasonings include salt, pepper, spices, and aromatic roots such as garlic and ginger. When choosing seasonings, consider how well it will pair with your base produce. Popular chutney combinations include:


Mango chutney seasoned with 1/4 cup (2 oz) ginger, 1 garlic clove, a teaspoon of mustard seeds, and ½ teaspoon red chili pepper flakes.Carrot chutney seasoned with 1 inch (2.5 cm) peeled and minced ginger root, 5 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, a few coriander leaves, and 2 tablespoons tamarind pulp.Simple tomato chutney seasoned with two cloves of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, a dash of pepper, and a teaspoon of curry powder.

, Find a large, stainless steel stock pot and a non-reactive mixing spoon. Non-reactive materials include plastic, wood, and stainless steel. Next, set aside some clean canning jars for storing the chutney. These jars will be sterilized just before filling them with your chutney mixture.


Purchase canning jars from gourmet grocery stores or online.

, Thoroughly wash any fruits or vegetables you will use to remove dirt and debris. First, rinse the produce in cold water for a few seconds. Next, scrub any hardy produce with a vegetable brush to remove stubborn dirt.


Hardy produce includes potatoes, carrots, and ginger.
The FDA does not recommend the use of detergents, soap, or commercial produce washes when cleaning vegetables., Consider what size would be best for your chutney. For example, if you’re planning on pureeing your chutney, the size of the vegetable isn’t important. Alternatively, if you’re not going to puree it, consider cutting the vegetables into easy-to-eat, uniform cubes.Some fruits and vegetables have a thick, inedible skin. If this is the case, peel the skin and dispose of it. For example, mangoes need to be peeled, while tomatoes do not.
Remove and discard any bruised and inedible parts of the produce.

, Combine the vinegar, sugar, base produce, and seasonings into your stock pot. Gently stir the mixture to incorporate the ingredients. Next, place your stock pot on the stove.


If you want to add any inedible seasonings such as whole cloves, wrap them in cheese cloth and secure them with cooking string. The bundle will be easy to remove after the cooking is finished.
Cheesecloth and cooking string can be purchased at most gourmet grocery stores, cheese making suppliers, and online.

, Continue to heat the mixture for ten to fifteen minutes over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring continuously. After the mixture begins boiling, the sugar will dissolve into the vinegar.

, After the sugar dissolves, reduce the heat to medium low. Allow the mixture to simmer for 45 minutes to an hour.Test the thickness of the mixture before removing it from the heat. You should be able to remove a spoonful of the chutney to create a small crater without any liquid filling it in.A mixture is simmering when there are small active bubbles forming around the pot. If the mixture is too active, reduce the heat. If there are no bubbles forming at all, raise the heat slightly.

, Allow the chutney to cool for ten to fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally. If desired, use a stick blender to safely puree the chutney. If you decide to use a blender, puree the food in small batches and cover the blender in a towel. Otherwise, the blender will spray hot chutney everywhere.


Remember to pick out any inedible whole seasonings such as bay leaves or cloves., Some canning jars come with specific instructions for sterilization. If not, simply submerge the cans in boiling water for ten minutes. Take the lids off the jars before submerging them and add them to the boiling water. Use tongs to safely remove the jars and lids from the water.Let the jars cool on a clean kitchen towel before filling them.
Always handle the jars with clean hands to prevent contamination.

, Carefully spoon your chutney into the jars, leaving about ½ inch of space at the top. Next, place the lid on the jar and seal it tightly. The lid will protect the food from bacteria and other debris.Use a clean, damp towel to wipe away any chutney that gets on the jar or around the lid.

, You can use a boiling water bath canner or a clean stock pot. If you use a boiling water bath canner, follow the manufacturer instructions. Otherwise, choose a large deep stock pot and place a small baking rack on the bottom. Set the filled jars in the pot on top of the baking rack and completely submerge them in water.Bring the water to a boil and heat the jars for ten minutes.


If you live at 1,000-3,000 feet above sea level, increase your heating time by five minutes.
If you live at 3,001-6,000 feet above sea level, increase your heating time by ten minutes.
If you live at 6,001-8,000 feet above sea level, increase your heating time by fifteen minutes.
If you live 8,001-10,000 feet above sea level, increase your heating time by twenty minutes., First, lay a clean dish towel on your counter or tabletop. After the jars are done heating, remove them from the hot water bath with tongs and place them on the towel. Allow the jars to sit undisturbed for twelve to twenty four hours.


Set the jars in a low-traffic area to avoid any breakage.
If any of the jars crack while they cool, dispose of the entire jar, including the chutney. Otherwise, you risk eating spoiled food or ingesting glass.

, Once the jars cool, test the seal on the jars. To do so, press down on the lid. The lid shouldn’t flex or bulge. Next, try lifting the lid away with your fingertips. If the lid doesn’t budge, your jar is properly sealed.If your jar isn’t properly sealed, immediately process it in the hot water bath again to try and reseal it. Otherwise, refrigerate the mixture and eat it within a week.

, Place your chutney in a dark, room-temperature place, such as a pantry or under your sink. Next, allow your chutney to ferment for two to three months. Don’t open the jar until you’re ready to eat it. The longer you let it sit, the better it will taste.


Chutney can be stored unopened for up to a year., Once your chutney is done maturing, open the jar to check for spoilage. If you consume spoiled canned goods, you can contract Botulism, a potentially fatal illness. If you notice any warning signs, throw your chutney away. Warning signs include:


A bulging or leaking container
A damaged container
Foam that squirts out when the jar is opened
Moldy or smelly chutney, You can keep your opened chutney in the refrigerator for up to four weeks.After four weeks have passed, discard any uneaten chutney.

If you are unable to find these ingredients at your grocery store, try a specialty market that offers imported foods.
Stir ingredients with a spoon so that the spices and the yogurt are well mixed.;
, If you purchased meat that was not pre-cut into slices or cubes, cut up your beef into smaller pieces. Braising steak is a good choice for a higher quality cut, or stew meat is an option for a less expensive meal.Remember to use a designated knife and cutting board to slice meat.
Do not use the same surface to cut vegetables or other prepared foods.
Wash both the board and the knife thoroughly with hot soapy water after you have finished cutting the meat., Place the beef and the marinade in a sealed container, such as a ziplock bag, plastic box, or glass dish covered in plastic wrap. The beef should marinate for at least two hours, or as long as overnight.


Always marinate meat in the refrigerator, not on the counter which would encourage bacteria to multiply.
Turn the beef occasionally to ensure that the marinade covers it evenly.
Place marinating beef on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator to prevent possible dripping onto other foods., Cut off the top of the onion and remove the papery skin. Slice the onion in half from top to bottom. Place the flat edge on your cutting board to keep it stable. Make slices ¼ inch apart in one direction, then repeat the same process in the other direction.


By slicing in perpendicular lines you create pieces that are roughly even in size, which will allow for even cooking time.
Bend your fingers while cutting an onion, which keeps the tips of your fingers away from the blade edge., Cut or break off a piece of the ginger root. Use a paring knife or vegetable peeler to remove the outer skin and discard it. Cut the ginger into small pieces by making even cuts first in one direction, then again perpendicular to the first cut.


Your ginger root should be smooth and unblemished. When selecting your root at the store, avoid any that are wrinkled, soft to the touch, or visibly molding.
If you have leftover ginger, wrap it tightly in plastic and store it or put it in the freezer., Cut two large tomatoes into slices about ¼ inch thick. If desired, remove the skins of the tomatoes prior to slicing.


One way to easily remove tomato skins is to place the tomatoes first in a bath of boiling water for around a minute, then transferring them to a bowl filled with ice water. The peels will come off easily.

, Heat 1 tbs of cooking oil in a large, heavy saucepan. When the oil is hot, add the onions and stir regularly until they soften slightly, around 2 minutes. Add the ginger and stir to prevent sticking or burning.

, Stir so that the ingredients are spread evenly throughout the pan. Keep the temperature at medium heat until the entire mixture is bubbling slightly.


Remember to wash the spoon you used to stir the ingredients thoroughly, because it has come in contact with raw meat. Do not reuse an unwashed spoon later.

, Cover the mixture and reduce the heat to allow the mixture to simmer, around 20-30 minutes. Using a clean utensil, stir the food occasionally to ensure that it cooks evenly.

,, Bring 1 ½ cups of water to boil in a saucepan. If desired, add a pinch of salt. When water is boiling, add ¾ cup of rice. Stir gently to ensure that it is evenly distributed. Cover the pot and return the water to a boil. When the water returns to a boil, turn down the temperature to simmer. Keep the pot tightly sealed. Allow the rice to cook for 15-20 minutes.The rice is done when all the water is absorbed.
Once the rice is done, remove it from the pot to stop the cooking process from continuing.

, Rinse ½ cup of brown or green lentils in a strainer under running water, removing any that are shriveled. Place in a pan with 1 ½ C of water and put on medium-high heat. When water begins a rapid simmer, reduce heat and cook for 20-30 minutes.


The bubbles should be gentle, causing the lentils to move only slightly while cooking
If necessary add water, to ensure that the lentils are always covered.When cooking is complete, drain the water.

, In a large bowl mix the rice and lentils to form an even mixture.

, Spread half of the rice and lentils across the bottom of the dish. Layer one of the sliced tomatoes on top of the rice. Ladle half of the meat mixture on top of the tomatoes. Repeat the process with the second half of the ingredients.

Add the remaining water slowly, stirring until it's fully combined.,

Roll the dough with a rolling pin until the balls resemble thin, round pancakes.,
Heat a heavy frying pan, tawa, or griddle over medium heat and cook each chapati on both sides.,
Remove the chapati from the heat, and wrap it in a towel until they are all ready to serve.,
Serve.",How to Make Chapati," If you can get some durum wheat atta, this will give you the tastiest results. Though wheat flour is perfectly fine to use, it can lead the final product to be slightly more chewy, and will make it dry out a bit faster. In any event, place 2 cups of wheat flour or atta, 1 teaspoon of salt, about 1/2 teaspoon of ghee into a bowl and use your hands to mix the ingredients together thoroughly. Your hands will work better than any mixing tools for this one. You may even sift the flour and salt together before adding the ghee.


If you really want to be health-conscious, you can skip the ghee, but the chapatis won't be as tasty. If you can't find any ghee, you can substitute olive oil. It won't be quite as authentic, but it should do the trick.
Though these are the only ingredients you need to make a traditional chapati, you can add a teaspoon or so of your favorite spice, such as chili powder, if you want to make an addition to this simple recipe.;
, Most people recommend lukewarm water, but you can even use water that is a little warm, which will make it easier to knead the dough. For best results, mix the flour with your fingers in a circular motion as you add a little bit of water at a time. Dumping in all of the water at once will make it a bit harder to stir the ingredients. At first, the mixture will feel pretty coarse, but as you add more water, it'll start to stick together.

, Continue to add the water until you've added all of it and the dough seems to really come together. Once you feel like you've mixed it together pretty thoroughly, you can knead the dough with your knuckles until it's soft and round. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes. It's important to knead the dough as well as you can so that the gluten is formed. When fully kneaded, the dough should be nice and smooth; if it's too hard, then the chapati won't puff up. However, if it's too soft, then it'll be harder to roll it and it won't puff up, either. It's important to find the perfect balance.

, Cover the bowl with a cloth; use cling wrap only as a last resort. This should give the dough enough time to come together. If you let it sit for much longer than that, then the dough will lose some of its moisture. Some people say you should let it sit for 30 minutes or more, however. Start with the lower time and do it for longer the next time you make chapati to find what works best for you.


Optionally, when this time has passed, you can moisten your hands with a bit of oil or ghee and knead the dough for another five minutes. It should feel both smooth and supple when you're done.

, Each ball's diameter should be around 3 inches (7.5 centimeters), but you don't have to make them all equally sized. You should use your hand or a rolling pin to lightly flatten each ball and then drench it with flour on both sides. For best results, keep the rest of the balls covered with the cloth while you flatten each one and cover it with flour. If you uncover all of them, you will release more of their moisture.

, The first time around, don't expect these balls to come out perfectly round. That's okay -- they'll still taste delicious, and you'll get the hand of it as you perfect your skills. Rolling the dough until it is even will make it possible for the entire chapati to puff up.

, Place the chapati on the pan, cook it until it's a bit less than halfway cooked, and then flip it over and raise the heat a bit. Once you flip it over, the chapati will begin to fill with air. You should keep cooking it until blisters appear on both sides of the bread's surface. You should rotate each chapati every few seconds to make sure that it gets cooked evenly.


As you see the chapati filling up with air, you can lightly press down on these spots to encourage the air to pass through the entire chapati. This puffiness will make the chapati nice and soft. Once the chapati has fully puffed up, you can take it off the stove.
Some people will say that, once you start cooking the second side of the chapati, you should cook it directly over the fire of your stove, using tongs to flip it over. If you do this, make sure your stove is very sterilized and that you take extreme care.

, You can also place it in a container that is lined with a towel. Make sure to cover each chapati as soon as it's cooked for best results.

, Enjoy this delicious chapati with curry or pickles or use it as a wrap. You can even brush the chapati with some ghee to add an extra burst of flavor. You can easily enjoy these staples of Indian cuisine on their own.

, After rinsing the dahl, place it in a large bowl with the fenugreek seeds and cover with water. Ideally, there should be about 2 inches of water above the surface of the rice to allow for absorption. Soak for about 6 hours.

, A wet grinder is the best option for this,but a food processor or blender may work as well. Add the soaked dhal one handful at a time into the grinder.


If it seems dry, try adding a bit of the liquid that the dhal soaked in.
The dahl should have a creamy, fluffy texture.The grinding will likely take around 15 minutes.
When complete, remove the dhal from the grinder and place in a large bowl.

, You do not need to wash the grinder between grinding the dahl and the rice. Add all of the rice and one cup of the water that the rice soaked in to the grinder and grind for 20 minutes, or until the mixture is smooth but gritty.

, Place the rice batter into the bowl with the dahl, add the salt, and combine all of the ingredients by mixing them with your (clean!) hands. Cover loosely with a cloth or a lid that is not air-tight.


Be sure that any lid is not air-tight. Air expansion is necessary for the fermentation process.

, The mixture now needs to ferment by sitting in a warm place for 8-10 hours.The best temperature for fermentation is 80–90 °F (27–32 °C).
Leave the mixture out on the counter or in a warm room if you live in a warm climate.
If you do not have an area that is the appropriate temperature, place the batter in the oven in your home with the oven light on. The light bulb will produce enough heat to allow for fermentation but not enough to begin to cook the batter.

, After 8-10 hours, check the batter. It should have a frothy appearance, and it should have grown twice its original size. If it has not, you may need to leave it a little longer. If the batter is too thick to allow for pouring, add some water., Ideally, you should try to cook the batter after it has had time to ferment, but if you need time between the fermentation and the cooking, place the batter in your fridge.

, If you have refrigerated your batter, you will need to remove it from the fridge and allow it to sit at room temperature for at least an hour. The dosas work better with room-temperature batter.

, Bring the cooking surface up to temperature for about 10 minutes with medium heat. An appropriate cooking surface would be a nonstick skillet, an iron griddle, or a flat tawa., The best way to prepare and season the cooking surface for making dosas is to pour a few drops of oil on a cut onion and rub the onion with pressure around the pan.You may find that you need to adjust the amount of oil depending on the cooking surface that you use, but one or two drops should be enough.

, The size of your dosas will be, in part, determined by the limitations of your cooking surface. Dosas can be made small, for individuals, or larger, to share. If you plan to make larger, shareable dosas, you will need to double the amount of batter you use for each one.

, Scoop about ¼ of a cup of the batter out (preferably with a ladle) and pour it into your pan. Use the bottom of the ladle to spread the batter out by starting in the middle and spiraling the ladle outward until the batter has spread to the edges of the pan.You shouldn’t need to put much pressure on the ladle.

, Cook until the bottom of the batter has browned to your preference and the top has become firm. You may see bubbles emerge and then pop, leaving small holes on the top of your dosa.

, This step is optional because the thin batter cooks all the way through from the bottom, but if you would like extra-crispy dosas, you can flip them and cook the top side for about 40 seconds., Use a spatula (be sure to use one that will not damage your cooking surface) to remove the dosa from the heat. Use caution not to break the dosa (for aesthetic purposes—it would still taste great!)

, Dosas can be served folded in half or rolled.This should be done immediately to avoid cracking or breaking.

, Continue to make dosas until you run out of batter. You may want to serve each one as it is ready. If you wish to wait until they are all ready to serve them, place cooked dosas on a plate or platter in the oven set to “warm” with a damp cloth over them to keep them from drying out.

, Traditional dosa recipes call for it to be served with coconut chutney and sambar. Tomato chutney and cilantro chutney are also good options. At least two options for dipping are preferable., Though this is an Indian dish, dosas do not have to be served with chutney. You can try other dips, such as hummus, spinach dip, or even guacamole for a little Indian-Mexican fusion!

, These delicate crepes are best if fresh off the griddle, so try to time your meal so that you are ready to eat as soon as they are cooked.

, While fresh dosas are best, if you have leftover dosas and do not wish to discard them, try freezing them. They can then be reheated on a skillet. It may be better to freeze them flat (without folding them).


Be aware that the texture may change in the freezing and thawing process.

Alternately, toast the pine nuts in a pan over low or medium-low heat on a burner. Stir often.
Pine nuts burn very easily, making them somewhat finicky to work with. When toasting pine nuts, pay attention closely and move them around often. The difference between perfectly toasted pine nuts and burnt pine nuts is often a matter of seconds.;
, Chopping before they are put into the food processor makes a finer ground pesto in the end.








, Add the extra virgin olive oil in the spout gradually as the food is being processed.









If you don't have a food processor, you can also use a blender in a pinch. (Pesto will turn out finer and less grainy when using a food processor.)

, Give the food processor one or two more pulses.








,, Pistou is a french (Provence) variation of pesto made in a similar fashion, except without pine nuts. It consists of basil, garlic, olive oil, and sometimes cheese. Pistou is generally used in vegetable soup.








, To the original pesto genovese recipe, add a bit of fresh mint leaves and substitute almonds for pine nuts. The almonds may or may not be toasted.








, Red pesto is like traditional pesto, except it has tomato, much less basil, and substitutes almonds again for pine nuts.








, This pesto incorporates grilled red bell pepper, black pepper, and sometimes eggplant and ricotta cheese to go along with the basil and tomatoes. It has a distinctly spicy taste to it.








, For a very rich, sweeter pesto, combine sun-dried tomatoes along with pine nuts, garlic, and olive oil.








, Although basil is the traditional ingredient in Italian pesto — and almost religiously used in authentic Italian recipes — you can experiment a bit with the green herbs you put into the food processor. As a substitute for basil, try:









Arugula. Makes a very nutty pesto.
Cilantro. Makes a light, fresh, and clean-tasting pesto.
Ramson leaves. This makes for a German variety of pesto.
Parsley. Makes a light, clean pesto.

, Because of the cost of pine nuts, many people have taken to substituting other nuts into the original recipe in lieu of pine nuts. Substitutes often include:









Walnuts.

Fry your sage leaves in olive oil for a traditional and savory garnish.",How to Make Saltimbocca," No matter which meet you choose, ask your butcher to cut them thin, if possible. You can also thin them yourself at home, but this step will save some time and effort.


Scaloppine is also known as a veal cutlet, just with a more specific name.
Both chicken and veal are used for saltimbocca, but the more traditional recipes are veal-based.;
, Flatten the cuts evenly with a meat mallet or rolling pin. If the cutlets were cut thin by a butcher you should still take this step to lightly tenderize the meat.

, Fresh sage is always best. If the leaves are large, about the size of your index finger, then one leaf is fine. You can use 2-3 smaller leaves as well.

, Pound the cutlets a few more times to secure the prosciutto and sage to the cut of meat.

, The best way to do this is by weaving the toothpick up and down through the prosciutto and veal/chicken. Note that some chefs skip this step, opting to be careful flipping and turning the meat as it cooks. For restaurant-quality looks, however, the toothpick is a must., A tablespoon of each is a decent start, but you can season the flour with as much salt and pepper as you prefer. Use a fork to mix it evenly into the flour.

, Simply dip both sides of the meat into the flour, aiming for a light, even coat on the entire thing. Make sure the prosciutto is covered as well.

, You can replace the butter with olive oil, but the traditional dish uses butter. Save one tablespoon of butter for later when making the sauce.

, When you flip the meat over the prosciutto should be browned and crisp.


Do not crowd the pan, as this rapidly decreases the heat and prevents crisping. 1-2 pieces at a time is enough.

, If you're cooking multiple pieces separately, set aside the finished pieces and tent with foil to keep it warm. Then repeat with the next batch of saltimbocca.

, Use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up all the browned and cooked bits on the bottom of the pan. They'll be loosened from the pan once the white wine hits. This is called deglazing., Simmering the sauce develops the flavors and thickens it up, making it easier to serve and eat., This will add a light creaminess to the sauce, but you can skip the step if you're feeling health conscience. Alternatively, add a dash of olive oil., The dish is perfect right off the stovetop, as it doesn't take long to cook and gets a splash of heat from the fresh sauce. Enjoy with sprinkled parsley, Parmesan, or both.Be sure to remove the toothpicks before serving!
Pair with pasta, gnocchi, or fresh bread to complete a simple meal.

, This will keep your meat warm as you're working through multiple batches of browning. It also allows you to quickly crisp the prosciutto later on., If the butcher hasn't already cut them thin for you, use a meat pounder or rolling pin to flatten the meat. It needs to be thin in order to cook quickly and crisply.To prevent messes and splatter, cover your meat in plastic wrap before flattening it.

, Once it's completely melted and starting to froth, move on. You do not want to cook six pieces of chicken in the same pan, so save the rest for your second batch., It shoudln't take long, especially since your meat is so thin. Flip the cutlets once so that both sides are equally cooked., This will keep the meat hot as you finish the second batch., Remember, it only needs about 2 minutes on each side to get browned. When the chicken is all done, leave the stove on -- you'll need it for the sauce., Remove the other half of chicken from the oven and place 1-3 sage leaves over the meat. Cover with prosciutto as well., While waiting for the oven to heat you can get started on your pan sauce., Once the cold wine hits the pan it will loosen any burned or browned bits. Stir them into the sauce and let everything simmer.

The oven should still be heating up.

, Keep your eye on it -- broiling shouldn't take too long. Don't worry yet if the oven isn't quite up to temperature. The point here is to brown the prosciutto, not cook the chicken or veal, so it doesn't have to be broil temperature just yet., Once the butter is melted, simply let the sauce keep cooking until it is ready to serve. You should have about one-third of the liquid you started with when you added the wine., This is mostly up to you. Note that broiling is very, very quick, so keep your eyes peeled.

Meanwhile, the sauce should still be simmering, the liquid slowly reducing. If it is almost dry, add a little more wine to the pan.

, Once the broiler is off, pour some sauce over the meat and serve hot. You can garnish with fresh parsley or Parmesan, if desired. Lemon wedges are also common., This works particularly well for the quick recipe, as it already uses the broiler. Either way, this is an easy variation. Once the cooking is done and before pouring the sauce on top of each saltimbocca, top each cutlet with a piece of fontina cheese. Place each cutlet on a baking sheet and broil for 2-3 minutes, until cheese is melted. Top with one more piece of sage and enjoy., After flipping the final cutlet of meat, toss in 2-3 minced shallots, 1/2 pound of sliced mushrooms, and/or 2-3 minced garlic cloves into the pan. Let them cook for one minute, until fragrant, then add the wine, proceeding like normal from here to create your sauce.

Remember to take the chicken or veal out, too! If timed right, it should finish cooking right before your add the wine.

, This is a classic Italian paring, and it is easy to accomplish. Simply heat up 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil in a pan. If desired, add half of a finely chopped onion and 2-3 minced cloves of garlic, cooking for 1 minute. Then add a large bunch of spinach, enough to fill up the whole pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until soft and about half it's original size, stirring regularly., Veal is naturally flavorful, and needs little more than a bit of salt and pepper to truly shine. Chicken, on the other hand, often needs a little more ""oomph."" To marinate it, massage the following ingredients into the chicken and let it sit at room temperature for an hour, or 2-3 hours in the fridge.

Salt and pepper, to taste
1/4 (60ml) cup olive oil
1 tablespoon (30ml) chopped or dried sage
1 teaspoon (5ml) red pepper flakes
2 cloves garlic pieces, smashed into a paste., This is a classic Italian touch for professional dishes. Have a slotted spoon handy and heat up 1 cup (240ml) olive oil in a small pan on medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the sage and cook for only 30 seconds. Remove and pat dry with paper towels, then place 1-2 leaves on the finished saltimbocca when it is done."

Refrigerate the mixture until it's cool.To quickly cool the syrup before you freeze it, fill a large bowl with ice. Set the bowl that has your hot syrup on top of the ice in the larger bowl. Leave it there for 15 minutes till it's cooler.

, You don't always need to use a fruit puree base to make an Italian ice. You can try making a fruit juice lemon ice for something even lighter. Or, melt chocolate and let it cool before blending it with ice to make a chocolate Italian ice. Popular Italian ice flavors include:


Peach
Lime

Pour the mixture into a shallow pan.,
Freeze the mixture and scrape it.,
Blend the mixture for smoother Italian ice.,
Consider using an ice cream maker.,
Serve the Italian ice.",How to Make Italian Ice2," Fill a long shallow pan with the Italian ice puree. Using a long shallow pan (like a 9x13 baking dish) will help the mixture freeze faster. It will also make it easier to scrape or mix in a machine. Cover the pan with plastic wrap to prevent the Italian ice from absorbing smells from your freezer.If you want the mixture to freeze even faster, place the shallow pan in the freezer before you start making your Italian ice puree. This way, the pan will already be cold.

, Traditionally, you should freeze the Italian ice for 30 minutes before scraping through the mixture with a fork. The mixture will be slushy. Freeze it again for another 2 hours until the mixture is firm. This will a crystallized Italian ice that you can serve.If you used a syrup base instead of the puree, you'll need to freeze the mixture longer before initially scraping. Freeze it for 1 1/2 hours, scrape the mixture with a fork, and then freeze it for another 1 1/2 hours before serving., If you don't want a crystallized Italian ice, you can use hand mixer with beater attachments. To do this, freeze your mixture in a long shallow pan (like a 9x13 baking dish). Once frozen, remove the mixture and put it in a blender. Cover the blender with the lid and pulse the blender until the mixture is shaved. This will make a lighter Italian ice.If you don't have a blender, transfer the frozen mixture to a large bowl. Use a hand mixer with beater attachments to blend the mixture until it's as smooth as you want it.

, If you don't want to watch the Italian ice and scrape it periodically, you can also freeze it in an ice cream or gelato maker. This freezing method is hands off and will make a much smoother Italian ice. Pour the cold pureed mixture into your machine and follow the manufacturer's instructions.You should still be around when freezing the Italian ice in the ice cream maker. Most ice cream makers should only be run for about 20 to 30 minutes. If you run your machine too long, the frozen mixture will start to melt.

, Scoop the Italian ice into cones or small bowls. If you'd like to drink the Italian ice as it melts, you may want to serve it in a tall glass with a straw. You can also add an optional garnish to show what flavor it is. You can garnish with:


Sliced strawberry
Lemon or lime wedge
Thin slice of watermelon
Sliver of mango

Place it on a lightly floured surface, and use a rolling pin to roll it out until it is about 1 to 2 mm thick.You want to roll the dough out as thin as you can without it breaking.
If you have a pasta roller, you can use it to roll out the dough. Start with the roller on the #1 setting and then roll it through on the next 3 to 4 settings until the dough is very thin.

, When the dough is rolled out, place it on a flat surface. Use a knife to cut the dough into even rectangles in the size that you prefer.You can also use a ravioli cutter to cut the dough. However, you’ll need to place the filling on dough first, evenly spacing it out. Next, lay a second piece of dough over the first and press down to mold the two together. Use the cutter to cut out each ravioli around the filling.

, After you’ve cut the dough into rectangles, spoon about a tablespoon (16 g) of the filling onto one side of the rectangle. Fold the other side of the rectangle over the filling and press the ravioli closed with your fingers.The amount of filling you use will depend on the size of the raviolis. You don’t want to add too much so that it seeps out the sides when you close it.
To give hand-formed raviolis a more decorative look, you can crimp the edges with a fork.

, After you’ve filled the first raviolis, repeat the process with all of the dough. Place the filled raviolis on a large platter or cookie sheet until you’re ready to cook them.If you don’t plan to cook the ravioli right away, cover them with plastic wrap and store them in the refrigerator.
You can also transfer the ravioli to plastic zipper bags and freeze them if you don’t plan to cook them right away. They should keep in the freezer for up to a month.

, Once the water comes to a boil, place the ravioli in the pot. Stir well to ensure that it doesn’t stick the pot, and allow the pasta to cook for 7 to 8 minutes, or until it is tender but still has some bite to it.If you are cooking the ravioli from frozen, you will likely need to boil them for 10 to 14 minutes.

, When the ravioli are finished cooking, remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon or drain them in them in a colander. Place them in a large serving bowl, add your favorite pasta sauce, and toss gently to ensure that they’re all coated before serving.A basic marinara sauce works well for mushroom ravioli, but you can also use a mushroom cream sauce, a sage butter sauce, or vodka sauce.

Make fried rice.",How to Cook Rice in an Indian Style Pressure Cooker," Place the rice into a medium bowl. Cover it with water, plus leave an extra (2.5 cm) of head room. Swirl the rice around in the bowl and let it soak for one to two minutes. Drain the rice through a fine-mesh sieve and rinse it under running water for about 30 seconds.









Rinsing rice is important because it prevents the rice from sticking together once it’s cooked. Rinsing removes a layer of starch on the surface that would otherwise cause the grains to clump together.;
, Return the rinsed rice to the pressure cooker and add the 2 cups (474 ml) of water for cooking. For extra flavor, you can also add a teaspoon (5 ml) of olive, sesame, or peanut oil.This method works for all varieties of rice, including white, brown, jasmine, basmati, wild, long-grain, and short-grain.
To make enough rice for more people, simply increase the rice and water quantities equally.
For al dente rice, use 1½ cups (356 ml) of water instead of 2 cups (474 ml).
For wild rice, use 3 cups (711 m) of water per cup (178 g) of rice., Turn the pressure cooker so the handle is facing you, which would be six o’clock on a clock. Fit the lid on so the handle on the lid is facing five o’clock. Turn the lid to align both handles at six o’clock and create the seal.








For a pressure cooker that doesn’t have handles that align, place the lid on the pot until it’s sitting flush with the pot. Then turn the lid to lock it in place.
It’s important to secure the lid properly, otherwise the pot won’t be able to build the pressure necessary to properly cook the rice.

, On an Indian-style pressure cooker, the small weight that gets placed on top of the steam vent is what regulates the pressure inside the pot. When the pressure builds enough, the steam pushes the weight up and the pressure releases.

Place the weight on top of the steam vent coming out of the lid.The weight looks like a small plug, and will come with the pressure cooker when you buy it.

, Place the pressure cooker on a gas or electric stove and heat it over high heat. As the pot heats up, the pressure inside will rise. When the pressure cooker gets to the right pressure, the steam will push the weight out of the way and make a hissing noise as it escapes. When you hear this sound, reduce the heat to medium and cook for an additional three minutes.









An Indian pressure cooker makes a hissing sound when it reaches pressure, and this sound is referred to as a whistle., After three minutes, remove the pressure cooker from the heat or turn off the gas. Set the pot aside and let the pressure inside drop as the temperature cools. Leave the pressure cooker for 10 to 15 minutes before opening the lid.








To remove the lid, remove the weight and twist the lid to unlock it. Pull off the far side of the lid first to allow steam to escape away from you.

, When the lid is off, use a fork to quickly stir the rice and release any extra moisture. Then, serve the rice on its own, add it to other dishes, or serve it as a side with your favorite meals., Place the rice into a bowl and fill the bowl with water. Swirl the rice around a few times with your hand. Pour the rice into a fine-mesh sieve to drain the water, and rinse the rice under running water for about 30 seconds.

Rinsing the rice prevents it from sticking together.

, Pour the oil into the pressure cooker pot and heat it over medium heat. When the surface of the oil is simmering, add the bay leaf, cardamom, star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, and shahi jeera. Let the spices cook for two minutes.Shahi jeera is a sweeter variety of cumin. Substitute regular cumin if you cannot find shahi jeera.

, Add the onion to the pot and stir to coat it in the spices. Cook the onion for about three to five minutes, until it starts to brown. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for another two minutes. Then, add the potato, carrot, peas, and chili.

Cook all the vegetables for an additional two minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning.
You can also add the florets from a small head of cauliflower to the dish., Stir in the fresh mint and the biryani masala. Cook for another two minutes with the vegetables to give the new spices time to absorb into the dish. Stir in the water, lemon juice, and salt. Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat.

When the water is boiling, add the rice., Put the lid on the pressure cooker and turn it to lock the lid in place. Place the weight over the steam vent. Increase the heat to high and wait for the pressure cooker to whistle. When the cooker whistles, turn the heat back to medium and let the rice cook for another three minutes.

After three minutes, remove the pressure cooker from the heat.
Set the pot aside for 10 to 15 minutes so the pressure can stabilize.

, When the pressure cooker is safe to open, open the lid away from you so the steam escapes away from your body. Stir the rice with a fork. Serve the biryani with fresh pepper and coriander leaves.

You can also garnish the dish with a sprinkle of chopped cashews and raisins., Rice is a traditional side dish for curries in many different cultures. Indian, Thai, and Japanese curries are often served with steamed or fried rice. The rice you make in an Indian-style pressure cooker is an ideal side dish for these curries, including:

Japanese curry

Yellow and red Thai curries
Indian curries

, There are many different types of meat, seafood, and vegetable stir fries, and they all taste great served with rice. Plus, the rice helps you feel fuller, and provides you with lots of carbohydrates, protein, and vitamins.

You can also pair rice with meat and vegetable dishes, such as beef and broccoli.

, Fried rice is a delicious side dish, but you can also cook the rice with vegetables, meat, tofu, legumes, and other foods to make complete and balanced meals.

Rice is always boiled or steamed before it’s fried, so rice that’s been pre-cooked in a pressure cooker is ideal for this dish.

Stir the ingredients together well so they’re fully blended.When you’re cutting the scallions, make sure to include only the white and tender green parts.
Be careful to remove the stem and seeds from the red chile before adding it to the bowl.
Nori is another type of edible seaweed. For the poke, you can use the sheets usually meant to wrap sushi. If you crush approximately 3 of the sheets, you’ll have the seaweed you need for the recipe.

, Once all of the other ingredients are mixed, add 12 ounces (340 g) of boiled octopus that’s been cut into ½-inch (13-mm) cubes into the bowl. Use a spatula to gently fold the octopus in so it’s fully incorporated.You can purchase boiled octopus at many Japanese markets.
You can boil the octopus yourself if you prefer. Fill a large pot with salted water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Add the octopus and boil it for 10 minutes or until it is cooked through to the center. Immediately, place it in an ice water bath to stop the cooking.

, After all of the ingredients are mixed, leave the poke to sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. That allows all of the flavors to come together.Octopus poke is not a good dish to prepare ahead of time. You’ll get the best flavor if you mix it right before you plan to eat it.

, After you’ve let the poke sit for several minutes, spoon it in individual bowls to serve. It makes an ideal appetizer or first course, though you can serve it with rice as a meal.The octopus poke recipe makes approximately 6 to 8 servings.

Mix well so all of the ingredients are fully combined.You can use any sweet onion, such as a Vidalia, Walla Walla, or Bermuda, in the salmon poke.
You can use a combination of the white and black sesame seeds if you prefer.
You can use store-bought fried shallots, which you can usually find at Asian markets, or fry your own.

, After you’ve mixed the ingredients, stir in a pinch of kosher salt. Taste the mixture to determine if you’re happy with the seasonings, and adjust accordingly.Depending on your preference, you may want to mix in more soy sauce, sesame oil, and/or chili garlic sauce.

, Once you’re happy with the flavor of the poke, let it sit at room temperature for 5 minutes. The ingredients will have time to marinate together, so the flavors meld and deepen., After the poke has marinated for several minutes, divide it between several bowls. Serve it alone as a salad or appetizer, or pair it with steamed rice for a main course.The salmon poke serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer and 2 to 3 as a main course.

Once you have these three things down, you'll be able to easily adapt and customize your curry to your own taste preferences. Simply mix and match ingredients into the following ""formula"" to get your own curry cooking:



Onions/Garlic/Ginger: These three ingredients form the basis of most curries, but some Indians actually skip the garlic.The longer you cook these ingredients the richer and darker the curry will be.

Generous Spices: Curries need big spoonfuls of spices, added early to cook and soften. There is no ""wrong"" combination of spices, so work on finding the mixtures you love.

Thickening Agent: What is going to give your curry it's body? This is frequently one or more of the following -- yogurt, coconut milk, stock, water, pureed or diced tomatoes, chili paste, or spinach.;
, You want the oil to be hot and shimmering. You can use whatever oil you'd like, but 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) of peanut, canola, or vegetable is your best bet.


For a traditional Indian dish you should use Ghee, also known as clarified butter, for oil., Once the oil is hot, toss in any combination of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) coriander/cumin/mustard seeds, fenugreek, and asafoetida, depending on your recipe. Curries are heavily spiced, but also heavily improvised, so feel free to try any combination of spices you'd like.


For your first recipe, try 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) cumin and coriander, plus a pinch of asafoetida if you have it.
Crackling means the seeds are hopping around in the pan, dancing.

, Dice the onion into small, roughly 1/2-inch squares and toss it into the oil. Cook until the edges are translucent and they begin to turn golden, 5-10 minutes.


The longer you cook the onions, the richer the final curry will be. You can also stop right as they edges turn clear for a lighter yellow curry., Finely chop up the 2-inch piece of ginger and 2-3 cloves of garlic, to taste. Add them in to cook and soften with the onions relatively soon after the onions go in. Toss in a pinch of salt, to taste, as they cook.


Onions, garlic, and ginger are considered the ""trinity"" of Indian cuisine, much like onions, carrots, and celery are the basic trinity of French cooking., Curries are heavily spiced dishes, and you need to let the spices cook in with the dish to get the best flavor. Add 1 tablespoon of ground chili powder, cardamom, cayenne pepper, turmeric, cinnamon, and/or curry powder to the oil. Add 1⁄2 tablespoon (7.4 ml) of salt after the spices go in. Stir them in and cook for another 2-3 minutes.


You want your spices to cook, but not burn. If there is not a lot of liquid in the pan from the onions and oil, mix the spices up with 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of water to rehydrate them and prevent burning.For your first recipe, try out a tablespoon each of chili powder, turmeric, cardamom, and curry powder.

, The longer you cook chilies, the sweeter they become, so add these towards the end of the cooking if you want extra heat. Chop up 2-3 scotch bonnet peppers, Habanero cayenne, Serrano, or finger chilies and toss them in to cook with the onions and garlic, or simply add 1-tablespoon of dried cayenne pepper. with the other spices.

, Add 1-2 chopped chicken breasts, shrimp, or lamb to the dish and an extra splash of oil. You can also add vegetables, like 1 can of chickpeas, 2 cups of cauliflower, one eggplant, chopped into 1-inch cubes, chopped pineapple, tomato, or a potato, diced into small cubes.


If you are adding meat, try browning the outside in a separate pan. Then add it to the curry before moving on.

, Add any mixture of water, stock, or coconut milk to the ingredients slowly, just until it starts to cover the vegetables and meats. Stir well and cover, lowering the heat to a simmer.


If you want garam masala in your dish, add 1-tablespoon now. It does not need to cook as long as the other spices.
For your first recipe, try adding one can of coconut milk for an easy, thicker curry, or 2 cups of vegetable, chicken, or beef stock.

, This is the time to add 2 cups chopped spinach (saag), 1 cup of unsweetened yogurt, 1/2-1 cups tomato puree, 2-3 tablespoons chili paste, or even a handful of ground peanuts or almonds. Toss in a pinch of salt as well, to taste.


Not all curries will need this, especially if you used coconut milk earlier on. You should still experiment with thickening ingredients, especially tomato puree -- the base of red curries.
For your first curry, try adding 2 tablespoons of tomato puree, then adding more to taste.

, Let the curry cook on low. You'll see the oil and water separate, but this is a good thing. Sample the sauce frequently, adding more salt and spices as desired. This is a good time to add ""heat,"" or spicy flavorings.


If your curry is too thin, add 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of yogurt or tomato puree., Curry can stand up to long cooking, so feel free to keep it on low while you finish up other recipes. Just make sure it is hot when you serve it, topped with any accouterments you might enjoy. Serve alone or over a bed of rice."
"
Understand how different sauces are created.,
Pulse or blend your ingredients ahead of time for a smoother sauce.,
Remember that cooking curry is about method, not a specific recipe.,
Play with the spices you want to add.",How to Make Indian Curry2," When you go to an Indian restaurant there are a variety of different dishes that all use the same basic ingredients and technique used in curries. The difference is primarily in thickening agent used:



Korma uses a creamy agent, like coconut milk, yogurt, or cream.

Saag uses greens, usually spinach but sometimes mustard/collard greens.

Madras uses pureed and diced tomato

Vindaloo uses pureed chilies., This technique, used in many restaurants, creates a curry paste of onions, garlic, ginger, and spices, which cooks faster and results in a smoother curry. To make it, use a food processor to grind everything up into a thick paste, then add it to the hot oil after the seeds have crackled., There is no one ""curry"" recipe out there. Curry is about mixing and matching ingredients using curry cooking technique, as outlined above. Still, to make the most basic, run-of-the-mill curry you would add and cook, in this order:


3 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter)
1/2teaspoon ground cumin seed
1/2teaspoon ground coriander seed
1 medium onion - finely chopped
4 cloves garlic - peeled and sliced
1.5-inch piece ginger - peeled and thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder, curry powder, salt
2 mild fleshy green chilies - de-seeded and chopped
5 tablespoons tomato puree or 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) concentrated tomato paste mixed with 4 tablespoons water, You should add spices generously, tasting and sampling every chance you get. Start with a tablespoon of any of following, adding more or less to fit your preferences:


Cumin (essential)
Coriander (essential)
Turmeric (essential)
Ground chili powder
Cardamom
Cayenne pepper
Cinnamon
Curry powder
Smoked paprika
Garam masala
Asafoetida (just a pinch, also called ""hing"")

"
"
Finely chop one yellow onion, 1-2 inches of fresh ginger, and 4-5 large cloves of garlic.,
Mix up your desired spices, using cumin, turmeric, cayenne, paprika, and chili powder.,
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and drop the greens in for 10 seconds, then drain.,
Immediately dump the hot spinach in an ice water bath, or rise for 30 seconds under cold water.,
Place 2 tablespoons ghee, butter, or oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.,
Toss in your spice mixture, cooking for only 10-20 seconds, then toss in the chopped vegetables.,
While the vegetables cook, chop your greens into your desired texture.,
Add the greens and paneer cubes once the onions are almost translucent, or slightly see-through.,
Add a half teaspoon of garam masala for a warm, spiced kicked.,
Consider adding a touch of cream or yogurt if you want a creamy saag.,
Serve hot over rice, only cooking the greens until up to heat.",How to Make Saag Paneer1," This dish takes place in one pan, meaning you need everything ready ahead of time to prevent burning and ensure proper cooking times. Dice the onion and mince both the garlic and ginger, setting aside for now.



Optional, but recommended: If you like heat, chop up and add 2-3 green chilis here as well, setting aside with the other three.;
, The exact ratios depend on your preferences, so mix everything together in a small bowl ahead of time and take a big whiff, adding more as needed. Start with a 1/2 teaspoon of each to start, smelling and adapting as you like:


Just use turmeric and a bit of cumin (dried seeds are best) for a simple, classic flavor.
If you aren't using fresh fenugreek, a touch of dried leaves will go nicely here.
If you don't have fresh ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger can be substituted here.

, This is the first step of ""blanching,"" which quickly cooks the spinach without losing its color or flavor. Bring the water to a rolling boil, then drop your fresh spinach in for a brief time before draining it all out.Most saags are heavy on spinach, using mustard and fenugreek to complement the main attraction. You can make an all spinach saag, though this is technically known as ""palak paneer."", This will halt the cooking process immediately. When done, drain any excess water and squeeze the spinach dry between some paper towels. Set aside.

, Heat until the oil is hot. Ghee (clarified butter) is the preferred choice for Indian chefs, but regular butter or canola oil will do fine without ruing the flavor.

, The spices will develop best when ""toasted"" for several seconds, though you need to take care not to burn them if they start to smoke. After ten seconds, add the onion, garlic, ginger, and chili (if used) and stir well to coat. Add a dash of salt with the vegetables to help them cook.


If you're worried about the spice burning, add them with 2 tablespoons of water., Many Northern Indian chefs (where this dish originated) only roughly chop the greens, leaving them in big chunks to enjoy. However, some western cooks prefer a smoother curry of sorts, using a blender or food processor to grind the greens up into a thick sauce of sorts. The choice is all yours.


Make sure you remember to stir the vegetables while they cook -- don't let them burn!

, The onions will start to go clear in the centers. This is your cue to add the greens, stirring well and adding another dash of salt.

, This famous spice blend is slightly sweet, helping it balance against the chilis and garlic for a fantastically well-rounded dish. Add it now and stir in well to mix.

, Again, personal preference is key here. If you want a chunky, greens-heavy dish, skip the liquid. If you want a smoother, richer dish, add 1/3 cup of heavy cream, whole milk, or plain yogurt. Sour cream, in a pinch, will work as well., The greens, already blanched, don't need to cook anymore. Once you add them with the cheese, stir everything to bring it to the same heat and then serve hot with rice."
"
Simmer half a gallon of milk over medium heat.,
Add a 1/4 cup of lemon juice once the milk is steamy and frothy.,
Remove the mixture from heat, stir, and let it all sit for 10 minutes.,
Place some cheesecloth in a mesh strainer, then use it to strain the liquids out of your milk mixture.,
Keeping the cheesecloth wrapped around the curds, press the whole bunch into a rough square.,
Place a flat cutting board or plate on the curds, weigh it down, and wait one hour.,
Fry the edges of the paneer in hot oil until golden brown for a richer taste.",How to Make Saag Paneer2," Stir regularly, making sure that the milk doesn't burn. Make sure you don't use UHT pasteurized milk, as it won't curdle well. This means it cannot be used to make paneer. A heavy-bottomed pan, which holds heat well, will always make it easier to cook than a flimsy cheap saucepan.


You can also use 2% milk if needed, but do not use 1% or skim milk. The fat content is too low to curdle correctly.Don't let the milk boil. If you have a candy thermometer, aim for 190-200°F

, Once the milk has scalded, add in your lemon juice and mix it in well. This causes the milk to curdle, which is how cheeses are formed.You can use 1/4 cup of vinegar in place of lemon juice. However, the paneer will have a different taste, slightly, when done.

, After ten minutes, the milk should look weird, yellow, and watery. This means that the acid in the lemon is doing its work, helping break down the milk and curdle it into a cheese.


If it isn't quite curdled after 10 minutes, add another pinch of lemon juice, stir, and wait., You should be left with a cheesecloth full of unformed curds, or little bits of milk solids. Wrap the remains in the cheesecloth then press firmly to squeeze any last liquids out of your curds.When done, add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the curds to bring out their flavor.

, Place the cloth full of curds on a cutting board and mold it into a large cube, more or less.

, Use a large cookbook or two to weigh the plate down, further pressing the paneer into a cube. This will compact and press the cheese into firm, edible cubes. Skipping this step often leads to an unformed, easily crumbled mess, so be sure to press the curds for at least an hour., This will create a lightly crisped outer texture, giving way to the soft cheese underneath. It takes a little extra time, and leads to one more pan to clean, but is a restaurant-quality touch that you can't miss.


Lightly salt the cubes as they cook to bring out a stronger flavor.

Follow this recipe to make hoppers within 3 hours.,
Mix yeast, sugar, and warm water together.,
Add the yeast mixture to rice flour and salt.,
Add coconut milk to the mixture.,
Cover the bowl and let rise.,
Heat a pan over medium heat.,
Add a small amount of oil to the pan.,
Add a ladle-full of batter and swirl it around the pan.,
Crack an egg over the center of the hopper (optional).,
Cover and cook until the edges brown.,
Remove from the pan carefully.,
Cook remaining batter the same way.,
Serve hot for breakfast or dinner.",How to Make Hoppers1," This recipe replaces slower methods of fermentation with yeast, which only takes about 2 hours to give the batter the right consistency and flavor for cooking. Hoppers made this way do taste different than hoppers made with toddy or baking soda, but they are still tasty and you'll save a lot of preparation time.


This is also the best recipe to follow if you don't have a food processor or strong blender, since all the ingredients are easy to stir together by hand.;
, Use 1/4 cup (60 mL) water heated to 110–115ºF (43–46ºC).Briefly stir in 1 tsp (5 mL) sugar and 1 tsp dry active yeast. Let sit for 5–15 minutes, until the mixture is foamy. The temperature and sugar causes the dry yeast to activate, turning the sugar into the flavors and airiness that make good hopper dough.


If you do not have a thermometer you can use for the water, use lukewarm or slightly warm water. Water that is too hot will kill the yeast, while water that is too cool will simply take longer to work.
If your yeast mixture won't foam, you may be using old or damaged yeast. Try a new packet.

, Once the yeast mixture is foamy, transfer it to a large bowl containing 3 cups (700 mL) rice flour and 1 tsp (5 mL) salt.Stir this together.


Use a bowl that can hold about 3 quarts (3 liters), since the batter will expand.

, Pour in 2.5 cups (640 mL) coconut milk and stir together until you have a smooth, consistent batter, with no lumps or color changes. You may puree this if you have a blender or food processor, but with this recipe it should be fairly easy to stir the batter by hand.

, Now that the yeast is active, it will continue to ferment the sugars in the batter. This will make the batter expand into an airier mixture, and add additional flavor as well. Cover the bowl and let it sit on the counter for about 2 hours.The dough will expand to about twice its size by the time it's ready.Yeast works more quickly at warmer temperature, or if it is still relatively new. Check on it after an hour to see if the batter has already expanded enough.

, If you have one, use a hopper pan, also called an appam pan, which has outward sloping sides that create hopper with a thin outer rim and a thicker center. Otherwise, a small wok or nonstick skillet will work.Heat it for about two minutes.

, Two or three drops of oil should be enough for a single hopper. Twirl the pan to make sure the oil covers the sides, or use a cloth to apply it evenly.Some people prefer not to use any oil at all, but it helps prevent your hopper from sticking to the pan.

, Add roughly 1/3 cup (80 mL) of batter to the pan. Immediately tilt the pan and move it in a circular motion so the batter covers the sides and base of the pan. A thin, lacy layer of batter should stick to the sides, with a thicker layer in the center.


If the batter is too thick and won't leave the center of the pan when you twirl, stir 1/2 cup (120 mL) coconut milk or water into the batter before making your next hopper.

, If you like, crack an egg directly over the center of the hopper. You might want to taste your first hopper plain first before you decide whether you'd like to try it with eggs. If each person is eating several hoppers, an egg for every hopper is probably too much. Consider 0-2 per person depending on their preference.

, Cover the pan with a lid and let the hopper cook for 1–4 minutes, depending on temperature and batter consistency. The hopper is ready when the edges are brown and the center is no longer runny, although you can leave them in longer for a crisper, golden-brown center if you prefer., A butter knife or other thin, flat utensil is good for removing the thin, crispy edge from the pan without breaking it. Once it's unstuck, use a spatula to transfer the hopper onto a plate. You can stack hoppers on top of each other as you cook them. If you are making a large number of hoppers (double or triple recipe) and want to keep them warm, place them in the oven at minimum temperature settings or with just the pilot light on.

, Grease the pan lightly between each hopper and cook each hopper in the covered pan until brown. Adjust the amount of batter you use if the hoppers are too thick to cook properly or too small to create the lacy edge around the pan sides.

, They are excellent for balancing out spicy curries or sambols. Because of the coconut flavor, they pair especially well with dinner dishes containing coconut.

Bring the milk to a temperature just below boiling.,
Add lemon juice or citric acid, 5 ml (one teaspoon) at a time.,
Allow the curds and whey to cool for half of an hour (or until still warm, but at a temperature you can handle).,
Wrap the cheesecloth around itself in order to squeeze out moisture from the curds.,
Shape the paneer, into a block and wrap it tightly with the cloth.,
Soak the block of cheese in chilled water for 2-3 hours.,
Use as directed in your recipe.








",How to Make Paneer (Indian Cheese)," Then turn off the heat. It should be about 80`C.Temp(176 f).






;
, Stir the milk after each addition until the milk separates; the solid curds part from the green and watery whey.









You’re looking for just the right amount of acid to cause the gently boiling milk to curdle. If milk does not start to curdle immediately, start by adding only one teaspoon of lemon juice at a time in a stepwise manner until the milk curdles. Do not add more lemon juice than necessary; otherwise the paneer will not be soft, as well as will taste sour and bitter.
Stirring gently and continuously throughout this step will not only separate the solid whitish-colored curds from the greenish-colored liquid whey, but will also prevent the curds from sticking to the sides and bottom of the pan.
You will know that the curdling process is finished once the curds have stopped precipitating from the greenish colored liquid whey.

, Then strain the mixture through a cheesecloth in a strainer. Rinse the curds with fresh water. You may wish to save some or all of the whey; it can be used to make your next batch of paneer, producing a slightly more tender cheese than lemon juice.








, The more you squeeze, the firmer the resulting paneer shall be.








, By putting a cutting board or something heavy and flat on top of the paneer, you can force out more moisture, and shape it into a firmer block, suitable for slicing and frying. To get a more rectangular shape, tie a knot and place the cheesecloth bundle in a box without closing it. Place something heavy like a pile of books or a brick on the cheesecloth to press down and give the cheese the box's shape. The longer you press the cheese, the firmer it gets. Not all Indian dishes requires cheese to be made into solid blocks. Stuffed Paneer Naans for example require cheese to be loose.









Cut and shape the paneer as desired, depending on the type of dish the paneer will added to. Paneer can be cut and shaped into large circular patties for sandwiches, small cubes for savory gravy or soups, or crumbles for garnishing salads.

, This is optional, as the intention is to improve appearance and texture.

Cook remaining hoppers the same way.",How to Make Hoppers2," This hopper recipe uses either toddy, an alcoholic palm wine, or baking soda. While toddy is more traditional and adds a special flavor, both methods involve fermenting the batter overnight, producing a noticeably different flavor than the faster yeast method.

, You can use any variety of rice for this recipe. Since you need to start making these hoppers the day before, you could make a pot of rice for dinner that day and save a handful (or two large spoonfuls) in a closed container in the fridge.

, Use 1.5 cups of rice (350 mL).While you may be used to rice that doesn't require soaking, this recipe calls for blending the rice with other ingredients, so you'll need to soak it until it is soft enough to grind or put in a food processor., Strain the soaked rice through a mesh or cloth to drain the water, leaving softened but uncooked rice.

, This will take a lot of work by hand, so use a blender or food processor if you have one. Blend the uncooked rice along with the grated coconut and cooked rice to a smooth or nearly smooth batter. A slightly coarse or grainy texture is fine.Add water little by little to the batter if it looks dry or you're having trouble grinding it., Stir the batter together to get a wetter, thinner mixture. Use a cooking pot or other cooking container. You'll cook this mixture and use it to start the batter fermenting, which adds air and flavor to the hoppers.

, Stir the batter water mixture vigorously as you heat it at a low temperature. It should continue to thicken until it is gelatinous and transparent.Remove the mixture from heat and let it sit until it reaches room temperature.

, Stir together thoroughly until there are no lumps. Add a little bit of water as you go if the mixture is too dry to stir.Use a large bowl with plenty of space for the batter to expand.

, Cover the batter mixture with a cloth or lid and let it sit at room temperature. Often, people will leave it overnight and make hoppers for breakfast in the morning.


The batter should nearly double in size, and appear bubbly.

, Once the batter is ready, add 1 tsp (5 mL) salt and 2 tsp (10 mL) sugar, or according to taste. Add either 1/4 tsp (1.2 mL) baking soda or a splash of toddy, also known as palm wine. Toddy has a strong flavor, so you may want to start with as little as 1 tsp (5 mL) and increase the amount if the first hopper doesn't have a distinct sour flavor.


Toddy is alcoholic, but the small amount used in this recipe should not affect sobriety.

, The batter should be thinner than American pancake batter. Add water or coconut milk until it is thin enough to easily swirl round the pan, but thick enough to stay together and not become entirely liquid. Stir or blend until there are no lumps.

, Use a cloth or paper towel to rub a small amount of oil across a hopper pan, wok, or skillet to lightly grease it. Heat for a couple minutes over medium heat; the pan doesn't need to get too hot.


Small pans with wide, sloping sides work best.

, Depending on the size of your pan, you'll need about 1/4–1/2 cups of batter (60–120 mL). Tilt the pan and run the batter along the edges in a circle once or twice. A thin layer should be left along the sides, with a thicker center at the base of the pan.

, Keep an eye on the hopper. It is ready when the edges are brown and the center is soft but not runny. It may be cooked a minute or two longer if you want the center to be crisp, but many prefer to eat it with a white center. Use a spatula to transfer it to a plate once it's done.

, Grease the pan between hoppers and check on the hopper frequently during cooking times. Because the pan will heat up as you keep cooking, later hoppers may cook in shorter times. Turn off the heat for a minute or two if the hoppers burn or stick to the pan.

Add the cheese, 6 tbsp (50 g) flour, 3 tbsp (40 g) sugar, ½ tsp (2.5 mL) vanilla, and a dash of salt. Mix thoroughly until the ingredients are well mixed and the batter holds together in a loose lump, similar to thick pancake batter.








You may need to add extra flour if using a wet cheese.

, Heat about 1 tbsp (15 mL) of oil in a medium sized skillet over medium high heat. The oil is hot enough when it makes a sprinkle of flour sizzle., While waiting for the oil to heat up, separate the batter into balls that fit on your palm. Coat each ball in flour and flatten it gently into a thick, round patty, similar to an American pancake., It only takes a couple minutes on each side to cook these pancakes. The outside should be golden brown and slightly crispy from the flour coating, while the inside stays soft, fluffy, and cheesy.









Add a little more oil to the pan between each batch of syrniki.

, Serve the syrniki hot and enjoy with a garnish of sour cream, fruit jam, fresh fruit, applesauce, or honey.

Some foam will gather at the top of the water. Use a slotted spoon to remove this.If you are vegetarian, you can leave out the chicken.;
, While the chicken is simmering, you can start preparing your vegetables.Wash and peel the vegetables, but do not cut them.

, You will need 1 pound (0.5 kilogram) total of soup vegetables. Great choices for tomato soup include parsley root, celery root, leek, and onion. Try to have a combination. Wash and peel the vegetables, including the carrots, but do not cut them. Add them to the pot along with the carrots and spices. Do not add the salt and pepper just yet.

, While the broth cooks, you can start preparing the tomatoes. If you plan on using fresh rice in this recipe, it would be a good idea to start cooking it in a separate pot now; it will need about 20 minutes to cook.


You can also use leftover rice from a previous meal. Keep it in the fridge until you are ready to serve.

, If you have not already, peel the tomatoes first, then cut them into cubes. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, then add the tomatoes. Cook them until they turn thick. For a more intense flavor, add some tomato paste.

, Set them aside and save them for another recipe.You can pour the soup through a strainer into another pot, or your can pull the vegetables and chicken out with a pair of tongs.

, Pour the sour cream into a small saucepan or bowl. Whisk in a few spoonfuls of soup until the sour cream turns liquid-y. Adding some of the hot soup into the sour cream gradually heats up the cream and prevents it from coagulating.


You can use more or less sour cream depending on your tastes.
Sour cream makes the soup more creamy and rich. If you don't like creamy soups or are allergic to dairy, you can leave out the sour cream.

, Be sure to pour the sour cream in slowly. Even though you warmed it up early, it may still coagulate if you pour it in too fast. Stir everything with a whisk until evenly combined and no streaks remain.

, Give the soup a taste. If it is not salty enough for you, add some salt. If it lacks some spice, add some pepper.


If the soup is too sour, add some sugar.

, Spoon ¼ to ½ cup (65 to 125 grams) of cooked rice into your serving bowls. Pour the soup over the rice. Garnish the soup with some parsley, if desired.If you don't have any rice, a sprinkle of dill would also work.

, If you can't find any prepared chicken or vegetable stock, you can make your own using 6 cups (1.4 liters) of water and 3 to 6 chicken or vegetable bouillon cubes. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce it to a simmer. Stir the water to dissolve the cubes.


How many cubes of bouillon you use depends on the brand you are using. Check the label on the package to make sure. Sometimes it is 1 cube per 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water. Sometimes it is 1 cube per 2 cups (475 milliliters) of water.

, If you don't have any tomato paste, you can use canned tomato juice or sauce instead. Reduce the amount of stock in your pot so that you have equal amounts of stock and tomato juice/sauce., Everything that you put into the soup is already cooked, so you just need to heat it up. While the soup is simmering, you can get out your rice so that it is ready.

, To prevent the sour cream from coagulating, mix some of the soup into the sour cream first, then pour everything into the pot. Stir the soup with a whisk until no streaks remain.


If you don't have any sour cream, stir 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk into 1 tablespoon of flour, and use that instead., Give the soup a taste, then add some salt or pepper to your liking. This may not be necessary if you used chicken or vegetable bouillon.


If the soup is too sour, add some sugar., Spoon ¼ to ½ cup (65 to 125 grams) of cooked rice into each serving bowl. Pour the soup over the rice. Garnish the soup with some parsley or dill, if desired.

Eat and enjoy!",How to Make Sauerkraut," DON'T wash the cabbage -- you'll want the natural bacteria on the leaves. They're what causes the fermentation to occur that turns cabbage into sauerkraut.
Weigh the cabbage head. You can do this at the store before bringing it home, since many supermarkets have scales.
Cut the head into quarters, so that the core (stem) is cut into quarters.
De-core by slicing away the thick stem.
With the quarter-head on a cutting board, carefully slice the cabbage into shreds about the thickness of a dime. Some people shred them more thickly, though (about a quarter inch).;
,, You should add about 3 tablespoons per 5 pounds of cabbage.








This translates into 1.8 teaspoons per pound. If you're concerned about saltiness, start with 1 teaspoon per pound and add more until it reaches a good level to taste.
The salt serves multiples purposes. It pulls water from the cabbage, hardens pectins for better crunchiness, and discourages the growth of bacteria other than lactobacilli so the sauerkraut can be stored for longer periods of time., This is to break down cell walls and encourage the release of water. Continue until the cabbage feels very wet., Using a plate and something heavy, weigh down the cabbage for a few hours to encourage the release of more water. You may have to hunt around to find a plate the right size. You want the plate to be almost the same size as the crock, so that as little air as possible can get in the sides. You may want to cover the cabbage with plastic wrap first before putting the plate on top.









If you can't find a plate that fits closely inside the crock, you can use a disposable styrofoam plate that's too big. Just trim it to the right size with a pair of scissors.
Instead of using a plate and a weight, you can put a ziploc bag full of water on top of the kraut.

, If you can't compact the shreds below the level of the liquid, add some salt water: Dissolve 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of non-iodized salt in a cup of water, and add it to the cabbage shreds.








, Alternatively, transfer the cabbage and its liquid to a jar. Try to make sure all the cabbage is completely submerged.








, Put it in a cool place and wait about 4-6 weeks. 60 to 70 °F (15.6 to 21.1 °C) will speed up the process but cooler temps may produce better flavor. Try the sauerkraut once a week until it reaches the flavor you're looking for. If it's in a jar, keep an eye on it and unscrew the lid periodically to let air escape. Don't worry if some mold grows around the edges of the container. It won't get far. Just remove it when you see it.








, If you don't eat it all in one sitting, put it in the refrigerator to pause the fermentation process.

Serve the pretzels.",How to Make Soft Pretzels," Mix the 1 1/2 cups warm water, sugar and 2 tablespoons kosher salt in a large mixing bowl. Open the package of yeast and pour it into the mixture. Let it sit until the yeast starts to foam, about 5 minutes.






;
, When the yeast has started to foam, pour in the melted butter and add the 4 1/2 cups of flour. Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture until the dough comes together. Start mixing faster, working the dough in circles and folding it over when necessary, until the texture of the dough becomes smooth and it begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.









If you have a stand mixer, you could use the dough mixing attachment instead of doing it by hand.
Doing this step by hand will probably take about 10 minutes, but if you use a stand mixture, it will take about 5 minutes.

, Coat a large mixing bowl with oil. Form the dough into a ball and place it in the oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and place it in a warm area in your kitchen. Let the dough sit in the bowl and rise until it has doubled in size, about an hour.









If you want to use the same bowl you used to mix the dough, remove the dough from the bowl and clean it out, then oil it and return the dough to the bowl.
You can let the dough rise overnight in the refrigerator if you'd like.

, Depending on how large you want the pretzels to be, you could divide the dough into 8 - 12 equal pieces. The larger the pretzels, the softer they will be on the inside. Smaller pretzels will turn out firmer and crispier.








, Place a piece of dough on a floured work surface. Place your hands palms-down on top of the dough. Use your hands to roll the dough into a long rope shape. Keep rolling until you have a rope that's about 20 inches (50.8 cm) long. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.









The question of how long to make the dough ropes is up to your personal preference. If you like pretzels with thin loops and large holes, make the ropes longer and thinner.
For plumper pretzels, stop rolling when the ropes are about 18 inches (45.7 cm) long.

, Lay a dough rope on a work surface in front of you. Shape it into a U. Cross the two ends of the rope over each other. Press the tips onto the bottom of the U. Use your fingers to pinch the tips a bit to make sure they stay in place. Repeat with the remaining dough ropes.








, Preheat the oven to 450 degrees, and line a baking sheet or two with parchment paper. Coat the parchment paper with a little oil to keep the pretzels from sticking. In a large pot, bring the 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a boil.,, Place a pretzel in the boiling water and allow it to cook for 30 seconds. Use tongs to remove the pretzel from the water and place it on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pretzels.








, Use a pastry brush to lightly brush some beaten egg on each pretzel. Sprinkle the pretzels with pretzel salt or kosher salt. You can also add garlic salt, sesame seeds, black pepper, and other flavorings of your choice.








, Place the pretzels in the oven and bake them for about 15 minutes, until they turn golden brown. If you like hard pretzels, reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake the pretzels for an extra 15 minutes.








, These soft pretzels are delicious with honey mustard sauce, cheese sauce, or simply on their own. Serve them hot. You can freeze the extras and reheat them in the oven to enjoy them at a later time."

, To protect your hands, use a tea towel to hold the potatoes as you peel away the skins with a knife.








, Pass the still hot potatoes through a passatutto (or potato ricer). Or you can grate them. This method is recommended as air gets trapped in the potatoes making for a lighter gnocchi. If you don't have a passatutto handy, you can use a masher instead.








, Add 2 generous pinches of salt and a pinch of pepper. Crack the egg and stir in quickly before the temperature of the potato cooks it. (The egg is optional, though.) Add 2 handfuls of flour. Mix until fully absorbed.








, Turn the potato onto a wooden surface and tip the rest of the flour on top. Use your hands to mix it together. After a minute or two it will form into a dough. Knead lightly. When it reaches a pliable consistency, it's ready.

Check the quality of the ingredients for freshness of produce.,
Know your pasta.,
Use innate cooking skills.,
Be thrifty.,
Be prepared to include coffee.,
Be hospitable.",How to Cook Italian Food," When an Italian goes shopping for ingredients he/she picks the best. The most fresh. An Italian never settles for poor quality. If produce at all the grocery stores or markets in his/ hers area is bad or poor than he/she goes somewhere else. Never settle for poor quality ingredients, herbs, and produce. Generally a produce stand has or will have fresher produce and the produce will last longer. Do not place produce such as tomatoes and lettuce etc. in the fridge. The produce will last longer if placed on the counter and used within a few days. A good Italian cook ALWAYS uses fresh garlic.;
, Pasta is the or one of the most important parts of Italian cooking. There are nearly 120 different types and kinds of pastas, but It is a good idea to become familiar with the more common pastas, and, if you use dry pasta, it is a good idea to know how to make fresh pasta when you are caught without dry pasta. In general, the smaller or thinner the pasta, the less sauce you want to use. consequently the larger or more rigid the pasta (such as penne rigate which has ridges) the more sauce or heavier sauce you can use. But any sauce can go with spaghetti. Risotto and Gnocchi are classified as a type of pasta and may be used as such.

, Italians are very flexible with their cooking. Knowing how and when to substitute something for something else, in the occasion that the grocery store does not have something or a certain ingredient or a certain ingredient that a recipe calls for is very expensive and not within your budget, the good Italian cook knows how to substitute or use something else. A recipe calls for squash and you don't have it; why not use zucchini? If a recipe calls for mozzarella cheese and you are out; use fresh asiago.

, Italians waste nothing. Some may call this frugality, others may call this smart, and some may call this good economics. I would call it all three. If there is leftover bread (not, ""puffed up 90% air"" bread; real, delicious, and hot bread) it is left out to dry, seasoned or left plain, and made into croutons. If there is leftover pasta it is saved and use latter. I love to top left over pasta with a little olive oil, sun dried tomatoes, olives, and a pinch of salt and pepper.

, Coffee is a major part of Italians life. Italians usually enjoy a very dark, roasted, robust coffee as well as cappuccinos, caffe latte, and caffe macchiato. It is very likely if not customary to serve coffee to any guests an Italian has in his/her house.

, Italian cooking does not stop at the food, coffee, or ingredients. Italian cooking usually if not always starts and stops with hospitality. Italians always make their guests feel at home and there is nobody else in the world they would have over than you (The guest). The good Italian cook knows how to add more ingredients or add an extra side dish to make enough if he/she has unexpected guests. The good Italian cook always has enough food, coffee, and joy for everyone.

Bake for 30-40 minutes at 375℉, covered with aluminum foil.,
Let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before serving.",How to Cook Lasagne1," Make sure you keep the entire lasagna noodle from breaking, as you will need unbroken sheets when you layer the dish later. Add a pinch of salt to the pot right before you add the noodles and let them cook according to the time on the box, usually 10-12 minutes. Stir occasionally, every 1-2 minutes. When they are done, drain the water and set aside the noodles to cool. You will likely need you biggest pot, filled 2/3 with water, to fit the noodles. As you wait for the water to boil and noodles to cook you can move on to making the filling, however.
Some companies sell ""Oven Ready"" noodles that don't need to be boiled, so be sure to read the box to check.;
, Do not move on until the oil is shimmering. This means it is hot, and adding ingredients too soon can lead to soggy, oily food.

, Translucent simply means that the edges of the onions have begun to turn clear. You do not need the onions to be fully cooked just yet.


Looking to get more vegetables in your lasagna? Add 1/2 cup chopped carrots, celery and/or green peppers here as well for a heartier sauce. If you do, allow the vegetables to cook and extra 1-2 minutes.

, Mix the meat in with the onions and garlic, stirring well, and cook on medium heat until completely browned. Add salt and crushed black pepper, to taste, as it cooks. If you have time, cook the meat in a separate pan, though this is not necessary.


If you are using sausage, cut the casings off so you only have the ground meat inside.
You can also take this time to add 1/2 tablespoon dried oregano, basil, or rosemary, or simply 1 tablespoon of dried Italian seasoning.

, The pot needs to be big enough to hold your sauce and tomatoes as well.


This is a good time to check on your noodles if you've forgotten them. They should be pliable and soft, but still firm.

, Pour your 28 ounces of sauce, 12 ounces of crushed tomatoes and 6 oz of tomato paste to the meat and vegetable mixture and stir well. Raise the heat to medium until the sauce comes to a low simmer, when occasional bubbles break the surface of the sauce.


You can substitute 36 ounces of pre-made pasta sauce instead of the three different tomato products for a simpler sauce.
Take this time to add any additional spices you want, such as garlic powder, sugar, or more seasoning, 1 teaspoon at a time. Many cooks like sugar to balance out the natural acidity of the tomatoes.
Lower the heat if it is bubbling too much, you only want a low simmer.

, The longer the sauce has to cook, the richer it will be. Stir it regularly, being sure to get down to the bottom so that nothing burns. When you're ready to build the lasagna, remove the sauce from heat and let it cool gently.


The sauce does not have to be cold to move forward, but letting it cool slightly will make it easier to handle.

, Whip up one egg with a fork, as if preparing scrambled eggs, and then mix it in with the ricotta. The egg will help the cheese bind with the layers of pasta, keeping your whole dish together when it is done cooking., You want something with tall sides, such as a 13x9x2"" or 2-quart baking dish. Spread the sauce evenly, enough to cover the entire bottom of the dish.

, You should be able to get three noodles vertically layered over the bottom, slightly overlapping. While a little overlap (1"" or less) is fine, feel free to trim the noodles with a clean pair of kitchen shears if need be. You want the entire bottom surface covered with noodle.

, Spread a nice layer of the ricotta over the tops of the noodles so that every bite will be nice and cheesy. Be sure to save the other 2/3 -- you'll need it for the rest of the layers.

, Get your filling into the pan, spooning it generously over the lasagna.

, This final layer of cheese will complete your first layer of lasagna. Coat the top enough that the sauce is only poking out in a few places underneath, or use less for a slightly healthier option.

, The top and final layer should be mozzarella. Just keep layering your lasagna like this to end up with your final, glorious lasagna.


Top with a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese before putting in the oven.

, Put a layer of aluminum over the lasagna before it goes into the oven. To prevent the sauce from spilling over the edge as it heats up, you can also place the entire dish on a baking tray to keep the sauce from getting on your oven. Since the dish is technically already cooked, putting it in the oven is meant to melt the cheese and let the flavors meld deliciously. That said, you can take it out when you feel like it is hot and ready to serve.


Remove the foil for the last 5 minutes to brown and bubble the cheese on top., This lets the cheese re-solidify, just a bit, which will keep the layers from sliding off of one another when you serve the lasagna.

1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated.
1 teaspoon salt and black pepper
1/2 cup minced parsley
1/2 tablespoon grated nutmeg., This can be a great substitute for meat, but vegetables can also become fantastic complements to a meat sauce as well. Cook the vegetables in the oil for 5-7 minutes, until tender, along with the onions and garlic, then proceed to make the sauce like usual. If you are using it along with meat, cut the following amounts in half and cook the vegetables separately, then add to the sauce with the meat.


1 large eggplant, diced.
1 large zucchini, sliced.
1 lb small white mushrooms, sliced.

, Cut your eggplant into 1/4-inch slices and fry until soft in 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil. Set aside and pat dry with a paper towel, then add the sliced eggplant after the sauce. Top with mozzarella and continue layering as normal, placing a layer of eggplant after every layer of sauce. You can also try layers of:


Roasted butternut squash.
Blanched spinach.

, Just because you can't enjoy pasta doesn't mean you can't enjoy lasagna. Layer in thin polenta cakes instead, treating the rest of the recipe exactly as normal., This ingenious, low-carb recipe is not layered exactly the same way, but that doesn't make it any less delicious. To make it:


Cut the squash in half and remove the seeds.
Cook the squash in a baking dish, cut-side down, for 45-60 minutes (450℉) or until easily pierced with a fork. Pour roughly an inch of water into the pan to prevent them from drying out.
Fill each squash half with layers, starting with 1-2 dollops of ricotta, then sauce and mozzarella. Repeat until full.
Cook the mini lasagnas for 20 minutes in the oven (450℉), until the cheese is melted on top of the squash.

, You can use grilled or shredded chicken instead of beef, if you'd like, though it is not necessary. The principles are all the same as Italian lasagna, but you can get a totally different dish with some simple swaps:

Tomato Sauce → Taco Sauce
Riccotta/Mozzarella → Queso Fresco/Cheddar
Noodles → Corn Tortillas
Italian seasoning → Ground Cumin, cayenne, red pepper, onion powder
Add 1 can of black beans and 1 can of yellow corn to sauce mixture.

, Add some crushed garlic cloves if you wish to.

, Adjust the heat as necessary to render fat out of the bacon, but avoid cooking the bacon to the crispy stage––you really want it soft and just slightly browned.


Timing is critical––you should be able to have the bacon cooked in the 10 minutes it takes to cook the pasta––you may need to lower the heat to keep the bacon hot. Do not allow the pasta and pot/ pan to go cold waiting for the bacon to cook, as this will leave the egg uncooked.

, Shake quickly to remove excess water. Do not rinse the pasta and return it to the hot pot you originally used to boil it in.

,, The eggs will cook from the heat of the bacon fat and hot pasta (and the hot pot).

, The cheese will melt from the heat of the bacon and pot.


If desired, you may add a splash of cream to improve the richness of the dish.

, Stir in, until the pasta mixture is speckled with pepper. You could use around a tablespoon of coarsely ground pepper although as the cook, you could add more or less to your personal taste.

Enjoy.",How to Make Cultured Butter," There are a lot of different tools you can use to make cultured butter.Be sure to have the following ready:


1 measuring cup
1 large glass jar with a lid. A 64 ounce Mason jar works well.
1 clean kitchen cloth
1 rubber band
1 spoon
1 spatula
1 whisk or 1 food processor
Several large clean bowls (You can use 1 bowl, but you'll have to wash it frequently.)
1 strainer,
1 cheesecloth
1 role of wax paper;
, Since culturing butter takes a while, you’ll want to find a place where you can leave your materials out. You’ll also want to have ready access to a sink, especially if you don’t have several clean bowls to use. Make sure your space is clean. The culturing process is delicate. You don't want any dust or dirt to make it into your butter.

, At several points in the process, you’ll need to remove ingredients from or temporarily store your butter in a refrigerator. Have one nearby to make it easier on yourself.

, Making cultured butter can be done cleanly, but it is possible that you might splash some buttermilk or get some butter on your clothes.

, The most common recipe for cultured butter requires that you combine 4 cups of heavy cream with 1/3 cup of high quality, whole-milk yogurt, buttermilk, or crème fraîche.


For the best results, use yogurt without any preservatives or gums in it.
The yogurt, buttermilk, and crème fraîche is what has live cultures in it. This is what allows the culture process to take place.

, After you’ve put all the ingredients into your jar, replace the lid and shake. Alternatively, you could use your spoon to mix the ingredients.

, In order for the culture process to happen more efficiently, it will need air. You don’t want dirt or dust to get into the mix. That is why you should use a dish towel. The towel will allow air in while keeping unwanted dust particles out. Secure a rubber band around the towel over the opening of the jar so the towel won't slip off accidentally.

, Cultured cream requires several hours to actually “culture.” The dairy product goes through the fermentation process. This gives the substance its tangy taste. This process also restores many of the good bacteria often found in dairy that is lost during the pasteurization process. It also helps to break down milk proteins like casein that are hard for some people to digest.

, The cream should be 3-4 times thicker than the original consistency. For better results, place the original lid back on the container and place in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. The colder temperature will stop the culturing process, will help seal in the flavor, and will make it easier to churn., If you choose to use a food processor, that is fine. If you do so, make sure that you cover the top of the bowl. Once the food processor or electric mixer begins working its magic, it is possible that the cream will spray out of the bowl. Otherwise, get your whisk ready., With an electric mixer, this should only take 5 minutes or so. If doing it by hand, it could take up to 10 minutes to get the cream nice and thick. It should look a lot like whipped cream at the beginning. As you whisk, it will start to become firmer and more yellow..

, Place a large bowl on the table. Put a strainer over it with a piece of cheesecloth inside the strainer. Now pour your mixture onto the cheesecloth. The liquid will drain through the cheesecloth and the strainer and end up in the bowl.Just like you would do with spaghetti, shift the strainer back and forth. Take a spoon and stir the left over butter, pushing more and more liquid out of it.Pick up the cheesecloth filled with butter, and squeeze it to remove more liquid. It should look like a buttery sponge at this point.

, Place the butter in a clean bowl. Pour 1/3 cup ice water over the butter. The cold water will force the butter to contract, further removing any remaining buttermilk. Then pour out the milky liquid. Do this several times until you have a nearly perfect lump of dry butter.

, Many people like salted butter. If you do, add about 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt to the butter and then mix thoroughly. This should be enough salt. Any more and you will overpower the natural taste of the butter.For flavor, you can also add several other ingredients at this stage. Consider adding a couple of squirts of lemon, a dash of chili powder, or some fresh basil. Think about other flavors you like and consider adding them to your cultured butter. Remember that a little goes a long way. You don't want to overpower the flavor of your cultured butter.

, Plop it down on a piece of wax paper. With your spatula and a little flour (to help reduce the stickiness of the butter), shape it into a cylinder. Really, you can shape it however you’d like. Store bought butter normally comes in this shape, because it is easier to cut off small slices for buttering bread or cooking with., The colder temperatures in the refrigerator will help solidify the butter further. Keeping it in the refrigerator will also help it stay fresh longer.

, Use it as a garnish on your dishes. Add to breads, rices, salads, and other foods that could use a little butter. Never eat by itself.

, Even though you will be serving the soup clear, it still needs to have some flavor to it. Because you will be straining everything out of the soup later on, it is best to leave the vegetables whole or in large chunks. If you have not yet done so, get out your vegetables, and prepare them in the following ways:


Peel 4 large (or 6 small) beets, then cut them in half.
Cut the stem off of 1 medium-sized carrot, then peel the carrot. If the carrot is too long for the pot, cut it in half.
Cut the stem off of 1 medium-sized parsnip, then peel it.
Peel 1 large onion, then cut it in half.
Rinse 1 leek, then trim off the leaves. Cut it in half lengthwise.
Peel a celery root, then cut it into fourths. Save one of the pieces for your soup, and save the rest for another recipe.
Peel 8 garlic cloves. Do not crush or mince them.

, Place the prepared beets, meaty bones, carrots, parsnip, onion, leek, celery root, mushrooms, garlic, bay leaf and marjoram into the pot. There should be enough water in the pot to cover all of the ingredients. If there is not enough room in the pot for more water, take out some of the ingredients.


Start with 8 garlic cloves. You can always add more, if needed.
For a spicier soup, add some peppercorns.
Don't add the salt, pepper, lemon juice, or sour cream/yogurt just yet.

, You are ready for the next step when the meat falls off the bones and the vegetables turn soft.

, Place a colander or strainer over a new pot, then pour the borscht through it. Press the ingredients against the mesh with the back of a spoon or rubber spatula to strain out any excess liquid.


At this point, you can discard the meat and vegetables or save them for another recipe.
Don't worry if some of the dried marjoram gets into the strained soup.

, If it is too watery and flavorless, let it boil over medium heat for 30 minutes, or until the flavor intensifies. If it is too flavorful, add more water.

, The ideal taste should be sour and somewhat garlicky, with beet-y sweet undertones. At this point, you can add in more seasonings, such as salt, pepper, lemon juice, or dried marjoram. You can also add a few more garlic gloves, then simmer the soup for another 1 to 2 minutes. At this point, do not let the soup boil, or it will discolor.


Peel the garlic cloves first, then press them with the flat side of a knife before adding them in. Be sure to scoop them out before serving.

Process rapidly to form a paste.,

Add the flour.,
Cook for 20 to 30 minutes.,
Add the spices.,
Store in an airtight container.",How to Make Curry Paste," When these ingredients are among those called for in the recipe, you should peel off the outer skin, roughly chop the ingredient into chunky pieces, and toast those pieces on the stove.


To peel the ingredients:

Peel ginger by gently scraping the skin off with a spoon.
Peel garlic by striking the clove with the flat side of your knife. The skin should completely separate from the clove. Remove it with your fingers and use the smashed garlic as is.
Peel onions and shallots but cutting off both ends and peel the skins away with your fingers.


Toast these aromatics by heating a skillet to medium heat and tossing them in. Stir with a spatula or heat-resistant mixing spoon for 1 to 2 minutes, or until a strong aroma is produced.
Strictly speaking, you do not need to toast aromatics before using them. Peeling them is necessary, but the toasting process is only optional. Cooking them briefly in this matter is still recommended because it enhances both the scent and taste of the final curry paste.;
, If the recipe calls for actual whole chiles, you should remove any stems, ribs, and seeds. Use a sharp yet small knife to gut the chiles.


After handling chiles, wash your hands well with soap and water. If you do not wash your hands, you may inadvertently rub your eyes and transfer the juices to the sensitive tissue there and causing a severe burning sensation.

, Fresh chiles can be used as they are, but if your recipe calls for dried chiles, you should consider soaking them in warm water first to infuse them with some of their lost moisture.


Tear or cut the chiles into small pieces and place them in a bowl. Fill the bowl with warm water, and let the chiles soak for 10 minutes. Drain the water before adding the chiles to the rest of your spices and ingredients.
If you do not soak the chiles, your curry paste may lack the sort of moisture it needs to form a smooth paste.

, Doing so is only optional, but as with the aromatic ingredients, whole spices are enhanced in both scent and flavor once you use heat to draw out the essence of that spice.


Heat a skillet on medium to high heat on the stove. Add the spices you intend to toast and keep them in the hot skillet for a few minutes, stirring almost constantly. When ready, they should take on a golden brown tint and have a notably stronger smell.
Whole spices you might consider toasting include any nuts, seeds, and berries.

, Some recipes might call for fresh spices and herbs, while others will list the dried versions. Curry paste made fresh fresh spices usually has a stronger aroma and more complex taste, but versions made with dried spices are usually just as acceptable to the common tongue. The choice is mainly a matter of preference—save the time by using dried spices or enhance the flavor profile by using fresh spices.


If you need to convert fresh spices to dried spices, or vice versa, check on the conversion ratio for the specific spice before proceeding.

For all herbs, use 1/3 the amount of dried herbs for every amount of fresh herb listed. For instance, 3 tsp (15 ml) of fresh parsley would equal 1 tsp (5 ml) dried parsley.
For cinnamon, 3 inches (7.6 cm) of a stick equals 1 tsp (5 ml) ground cinnamon.
For cloves, 3 whole cloves equal 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground.
For garlic, 1 clove equals 1/8 tsp (0.6 ml) ground.
Note that 1 cardamom pod with 18 to 20 seeds equals 1 tsp (5 ml) ground.
Use equal parts ground coriander when substituting for fresh.
For cumin seeds, substitute 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) ground for 1 tsp (5 ml) fresh.
With turmeric, note that 1 oz (30 g) of fresh root equals 4 Tbsp (60 ml) powdered turmeric.
If using fresh mustard seeds, note that 1 oz (30 g) of fresh seeds produces 2-1/2 Tbsp (37.5 ml) ground mustard powder.



, Once you have prepared any individual ingredients for your curry paste, combine the spices and other dry ingredients in a food processor and blend rapidly until they form a fine, evenly combined powder.


This step is not necessary if you are already using previously ground, powdered spices, but you should still toss the spices together gently to distribute them evenly in the mix.
If you want more control over the process or do not have a food processor, you could use a mortar and pestle to grind the spices into powder instead. Depending on the size of your mortar and pestle, though, you might need to work in batches., Place any moist ingredients, fresh roots, or fresh aromatic vegetables in the food processor along with your ground spices. Pulse gently for a few seconds to break up any larger pieces of food, including larger pieces of chile, onion, shallots, garlic, or ginger.If you do not have a food processor, you could still make the paste using a mortar and pestle, but you might find it easier to use a blender, instead. If using a blender, you may need to add a bit more moisture to the paste to help it puree into a paste. Monitor it carefully during the blending process to determine if this is necessary., Once the spices and other ingredients are loosely combined, process or blend them at a high speed for a few minutes. Continue processing them until a thick paste forms.


If some of the paste or the separate ingredients stick to the sides of the food processor bowl, pause the process and scrape the sides down with a spatula. Doing so will help you maintain the proper ratio of spices.

, You can store curry paste for up to 1 month in the refrigerator or up to 1 year in the freezer.If refrigerating the paste, place it in a non-reactive, airtight glass or plastic container before sticking it in the refrigerator.
If freezing the paste, transfer equal amounts into a clean ice cube tray and freeze until solid. Transfer the cubes of paste to an airtight, resealable plastic freezer bag. Label the bag with the contents and current date before freezing for long-term storage.

, Heat slowly until completely melted.


It is important that you melt the butter slowly since butter that overheats can flash boil. When that happens, the fat breaks down at an uneven pace and the hot butter could splatter and cause burns.
To help the butter melt evenly, consider stirring it in the pan as it heats.

, Sprinkle the flour into the melted butter. Use a spatula to stir the flour into the butter as thoroughly as possible.


Once combined, the flour and butter should swell up.
Stir the roux continually at this point. It will not take much time for the roux to burn if you stop mixing it.

, Cook the roux for a full 20 to 30 minutes, stirring at a nearly constant pace, until the color warms to a light brown.


You need to cook the roux thoroughly in order to remove the strong taste of uncooked flour. Undercooked roux can still retain that taste, and as a result, your curry roux could have a hint of bitterness.

, Add whatever spices called for in the recipe at this point, stirring them until well combined. Cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds before removing the curry roux from the heat.


In the case of the recipe provided here, you would add curry powder, garam masala, and cayenne pepper.

, The curry roux can be used immediately, but if you do not plan on doing so, let it cool before transferring it to an airtight container. Store it in the refrigerator for up to 1 month or in the freezer for up to 4 months.

,, THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP! Do not rush the processing of the garlic with the salt. Repeat the processing and scraping to center until the garlic is very fine - five to ten cycles.

, Take the lemon juice in one hand and the oil in the other, positioned to pour in to the the food processor bowl.

, The stream should resemble a thin thread - the key is to pour slowly. Initially, it will look like garlic and oil soup, but, when enough oil is added, the garlic, salt and oil will react and combine into a white emulsion. You'll hear a change in the food processor motor's pitch as well as see the change in the bowl.

, You should run out of juice before you've finished pouring the oil - that's OK!

, If this happens, stop the processor and ""cut"" the emulsion with your scraper, ensuring you are creating a path for the oils to drain down toward the blade. Pulse the food processor to incorporate this oil into the toum.

, This prevents any condensation from the sauce as it cools from falling back into it - added moisture can cause the emulsion to break, leaving you with a lemon-garlic oil (which is still usable for other purposes, I might add. Just a bit disappointing!).

, Toum keeps a very long time - a month or more - before it begins to separate.

Combine evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream in a wide pot.Instead of simmering and reducing milk for an extended period of time, this recipe eliminates that step by using milk that has already gone through this process.,
Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for five minutes.Once the milk mixture begins to boil, reduce your stove to medium or low heat and allow it to simmer.,
Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 1/2 teaspoon cardamom.",How to Make Kulfi (Indian Milk Ice Cream)1," Evaporated and condensed milk are quite sticky, so you'll need to stir vigorously to ensure they are completely mixed together.


The sweetened condensed milk eliminates the need to add sugar to the recipe; however, it also makes it difficult for you to control the sweetness.;
, Stir frequently for about five minutes. This will help ensure your ingredients are fully combined and also prevent the milk from burning.


Make sure you scrape the sides and bottom of the pot. This is where milk may ""catch"" and burn., If you want to use additional flavoring, such as nuts, saffron, or fruit, you can add that now, as well.

Mix in 1/4 cup sugar, cardamom and other flavoring, and stir.",How to Make Kulfi (Indian Milk Ice Cream)2," Using reduced fat milk will cause ice crystals to form when you freeze your kulfi and won't give you the same rich, creamy taste as whole milk.A wide pot will give the milk more surface area and may speed up the process.A wok, saucepan, or frying pan may all be used to heat the milk.

, Unlike a soup or sauce, the milk cannot be left to simmer on its own. You must stir the milk frequently, otherwise it will catch on the sides or bottom of the pot and burn. Reducing the milk to 3/4 its original volume will take about 45 minutes.Reducing the milk in this way will give it an incredible nutty, caramelized flavor that is missing from the ""instant"" version of kulfi.
The resulting condensed milk should come to roughly 2 cups.
Reducing by 3/4 is the minimum, but to get the best flavor, you may want to reduce the milk to 2/3 or even 1/3 its original volume. This gives you the most authentic, flavorful kulfi, but also requires you to stir regularly for 4 hours or more.

, Adding the sugar will temporarily thin out your mixture. Continue stirring and heating until it thickens up again, about five to seven minutes.


If you want to add other flavors, such as ground pistachio, rosewater, saffron, or mango puree, mix that in as well.
The more sugar you use, the softer the kulfi."
"
Allow the mixture to cool.,
Pour the chilled mixture into your moulds.,
Cover the molds and freeze for at least six hours.,
Free the kulfi from the molds with a little warm water.",How to Make Kulfi (Indian Milk Ice Cream)3," You can leave it out at room temperature or place it in the refrigerator for two hours. This will help prevent ice crystals from forming in your kulfi, which can ruin the texture.


Some recipes suggest chilling the kulfi for at least 12 hours before freezing.

, There are traditional kulfi molds, but they may be difficult to find (try searching online). If you can't find them, try substituting with disposable souffle cups or even popsicle molds.Don't fill them to the top--remember that liquid expands when it is frozen.


Greasing your kulfi molds may help you release the ice cream when it's time to serve.
If you want garnish on your kulfi, like bits of pistachio stuck to the outside, sprinkle a little into the mold before pouring in the mixture.
Make sure you get a stand if you are using a kulfi mold, otherwise it will be difficult to keep them upright in the freezer.

, If you have a deep freezer, store the kulfi in there. If you want your kulfi on a stick, insert popsicle sticks when the ice cream is partially frozen.

, You can dip the molds in a bowl of warm water or run them under the sink. This should loosen the kulfi enough for you to remove it from the mold. If you still can't get it out, try running a knife around the edges of the mold.Transfer the kulfi onto a dessert plate. Serve whole or sliced into pieces.
Garnish your kulfi with a sprinkling of pistachio or rosewater, or just enjoy it plain!

Serve and enjoy!",How to Make Kheer1," Kheer is just one name for a rice pudding-like dessert that is often made in southeast Asian countries like India, Nepal and Pakistan for special occasions.Kheer is a year-round favorite that can be served topped with any number of things from chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds to spices such as cardamom and saffron.


There is no one standard recipe for kheer. Each family and geographic region makes kheer using some variation of the recipe.Kheer is also known by different names including khir, payasam, payasa or kheeri.;
, You’ll need to gather the ingredients for kheer before you start cooking it. The recipe is fairly simple, but you may need to go to a specialty food store for ingredients if your local supermarket doesn’t carry them.


For kheer that serves four people you’ll need the following ingredients: 1 cup of slightly overcooked rice, 2 cups of whole milk, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon raisins, 1 tablespoon chopped pistachios, 1 tablespoon chopped almonds, 1/8 teaspoon powdered cardamom, and a pinch of saffron.You can use any type of rice, such as long grained or basmati, for this recipe. It’s probably best to not use flavored rice like jasmine or coconut.
If you have leftover rice from another dish, you can use it to make kheer.If you are making the rice just for kheer, it’s best to overcook it a little bit to mimic the texture of leftover rice., Before you start cooking kheer, heat the pan and prepare the saffron and raisins so that they’re ready to use as you cook. It’s important to do this before you begin cooking so that your kheer doesn’t burn while you mix the ingredients.


Put the raisins in a little bit of water to puff them up.Use any small or medium heavy bottomed pan that you have to cook the kheer.Heat the pan over a medium gas flame or electric stove setting.While the pan is heating up, grind the saffron and a pinch of sugar with a mortar and pestle. Set it to the side., Once you’ve preheated the pan and done the prep work, you’re ready to cook your kheer. Make sure to not leave the pan at this stage so that your kheer doesn’t burn.


Add the cup of slightly overcooked rice and 2 cups of whole milk to your heated pan. Lightly stir this mixture.If you like a smoother texture, mash the rice slightly before adding it to the milk.Add your mixture of saffron and sugar to the milk and rice in the pan., You’ll need to make sure that you don’t leave the mixture in the pan at this point to keep it from burning. Keep stirring the pan until the mixture reaches a consistency that you wish.You should let the mixture thicken over the heat, but you can decide how thick it gets. Some people like their kheer thinner like a creamy soup while others like their kheer thick like oatmeal.

, Once your kheer has reached the desired consistency, add the 3 tablespoons sugar and the raisins and mixed nuts. Fold these ingredients into the mixture.


Add the sugar before the raisins and mixed nuts. You might want to taste the kheer at this point to see if it needs more sugar.
Drain the raisins and add them to the mixture along with the 1 tablespoon chopped pistachios and 1 tablespoon chopped almonds.Remove the pan from the heat and add the 1/8 teaspoon powdered cardamom.

, The time has come for you to enjoy your kheer! You can serve the dish either hot or cold, depending on your taste and the time of year.

There is no one standard recipe for kheer. Each family and geographic region makes kheer using some variation of the recipe.Vermicelli kheer is also known as semiya payasam., You’ll need to gather the ingredients for your vermicelli kheer before you start cooking it. The recipe is fairly simple, but you may need to go to a specialty Indian food store for ingredients if your local supermarket doesn’t carry them.


For vermicelli kheer that serves four people you need the following ingredients: ½ cup roasted vermicelli; 2 ½ cups warmed whole milk; ½ cup sweetened, condensed milk; 2-3 tablespoons mixed, dried fruits and nuts; ½ teaspoon cardamom powder; 1 tablespoon ghee; a pinch of saffron.If you live near an Indian food store, you can buy roasted vermicelli so that you don’t need to roast it separately.The amount of milk you use can increase or decrease depending on how creamy you want your kheer.Use any dried fruits and nuts you like such as raisins, dried cherries, cashews, almonds, or pistachios.Ghee is a type of Indian butter. If you cannot find it, you can use clarified butter.

, Before you can start cooking your vermicelli kheer, you’ll need to quickly roast the dried fruits and nuts. If you don’t live near an Indian food store or simply just prefer to do the work yourself, you’ll also need to roast your vermicelli.


Use any small or medium heavy bottomed pan that you have to roast the nuts and dried fruits and vermicelli.Heat the pan over a medium gas flame or electric stove setting and add the ghee.When the ghee has melted in the heated pan, add the nuts and brown slightly.

To the roasted vermicelli in the pan, add the milk and a few of the nuts.Put a lid on the top of the pan for about 6-8 minutes to cook the vermicelli., Once the vermicelli has cooked, remove the pan lid and add the ½ cup sweetened, condensed milk; ¼ teaspoon powdered cardamom; and pinch of saffron.Taste the mixture and add more condensed milk if you want the kheer to be sweeter.After you’ve added the condensed milk, cardamom, and saffron, allow the mixture to cook for a few more minutes and thicken to a desired consistency.Let the mixture thicken over the heat and decide how thick it gets. Some people like their kheer thinner like a creamy soup while others like their kheer thick like oatmeal.

, If you like, you can garnish with different fruits and nuts than are in the kheer for more complex flavors.

, The time has come for you to enjoy your vermicelli kheer! You can serve the dish either hot or cold, depending on your taste and the time of year.


You can also garnish your vermicelli kheer with fruits like strawberries, bananas or apples for extra flavor and visual effect.

Remove the jalebi from the syrup and serve.",How to Make Jalebi," The traditional leavening agent is plain yogurt, called ""dahi"" or ""curd"" in Indian recipes. You may substitute plain Greek yogurt or buttermilk for this ingredient, as long as it has live active cultures.


1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons gram, corn, or rice flour (This adds a bit of flavor and texture; you can just use more all-purpose flour if that's all you have on hand.)
3/4 cup plain yogurt, or 1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons melted ghee, or clarified butter (you may substitute vegetable or olive oil)1/4 tsp saffron for color (you may substitute a pinch of turmeric, or a few drops of yellow food coloring)
Water, as needed;
, Whisk together the dry ingredients in a medium, non-reactive (preferably glass or ceramic) bowl. Then add the yogurt or buttermilk and melted ghee, and stir well to form a thick batter. Finally, add the saffron or food coloring to achieve a golden yellow color.

, Your batter should resemble a thick pancake batter. Depending on the humidity and the moisture content of the yogurt or buttermilk you are using, you may need to add water to obtain this consistency.


If the batter is too thick, add water a bit at a time and stir well between additions.
If the batter is too thin, stir in additional flour one tablespoon at a time.

, Cover the bowl and leave the batter to ferment in a warm place for 12 hours or overnight. (In warm climates, just a few hours will suffice). The batter will rise and become noticeably fluffier than it was the night before. It is now ready to use.

, This method uses active dry yeast, available in the baking section of most grocery, and comes together in a matter of minutes.1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 tablespoon plus 2/3 cup water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons gram, corn, or rice flour (This adds a bit of flavor and texture; you can just use more all-purpose flour if that's all you have on hand.)
2 tablespoons ghee, or clarified butter (you may substitute vegetable or olive oil)1/4 tsp saffron threads for color (You may substitute a pinch of turmeric, or a few drops of yellow food coloring.)

, First, dissolve the yeast in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lukewarm water, and let it sit for 10 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours to combine. Then add the yeast, melted ghee (or butter or oil), saffron or food coloring, and 2/3 cup water. Stir until there are no more lumps and a thick batter is formed.








, It should resemble a thick, yellow pancake batter. If it is too thick, it will not come out of the dispenser correctly, and if it is too thin, it will be difficult to shape.









If the batter is too thin, stir in additional flour one tablespoon at a time to achieve the desired consistency.
If the batter is too thick, add a small amount of additional water, and stir well, adding more if necessary.

, The yeast will work much more quickly to lighten the batter, and the batter can be used right away. However, your jalebi will be lighter if you let the yeast work for a while. Cover the batter and set it aside while you prepare the syrup for the jalebi, and heat the oil for frying.

, This recipe is for a saffron simple syrup. If you do not have saffron available, use a few drops of yellow food coloring to achieve the proper color. It is also common to add other flavorings to this syrup, including lemon, lime, cardamom, and rose water. Try the basic version first, and then experiment with your own additions.









1 cup water
1 cup granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, or a few drops of yellow food coloring

, Add sugar and water to a pan and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down until it is just barely bubbling. Cook the syrup until it reaches the single thread stage, or approximately 220°-222°F (104°-105°C). Watch the syrup carefully to make sure it doesn't burn. This should take around 10-15 minutes on medium-low heat.








, Sugar syrups used in Indian cooking are defined by their thread consistency. To test the syrup without a thermometer, dip a spoon or spatula into the syrup and lift it out. Wait a moment and carefully pick up a drop of syrup on your finger. Then touch your finger to your thumb and pull them apart slowly to see how many threads of syrup form.For this recipe, you want a single thread syrup.









If no thread forms, or it breaks quickly, your syrup is not yet cooked enough.
If multiple threads or a sheet forms, you have reduced the syrup too much, and need to add some additional water or begin again.

, Do this as soon as it reaches the desired consistency. Then quickly stir in your saffron or food coloring. Keep the syrup near at hand, as you will soon be soaking your hot jalebi in it.

, Fill a heavy-bottomed pot, such as a dutch oven, kadhai, or wok, with enough ghee or oil for deep-frying, between one and two inches. Heat the oil to between 360°-375° F (182°-190°C).To test the oil temperature without a thermometer, place the end of a wooden spoon into the oil. If bubbles start to form around the spoon and float to the top, your oil is ready to go., Give the batter a quick stir with a spatula, but do not over-mix.Then pour the batter into a clean squeeze bottle or condiment dispenser.









Plastic squeeze bottles can be purchased at many grocery stores, as can specialized batter dispensers. You can also recycle an empty ketchup bottle, just be sure to wash it thoroughly before use.
If you do not have a squeeze bottle available, you can pour the batter into a food-grade plastic bag, and cut a small hole in one corner of it when you are ready to dispense the batter.

, Using your dispenser, squeeze or pour the batter into the hot oil in coils or spirals that are about 2"" wide. Only make 3-4 jalebi at a time to avoid crowding the pan.









Forming the jalebi is the tricky part, and does take a bit of practice, but once you get the motion down it will be as easy as, well, jalebi!

, The batter will first sink to the bottom, but will quickly pop back up and float to the top. After a minute or two, flip the jalebi over so they cook on both sides. Then remove them from the oil and drain for a moment on paper towels.

, Place the jalebi into the syrup while they are still hot, and let them soak for at least a minute, some people prefer up to 4-5 minutes. Turn the jalebi over once so both sides have a chance to soak. The jalebi should become thoroughly saturated with sugar syrup.


Start your next batch of jalebi cooking while the first is soaking the syrup.

, If you wish to serve the jalebi warm, place the jalebi on a platter, or in bowls with a bit of syrup. Otherwise, remove them from the syrup and let then dry on a rack for several hours until the syrup forms a crust.

Then, you can whisk in the tahini, olive oil, yogurt, and ¾ teaspoon of salt until the mixture is smooth. If the mixture feels too thick to pour, then you can add another 1 or 2 tablespoons (14.8 or 29.6 ml) of water and mix it in to make it a bit thinner.You can make the sauce while you’re cooking your chicken, lamb, beef, veal, or other meat, if you want to save time.
Additionally, you can make the sauce two days in advance and store it in the fridge until it’s ready to be used.;
, Pickled cabbage is another important ingredient to making a tasty shawarma. All you have to do to make it is to heat a bit of oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add your cabbage and cook it for about 8-10 minutes, until it’s good and tender. You can stir it occasionally as you do this to make sure it’s evenly cooked. Then, remove it from the heat and add the pomegranate molasses, vinegar, and sugar. Once you do that, just season it to taste with a bit more vinegar or sugar, as well as salt and pepper.


You can make the cabbage while you’re cooking the meat, if you’d like to save time. Alternatively, you can make it up to two days in advance and store it in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.

, You can use pita, yufka, marfouk, or even a flour tortilla for a shawarma. If you’re using flatbreads that you bought in the store or have made them ahead of time, then just warm them in a deep skillet over medium heat for a minute or two. You should do this right after you’ve finished preparing the meat so that you can place the meat into a shawarma that is nice and warm.


Note that, after you’ve added your meat, tahini sauce, and cabbage to the shawarma, you can cook it, seam side-down, for about 3 minutes in a skillet to get it nice and brown and to seal the ingredients together.

, Use a medium-sized plastic bowl for mixing together the garlic powder, paprika, nutmeg, cardamon, and cinnamon. Stir the spices for at least 30 seconds so you have fully mixed them together.

, Just place the chicken strips into the spice mixture and toss them until they have been covered with the spice mixture on both sides. Then, drizzle them with a bit of olive oil and toss them again to make sure that they are fully coated in the olive oil and spice mixture.

, Heat your grill and grease a large piece of aluminum foil. Set it on the grill with the greased side up once the grill is heated.

, Turn the chicken over a few times, until cooked through. This should take about 8 minutes on each side, depending on the size of the chicken strips. If your grill is smaller, you may have to grill the chicken in 2 batches.

, You'll need to do this before you can begin to assemble your shawarma.

, You can add lettuce, onion, tahini sauce, pickled cabbage, hummus, or whatever other ingredients you’d like to place in the flatbread. Place the chicken in the bread first, followed by the other toppings, pouring on the tahini sauce last. Wrap the flatbread similarly to a burrito, leaving an inch of space between the ingredients and the top of the bread so they don’t pour out. Once you do that, your chicken shawarma will be ready to eat!, Make sure that you’ve placed your rack in the center of the oven so the lamb gets cooked the right amount., Gently use a paper towel to remove some of the moisture from the lamb before you begin cooking it.

, Heat your oil in a deep 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.

, Place one batch of the lamb chops on the skillet and wait until they are browned on one side, which should take about 2 minutes. Then, flip them over to the other side and continue cooking them until they are evenly cooked on both sides. You may need to add a bit more oil to cook your second batch.


When you’re done with both of the batches, transfer them to a 9 x 13 inch roasting pan and season them with salt and pepper to your liking.
Remember that you don’t have to cook them completely, just get them nice and browned. You’ll be placing them in the oven, so they will continue to cook. If you cook them too much on the skillet, they’ll be dry after being in the oven.

, Bring the wine to a simmer, and scrape the skillet to remove any browned bits on it. When you’ve gotten the wine to simmer, carefully pour it over the lamb chops. You can move the roasting pan back and forth a bit to distribute the wine more evenly.

, Now, sprinkle them with cumin and then add the garlic, carrot, onion and the additional ½ cup of wine. The liquid should reach about halfway up the lamb chops, so if it doesn’t do that, you can add some water to the mix. You can even flip the lamb chops over and move them around a bit to make sure that you get them spiced evenly.Once you’ve seasoned the lamb chops, you can cover the pan with a double-thickness of foil to prepare the lamb chops for cooking.

, After an hour or so, start checking the lamb with a fork. The lamb will be ready when the meat is tender on your fork and falls off easily. Once it does that, you can remove it from the oven.

, Tent the lamb with the aluminum foil loosely, so that you keep it warm but don’t trap the heat. You can use your fingers or a fork and knife to carefully break the lamb into small chunks in order to remove the fat and the bones.

, Once you’ve moved the lamb, you can move the contents in the roasting pan through a mesh sieve to a medium bowl, which should get you about 2 cups of liquid.


Remove the solids and freeze the liquid until the fat in it rises to the surface. This should take about 15 minutes.
Then, skim the fat off the surface and discard it.
Once you do that, move the liquid to a 3-quart saucepan and then boil it over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until about half of it remains.
Then, add the pomegranate molasses, lemon juice, and butter into your braising liquid.

, After that, add the lamb to the liquid and gently toss it together to fully coat it. Season it with salt and pepper, and your lamb is all done!

, Now that you’ve prepared your lamb, you’ll need to add it to your flatbread, toss in the cabbage, and pour your tahini sauce over it to add a delicious flavor to your meat and veggies. Place the lamb in the flatbread about an inch from the edge and roll it up tightly while making sure to pull back on the edge of the flatbread in order to fold it over the filling and tucking it in like a burrito. Place it down on its seam side before cooking it in a skillet for 3 minutes until it’s ready to eat."

Try making a falooda-flavored smoothie if you're on the go.",How to Make Indian Falooda," Milk, sugar, and ice cream should be available at almost any supermarket, but basil seeds, rose syrup, and falooda sev will not usually be. For these, you'll need to visit an Indian or South Asian grocer. You may be able to find them at certain non-Indian specialty grocers' as well. Most of these ingredients are also available for order online if you do not have a place to buy them near you.


Falooda sev is a type of Indian noodle somewhat similar to vermicelli. You can buy dry falooda or make it yourself from scratch. A good falooda sev recipe is available here., In a cup, cover the basil seeds with an inch of water. Stir once, then let them soak for 30 minutes. After soaking, drain them in a fine mesh strainer and set aside.


While you wait for the seeds to soak, feel free to proceed to the next few steps.

, Pour the two ingredients into a medium saucepan and bring to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally. Lower the heat and let simmer for 5-7 minutes. Pour the thickened milk into separate container and let it chill in the fridge.

, Follow the instructions on the packaging for best results. If you made your own falooda sev or your packaging doesn't have instructions, follow these steps:Bring water to a boil in a small pot.
Add falooda sev and cook for about 4-5 minutes.
Drain the falooda in a strainer, rinsing it with cold water to stop the cooking process.
Use a knife or pair of scissors to cut the noodles into small pieces.

, Grab two tall, decorative glasses to serve your beverages in. Add ingredients to each glass in the following order (use half of each ingredient per glass):


Basil seeds
Cooked falooda sev
Rose syrup
Milk — it's OK if basil seeds or falooda sev float to the top at this point.

, If you want, you can mash the ice cream into the drink to dissolve it, but you don't need to. If you leave the ice cream alone, dunk it into the milk at least once to give it some of the rose flavor.

, The falooda is ready to drink at this point. If you wish, you can add a handful of chopped pistachios and rose petals to the top of the drink as a garnish, though this is not needed.


Serve the falooda immediately. It does not keep if allowed to sit or stored in the refrigerator. Enjoy!

, With its smooth, creamy flavor, vanilla ice cream goes especially well with the rose syrup in falooda, but it's not the only choice available. Other sweet, mild ice cream flavors like strawberry, raspberry, and pistachio make for interesting choices as well. Some may even enjoy the taste of chocolate ice cream.


Avoid ice creams with ""sharp"" flavors (like citrus), which can overpower the rose in the drink.;
, Pistachios and rose petals aren't the only ingredients you can use as garnish. Most nuts and dried fruits taste well on top of a delicious falooda drink. For instance, golden raisins and chopped almonds make a good choice. Craisins and dried berries can also work well.

, The nice thing about falooda is that all you need to do to put a new spin on it is drop a slice or two of your favorite fruit into the drink before you add the ice cream. Mango, strawberries, and other sweet fruits make the best choices. Tart fruits like citrus don't always pair well with the creaminess of the other ingredients, however.

, If you love falooda but don't have time to layer the ingredients, simply toss them in the blender and pulse a few times to get a smoothie. Pour the smoothie into a bottle and you now have a portable falooda drink. You can even add ice cubes to the blender to give the smoothie a slushier texture without affecting the taste.


The smoothie may separate somewhat if you keep it in the refrigerator, but it will not be unsafe to drink.

, Set the syrup aside -- you'll need it later when you have to soak the dough balls in it. Alternately, you can keep it warm over very low heat.

, Stir these ingredients well in a bowl to fully combine them. You should melt the butter a bit first to make it easier to combine. These ingredients will add a unique texture to this tasty dessert.

, Continue to stir the ingredients until you create a nice thick and creamy substance. If the dough is still not creamy enough, keep adding a bit more milk until the dough is smooth and creamy.

, This doesn't have to be exact, and not every portion has to be identical. Just try to pinch out roughly twenty portions of dough, which you will then roll into balls. Try to make each ball smaller than a small lime. They will become larger when you deep fry them, and you don't want them to be too big.

, Just take each portion and roll it into a ball using one hand to roll it in your other palm, or rolling it on an even surface like a cutting board. Try to make the balls as smooth as possible because cracks will make the Jamuns disintegrate when they're soaked in syrup. To make them as smooth as possible, you can grease your palms with oil or ghee while you make the balls. When you've finished, place them on a plate and get ready to fry them.

, When it's hot, reduce the heat to low to medium. You can use regular vegetable oil, or create a 50/50 combination using vegetable oil and ghee. You'll need to keep the heat on low to medium to keep the oil from sputtering too much.

, Be careful when you're working with hot oil; stand back from the pan to steer clear of sputtering oil. You can use a spatula or a slotted spoon to lower each ball into the oil.

, This is a part of the process -- do not try to move them. They will rise to the surface on their own.

, Keep turning them so they are evenly cooked on all sides. You may not want to cook more than a handful of them at a time; otherwise, they may get crowded, bringing down the temperature of the oil and getting soggy. Make sure that all sides have browned evenly and remove each dough ball from the oil. A slotted spoon is best for this, because it helps get rid of the excess oil.

, This will help absorb the excess oil. You can even gently pat the dough balls with a paper towel.

, You can either heat it again, or just have had it heated on low during the whole cooking process.

, You can use any deep dish, bowl, or tray for this process.

, Make sure that the dough balls are completely absorbed in the syrup. Some people even like to let them soak in the syrup overnight to let them fully absorb the syrup.

, Once the Gulab Jamun have soaked in the syrup for a long enough time, they are ready to eat. You can add a garnish of slivers of pistachios before you serve them. You can enjoy them on their own or with some vanilla ice cream or yogurt. They are best served warm, though they can be tasty when they're cold, too. If you have any left over, you can let them sit in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, for up to a week.

Serve.",How to Make Dil Pasand," Place the two ingredients in a medium saucepan and set it on the stove over medium heat. Cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture becomes smooth and thick.Cook the mixture for at least 5 minutes. Under-cooking it can result in lumps, which will negatively affect the quality of your final dough.
Continuous whisking is key here. If you do not whisk the mixture well enough, it will never become smooth and appropriately thick. Failing to whisk the mixture thoroughly can also cause the flour to begin burning on the sides and bottom of the hot pan.;
, Remove the saucepan from the heat. Allow the flour mixture to cool until it drops to a temperature just slightly warmer than room temperature.


Depending on how hot the mixture became while you cooked it, you may need to wait as long as 30 to 60 minutes before it becomes sufficiently cool.
If the mixture is too hot when you add the other ingredients, you may accidentally kill the yeast, which would mean that the dough would no longer be able to rise.

, Combine the liquid flour mixture with the remaining 4 cups (500 g) of flour, along with the butter, yeast, salt, sugar, and milk. Mix well until evenly combined.


Use your hands or a sturdy mixing spoon to combine these ingredients.
Continue mixing the contents of the saucepan until you can no longer identify any separate ingredient in the mix.

, Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead until it becomes smooth and elastic in consistency.


You may need to lightly flour your hands, as well, to prevent the dough from sticking to your skin.
Kneading the dough can take as many as 5 to 10 minutes. Test the smooth dough by attempting to stretch out a portion of it. You should feel some resistance as you pull, but the dough should still stretch well.

, Drizzle the oil over the top of the dough. Knead it into the dough and continue kneading for another 4 to 5 minutes.


The finished dough will have a glossier appearance than it did before you added the oil, but it should not feel notably oily when you touch it.

, Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled in volume.


You can encourage the process further by draping a damp dish towel over the plastic wrap. The added humidity can cause the dough to rise quicker.

, Spread the shredded coconut over the bottom of a large skillet. Heat the coconut on the stove over a medium setting for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently.You only need to fry the coconut long enough to cook out most of the moisture. A few strands may also begin to lightly brown around the edges, but do not allow any of the coconut to turn a deep brown. Burnt coconut will ruin both the taste and texture of the filling.

, Spread the sugar evenly over the coconut and toss well to combine. Continue cooking the contents of the skillet for another 3 to 4 minutes.


The sugar must be permitted to melt and mix with the coconut during this step.
Watch the filling mixture carefully once you add the sugar, though. If you overcook the sugar, the filling can become too hard

, Sprinkle the cardamom powder and ground nutmeg over the coconut. Add the cashews and tutti frutti to the pan, as well. Stir to combine and continue heating for another 2 minutes.


You may use a mix of assorted nuts and dried fruits instead of cashews if you would prefer. A mix of chopped almonds and raisins can work very well in this recipe.
Tutti frutti is a chewy confection made with candied fruits. If you are unable to find it, you can use a blend of candied fruits, instead. Blends that include candied papaya are best. Cubes of barfi, another type of chewy fruity confection, can be used instead of tutti frutti, as well.

, Remove the skillet from the heat and set it aside. Allow the filling mixture to cool slightly.


The mixture does not need to drop to room temperature, but it should be cool enough to handle with your hands. If it is too warm, it could affect the consistency of the dough prematurely once you fill the buns.

, After the dough has finished rising, separate it into 16 equally portioned balls.


The easiest way to do this would be to start by dividing the dough into halves, then dividing each half into halves again, giving you four equal portions of dough. From there, divide each portion into four evenly sized balls.

, Use a lightly floured rolling pin to flatten each ball of dough until it is approximately 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick and circular in shape.


The counter should be lightly floured during this step, as well.

, Spoon a generous helping of filling into 8 of the 16 dough circles.


Leave roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space around the edges of each circle.

, Place one plain circle of dough over each covered circle of dough, sandwiching the filling in between both halves. Press the two halves together and smooth away the seam.


Create a tighter seal between the two halves by wetting your finger with a little water and tracing it over the edge of the filled half before you position the empty half on top. The extra moisture can help the two halves stick together more securely.
Lightly squeeze and roll the filled ball in your hands after sealing the seam. Each bun should be fairly circular, not semi-circular.

, Place the filled buns on a lightly greased baking sheet. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for another 30 minutes, or until the buns have doubled in size.


Instead of a greased baking sheet, one covered in nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper would work equally well.

, Do this while the buns are rising so that the oven will be ready as soon as they are.

, After the buns have finished rising, remove the plastic wrap and brush the tops and sides of each bun with egg white.


The egg white will help the buns brown in the oven.
Leave the buns on the baking sheet. There is no need to transfer them to a different baking dish.

, Place the buns in the oven and let them cook for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the tops start turning a golden brown color.

, Turn off the oven, but keep the buns inside for another 10 minutes.This step allows the bread to finish baking at a gentler temperature, thereby reducing the risk of burnt bottoms or edges.

, The dil pasand is now finished. You can enjoy this treat while it is still warm or wait for it to cool to room temperature.

Melt the ghee.,
Roast the besan over medium-low heat.,
Add cardamom and milk.,
Let it cool in a mixing bowl.,
Mix in powdered sugar.,
Shape into balls.,
Mix in golden raisins.,
Decorate with nuts.,
Coat in almond meal.,
Use boora instead of sugar.",How to Make Besan Ladoo," Warm the ghee in a pan to melt it. Pour it into the besan, stirring constantly.









Start with ½ cup (110g) ghee. If there is still dry besan after the next step, or if you like extra-shiny, soft ladoos, add more one spoonful at a time.Ghee is clarified butter that's been toasted for a nutty, caramelized flavor. You can substitute plain unsalted butter, but it will have much less flavor.;
, Stir constantly for about 10–12 minutes, watching the besan brown evenly. This is the most important step. Too little cooking will leave an unpleasant raw taste, while too much can burn the flour. Constant stirring will help prevent these problems.








Use an Indian karahi (kadai), a wok, or a deep saucepan.
Besan is the Hindi word for gram flour. It is also sold as chickpea flour, garbanzo bean flour, cece flour, chana flour, or (in Tamil markets) kadalai maavu.

, Add the cardamom powder (elachi) at this point. If you are using milk and/or cinnamon for more flavor, add those as well. Stir for just a few seconds, then turn off the heat.


Milk adds a richer taste and fluffier texture, but shortens the shelf life.You can skip the milk if you like.

, Move the mixture to a large bowl. Keep stirring for a minute to avoid burning the besan. Set it aside and let it cool for ten minutes. This will stop the sugar from melting, but not cool it so much that the sugar can't blend in.


While waiting, you can make boora if you want to use it instead of sugar.

, Add sugar to the besan mixture. Stir until combined. Do not add the sugar while the besan is still hot, or it may burn. Leave the mixture to cool to room temperature.









If you only have granulated sugar, turn it into powdered sugar with a food processor, coffee grinder, or spice grinder.

, Wash and dry your hands. Shape the mixture into balls with your hands. Store in an airtight container. If you want to decorate them, see below for optional instructions.









If it is too dry to form balls, mix in another teaspoon (5 mL) of ghee and try again. Keep adding ghee until the balls stick together.They will also be easier to form if you put the mix in the fridge for 20–30 minutes., You can add these directly to the mix, or poke one into each ball. Deep fry them in ghee first for even better flavor. Pat them dry after frying, with a paper towel.


Chopped, dry fruit will work as well.

, Put a slivered almond, a cashew half, or a pistachio on the top of each ladoo. Press lightly to push it into the dessert.








, Coarse almond meal adds a tasty, crunchy outside. Roll each ball in it.This is sold as badam powder at Indian markets.


, Many people make their own boora and use it instead of sugar in besan ladoo. This is quick, easy, and uses common ingredients. Here's a larger batch so you can store extra for other recipes:Mix 2¼ cup (450g) granulated sugar and ½ cup (120 mL) water.
Heat in a karahi or other deep pan. Bring to a boil. Stir constantly for 2 or 3 minutes.
Add a spoonful of milk and stir. Use a ladle to skim off the dirty foam that appears at the top. (May not be necessary if sugar and water is clean.)
Add a spoonful of ghee to prevent lumps. Cook until the syrup is very thick and nearly transparent. Keep stirring vigorously. This takes about ten minutes.
Turn the heat off. Move it to a cool surface. Keep stirring constantly until the mixture cools.

Large bowl for soaking the beans
Strainer
Large frying pan
Wooden spoon;
, One of the main features of dal makhani is that it’s creamy and rich. To get the right consistency and texture, the beans must be soaked so that they become soft.


Place the beans in a large bowl and cover them with 3 to 4 cups of water. Allow them to soak overnight.If you don’t have time to soak the beans, place them in a large pot with water, and bring them to a rolling boil for five minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the beans and water with a lid, and let them sit for an hour.The black lentils that you use for this dish are also called black gram and urad dal. You can also use split black lentils if you prefer.

, After soaking, strain the beans and discard the water they were soaking in. Place the beans into the pressure cooker with 4 cups of water. Lock the lid and heat the pressure cooker over high heat until it reaches proper pressure.


When the pressure cooker whistles the first time, reduce the heat a little and continue cooking the beans over medium–high heat for about 10 minutes, until the beans are soft.If you don’t have a pressure cooker, cook the beans over medium–high heat in a lidded pot for 45 minutes to an hour.Remove the beans from the heat when they're ready.

, Heat the ghee over medium heat in a large frying pan. Add the cumin seeds and toast them until they become fragrant and start to change color.Ghee is clarified butter, but you can also use regular butter or oil to toast the cumin.

, When the cumin is toasted, add the chopped onion, garlic, and ginger to the frying pan. Heat over medium heat until everything becomes golden brown.

Stir the mixture regularly so the garlic doesn’t burn. Burnt garlic becomes bitter, and this will change the flavor of the dish.

, Add the ingredients to the onion mixture and turn the heat up high. Cook for five to 10 minutes, until the tomatoes soften and reduce to a thick pulp or sauce-like consistency.


Continue stirring regularly to prevent the tomatoes from burning to the bottom of the pan.
You can also substitute tomato paste for some or all of the tomatoes to give the dish a deeper color and richer flavor.

, Pour the beans into the frying pan along with the water they cooked in. Using the back of your spoon, mash most of the beans to release the meat from within.Mashing the beans will thicken the dal and give the dish it’s characteristic creamy texture.
If the mixture is too thick, add some fresh water. The dal should be about as thick as a thick soup.

, Then reduce the heat to low and simmer the dal for about 15 minutes. Stir in the cream and cook for another few minutes, long enough to heat the cream through.


Use heavy cream for the richest flavor, or regular cream or milk for a slightly lighter version.Taste the dish before serving and add more salt if desired. You can also stir in a pinch of dried fenugreek leaves to give the dal a slightly sweet and nutty flavor.

, To make restaurant-style dal, you take a batch of home-made dal and add smoke flavor to it using the dhungar method, which is a way of smoking dishes using hot charcoal.To do this, you will need:

Hot and freshly prepared home-style dal in a large pot or pan with a lid
Small piece of natural lump charcoal (not charcoal briquettes, which are treated with glue and other ingredients)
Open flame
Tongs
Small heat-proof bowl

, Grab the piece of charcoal with tongs and heat it over the open flame. You can use a candle, a torch, or the flame from a gas stove. Turn the charcoal regularly so that it heats evenly.Heat the charcoal until it becomes red hot. When it’s ready, carefully place it into the small heat-proof bowl.

, Place the bowl with the hot charcoal in the center of the prepared dal dish. Drizzle the oil over the charcoal and let it smoke and sizzle.

Immediately place the lid over the dal and the charcoal and let the smoke infuse into the dal for about two minutes., After two minutes, remove the lid and use the tongs to remove the bowl of charcoal from the dal. Set the bowl aside and allow it to cool.

Give the dal one final stir before serving.

, Remove the dal from the heat when it’s cooked and serve it hot. You can garnish each serving with an extra drizzle of cream and a sprinkle of coriander leaves."

Enjoy!",How to Make a Chicken Biryani," Start with the stove heat on high to get the oil nice and hot, quickly. The onions should sizzle when you put them in the pan with the oil.


Once you see oil evaporating a little bit, the oil is ready for the onions.;
, It's easier to fry onions in smaller portions, so for 2 sliced onions, you can try frying 3 batches or so., Deep fry the onions on medium heat until they turn a golden brown. This should take about 10-20 minutes.


While they are sizzling in the oil, gently mix the onions around to keep all of them coated, and to disperse the heat and oil evenly.
If the flame is very high the onions will burn on the outside and remain watery on the inside.

, Use a big, perforated spoon (a spoon with holes in it for drainage) to removes the onions from the pan once they are golden brown. You want a perforated spoon to drain out excess oil.


Place the onions on a plate with a paper towel on it, to absorb the rest of the excess oil. Put the onions aside for later.

, The bowl or pan needs to be big enough so there is enough room to mix the chicken in with the marinade, and have the marinade coat the chicken completely.


Keep the chicken in big pieces, and on the bone. Keeping the chicken on the bone will create a stock once the chicken is being cooked, adding a nice, full flavor to the biryani.

, One by one add the marinade ingredients to the chicken:


Ginger garlic paste - 2 tbsp
Red chili powder - 1 tbsp
Salt - to taste (approximately 1 tsp)
Yogurt - 1 cup
Garam Masala Powder - 1 tsp
Green cardamom powder - 1 tsp
Cumin powder - 1 tsp
Turmeric - 1/2 tsp
Fried brown onions - 1 cup
Ghee (clarified butter) - 4 tbsp
Freshly chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) - 1/4 cup
Mint leaves (no stalk) 10-15
2-4 green chilies (broken or cut)
Lemon juice - 1 tbsp

, Mix all the ingredients until they are dispersed throughly, and the chicken pieces are completely covered with the marinade mixture. Once the chicken is coated with all the spices and flavorings, let it marinade.


There is a wide range of how long you can let the chicken marinade. You can marinade the chicken overnight to ensure the chicken absorbs all the flavors, or you can marinade it for less time. However, give the chicken a minimum of 4 hours to marinade to set in., Once you are finished with the marinading the chicken, cover and place the chicken in the refrigerator, and work on the other parts of the biryani.

, Rinse the rice with cool water to remove some of the outermost starch, and then allow it to continue soaking in the water. Let the rice soak between 30 minutes to 1 hour.


For biryani, you want to use basmati rice to give the fullest flavor to the dish.

, This is the water you are going to cook the rice in. The water must be boiling before you add the rice.

, Along with the rice, add some other ingredients to give the rice a full flavor, and prevent the rice from sticking:5 green cardamoms
2 black cardamoms
3 cloves
2 pieces of cinnamon
1 bay leaf
1 piece of mace
1 tsp of ghee
1/2 tsp of salt

, Stir the ingredients to make sure they are all mixed in, and then cover the rice boil it for 8-10 minutes or until the rice is cooked half to three quarters of the way. Once the rice is cooked half to three quarters, you can take out the whole ingredients you added earlier (cloves, cardamoms, etc.)

, Since the rice should only be cooked half to a quarter of the way when you take it off the stove, the grains should be soft on the outside but still hard in the middle.


This is because the rest of the rice gets cooked on dum (when you layer the chicken and rice, seal it with dough around the edges to lock in the steam, and put it on a very low flame).
You can tell how cooked the rice is by taking a grain and pressing it with your fingers. The rice should break apart into pieces, but still have a hard texture to it. If it is soft and mushes in your fingers, you have cooked it too much., Turn off the heat once you rice is cooked half to three quarters of the way, and let it sit. The hot water will cook the rice a little bit more, without cooking it too much., Add 1/4 tsp saffron to 2 tbsp of warm milk and let it soak for approximately 15 minutes. This saffron mixture will go on top of the rice when you are preparing to cook the final part of the biryani and it will give a nice flavoring.

, Place 2 cups of chapati flour in a bowl and add approximately 3/4 cup of lukewarm water.Stir until the mixture forms a soft dough.


If the dough is dry and isn't really mixing well, you can add 1-2 tablespoons of water.
Knead the dough by pushing on it with your knuckles and heels of your hands. Make sure your hands are damp with water while doing this so the dough doesn't stick to your skin. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes to ensure it is fully mixed together.

, Traditionally, biryani is cooked in an Indian cooking pot called a biryani handi, but any thick bottom pot will work just fine.A non-stick pot/handi works best.


Spread the chicken so each piece of chicken is touching the bottom and/or sides of the pot. This will help ensure that each piece of chicken gets cooked throughly.

, The rice that you cooked earlier is now ready to be added to the chicken. Create a layer of rice, adding about half of the rice on top of the chicken.


With your perforated spoon, pack the rice firmly into the pot. It is okay if some water comes along with the rice, it will help things cook with the steam.
On top of the rice, sprinkle on fried onions(approximately 2 tbsp), chopped coriander leaves(approximately 1tbsp), and mint leaves (approximately 8-10).You can also sprinkle on cashew or golden raisins, but these are optional.

, This is the second, and final layer of rice you will be adding to the biryani. Once the rest of the rest is spread evenly, add on the rest of the brown onions (approximately 1 tbsp), a little bit more coriander leaves (approximately 1/2 tbsp), mint leaves (3-5), the saffron milk mixture, and approximately 6 tbsp of ghee.An alternative and optional topping is adding some rose water. Just add about 1/2 a capful, and sprinkle it over the top of the biryani., Roll the chapati dough into long pieces and put the dough on the edges of the pot's upside down lid.You add the chapati dough to the edges of the lid, so when you turn the lid right side up, the dough seals the pot so the chicken and rice can steam cook together.


Press lightly but firmly to make sure the lid is secure and tight.
You can add a weight to the lid to ensure that it stays sealed, but usually if you use the dough, it is sealed good enough.

, Keep the biryani cooking for about 5-10 on high flame. Then, take the pot off the flame, put a cooking plate on the flame, and place the pot back on the flame with the cooking plate.


This is the safest method to cook the biryani and make sure the biryani doesn't burn because of the direct contact with the heat.After about 35 switch off the flame, but don't open the biryani yet. Let the biryani sit for another 10 minutes.

, The dough will be a little cooked and hardened, but crack through it, and take of the top to check the biryani.


A lot of steam will come out so be careful not to burn yourself.
Slowly stick a large spoon on the inside side of the hand and lift to get the bottom layers of the rice out. Then, as you work your way down, bring up a piece of chicken. The pieces of chicken should have a brown coloring.

, Usually, biryani is eaten with your hands, and is served with raita, a cold, refreshing, yogurt condiment."

NOTE: Grape leaves can be found in a can, which is often risky since you cannot see the grape leaf, or in a glass jar, in which case you will be able to see the thickness or thinness of the leaf.,Pour just enough hot water over the leaves so that the fluids cover the leaves barely, like the bulgar with the tabbouleh and let soak for approximately 20 minutes.,Mince onions, pine nuts and dried currants.,

NOTE: The following step is optional; as you may either cook the ingredients all together at once, or lightly pan fry piece by piece.,
Take your frying pan, set on medium heat.,Return to your bulgar after the allotted time and strain any excess water from the cracked wheat and set aside.,Now, in the other mixing bowl, combine salt, pepper, all spice (or kibbeh all spices that may be found at local Arabic store or market), and ground cumin.,
At this point, your bulgar is prepared, your meat is thawed, your spices are mixed and the onions and pine nuts are either ready for cooking or have already been lightly browned.,Your oven should be set on medium-high now, ready to pan fry lots of meat.,
NOTE: Some kibbeh recipes opt for baking the meat instead of pan frying, while others are form their meat entirely different, almost in the shape of a torpedo – filled with spices and then deep fried.,
Place two teaspoons of olive oil into the pan, or a little less depending on the size as you do not want to soak the meat in too much oil.,Occasionally roll the patty over from side to side, in order to cook the meat thoroughly and flake the remaining spices over the meat while its cooking.,

Very similar to seasoning hamburgers or any other types of meat. Keep rolling the ingredients and press the meat lightly together as it’s sometimes difficult to mix these ingredients into your lamb or beef. The size of each kibbeh “patty” is to your own choice, but keep in mind the thicker the meat, the longer the time it takes to cook.,, This recipe is clearly not the only means of cooking kibbeh. Be reminded this is only one method., Take about four patties of meat, or however many your pan will contain, and begin to pan fry the patties.,, However, if its turning black or smoking, or smells like its burning, you are obviously running the meat and need to lower the heat of the oven or add more oil for moisture.,, Let cool, but serve while its still hot. Often kibbeh is served with plan yogurt, or homemade style yogurt that dates back centuries., Often the hardest part is gathering all the materials together. Be reminded that appearance is not essential for this kind of food, granted you do not want to look unappetizing or spoiled, but taste is much more important. Be patient when cooking these foods, and take your time. Perhaps try making each dish separately before taking the ambition to cook all four recipes all at once. Or make it an evening affair and invite your friends over to try something new. But, once you are accustomed to the routine and demand of cooking and baking Lebanese cuisine, you will have no problems adjusting to other styles of Mediterranean foods and become eager to know more."

Combine the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl.,
Cook on high.,
Let stand.,
Serve.",How to Cook Freekeh1," Place 2 cups (500 ml) of boiling water, 1 cup (250 ml) freekeh, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt, and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) olive oil in a deep, glass or plastic microwave-safe bowl.Mix slightly to moisten all the freekeh granules and to spread the salt and oil.
You can use either cracked grain freekeh or whole grain freekeh. Either option will work.
To boil the water, fill a tea kettle or small saucepan with water and heat it on the stove over high heat until bubbles start to form.
Alternatively, you can boil the water by placing it in a separate microwave-safe dish and microwaving it in 30 to 60 second intervals until bubbles start to form. Place wooden chopsticks in the water to break the surface tension as you microwave it, thereby preventing the water from super-heating and breaking the dish.;
, Cover the dish and cook the freekeh on high until most of the water is absorbed. For cracked grain freekeh, this will take 10 to 15 minutes. For whole grain freekeh, this will take 30 to 35 minutes.


If your microwave does not rotate, pause the microwave one to three times during the process to turn the dish manually. Doing so can ensure that the freekeh cooks evenly.

, After the cooking process finishes, remove the dish from the microwave and let the freekeh stand, undisturbed and still covered, for about 5 minutes.


The grains of freekeh should absorb the remaining water during this time, causing them to plump up and soften even more.

, At this point, the freekeh is ready to serve. You can enjoy it as is or use it in a recipe for another dish calling for pre-cooked freekeh.

Combine the ingredients in a saucepan.,
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.,
Let simmer.,
Serve.",How to Cook Freekeh2," Add 2 1/2 cups (625 ml) cold water, 1 cup (250 ml) freekeh, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt, and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) olive oil to a medium or large saucepan.


Mix slightly to spread the salt and olive oil and moisten all the grains of freekeh.
You can use cracked grain or whole grain. The latter takes longer to cook, but either one will work.
Make sure that the saucepan has a lid.
The contents of the saucepan should take up half to three-quarters of the total volume. If the pan is much fuller than that, the water might boil over.
Make sure that you use cool to cold water. Cool water will heat more evenly, so the grains of freekeh will cook more evenly, as well.
Note that if the instructions on your box or bag of freekeh differ, it is advisable to use the instructions provided on the container rather than these.

, Use a mixing spoon to stir the contents of the saucepan occasionally as they come up to temperature. Once the liquid starts to boil, cover the pan with its lid.


The lid is necessary because it traps the steam inside. This prevents the water from evaporating, leaving it nowhere to go but into the grains of freekeh.

, Lower the heat to low or medium-low and let the grains simmer until the grains become tender. For cracked grain freekeh, this should take about 10 to 15 minutes. For whole grain freekeh, this should take 40 to 45 minutes.


Stir the grains periodically during the process to promote even cook and limit the amount getting stuck to the pan.
Stir the grains once more at the end of the process to make sure that all of the water has been absorbed and that the grains are adequately tender.

, The freekeh should be ready to serve now. You can enjoy it as a side dish as is, or you can opt to use it in another dish that calls for pre-cooked freekeh.

Stir the herbs into the pilaf.,
Serve with yogurt and pine nuts.",How to Cook Freekeh3," Place the butter and olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan and warm them on the stove over medium heat. Add the sliced onions once the butter melts and Sauté until soft and brown.Sliced onion will take about 15 to 20 minutes to cook. You will need to stir the onions occasionally to prevent them from burning or sticking to the pan.
If you want to distribute the onion flavor more evenly throughout the dish, you could use chopped onion instead of onion slices. Note that chopped onions will only take 7 to 12 minutes to cook.

, Place the uncooked freekeh grains in a medium bowl and fill the bowl with cold water. Let soak for 5 minutes.


It is recommended that you do this while the onions are cooking to minimize the amount of time it takes to prepare the dish overall.

, Pour the freekeh and water through a sieve and rinse well under cold, running water. Let drain completely.


The purpose of soaking, draining, rinsing, and re-draining is to help clean the grains.
Make sure that the holes in the sieve are very small to prevent the loss of grains.

, Toss the freekeh, cinnamon, and allspice into the saucepan with the onions. Stir well to combine.

, Pour the vegetable stock into the saucepan and sprinkle with a pinch each of salt and black pepper. Stir to mix and bring to a boil.


Stir the contents of the saucepan periodically as they reach a boiling point to prevent uneven cooking.

, Once the liquid begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and let it all simmer gently for 15 minutes.


Cover the saucepan as the freekeh cooks to avoid losing water through evaporation. Losing too much water can cause the freekeh to be hard and undercooked.

, Once the freekeh seems tender, remove the saucepan from the stove and let it stand for 5 minutes covered and 5 more minutes uncovered.


Letting the freekeh stand while covered allows the grains to finish absorbing the water.
Letting it stand uncovered lets the freekeh cool down slightly.

, In a small, separate bowl, whisk together the three ingredients until smooth and evenly distributed.


Add a sprinkle of salt, if desired, to draw out more of the flavors.
Save time by doing this step as you wait for the freekeh to cool.

, Once the pilaf is warm instead of hot, stir in the parsley, mint, and coriander until evenly distributed throughout the pilaf.


Taste the pilaf and adjust the seasonings as needed.

, Scoop the freekeh pilaf into individual serving dishes and garnish each portion with a spoonful of the yogurt mix. Garnish with pine nuts.


The pine nuts accentuate the nutty flavor of the freekeh.
You can also garnish with additional parsley or a drizzle of olive oil.

Toss well to evenly coat all the grains in the oil and lemon juice.Before starting this recipe, the freekeh should already be cooked using the microwave or stovetop method described in this article. Make sure that it is drained well and somewhat cooled so that it is no longer steaming hot.
You will need about 1 cup (250 ml) uncooked freekeh for this recipe.

, Add the chopped parsley, mint, basil, and green onions to the freekeh. Use a mixing spoon to stir these ingredients in, distributing them evenly throughout the dish.

, Combine the tomatoes with the freekeh and other ingredients in your mixing bowl. Toss well to mix.


At this point, you should also season the tabouleh with salt and pepper, to taste. Toss well after your initial addition, taste, and add more as needed.
You can add more herbs if desired, as well.

, Loosely cover the dish and let it sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes.


This step will cause the flavors to combine better. It will also give the salad a chance to cool to room temperature.
If you want this dish to be served cold, you can also let it stand in the refrigerator.

, Spoon servings into individual serving dishes and enjoy. Add more salt and pepper, if desired.

, They are all going to go into the dish at the same time anyways, so you put them all together and then put all of their containers away. This helps to maintain a clean cooking space.



Do not add the parsley flakes into the dry spices! The parsley only goes in the rice.

, Cut the ends off and then cut it in half lengthwise and, using a small spoon, scrape out the seeds.


You don't have to do this, but in this dish, it's better with just the crunchy part of the cucumber. Just toss the seeds in the trash. From there, cut each half into three long pieces. Then cut each of those into smaller slices no wider than a 1/4"" thick. The cucumber will be going on the side of the dish to give it a cooling effect (because the curry will be spicy) and a fresh aspect. With that said you can just place the sliced cucumbers into a baggie and toss it in the fridge until it's ready to use.

, In a small bowl, add the ginger powder to the diced garlic and mix it all up well. Let this sit to the side until it's time to add it to the dish.

, The tomato will also be placed on the side of the dish with the cucumbers as a sort of salad so you can just place these into a baggie and put them in the fridge until it's time to use.

, Cut only one half into strips and then dice up the strips. These onions will be going along-side the curry with the tomatoes and cucumbers so just toss them into a baggie and put them in the fridge until you're ready to eat. Remember, only dice up one half of the red onion and put in a baggie. With the other half you will coarsely chop it up to go into the curry. When that half of the red onion is chopped, slide it all onto a paper plate and set aside for now.


Separate the tomatoes, cucumbers, and red onions because we don't all like the same stuff on our bowls of curry; so this way no one complains. If you like all of it you can just go ahead and mix in the cucumbers, tomatoes, and diced red onions together and toss it in with your curry when you’re ready to eat.

, Cut the ends off, cut them in half, cut into slices, and coarsely chop them up and put it all on the same paper plate with the red onions. This will all go into the curry soon, so just set it aside.

, Cut up each potato into bite sized pieces. Put them all into a bowl and fill the bowl with cold water and set them aside.


Do this because when you cut potatoes, the air oxidizes them and they start turning brown. This way, in cold water, they don't turn brown. When it's time to use them you'll just dump out the water and put it in the curry.

, Make sure to rinse the rice well.


Rice is very dirty and gritty, so be sure you run it under hot water and use your hands to get in there and swish the rice around. Then drain out the water, add more hot water, swish around, drain and keep doing this over and over until you see the water is becoming clear. Once you can clearly see the grains of rise through the water you should be good. Rinsing will also remove some of the starch therefore making the rice less sticky.

, When it is done, it beeps and lets you know it's done.

, Rinse the chicken under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels, then cut them into bite sized pieces and set them aside on a paper plate until it's time to cook them.

,, Now you're ready to cook.

, The second you see the oil smoke toss in your whole spices (cinnamon, peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, and cardamom). Stir them around a bit until they become fragrant.

, Let the onions cook until they become transparent, stirring every 1-2 minutes.

, Cook this for about 3 minutes or so or until you can smell the garlic become fragrant.

, Stir this all together to combine. This will start to stick to the bottom of the pot so now, quickly, walk to the sink, and fill a coffee cup with hot water. Pour this water into the pot and stir. Make sure to scrape the bottom to make sure you pick up any stuck on flavor bits.


Do not be tempted to turn down the heat. Leave it just under the high setting. This is a fast process I know, but thanks to all of your prep work, it shouldn't be too hard. Let this bubble until it cooks down by half. You will notice the mixture has become a very dark brown color and smells amazing. You're doing great. Let's keep going.

, Simply pour the chicken right into the pot. Give it all a stir to coat the chicken. Now, pour in 6 cups of hot water. Let this boil and bubble until it’s cooked down by about half.

, Open up the top, and toss in the parsley flakes and about a stick of butter's worth of margarine.

, Then just close the lid back up and set it warm.

, Wait until you see the water come back to a rolling boil and then turn the heat down to medium. Let this bubble for a while to ensure the potatoes get nice and soft and all of the flavors have married together.

Cut a large square of cheesecloth or muslin (calico) (around 15 inches or 38cm in diameter).,
Place the lined colander or sieve over a suitably sized mixing bowl.,
Pour the yogurt into another mixing bowl.,
Empty the mixed yogurt on top of the cheesecloth.,
Bring up the sides and tie tightly with string, leaving a length of string to tie up so the bag will hang and drip into the bowl placed beneath the bag.

,
Place a weight on top of the tied-up bag.,
Place the container in a cool place for at least 15 hours.,
Remove from refrigerator.,
Store in the refrigerator, covered.,
Serve.",How to Make Labneh Cheese," Rinse the cheesecloth or muslin and line a colander or sieve with it. Ensure that excess cloth hangs over the edges; you'll be using this to tie up with. You can also use a large paper coffee filter for this, but it takes a little longer than cheesecloth.;
, Alternatively, use a jelly stand if you have one.

, Add the salt (or sugar). If using flavorings or spices, add at this stage. Anything added should be completely stirred through. Traditionalists enjoy this cheese extremely pungent, so adding spices is usual. Experiment with different mixes to find what works best for you. If you'd rather add the spices or flavorings later, see below.

, It's best spooned in, to save splashing mess.

,, The easiest thing to use is a small plate with a can placed on top. It doesn't need to be that heavy.


You can also choose to leave the weight off and let the cheese come together with gravity. Wrap it in a cheesecloth, tie it off with twine, let hang it in the kitchen over a bowl.

, Purists leave the cheese out in a cool room to drip into a sink. However, if your kitchen or storage area isn't very cool, to minimize the risk of bacteria or mold, place the cheese mixture into the refrigerator.


The cheese can be left for 1-2 days, until the desired consistency is reached. The longer that the cheese is left, the firmer it becomes.
The process can be sped up by squeezing the cheesecloth/muslin to force the excess water out.







, Unwrap the cheese and drain any excess liquid (there is usually some); this is the ""whey"", while the remaining cheese is the ""curds."" Reserve the drained liquid and turn the cheese onto a plate or into a bowl.


At this stage, you can add fresh herbs or dried fruit by whisking/beating this through the cheese. Obviously this will change the consistency and shape of the cheese, so be sure you wish to do this at this stage.







, Placing plastic wrap directly on the surface of the cheese keeps it fresher.


This cheese will keep for up to 4 days when chilled and covered.
For longer keeping, roll the cheese into small balls. Place the balls into a sterilized jar and cover with extra virgin olive oil. Add some rosemary or thyme stalks and some spice seeds such as coriander. Leave to marinate; it should be allowed to marinate for at least 1 day before eating. Store in the refrigerator and use within a week or two.







, The cheese is for spreading and goes well with fresh bread and on crackers. It's also enjoyable on its own, added to a platter of dips and crudités and as a topping for steamed vegetables.

Writing famous quotes in the end just takes your essay to another standard.",How to Write the Last Sentence in a Paper," Pulling back to reveal the larger context can be useful for a complex topic.If you are critiquing a book, mention changes in society or writing that the book reflects. If you are discussing an issue, tell people why the issue is important.


Example: ""Without a detailed understanding of Tolstoy's personal ideology, the reader can only guess at the meaning behind his work.""
Example: ""At a time of record stray populations, these questions of house cat care have never been more urgent.""

, If you're out of ideas on how to continue your topic, ask yourself, ""So what?"" Why should the reader care about your conclusion? What's the next step your argument could lead to? Answer this question in the final sentences of your paper.

, For an essay that lays out and examines a controversial topic, the conclusion may be the best place to include your own opinion. Write your own ""editorial"" on the topic, but make sure to stay grounded in the evidence.For an especially dramatic ending, warn the reader, or make a ""call to action.""


Example: ""If no work is done to prevent these concussions, the sport does not deserve a place in our schools.""

, Visual description can be more memorable than analysis or further arguments. Try describing a person or scene related to the paper's topic, especially if the topic provokes emotional reaction., The final sentence usually provides a sense of closure or completion, but it often includes a small twist as well to set the reader thinking, or to provoke an emotional reaction. A joke or an ironic statement can be a great way to include that twist. This is not suitable for all paper topics and styles, though, so don't force this if you tend to write with a more serious or straightforward tone.

, A sentence composed of short words, especially words one syllable long, often feels dramatic and final. This tactic isn't mandatory, but it works especially well for a call to action or a warning.Similarly, a direct, simple sentence will often feel ""punchier"" than one with many sub-clauses and commas.

, Ending in a similar place to your introduction is one of the most common ways to create an appealing, ""symmetric"" essay. The key here is not to reiterate a point you already made, but to reference your earlier writing as part of a new point.Try using the title of your paper, a short phrase from a quote in your introduction, or an important term you define in the introduction.

, A short, memorable phrase can help your essay stick in the reader's mind.Try working a common idiom into your final sentence, or a short quotation.


Try to keep quotations to no more than a few words in your final sentence. It's difficult to end the paper gracefully and on-topic when you're not using your own words.

, Writers and orators often build up to a major point using a set of three parallel phrases. Your audience is conditioned to hear this, and will associate it with a sense of completion. Here are some examples of possible final sentences using parallel structure:


""For the settlers who founded these farms, the people who work there, and the animals who are raised there, it's time to fight.""
""We shall celebrate Janet Smith's novels for years to come, for their unique characters, inimitable poetry, and inspiring messages.""

, Your reader will have already noticed that this is the last sentence. There's no need to mention it using ""in conclusion,"" ""in summary,"" or similar phrases.Remove these from the entire last paragraph for a more straightforward, punchy conclusion.

, If your essay is five pages or shorter, try to avoid summarizing or repeating your main points in the conclusion paragraph.Your reader doesn't need to be reminded of what she just read, and this dry lead-in makes it difficult to write an inspiring or interesting final sentence.

, The last paragraph is no place to bring up a new topic, right before you jump ship and leave your reader to figure it out himself.If your last sentence mentions a topic you haven't already discussed, delete it and try again. You can make an exception if your conclusion paragraph ties your paper's topic into the broader world around it, but be careful to keep your writing relevant to your thesis.


Ending in a question can be tough for this reason, since questions often introduce new ideas. A rhetorical question can serve as a final sentence, but it's best to rephrase it as a statement if you have any doubts.

, You might find the perfect statistic to support your point, but it still belongs earlier on in the paper. Similarly, don't end with a quotation that you're only including to back up your argument. If you do use a quotation, select one that produces inspiration or dramatic effect on its own.

, Emotional, dramatic endings are fun to write, but that doesn't mean they're always correct. An analytic paper that carefully examines evidence and argues a logical point has no reason for a final sentence full of emotional outburst, praise, or condemnation.This often turns up in the form of praising a country, ""overcoming injustice,"" or other appeals to broad phenomena not specifically related to the paper topic.

, Keep your last sentence, and your entire essay, strong and direct. Remove apologies, self-doubts, and other phrases that undermine your authority.If you didn't have time to cover a topic, don't mention it and don't apologize for it; your essay is what it is, and it's up to your readers to decide whether they like it.

, It also helps a little in covering the mistakes you might have made in the last paragraph or maybe even throughout your whole essay."

Try clustering. Write your thesis in the middle of a blank sheet of paper and draw a circle around it. Every time you think of an idea to support it, draw an arm off of the center idea and write it out.
Try freewriting. Write your thesis at the top of a piece of paper and write down whatever ideas come to your mind. Don't think, just write.

, Parameters are used to prove your thesis. For example, if the thesis is ""Paul West was a dynamic character and the leader of the group,"" choose three traits that Paul West displays that prove he is a dynamic character and the leader of the group.


Write down your parameters.
Be sure you can prove that they are true through factual examples.

,


Write your thesis at the top of a sheet of paper.
List your three supporting paragraph topics.
List 2-3 examples that support your paragraph topics within each paragraph.
Order your examples from best to worst.

, This is the sentence that draws the reader in before the thesis statement, which is usually the second sentence of the first paragraph. For example, ""Paul West was one of fourteen boys who became stranded on a deserted island in the Caribbean."" Your thesis should be next. ""Paul West is a dynamic character and the leader of the group.""

, Each paragraph should support your thesis. Include examples of why each topic supports your thesis. Again, use your strongest examples first.

, Each paragraph should be connected through a transition sentence. For example, ""Not only was Paul West the leader of the group because people adored him, but his followers were also scared of him.""

, Your conclusion should restate your thesis and 3 parameters. For example, ""From these examples it is clear that throughout the novel Paul's once shy, honest, and naive nature changes, proving he is a dynamic character.""

Document your sources.",How to Write an Interview Essay," This will have an impact on whom you interview, how you will conduct the interview, and how you will write the subsequent essay.If your essay is to be a factual piece, you'll want to interview someone who has expertise in the subject matter you'll be addressing. If your paper is about a science topic, you'll want to interview a scientist in that field. If your paper is about a period of history, you'll want to interview either a historian or someone who's lived through that period of history.
If you plan to make your essay an opinion piece, you'll likely want to interview someone who has a strong opinion about the topic covered in your essay. Ideally, you want someone who can express opinions articulately, and who also has credentials in the area you plan to write about.
If your piece will have a narrow perspective, you'll need to interview only one or two people. If your piece will present a general consensus, you'll need to interview more people, probably with varying expertise and credentials.;
, In order to conduct an effective interview that can in turn become a successful interview essay, you need to delve into the history and background of your subject(s) and the topic at the core of your essay. You can use this information to determine the best questions to ask in the interview.When available, read works about and works written by your subject, both in print and online. At the same time, research the topic associated with your subject. The more you know about both, the more intelligent questions you can ask.
Look for previous interviews your subject has given, as well. These will give you an idea of what questions the person has been asked before, so you can decide on appropriate subjects for your own questions, including questions that no one else has asked.
Questions that require ""yes"" or ""no"" answers are good for gathering specific factual information; open-ended ""how,"" ""why,"" and ""tell me about"" questions are great for gathering additional background material not found in your research.
Draw up a list of the questions you are prepared to ask. Have more questions ready than you will likely use, so that you can make adjustments as the interview takes place. (For instance, your subject may begin focusing on what you thought was a side topic, but turns out to be the key part of your interview.) Rank your questions in order of importance to make sure you ask your best ones, or list them all in the order you'd ask them and color-code the most important ones.

, You'll need to contact the interviewee (or his or her representative) to arrange a time and place to conduct the interview. You'll also need permission to record the interview with either audio or video equipment, or to take photographs. Be sure the person you contact knows who you are and why you want to interview him or her.Choose a quiet place with few distractions for your interview site. A library, restaurant, or campus location if you're doing this for a college writing class would be suitable.
You may want to get the interviewee's consent to use his or her comments in your essay in writing, as well as permission to record those comments during the interview. By law, if you are recording an interview conducted over the phone, you must obtain written permission.It's helpful to have a backup interviewee in case the person you plan to interview can't make it.
Be on time at the place you've agreed to meet for the interview.

, Even if you are using a recording device, take notes during the interview, as they can help you look for specific points in the recording to incorporate into the essay.Using a recording device (with permission) is almost always advisable, as it permits you to save your note-taking for jotting down your insights on contexts, themes, how your subject approaches the questions, his/her comfort level, and so on.
Be patient and respectful as you ask your questions and wait for responses. Give the interviewee time to reflect, and you will likely be rewarded with more insightful answers. A few deeper responses are usually better than many superficial ones.
Immediately after the interview, write down your thoughts and impressions about the interview and interviewee. They may help you shape the essay.
Always end the interview by thanking the person.

, If the essay is a class assignment, the format will likely be pre-determined. Clarify with your instructor whether he or she expects questions and answers, long quotations, or paraphrasing, and if the primary focus should be the interview itself or in placing it in a larger context.Generally, interview essays can be in one of several formats:


Narrative format. This form allows paraphrasing of some information the interviewee says, along with direct quotes for the material you most want to emphasize. This is the most likely format for a class assignment, and offers the most opportunity to add context and analysis.
Conversational format. This is a looser format than the formal writing style required for most essays. You can address the reader directly and use both first and second person. This format can be suitable for anything from class assignments to magazine articles.
Question-and-answer format. This form presents your questions to the interviewee, followed by the interviewee's responses. (That is, the text looks something like this: (Your Name): How long have you been in the circus? (Interviewee's Name): About 35 years.) These are always direct quotes, although you may insert explanatory material in parentheses and substitutions, such as a person's name in place of a personal pronoun, in brackets. This format is best suited for essays with only a single interviewee or a closely related group, such as spouses or the core cast of a TV show.

, The outline will depend largely on the essay format you are following, but a strong introduction, which clearly identifies your subject and the goals and focus of your interview, is always important.Read over your interview notes and listen to any audio / video recordings you have. Utilizing both whenever available will allow you to thoroughly consider both the highlights of the interview and the most significant themes to emerge from it. These, in turn, will inform your outline of what information your essay will cover and how it will appear.One possible outline could be an introduction that starts with an anecdote about the interviewee and then presents your thesis statement, several key points that support the main focus, and a conclusion that summarizes the information presented. Traditional school essays often utilize a five paragraph format (introduction, three supporting paragraphs, conclusion), and this can often work with interview essays as well.

, If the purpose of your essay is only to present your interviewee to your reader, your thesis will likely be a brief summary identifying the person and his or her background, accomplishments, and qualifications. For instance: ""John Doe eagerly volunteered to serve his country in Vietnam in 1967, and is fortunate to still be here to share his story.""


If, however, the purpose of your essay is to use your interviewee's comments to support a position or examine a larger theme, your thesis will probably be a statement of that position or theme, with the interview / interviewee placed within that context. For instance: ""John Doe's mixed feelings of pride and betrayal reflect those shared by many Vietnam veterans still with us.""
Regardless of essay format, make your thesis clear and concise, and be sure that the remainder of your essay refers back to it. See How to Write a Thesis Statement for more advice.

, The body of your essay needs to follow the selected format while supporting the thesis and providing substantial coverage of the actual interview.


Interviews can sometimes produce a good deal of repetitive answers (even with high-quality questions), so you may need to trim repetitions and unnecessary elements from the body of your essay. Make sure that whatever material you do keep remains true to both the spirit of the interview and the overarching focus of your essay.A handout from the Writing Center at the University of North Carolina (available at http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/oral-history/) provides a wealth of valuable materials on interview essays. It includes, for instance, examples of how to utilize the same interview materials in a transcription (question-and-answer format), a presentation of individual experiences (quotations and paraphrases), and the placing of the interview / interviewee in a larger context (paraphrasing and quotations with ample explanation).

, Any type of essay, including interview essays, should be thoroughly proofread and carefully revised to provide maximum clarity and impact.


Reading over the essay yourself is a good start, but it is always wise to have another set of eyes look it over as well. Another reader is likely to catch errors, repetitions, and unclear sections that you have glossed over.Go back to your original interview notes, recordings, and transcripts, and make sure that your essay continues to reflect the actual interview. Layers of editing and revising can sometimes cause the essay to drift away from the original source and intent. You may even want to let the interviewee read it over to ensure that it captures his or her voice., Depending on your assignment, you may not need to explicitly cite the interview itself, but always check to make sure. Always cite any supplemental materials, however.Any materials you used for research, information about the interviewee, or context for the essay itself should be referenced in the approved citation format for your essay.
Make sure one more time that any direct quotations from your source are placed in quotation marks, and any paraphrasing is done without quotation marks. Don't put words in your subject's mouth, and respect the words that do emerge from it.

Decide on a style.",How to Write an MLA Style Heading on a Literature Essay," MLA format doesn't require you to have a title page. Therefore, on the first page of your paper, you need to include your information in the upper left-hand corner to identify yourself. You'll need to have your name, the professor's name, the name of the class, and the date.Put your name at the top. Underneath it, add your professor's name, and underneath that, add the class. The date goes underneath the class.
This information should be double-spaced.;
, The title goes directly underneath your information. The title should be centered in the middle of the page instead of aligned with the left margin.You should also use title-case capitalization for your title, where you capitalize the first and last word, as well as all other important words.
The title should be descriptive of your paper. Try to give the reader an idea of what your paper is about, though it can be a pun or funny, as well, such as ""What's at Stake: Symbolism in Dracula""
If you have a sub-title, it should be set off with a semicolon, as in the example.

, Your entire document should be double-spaced.This means that there will be a space between the lines of your personal information and between the title and the text.


To double-space your document in Word, highlight the text and then open the ""Paragraph"" dialog box in Microsoft Word. Click on the ""Line Spacing"" drop-down menu and select ""Double."" This will automatically double-space your text.
Do not manually enter spaces into your document. Doing this will add too much space between the lines and it will make your document look a little odd.

, A header runs throughout your paper, so that every page is labelled. The header goes in the upper right-hand corner. The first header should appear on the second page of the document and then continue to the end of the document. It should include your last name, followed by just the page number to the right of your last name.You don't need to add ""p"" or ""pg."" in front of the page number. You just need the page number. Unless otherwise specified, the header goes on every page, including the first one.
Always follow your teacher's instructions. For example, your teacher may ask you to place the page number under your name.
You can create a header with your word-processing software. For example, in Microsoft Word, you can just double click in the space at the top of the page to edit the header.

To insert page numbers in MS Word, select the ""Insert"" tab. Then, click on the ""Page Number"" drop down menu. Hover your cursor over the ""Top of the Page"" option and then select ""Plain Number 3."" The page number will appear on the current page of your document. Type your last name in front of the page number, and then check the box next to ""Different First Page.""
You can also highlight the text and change it to match your document's text. For example, if you have used Times New Roman, then you could highlight the page number and your last name on the current page and then select Times New Roman from the font menu. Exit the header by clicking on a different part of your document.

, You may not be required to include section headings for your paper. Check your assignment guidelines or ask your teacher if you are unsure. If your teacher does require you to include section headings, then make sure that you follow any special instructions that your teacher has provided.


Try saying something to your teacher like, ""Just to clarify, do we need section headings for this paper?"" If the teacher says yes, then you might ask, ""Are there any special instructions for the section headings that I should keep in mind?""

, To use headings, your paper needs to be divided up into the main sections. Each section should cover one main idea in your paper. Usually, sections only work in longer papers, such as 6 to 10 pages or longer. If your paper is fairly short, you probably won't need headings.If you wrote the paper from an outline, use that to create your sections from.
If you didn't use an outline, look at the main ideas that you outlined in your introduction. Each main idea should have its own section.

, In MLA format, you use a number in front of each heading, starting with the first main idea after the introduction. Use Arabic numbers (1, 2, 3...), not Roman numerals (I, II, III...), to number your headings. Use a period after the number.For example, your first heading would be numbered like this: 1.

, Now, you need to name each section with an appropriate title. Each title should be descriptive of what's in the section, so it gives your reader an idea of what's ahead. Headings can also be fun, such as a pun on what you're talking about, but they should always provide some idea of what's ahead.For example, if your section is about the use of blood in Dracula, you could write something purely descriptive, such as ""The Use of Blood in Dracula.""
Use title capitalization, meaning you capitalize the first and last words in the heading, as well as all the other important words in the heading. Don't capitalize unimportant words, such as articles (a, an, the), prepositions (to, with, through, about, etc.), and conjunctions (and, yet, but, for, so, etc.).
Place the heading after the number: 1. The Use of Blood in Dracula.

, It's best to maintain parallelism when creating your headings. That is, it's best to keep them grammatically similar. For example, you don't want to use ""The Use of Blood in Dracula,"" and ""Finding the Stake."" Instead, make them similar, such as ""The Use of Blood in Dracula"" and ""The Symbolism of the Stake.""Another example of parallelism would be changing the titles ""The Blood in Dracula,"" ""Dracula's Symbolism,"" and ""Finding Religion"" to ""Dracula's Blood,"" ""Dracula's Symbolism,"" and ""Dracula's Religion.""

, If your paper is very long, you can break your sections into sub-sections. In that case, you'll need to add subheadings. Use consecutive numbers after the period to distinguish the subheadings, and add a title after each number.For example, under ""The Use of Blood in Dracula,"" you could have the following subheadings: ""1.1 Blood as Sexuality"" and ""1.2 Blood as Symbol of Immorality.""

, MLA format doesn't specify how you should format your headings, so you can decide how you want to format them. You may want to bold your main headings, and italicize your subheadings, for example. The key is to be consistent with how you format them.For example, your headings could look like the ones below:1. The Use of Blood in Dracula1.1 Blood as Sexuality
1.2 Blood as Symbol of Immortality

Understand scoring.",How to Write Good Essays in AP World History1," The point of this essay is to show that you can see a historical document, whether a ship’s register or a written historical account, and make correct observations from it. You will receive four to ten documents and should demonstrate mastery of the wider context of world history. During the exam, you have fifty minutes to complete this essay. Ten minutes are for reading and looking at the document, forty minutes are for writing. Underline key terms when reading the prompt. This question aims to test your knowledge of the following historical analytical skills:


Making historical arguments from evidence and practicing historical argumentation
Chronological reasoning, determining causation, continuity, and change-over-time
Comparison and contextualization
Historical interpretation and synthesis;
, You can choose to analyze your documents based on chronology, cultural issues, or any other themes.Picking a theme for analysis will help you create a clearer narrative. Do not try to undertake too much in one essay. Instead, pick one or two themes that can act as the common threads through the documents.


Look for commonalities or contrasts in the documents’ tone, authorship, purpose or intent, and dating.Draw a table that lists your group headings, e.g. ""gender"" or ""trade pacts."" List the numbers of the documents that fit in each group. For each group, make sure you have minimally two documents.Themes might include a particular time period like World War II, technological movements like the Industrial Revolution, or social movements like civil rights.

, First, read and analyze the documents individually. Use the documents’ contents to create your thesis statement. Decide what you want to prove based on the facts in front of you. See how you can relate the content to its context or to other events in that historical moment. Work to synthesize your findings into a clear, cohesive essay.You must use all or all but one of the documents.For this essay, rely on the evidence in front of you first. Then, if you have any examples that will help your point, you can incorporate them into your argument.
You might be asked what other documents could be beneficial to your grouping or argument. Think about what could make your arguments stronger. Try to mention an additional needed document at the end of every body paragraph.For tips on writing an essay, see Write an Essay.
For advice on developing your thesis statement, see Focus an Essay. Your thesis statement should mention evidence you gathered from the documents. It should clearly and concisely answer the prompt. Do not take on a thesis that you cannot prove in the allotted time. A framework for a thesis could be: ""Docs. 1-3 demonstrate how due to the invention of the water mill, landowners with water rights were able to extract income from a basic natural resource. This widened the income gap between landowners and farmers.""

, Your grader will look at several factors when grading your essay. For example, the clarity and strength of your thesis matters. Understanding the documents, supporting your thesis with evidence, and examining the point of view of two documents are also crucial. Grouping your documents into different categories also shows that you can connect the dots between artifacts. Lastly, your explanation of what sources could add to your argument also impacts your score.For examples of sample questions and documents for this essay and the other types of essays, see http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-world-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf

This helps determine how much information you'll need to gather and present. Check your syllabus and any assignment prompts or sheets first; if you still need clarification, ask your teacher.Be sure you know how your teacher wants you to cite your sources so you can keep track of what you research. Some schools provide reference software like EndNote or RefWorks, which can make collecting and keeping track of research sources easier.
Be aware of any formatting requirements. The essay prompt will often tell you things such as whether the essay needs to be handwritten or typed, and what font type and size to use. If it doesn't stipulate, the safe choice is a standard, readable 12-pt font such as Times New Roman or Arial. Avoid using ""cute"" or ""quirky"" fonts in an academic paper unless given specific permission to do so.
Know the due date! Get started early so that you have plenty of time to complete the essay.;
, If the topic is not already assigned, you'll need to select your own topic. It's easy to get stuck on this step if you have a wide range of choices, so take your time and abide by a few general rules:


The topic should not be too broad or too narrow. See Write an Essay for more information. There should be enough information about the topic to write about, but not so much that you can't present clear, concise information. For example, writing on ""the history of animal shelters"" is probably much too broad, while ""the history of Sunny Days Animal Shelter in X County"" is probably too narrow. A happy medium might be ""the history of breed-specific animal shelters in America.""
The topic should be appropriate and interesting to your audience. Think in advance about who might be reading your essay. Obviously, if this is for school, your teacher is your primary audience, but you should always have a target audience in mind. What will they want to know? What do they probably not know already that your essay will provide?
Ideally, the topic should be one that interests you. This will make the writing process that much easier, and you can pass your enthusiasm on to your reader.

, This is especially important for an informative essay, where you need to impart accurate information. Be very careful to use objective sources written by experts on your topic. A librarian can best help you find reliable sources of information, such as encyclopedias, books, journals, and relevant websites. Be careful when using the Internet, including sites like Wikipedia, as many pages are full of unreliable content.


For best results, try to find online sources from reputable organizations, government agencies, and universities. Google Scholar can be a good place to start.

, Use a blank sheet of paper or notebook to jot down interesting facts that you read. Alternatively, you can type notes on a computer. Whatever you choose, find a way to keep all your notes for the essay in one place.


For your informative essay, you will need an introduction, at least three main points, and a conclusion. You may want to make these sections and write notes down under the section where you expect it to go.

, You should know in advance what information you'll need when citing sources. You will usually need to include the author(s), title, publisher, copyright information, and website address (if relevant).

, When you feel you've gathered enough material from your research, brainstorming will help you put the information into relevant groups and see the connections between them.Make an ideas map. Put your topic in a circle at the center of a piece of paper, then write down the most important pieces of information or ideas related to it in circles surrounding the topic. Make lines connecting each idea to the topic. Next, add details around each idea, circling them and making lines to show connections. There may be lines connecting ideas to each other, as well, or between supporting details.
Make a list. If you prefer the linear format of a list, write down your topic at the top and then below it any ideas you have. Under the ideas, add extra details that support them. Don't worry about putting them in specific order - that comes next.Free write. Free writing can help you generate ideas, even if it usually doesn't provide polished prose you'll use in your final draft. Set a short time limit, such as 15 minutes, and then write whatever comes to mind about your topic. Don't stop to edit or change spelling, and keep writing even if you aren't sure you have anything to say. The important thing is to write for all 15 minutes.

, You should have some idea that you want to present in your thesis statement, which is typically two to three sentences long and articulates your overall argument.


Don't worry about getting your thesis just right at this point - that comes later. If you don't feel ready to write the thesis out, jot down some notes in the introductory part of your outline. At the very least, you need some idea of what you want to say in your essay.
While it may seem odd to summarize your essay before you've begun, writing your thesis at the beginning of your outline will help you organize your ideas and select the most important details that you want to present.

, The body of your essay is the part between the introductory paragraph and the conclusion paragraph. Select main details from your research that demonstrate your overall thesis (from Step 1).The number of details you use depends on the paper length: if you're writing a five-paragraph essay, then you have three paragraphs for the body, so you'll need three main ideas.
Make sure you choose the most important details, and that they are all distinct from one another.
Details used to support your thesis are also called ""evidence.""

, Now that you've identified the major point for each paragraph, jot down smaller, supporting details that help your reader understand the paragraph's main idea. These might include examples, facts, quotations or further explanation.


Make sure you have enough supporting details for each paragraph. If you don't have enough to say about the paragraph's main topic, consider changing the topic or combining it with another paragraph. Alternatively, you can research a bit more to find additional supporting details for the paragraph.

, The conclusion summarizes what you've already said, and brings some new level of nuance or sophistication to your original thesis. Think of it as your final opportunity to make sure your reader understands what you've written.

, Using your outline as a guide, flesh out your notes into full paragraphs.


Do not worry about spelling errors or mistakes. Remember that this is just a rough draft, not your final copy. Just focus on writing it down, and later you can fix mistakes.
Write your rough draft by hand or type it - whichever is easier for you.

, The topic sentence, often the first sentence in each paragraph, tells your reader the main idea of the paragraph. It can also serve as a transition from the previous paragraph's main idea to the new paragraph's main idea.For example, a topic/transition sentence might look like this: ""While some factories allow union labor, others, such as those in X, argue that unionizing harms the workplace."" This sentence gives a clear direction for the paragraph (some factories argue against unionizing) and links it to the paragraph before it (which was probably about pro-union factories).
Remember: each paragraph needs unity (a single central idea), clear relation to the thesis, coherence (logical relationship of ideas within the paragraph), and development (ideas are clearly explained and supported)., Your essay will need, at minimum, an introductory paragraph, a body, and a conclusion. Each body paragraph should follow the ""C-E-E"" formula: Claim + Evidence + Explanation. Use supporting details and your own thoughts to expand on the paragraph's topic or idea.


Make sure you're clear about what the idea of each paragraph is. To keep yourself on track, refer to your outline as you write.

, Read through your rough draft a few times and ask the following questions:


Have you told the reader everything you need to about your topic?
Do you have a clear thesis statement, expressed in two to three sentences?
Do all your paragraphs relate to the thesis?
Does each paragraph have one main idea, supported by accurate, objective details?
Does your conclusion summarize your thoughts on the topic without adding new information or opinions?
How does the paper flow? Are there clear, logical transitions between paragraphs?
Have you used clear, concise prose and avoided flowery language?
Did the reader learn something new from the essay? Is it presented in an interesting way?
Have you cited sources as instructed by your teacher?, After you've made notes on your rough draft, transform it into a final draft. If you've done the work on your rough draft, turning it into your final draft shouldn't actually be too hard.As you write your final draft, keep track of coherence in particular. Rough drafts often have all of their ideas jumbled up without a clear, logical progression. A key difference between a rough draft and a final draft is that the final draft should offer its information in a smooth, clear, easy-to-read fashion that builds on previous points as it goes along. Keeping an eye out to make sure you've followed the C-E-E- formula will help you.

, Once you've organized all of your paragraphs in a logical progression, you can turn your attention to your language choices. Read through your essay aloud, listening for any places that sound odd or awkward. Revise those.

Also keep an eye out for word echoes, or words that show up many times within the space of a few sentences or paragraphs. If you use the word discusses multiple times in the same paragraph, it will make your writing seem clunky and unpolished.

, Mistakes can happen, so be sure to give your final draft one more read-through, checking for spelling and grammar errors.


Sometimes our eyes ""fix"" mistakes for us as we read, so it's hard to catch mistakes reading silently. Reading aloud helps you find mistakes your eye might not.

How did environmental conditions shift, for example, during the Industrial Revolution? What were the connections to technological development? Look for changes over time and things that remained the same or were continuous.
Include dates when relevant.When forming your thesis statement, make sure it answers the prompt and mentions both change and continuity. For example, ""Although Christianity spread through colonialism, its impact in China was relatively small in comparison to other countries (e.g. X, Y, Z). In China, Buddhism remained as a mainstay because of missionaries' inability to connect with the local people in (location M, N, etc.).""

, Use examples you have learned from class and your studies to support your point. Choose stories that demonstrate change and continuity and the forces driving those processes. Aim to be relevant.


For example, if you are writing about the Crusades, drawing parallels to the Mongols and spirituality's influence on their wars is an interesting side-point. Unless you were asked to compare the role of religion in war, however, the point is probably not necessary to mention!

, Graders will look at the strength of your thesis and that you discuss appropriate global issues. You also must answer every part of the question. Use relevant evidence that you have learned in class or studying to back up your claims. Make sure to convey the continuity or change elements of this essay. While your last essay (comparative) focuses heavily on making comparisons, you should seek to have a linear argument for the continuity and change essay.


Good essays tie change and continuity together. For example, an important agricultural change could lead to a technological innovation that becomes a continuity.

Learn about scoring.",How to Write Good Essays in AP World History3," Students demonstrate via comparative essays that they can look at two civilizations or regions and recognize how they are similar or different. You should examine why there are similarities or differences. What are the reasons behind them? You have forty minutes to write this essay. Spend the first five minutes outlining your argument.You might be able to choose from a number of examples for analysis., Students must show that they can follow the prompt. For example, if it says “compare and contrast,” do both of these things. Be sure to understand the meaning of these words. Common “directive” words that will appear on your exam are:


Analyze
Compare
Assess or evaluate
Explain
Discuss
Describe, Before you start writing your essay, jot down an outline with your key points. Decide what will go into each paragraph. By having a map of your plan, you will be able to write more efficiently and quickly. When making your thesis statement, key in mind the directive words. If the prompt says you must compare, then make sure you offer a comparison in your thesis statement.

, When drawing comparisons, think about two topics you know a lot about. Of course, some prompts will lead you to analyze specific groups but if you are allowed to choose your examples, lean on your strengths.


For example, if the prompt asks you to compare the role of religion in war between two societies, you could pick the Ancient Hebrews and early Muslims. If, however, you know more about the Christian Crusaders and the spiritualist Mongols, go for that comparison. As long as you can support your points with thorough examples and your examples answer the question at hand, use what you know best.

, Like with the change-over-time essay, graders will look to see that you can argue well, explain the reason for changes, and synthesize your arguments. Because comparison is the focus of this essay, particular attention will be given to how you compare and contrast the regions. What details do you provide? How do you explain the different historical, social, or contexts that result in differences? Particularly you must show that you:


Can develop a solid thesis
Answer every part of the question
Provide evidence to back up your thesis
Make minimally one (preferably more) direct comparisons between regions or societies
Examine one reason for the difference between regions

If you are writing an expository essay for an assignment, read the assignment guidelines. Ask your instructor if anything seems unclear.

, Think about who will be reading your expository essay. Consider the needs and expectations of your readers before your begin writing. Jot down some of the things that you will need to keep in mind about your readers as you write your expository essay.If you are writing your essay for a class assignment, consider what your instructor will expect you to include in your essay.

, Before you begin writing your essay, you should take some time to flesh out your ideas and get some things down on paper. Invention activities like listing, freewriting, clustering, and questioning can help you to develop ideas for your expository essay.Try listing. List all your ideas for your expository essay. Then look over the list you have made and group similar ideas together. Expand those lists by adding more ideas or by using another prewriting activity.Try freewriting. Write nonstop for about 10 minutes. Write whatever comes to mind and don’t edit yourself. After you finish writing, review what you have written. Highlight or underline the most useful information for your expository essay. Repeat the freewriting exercise using the passages you underlined as a starting point. You can repeat this exercise many times to continue to refine and develop your ideas. Try clustering. Write a brief explanation of the subject of your expository essay on the center of a piece of paper and circle it. Then draw three or more lines extending from the circle. Write a corresponding idea at the end of each of these lines. Continue developing your cluster until you have explored as many connections as you can.Try questioning. On a piece of paper, write out “Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?” Space the questions about two or three lines apart on the paper so that you can write your answers on these lines. Respond to each question in as much detail as you can., Once you have gotten some of your ideas on paper, you may want to organize those ideas into an outline before you begin drafting your essay. You can Write an Essay Outline to plan out your whole essay, develop more ideas, and figure out if you have forgotten anything., See your assignment guidelines or ask your instructor if you have questions about what types of sources are appropriate for this assignment. Books, articles from scholarly journals, magazine articles, newspaper articles, and trustworthy websites are some sources that you might consider using., There are several things that you will need to consider in order to determine whether or not a source is trustworthy.Identify the author and his or her credentials. Think about what qualifies this person to write about their subject. If the source has no author or the author does not have adequate credentials, then this source may not be trustworthy.Check for citations to see if this author has researched the topic well enough. If the author has provided few or no sources, then this source may not be trustworthy.Look for bias. Think about whether or not this author has presented an objective, well-reasoned account of the topic. If the author seems biased, then this source may not be trustworthy.Consider the publication date to see if this source presents the most up to date information on the subject.Cross-check some of the information in the source. If you are still concerned about a source, cross check some of its information against a trustworthy source., Make sure that you understand what the author is saying. Take time to look up words and concepts that you do not understand. Otherwise, you might end up misreading and misusing your sources.

, Highlight and underline significant passages so that you can come back to them. As you read, take note of significant information in your sources by jotting the information down in a notebook.Show when you have quoted a source word for word by putting it into quotation marks. Include information about the source such as the author’s name, article title or book title, and page number.
Write down the publishing information of each source. You will need this information for your ""References,"" ""Bibliography,"" or ""Works Cited"" pages. Format this page according to your instructor's guidelines.

, Effective thesis statements express the main focus of a paper and state an arguable claim. A thesis should not be more than one sentence in length.Make sure your thesis is arguable. Do not state facts or matters of taste. For example, ""George Washington was the first president of the United States,"" is not a good thesis because it states a fact. Likewise, ""Die Hard is a great movie,"" is not a good thesis because it expresses a matter of taste.Make sure your thesis provides enough detail. In other words, avoid just saying that something is ""good"" or ""effective."" Instead, say what makes something ""good"" or ""effective., Your introduction should immediately begin discussing your topic. Think about what you will discuss in your essay to help you determine what you should include in your introduction. Keep in mind that your introduction should identify the main idea of your expository essay and act as a preview to your essay., Provide enough background information or context to guide your readers through your essay. Think about what your readers will need to know to understand the rest of your essay. Provide this information in your first paragraph.If you are writing about a book, provide the name of the work, the author, and a brief summary of the plot.
If you are writing about a specific day in history, summarize the day's events. Then, explain how it fits into a broader historical scope.
If you are writing about a person, name the person and provide a brief biography.
Keep in mind that your context should lead up to your thesis statement. Explain everything your reader needs to know to understand what your topic is about. Then narrow it down until you reach the topic itself.

, Your thesis statement should be a single sentence that expresses your main argument., The most common length for an expository essay is five-paragraphs, but an expository essay can be longer than that. Refer to your assignment guidelines or ask your instructor if you are unsure about the required length of your paper.


A five-paragraph essay should include three body paragraphs. Each body paragraph should discuss a piece of supporting evidence that supports your thesis.Even if your essay is longer than five paragraphs, the same principles still apply. Each paragraph should discuss a piece of supporting evidence.

, The topic sentence introduces the main idea of the paragraph. It should introduce one piece of supporting evidence that supports your thesis.


For example, if you are writing an expository essay about the use of dogs in the US Marine Corps during WWII, your main ideas and topic sentences could be something like:

""Dogs played an active role in Marine Corps missions in the Pacific.""
""The Doberman Pinscher was the official dog of the US Marine Corps during WWII, but all breeds were eligible to train as war dogs.""
""War dogs were even eligible to receive military awards for their service.""



, After you have stated your topic sentence, provide specific evidence from your research to support it. Offer a new piece of evidence for every body paragraph in your essay.Most of your evidence should be in the form of cited quotes, paraphrases, and summaries from your research.
Your evidence could also come from interviews, anecdotes, or personal experience.
Try to provide at least two to three pieces of evidence to support each of your claims.
For example, if a paragraph starts with, ""War dogs were even eligible to receive military awards for their service,"" the supporting evidence might be a list of dogs who got awards and the awards they were given.

, Explain how the evidence you have provided in that paragraph connects to your thesis. Write a sentence or two for each piece of evidence. Consider what your readers will need to know as you explain these connections., Each paragraph should transition into the next. The conclusion of each body paragraph should sum up your main point while showing how it works with your next point. For example, imagine that you want to connect two paragraphs that begin with these sentences: ""The Doberman Pinscher was the official dog of the US Marine Corps during WWII, but all breeds could train as war dogs."" And, ""War dogs were, in fact, eligible to receive military awards for their service."" Your concluding sentence would need to combine the idea of dog breeds with the idea of dogs receiving military awards.

You could write, ""Even though Dobermans were the most common breed used in WWII, they were not the only breed, and were not the only dogs recognized for their help.""



, The first sentence of your concluding paragraph should restate your thesis. But you should not just restate your thesis. You should also say what the evidence you have provided has added to your thesis.For example, if your original thesis was, ""Dogs used by the United States Marine Corps during WWII played a significant role in the Pacific theater,” then your restated thesis might be something like, “Dogs of all breeds and sizes had an important and honored role to play in WWII, especially in the Pacific theater.”

Note that the second sentence repeats the information provided in your original thesis. It just says it in a new way while also hinting at the information you included in the body of the essay.



, Take one sentence to summarize each main piece of supporting evidence, as presented in your essay's body. You should not introduce any new information in your conclusion. Revisit your most compelling claims and discuss how they all support your main point., Use your last sentence to make a final statement about your topic. This last part of your final paragraph is your opportunity to say what should happen next. You can offer a solution or ask a new question about your topic.Explain how the topic affects the reader
Explain how your narrow topic applies to a broader theme or observation
Call the reader to action or further exploration on the topic
Present new questions that your essay introduced

, Although outlining a paper can help you to develop and organize your ideas, you may need to do some other prewriting exercises to get started.There are many useful prewriting strategies that can help you to generate ideas for your paper.


List all the ideas that come to mind (good or bad) and then look over the list you have made and group similar ideas together. Expand those lists by adding onto the list or by using another prewriting activity. Freewriting. Write nonstop for about 5-10 minutes. Write whatever comes to mind and don’t edit yourself. When you are done, review what you have written and highlight or underline the most useful information. Repeat the freewriting exercise using this information as a starting point. You can repeat this exercise multiple times to continue to refine and develop your ideas. Clustering. Write your subject down on the center of a piece of paper and circle it. Then draw three or more lines extending from the circle. At the end of each of the lines you have drawn, write down a new idea that corresponds to your main idea. Then draw three or more lines from each of those new ideas, and write ideas that corresponds to those ideas. Continue developing your cluster until you feel that you have explored as many connections as you can. Questioning. On a piece of paper, write out “Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?” Space the questions about two or three lines apart so that you can write your answers on these lines. Respond to each questions in as much detail as you can. This exercise will help develop your ideas and identify areas of your topic that you need to learn more about. , Ask yourself what you want to accomplish with your paper. Are you writing this paper in order to persuade, entertain, enlighten, or something else? Just make sure that your purpose is in line with what the assignment asks you to do. Look for key words in the assignment guidelines to help you figure out what your purpose should be. , Think about who will read your paper. Your instructor? classmates? strangers? Identify the needs and expectations of your audience by considering what they do and do not know about your topic. Anticipate their reactions as well. How they might react to the information that you will be sharing with them? Will they be angry, sad, amused, or something else? , Once you have developed your ideas and considered your purpose and audience, you should be ready to write a thesis statement.Effective thesis statements express the main focus of a paper and state an arguable claim. A thesis should not be more than one sentence in length. Make sure your thesis is arguable. Do not state facts or matters of taste. For example, something like ""George Washington was the first president of the United States,"" would not be a good thesis because it states a fact. Likewise, ""Die Hard is a great movie,"" would not work because it expresses a matter of taste.Make sure your thesis provides enough detail. In other words, avoid simply saying that something is ""good"" or ""effective"" and say what specifically makes it ""good"" or ""effective."""
,How to Write an Essay Introduction,
"
Choose a standard alphanumeric structure if you want an easily recognized outline structure.,
Choose a decimal outline structure if you want an easier way to demonstrate how the parts of your essay are related.,
Determine whether to use full sentences or brief phrases in your outline.,
Use parallel structures for outline sections.,
Coordinate section titles and subordinate subsections.,
Divide each heading into two or more parts.",How to Write an Essay Outline2," An alphanumeric outline is the most common, easily recognized outline type, and each subdivision is identified by Roman numerals, capitalized letters, Arabic numerals, and lowercase letters, in that order.Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc,) are used to mark each major heading or section. You will typically have three for an essay outline: one for your introduction, one for your body, and one for your conclusion. Capitalized letters (A,B,C, etc.) mark each primary point within a major section. Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) are used to flesh out primary points. Lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.) are used if further detail is still required. , A decimal outline is similar in structure to an alphanumeric outline, but it only uses a series of numbers to identify each subsection. Some people prefer this structure because it shows how each section contributes to the essay as a whole. A decimal outline begins with “1.0” and other sections will begin with different numbers (2, 3, 4, etc.). Therefore, the first section would read ""1.0,"" the second would read ""2.0,"" and the third would read ""3.0.""
The number after the decimal point changes when new information is presented. For instance, under the ""1.0"" section, you would expect to see ""1.1,"" ""1.2,"" and so on.
Further subsections can be added by adding another decimal, followed by a number that corresponds to the new information. For instance, under the first ""1.1"" section, you might find ""1.1.1,"" ""1.1.2,"" and ""1.1.3"" labels.

, For most outline essays, full sentences will prove more useful because they allow you to provide more thorough information. This is especially true if your outline must be handed in to an instructor.

, For example, if one section of your outline begins with a verb that uses the present tense, then the next section should also begin with a verb that uses present tense. For example, if section I of your outline begins with something like “buying a new book,” then section two should begin with a similarly structured phrase. Something like “reading my new book” would be appropriate whereas “read my new book” would not be appropriate. , Each section title should feature information that is equally important to other section titles and subsections should contain information that is less important than your main section titles. For example, if you are writing a narrative essay about discovering and reading your favorite book and the first section of your outline is titled “Hearing about the book,” then “Checking the book out of the library” and “Reading the book” would be appropriate titles for the other sections of your essay outline. These outline section titles feature information that is as important as the first section title. However, titling a section something like “went to my room and closed the door” would not be appropriate. This line would work better as a subsection under “Reading the book.” , In order to provide adequate information for each section, you will need to divide each section into two or more parts. For example, under the section heading “Hearing about the book,” you might also include subsections called “talking to my best friend,” “listening to the radio on my way to school” and “browsing the internet for new book ideas.” Beneath each of these subsections you would provide additional sub-subsections to break down the information that you will need to include in each of these subsections. "
"
Provide your introduction in the first section of your outline.,
Provide essay body information in the second section of your outline.,
Provide your conclusion information in the last section of your essay outline.",How to Write an Essay Outline3," This section should include an attention getting opening and general information about your topic. The information you provide in your introduction outline should gradually become more specific as you progress through its subsections.The last subsection of your introduction outline should be your thesis statement.Under the first sub-point, write a sentence that introduces the essay topic while also grabbing the reader's attention. A shocking fact or anecdote is a great way to start. The second sub-point should describe the topic, history of the issue, background, or problem being explored. Keep this section brief, but include the information that your readers will need to know in order to understand your paper. The final sub-point should be your thesis statement. State the idea or argument that you plan to discuss in your essay. , The body of your essay should be the largest part of your essay, so you will want to devote at least three subsections to this portion of your outline.


Do not label each point as ""main point."" Instead, directly write out the point being explored.
Under each main point, you should write supporting evidence to back the point up. Give each piece of supporting evidence its own line and sub-section.
If desired, you could also include a sentence that transitions into your next major point at the end of each ""main idea"" section. This is not strictly necessary, though.

, This section should return the reader to the general discussion brought up in the ""introduction"" portion.


Restate your thesis first. Do not copy your original thesis statement word-for-word. Instead, restate the idea, but rephrase it in a new way.
Make a concluding statement. A concluding statement will usually discuss the implications of the thesis, propose solutions to problems addressed in the essay, or explain the importance of the thesis to something outside of the range of the essay.

"
"
Organize your thoughts.,
Write the introduction.,
Write the main paragraphs.,
Write a conclusion.",How to Write an Essay Using the DRAPES Method," Use a sheet of blank, lined notebook paper to write down your thoughts. Each paragraph should have its own section on the paper. Every section except for the introduction should have the main idea of the paragraph and two or three DRAPES components. The introduction section should contain the topic of the essay, the reasons to back it up, and two or three DRAPES as well. There are six parts required to fully utilize the DRAPES, one for each letter:


Use dialogue. Use a professional's opinion. This could be anyone, such as a doctor, your parents, or The President of the United States. You can use either a direct quote (i.e. ""In a recent interview, Doctor Smith said 'Hats help prevent disease!'""), or reword the statement into the sentence (i.e. ""Doctor Smith said that hats are good for people."") If you use a quote, be sure to put it in quotation marks.
Use rhetorical questions. These are questions which can make the reader think, but not one they have to answer, such as ""How could someone refuse a free television?"". The idea is the statement makes the reader think, and if it is at the beginning of an essay, they will probably want to read on. These are good to have in an introductory or conclusion paragraph.
Use analogies. Use similes and metaphors to emphasize your point. A simile compares two things with ""like"" or ""as"", such as ""The water is as clear as glass"". A metaphor says that something is something else, such as ""The mean dog is a demon"". You can also improve your essay by slipping in a few Anecdotes, or short stories that convey your message.

Use a personal experience. Write about something that has happened to you that is related to the essay's main idea. For example, if you are writing about why divorce is terrible, you might say that you had divorced parents, and this made you depressed. The experience should be strong enough to bring the reader to agree with you.
Use examples. Write examples of your position of the essay to make it look good, and use example which make opposing positions look bad, especially in a persuasive essay. Examples and personal experiences often are written together.
Use statistics. Use percentages and ratios to support your position. Remember to tell where these statistics came from. For example: ""According to a recent poll by students at Harvard, hats are 16% more popular than watches on campus."";
, The introduction is the first paragraph. This should do a few things:


Interest the reader. Draw the reader into your writing. The first sentence should be responsible for this. Often, a rhetorical question is the first sentence in an article, because it is so effective in making the reader think and wonder what the topic is exactly about. Another good option is to use a famous quote.
State the topic. Be sure that you give the exact topic or problem that the essay discusses. This should be stated in the second paragraph, after the reader has been drawn in. They are then will never be left guessing what exactly you are writing of.
Give your position. Leave the reader in no doubt of what your position is on a topic. This is particularly important in a persuasive essay.
Contain sentences using the planned DRAPES. You have already planned the DRAPES you will use, so write them down as sentences in the paragraph. Rhetorical Questions and Analogies (or Anecdotes) work particularly well for an introduction.

, These are the paragraphs in between the introduction and conclusion. Each paragraph provides support for one of the reasons you wrote of in the introduction. When writing these paragraphs, remember to:


Stay on topic. Keep all of your information related to the essay's topic. Also, only write about the single reason the paragraph is supporting. You should only write about one idea in each paragraph. Do not write about reason two in paragraph one, or reason one in paragraph two.
Use DRAPES. Again, implement the DRAPES that you planned into sentences in the paragraph. Dialogue, Analogies (or Anecdotes), Personal Experiences, and Statistics are the best components to use in the main paragraphs.

, The conclusion should contain everything the introduction said, except in different words and in a different order. If you used an analogy in the introduction, use a different analogy in the conclusion, if you had a rhetorical question in the first sentence, you may want to restate it as the last sentence, etc.

Bring your points together in way that highlights your thesis.",How to Write an Essay on a Controversial Topic," You’ll want to imagine readers from various viewpoints to make the best argument. This means thinking about the people who are most likely to disagree with you, as well as those on the fence about an issue. By taking their concerns in mind, you’ll help to establish credibility with a wide variety of readers.


Don’t preach to the choir. This is where you imagine only those readers who agree with you. For instance, if you are for labeling GMO (genetically modified organism) products, don’t just talk to organizations or people who already support that. You’ll need to consider farmers who rely on GMO products for their livelihood, corporations with lobbyists in congress, scientists who don’t think GMO products need to be labeled, etc. How can you convince these groups of your position?;
, You can do this in a number of ways, but the most important is bringing up their concerns and explaining how you’ll address them. For instance, if you are trying to convince corporations that GMO labels are necessary, their primary concern is likely to be profit. So, you’ll need to show them how GMO labeling will bring more money to the table., This may seem like a no-brainer, but it can mean losing your reader's faith in your argument very quickly, even if everything else in your argument is true. For instance, if you claim that 99% of foods in supermarkets are genetically-modified, when the statistic is quite lower, your readers may distrust your other facts and claims as well., Plagiarism can simply be a failure to cite your sources or as egregious as copying an entire essay or huge sections of essays. Any plagiarism in an essay seriously erodes the credibility of the author, often to the extent that readers are unwilling to consider anything the writer has said. So, take care with your sources, and keep notes that include your source, on each page, and always write direct quotes with quotation marks to ensure that you don't come back to your notes and forget that you've copied someone else's words., When you’re talking with a friend, if you misuse a word or spell something wrong, they are likely to know what you mean and may not care. However, when writing an essay, grammar is part of the message. This means that the care you take in making sure the essay has no typos or errors demonstrates to your readers your care for the subject. While this may not be factual—you could be a terrible speller and extremely passionate about your subject, but an antagonistic or even just a skeptical audience may see it as a way to discredit your argument., This sentence or set of sentences should not be a cheesy or showy attempt to capture your audience's attention, but rather a way to lay out the stakes or importance of your argument. Don't use something that's completely irrelevant. Rather, introduce the topic, the context, and the stakes within the first couple of sentences. Sometimes you can put a story at the beginning, and if it's immediately relevant and addresses the topic, context, and stakes, then it is fine. If not, it might be best to get to the point., This should include the current debates on the issue, any relevant history, and it's prevalence in the media (whether it's all over the place or barely mentioned can be important). Giving the context helps people unfamiliar with the issue get their bearings, and refreshes it for those more familiar with the issue. It also helps define the importance of the issue and your argument., The thesis is your argument or claim. It is not a statement of fact, but something that is arguable based on the evidence you provide in the essay. Your thesis is not merely an organizing statement, which provides the order of your evidence, but the claim you are making. For instance, the following is an organizing statement: ""GMOs have been studied scientifically, but people continue to worry that they are unsafe."" This is a thesis: ""GMOs should not be labeled, because the scientific community has reached a consensus that they are safe for people to eat."" The idea that GMOs should not be labeled is the arguable part of the thesis., This means making sure each claim you have supports your overall thesis or claim. In the introduction, you should include a summary of your argument as well as an overview of the organization of the essay. This will help your reader know where you're coming from and help you gain their trust. You should start the body of the paper, including your sub-claims as the topic sentences of your paragraphs or sections (can be more than one paragraph)., It can be tempting to write vaguely, as the vague seems to be safer. If you say something like “GMOs are unnatural,” it is vague because it does not define “natural” and it rests on the false assumption that all natural things are automatically better and safer than non-natural products. However, if you include data from respected scientific studies of the effects of GMOs on people (currently there isn’t a lot of such support),you are more likely to convince people of your claims. When including evidence you’ll want to include at least some of the following:If you use scientific data, make sure it comes from a valid, peer-reviewed source. It should have a statistically significant sample size, and preferably should include a review of the literature (or summary of other studies doing similar things).
Specific examples can be useful in making a point in an essay, but beware of relying solely on anecdotal evidence, as it can be misleading. Just because one person has a specific experience does not mean that experience can be generalized.

, Statistics are useful in establishing the importance of a topic, as well as the effects of a phenomenon on groups of people. However, statistics can be misleading, and it is important to acquire your statistics from reliable sources. You have to address context, the sample size, etc, to determine if a statistic is useful and straightforward.Remember that statistical correlation does not equal causation (there are many spurious correlations, or statistical coincidences)., When convincing an audience, it is incredibly important to use the most credible sources. If a source is known for factual errors and bias, then it is probably not the best source to use to convince a skeptical audience. When looking for a good source, consider the following:How recent is it? Is a scientific paper from 1893 still valid? It may be so, but you’ll want to know whether more recent scientists cite it, and if there are any scientists since then who have refuted it.
Is it scholarly? While it may not be essential to use solely academic sources for a paper, they can add a lot of credibility to your work. This is because most scholarly papers go through an extensive peer-review process before being published. The same is not true for very many other sources, including the news, most magazines, and many blogs. That doesn’t mean those sources aren’t credible, but that they are often processed very quickly (especially online) and are more prone to factual errors and bias.
What sources does the source use? Do they use scholarly or other credible sources? Or do they cite personal blogs, or contain no citations at all?
What is the purpose of the piece? Is it an op-ed, the purpose of which is to express an opinion, not necessarily to provide evidence for that opinion.
Is the source biased? What biases does it have? It is important to know these before using it in a paper.

, Choose a citation style such as MLA or Chicago. Then follow that form throughout. You should include an in-text citation each time you quote, summarize, or paraphrase a source. Be consistent in your citations. Some people think that using sources takes away from their originality or their voice in a paper. On the contrary, it helps to distinguish your voice from the voices of others, and helps to build your credibility. Besides, failing to cite your sources constitutes plagiarism., In order to convey your argument to your audience, you need to analyze your evidence. This means breaking down your evidence into its component parts and explaining the purpose of those parts to your audience. Sometimes this will mean analyzing your sources for accuracy, their use of sources, and their rhetoric., Good organization is part of your argument. If you hide your most important point in a tangential paragraph, you’re suggesting to the reader that it is not that important. Good organization tells the reader what you want to do, how you intend to do it, and why it’s important. The following organizational structures are often useful for argumentative papers about controversial topics:


A cause and effect structure can help show the ways in which your preferred option is preferable to other options because of a cause or an effect of that option. For instance, you can show how labeling GMOs makes people feel safer about their food. The feeling of safety would be an effect of labeling. But you would have to show how this effect outweighs any negative effects caused by such labeling.
A compare and contrast essay is often the most effective in a persuasive essay, as it shows the similarities and differences among the different options your presenting, and can highlight why your view is preferable to others. You can compare and contrast in a point-by-point way or you can present your argument and then address the counterargument in separate parts of the paper.

, Logical fallacies occur when you use a line of reasoning that does not make sense. Logical fallacies weaken your argument, and if your audience recognizes them, they will not be likely to take your argument seriously. Here are some examples of common logical fallacies:Hasty generalization is where you assume because a thing is true in a certain context, it must be true in a lot of other circumstances. For instance, if you say, “I got sick after eating GMO corn; therefore, GMO corn makes people sick,” then you are making a hasty generalization. You would need first to establish that it was the corn that made you sick, and that other people get sick not just from that particular brand of GMO corn, but from all GMO corn to prove your statement.
A red herring is something that distracts from an argument. Xenophobia is often such a red herring, as it stirs people up and causes them to blame certain groups of people for something like job loss (which is demonstrably false),while distracting them from the actual evidence in the case such as which factors in our economy actually lead to job loss.
A straw man is a false and easily disproven argument used to make another argument look good.
The either/or fallacy occurs when someone insists that there are only two options for a given situation, when in actuality there are many.
The slippery slope fallacy occurs when someone believes that because one thing happened, then it is inevitable that other (often negative) effects will follow.

, This includes the ad hominem fallacy, some appeals to emotion, tu quoque, personal incredulity, among others. These types of fallacies immediately alienate many potential readers, as they often cast blame (often wrongly), grossly mischaracterized arguments, people, and ideas, and sometimes even accuse the reader. For an explanation of these fallacies, see below:Ad Hominem is where you attack a person rather than their argument. For instance, if you say “Scientists are haughty know-it-alls—they don’t really know anything about GMOs,” you are attacking the scientists’ character rather than addressing their arguments about GMOs.
Appeals to emotion that turn on invoking people's anger, but do not actually address the situation are fallacies that are aggressive and not particularly convincing to other parties.
Tu quoque is where you turn the criticism back on the person making the criticism rather than addressing their argument. Children often turn to this when they are caught in the act of doing something wrong like coloring on the walls: ""But you said I could use my crayons.""
Personal incredulity is where you don't believe a fact or argument simply because you don't understand it or it seems ""unnatural"" or somehow wrong to you based on a gut feeling. Many people used this fallacy to fight marriage equality by implying that their own aversion to/lack of understanding of same-sex relations justified outlawing it.

, In order to make a good argument, you must be willing to research other views. This will help you construct your counterarguments, as well as help you understand the audience you’re writing for. This does not mean simply looking for things you can easily disprove (this is the straw man fallacy), but finding out how the opposing argument is framed and why people find that argument persuasive., If you go into a project believing you are right and that nothing can sway your opinion, it will be difficult to write a fair and balanced paper. If you can’t even read the other sides’ views with an open mind, you are unlikely to be able to convince them of your point. You may be surprised by what you find in your research. Allow yourself to be surprised.Confirmation bias is where you look only for evidence that confirms your views.Backfire effect is when you encounter evidence that calls into question deeply held beliefs and that makes you believe what you already believe all the stronger., In order to make a convincing case with a controversial paper, you must be able to state the opposing views fairly. You do this by accurately summarizing their views, acknowledging any valid points they make (and incorporating those points into your own argument as possible), and addressing their underlying concerns., Once you’ve stated their views, it’s important to consider your argument in light of those views. It doesn’t mean you have to change your view, just that the reassertion of your point must take the alternate views into consideration in order to be convincing.

, If you've organized your paper in a way that goes back and forth between argument and counterargument, you'll want to briefly summarize the counterarguments. For instance, you could say, ""Some people have claimed that GMOs should be labeled because they are harmful to people's health, that people have a right to know what's in their food, and that they are also dangerous for the environment."" If you've organized your paper, where your counterarguments all fall immediately before the conclusion, you'll want to be even briefer. You could say, ""These arguments against GMOs fail to prove their scientific claims, and do not overcome the scientific and economic realities of attempting to label these foods."", This is especially effective in papers that end with a call to action. For instance, you can say, ""I understand that it may feel scary or strange to eat a fruit or vegetable whose genes have been manipulated, but based on scientific consensus, there is little evidence to suggest that they are actually dangerous to people."" By appealing directly to your reader, and attempting to bridge the gap between you and the skeptics of your audience, you will make a more convincing argument., Do not simply restate the thesis. In a short paper, especially, this will seem repetitive and unconvincing. Rather talk about how they evidence you've brought up should lead your reader to your point. You could say something like, ""As you can see from this evidence, the case against GMOs doesn't stand the test of science or economics."""

Review the assignment.,
Ask questions.,
Research your topic.,
Read efficiently.,
Take good notes.,
Organize your materials.,
Prepare your work area.",How to Write an Essay on Sociology1," The first thing you want to do is choose a topic. Sometimes your professor will explicitly assign a topic and other times you will be given a list of possible topics. If you are in an upper-level class, the assignment might be more broad, and you will need to come up with your own subject for the essay. Whatever the case, start thinking about your topic right away. Remember that a good sociology paper starts with an important sociological question. Your first step in writing a good essay is to figure out which question you are going to answer.;
, If your professor did not assign a specific topic, make sure to get approval before you start researching the subject you have chosen. Visit your professor during her office hours to discuss the essay and ask questions. For example, do you know how long the paper should be? Do you know how many sources you need to cite? Make sure you are clear on guidelines before starting your essay.If you are unable to attend office hours, you can ask your professor questions via e-mail. Write this e-mail as if it is business. Be professional, courteous, and clear.

, To write a sociology essay, you will need to collect evidence. All sociological arguments must be supported by facts and documentation. You will likely need to visit the library and do some online research, too. Ask your professor for suggestions if you do not know where to find sources. One type of sociological data is quantitative. These statistics are based on sources such as surveys and censuses. These are generally numbers. An example of quantitative data could be: 9,326 people lived in Urbantown in 1972.
The other type of data you need is qualitative. This research is less concrete, and is based on sources such as interviews and the researcher's own impressions. An example of qualitative data is: ""The number of people living in Urbantown in 1972 likely was much lower because the major industry in town had closed and there were also severe racial tensions"".

, In a sociology course, you will be asked to read a lot of information. It's helpful to have a system to make sure that you can read the material quickly, while retaining the important points. As you read the sources for your paper, make sure you are reading for specific information. Look for examples that relate to your thesis, and make note of them.Highlight important information. Not only will this make it easier to find that specific information later, but the act of highlighting itself will help embed the information into your brain.
Don't be afraid to skim over parts of books or articles that either do not relate to your paper topic or are not helpful.

, You want your notes to be detailed, but not so lengthy that they are not easy to skim. Just note the most important piece of information, with a reminder of where you found that information. You can go back and expand later, but when you are taking notes, it is important to be efficient.


Remember that sociology is largely about concepts. For example, you might need to explain the relationship between class and power in contemporary society. Therefore, your notes will be different from your chemistry notes, since you are memorizing ideas, not formulas or methods. In your notes, make sure that you have been thorough enough that you will understand the concept when you review your notes.

, When you have completed your research, make sure you have it organized in a way that will help you to write efficiently. As you sit down to write, make sure that you have all of your books, printouts, and notes nearby. This is also a great time to make sure you have anything else you need--computer, pencils, and the assignment guidelines.

, Make sure that you have plenty of room to work. You might need to spread out your materials in order to be able to view multiple documents at once. You'll also want to make sure that you have a chair with good back support, and that the room is a comfortable temperature for you.Experiment with the noise level in your writing space. Some people work well with music playing, while others work best in total silence. Figure out the right atmosphere for you.

Start strong.,
Give a message as the body of your essay.,
Don't be harsh.,
Make your purpose behind the writing to expand upon the effects of bullying in the short term, as well as the long term and the ways through which it could be tackled or gotten over.

,
Mention the bullies.,
Empathize and suggest actions in your conclusion.",How to Write an Essay About the Effects of Bullying at University," Start with your introduction explaining how you feel bullying is as a form of torture. Bullying includes fierce acts so that people feel threatened and depressed when they are bullied. Mention all the painful adjectives that express the feelings of the victims of bullying. When you start with a paragraph expressing with clarity how it impacts someone, the reader gets prepared to know more and hopefully take some action against it.;
, Make the essay engaging in the following passage by including the experience of real time victims of bullying. Relate other parts of their lives and how other areas are affected/influenced because of the sadness, shame, feeling self-conscious and being ridiculed. You could use the example of their studies, personal growth, happiness quotient, interaction, enthusiasm and participation in other activities that get affected with most or all involved students.

, Whether you are writing the essay to merely express your feelings or to evoke some feelings in the readers, try not to judge or condemn the bullies as being evil, bad people or any such harsh comments. At one point or the other, each one of us has troubled someone around us. Even if you have not done this to anyone, you may have bullies read it too and they might stop bullying after reading it.

,, Write a passage of 3 to 4 sentences about the motives of bullies who do it. You could mention various emotional pleasures, feeling of power, control and conquest they might get to do it. Also, you could indirectly leave a question for them by suggesting that you are wondering about how they might have benefited by killing their juniors', classmate's or seniors' joy.

, While writing about a topic such as this where someone is suffering. Keep the language empathetic so the victims don't feel that they are alone and all others are lucky enough to escape it. Suggest ways how it could be tackled like sharing experiences with others, counseling, direct communication with the bullies, getting stronger themselves, finding humor, connecting with other victims, etc. You will have a very good essay with all these and more that you would want to add spontaneously.

Create a title for the essay.",How to Write an MCAS Essay in Five Hours," As a whole, the MCAS will test you on three subjects: English Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science and Technology/Engineering. During your English Language Arts tests, you will need to respond to a writing prompt with a written composition, or an essay. You will be required to write a five paragraph essay for the long composition section of the ELA test, using specific examples from a text or several texts to support your thesis.Your MCAS essay should be free of any grammatical or spelling errors and present fully developed ideas in the five paragraph format.;
, The English Language Arts MCAS are scored based on two categories: Topic/Idea development and Standard English conventions. Your essay will be graded within these two categories with a numerical score. The Topic/Idea development section is rated from a high 6 to a low 1, and the Standard English conventions section is rated from a high 4 to a low 1.To achieve a high 6 in the Topic/Idea development category, you will need to demonstrate rich topic/idea development, careful and subtle organization, and use language effectively in your essay. You will earn a low 1 if your essay has very little topic/idea development, organization or details, and you demonstrate very little awareness of your audience or of the task asked of you in the essay prompt.
To achieve a high 4 in the Standard English conventions category, you will need to demonstrate control of sentence structure, grammar and usage. Your essay should also be long enough to show you have a strong grasp of complex sentence structure and standard English conventions. You will earn a low 1 if your essay contain errors that interfere with clear communication and understanding in a serious way, and you have very little control of sentence structure, grammar, and usage.
Detailed information on the scoring guides for each category can be found at http://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/student/2014/question.aspx?GradeID=10&SubjectCode=ela&QuestionID=33209#.

, For the MCAS essay, you will be given a writing prompt that will introduce and define a significant literary technique, motif, or theme. You could be asked to write about a technique like “irony”, a motif like “hero” or a theme like “transformation”. You will then need to select one literary work you have read in class or outside of class and write a composition that describes how the literary technique, motif, or theme is used in that work.You may receive a prompt that focuses on the use of a technique in writing, for example: “Select a work of literature you have read in or out of school in which there is a difference between what is expected and what actually happens. In a well-developed composition, explain the situation and tell why it is important to the work you have chosen.”
You may receive a prompt that focuses on the use of a motif in writing, for example: “From a work of literature you have read in or out of school, select a character that, in your opinion, is heroic. In a well-developed composition, identify that character and explain why he or she is heroic.”
You may receive a prompt that focuses on the use of theme in writing, for example: “In many literary works, the main character goes through some experience that causes him or her to gain insight and change the way he or she is living. The moment of insight is called an epiphany. From a work of literature you have read in or out of school, select one main character who experiences an epiphany and explain how it changes his or her life.”
A complete list of previous essay prompts for the MCAS essay can be found at http://www.duxbury.k12.ma.us/Page/4853.

, The MCAS website has essay samples from previous years for each numerical score for both of the scoring categories. Take a moment to look at the essays that earned the highest scores in Topic/Idea development and in Standard English conventions to get a sense of what the evaluators will be looking for.Each sample essay also contains evaluator comments that explain why the essay received a high score or a low score. For example, an essay that received the highest score, 6, in Topic/Idea development opens with a rich first sentence that frames the rest of the essay, which is on Cheryl Strayed’s autobiographical novel Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail. The writer uses the opening analysis of the character’s internal and external battles to discuss how the character develops self awareness and emotional growth in the course of the novel. The writer returns to these themes throughout the five paragraph essay and uses strong examples from the text to support her ideas. The evaluator noted there is “careful selection and development of details” as well as “ language that supports meaning.”In comparison, an essay that received the lowest score, 1, in Topic/Idea development, is only four lines long and provides a very brief response that is minimal but on topic. However, the writer does not demonstrate any awareness of what the essay prompt is asking him to discuss in his essay and he does not present any rich detail, strong development of ideas, or meaningful analysis of the text., Before you start your rough draft, you should analyze the writing prompt to ensure you understand the prompt. Determine if the prompt focuses on a literary technique, motif, or theme., You will then need to determine which literary work you are going to use in your essay. Novels, autobiographies and short stories are all possible literary works you can use as source material.Often, your MCAS essay will be most effective if you chose one literary work that you have read recently and remember well. You will need to recount the plot and characters of the literary work, as well as any techniques, motifs, or themes used in the work. It will help if you choose a work that you are confident you can recall in detail.

, A thesis statement will convey to your reader the points or arguments you are going to make in your paper. It acts a road map for your paper and should answer the question, “What is this paper about?” It should take a stand and announce your position towards the topic.To save time, you can start with a rough thesis statement and then adjust your thesis statement once you are done your rough draft. Often, you can get a better sense of your thesis statement and the overall goal of the essay once you have finished a rough draft.
If we use the high scoring essay on Cheryl Strayed as an example, the thesis statement appears at the end of the first paragraph: “Written through the perspective of author Cheryl Strayed, Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Coast Trail illustrates Strayed’s own personal battle through the story of a classic life interrupted, which forces her to contemplate the polar extremes of what one woman can face.”, Make a rough outline of your five paragraph essay that will act as a guide for your essay. This will also help you save time when you start to write the essay, as you will have a good sense of the structure of the essay and can focus on writing the content based on your outline. Try to complete your outline and create your thesis statement within one hour.


Introduction: Your beginning paragraph should contain an engaging first sentence and your thesis statement. Some writers find it easier to write create a temporary introduction and revise it once they are finished with the essay. This will ensure the introduction is cohesive with the rest of the essay.
Body paragraph 1-3: Each paragraph should discuss one major point of your thesis, with at least one supporting example.
Conclusion: This paragraph should summarize your main argument and restate your thesis. You may also want to include last thoughts around the essay question.

, There are several possible hooks you can use in your essay to draw your reader in. Take 30 minutes to create an introduction and a hook opening sentence. If you get stuck on your introduction, it may help to place your thesis statement at the end of the paragraph and come back to your introduction once you are finished the rest of your essay.An interesting or surprising example: This could be a personal experience or a key moment in the literary work you are discussing in your essay.
A provocative quotation: This could be from the literary work you are using for your essay or one that feels relevant to your topic.
A vivid anecdote: An anecdote is a very short story that carries moral or symbolic weight. Think of an anecdote that might be a poetic or powerful way to start your essay.
A thought provoking question: Create a question that will get your reader thinking and engaged in your topic.

, Focus on fleshing out each paragraph with at least one example of your main point. Sign-post each paragraph by beginning with a strong argumentative point that links to a supporting example of your main point. Don't worry too much about perfecting each paragraph and avoid long winded sentences. You are going to revise these paragraphs when you do your final draft so for now, focus on getting down your thoughts and ideas. Take no more than three and a half hours to complete your body paragraph. If you use the Cheryl Strayed high scoring essay as an example:Body paragraph 1: Introduce the literary work and provide a brief, engaging synopsis of the book up to the turning point for the main character. For example, the death of Strayed’s mother from cancer and the breaking up of her family leads Strayed to fill her sense of loneliness and depression with a solo journey on the Pacific Coast Trail.
Body paragraph 2: Discuss how the literary work responds to the essay prompt and give a detailed analysis of the work based on the prompt. In the Strayed essay, the writer uses Strayed’s physical struggles on the gruelling Pacific Coast Trail to discuss the internal battle Strayed is also dealing with as she processes her grief and depression.
Body paragraph 3: Look at how a climax or pivotal moment to the literary work highlights the technique, motif, or theme noted in the essay prompt. In the Strayed essay, the writer uses the themes of nature and fate in the novel to discuss how the main character comes to terms with her external and internal struggles.

, Make your conclusion clear and to the point. Avoid introducing new ideas or arguments in your conclusion. Instead, restate your thesis and your main points.


For example, you may restate your thesis so that is connects to the larger themes of your essay. The essay on Cheryl Strayed’s Wild ends with this restatement: “Cheryl Strayed’s battle did indeed begin in the mind, but unfolded to become an expedition that illustrated her own hardiness in conquering not only her internal conflict but also the unknown situations of fate and nature.”, Take the last half hour to one hour to read through your rough draft to check if it flows from sentence to sentence and from paragraph to paragraph. Edit any wordy or confusing sentence and adjust your language so it is easy to understand. You should also go through your rough draft with the scoring guidelines provided by MCAS in mind.


Remember the guidelines for a high score in Topic/Idea development: demonstrate rich topic/idea development, careful and subtle organization, and use language effectively in your essay. You should also keep in mind the high score for Standard English conventions: demonstrate control of sentence structure, grammar and usage, as well as a strong grasp of complex sentence structure and standard English conventions.

, You may want to read your essay backwards to check for any spelling issues, as you will only be focusing on the words themselves, rather than the meaning of the sentences.


Always make sure you use proper grammar and spelling in your essay, as you will be deducted marks in the Standard English conventions category if you miss any misspelled words or grammatical errors.

, It can be easier to create a title for your essay once you have finished it. You could use a quotation from the essay, a phrase or term you refer back to often in the essay, or a summary of your main point.


For example, your essay on Cheryl Strayed’s Wild could be: “A Wild Woman’s Self Discovery” or “A Classic Life Interrupted”.

If possible, type up your essay draft on the computer so you can revise it easily and efficiently.If you do handwrite the essay, make sure you double space it so you can add in edits or adjustments when you revise it.;
, To stay focused on your essay, make sure you reduce any distractions around you. Turn off your phone and your wifi connection, if you don't need the internet for essay research. Close the door to your room or choose a quiet spot in the library to write. Having less distractions will ensure you get the essay done efficiently and effectively.


If you are writing the essay at home, let others around you know that you are working and not to be disturbed. If it is noisy around you, put on headphones to block the noise out so you can focus on the essay.

, Start by identifying the topic, subject, or main focus of the essay. If there is a prompt or question for the essay, read it carefully to ensure you understand it. Read the prompt or question out loud. Underline or highlight any keywords in the prompt to ensure you understand the topic.For example, if the prompt is, “Explain the consequences of Mao’s Great Leap Forward campaign,” you may then focus on identifying the consequences of Mao’s Great Leap Forward campaign and analyze how it affected China in your essay.

, There are three main types of essays: analytical, expository, and argumentative. Determining which type of essay you are writing will help you better tailor your essay to the topic. It will also give you direction and focus when you sit down to write.An analytical essay breaks down a topic or concept to better examine and understand it. For example, an analytical essay prompt might be, “What is the source of the violence and unrest in Shakespeare’s King Lear?”
An expository essay teaches or illuminates a point. For example, an expository essay prompt might be, “Explain the consequences of Mao’s Great Leap Forward campaign.”
An argumentative essay will make a claim or back up an opinion to change other people’s point of view. For example, an argumentative essay prompt might be, “Do you think Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream is a comedy, a tragedy, or a combination of both? Why?”

, Once you have a clear topic for the essay, do a quick brainstorm to generate ideas for the essay. Brainstorming will help you get your ideas down and feel more organized going into the writing of the essay. Write the topic in the center of your paper or on a new document on your computer. Then, start writing ideas that are triggered by the topic. Cluster ideas around the topic as you generate them.You can also draw lines from the topic to your ideas. Try to list three to five ideas that you can use in your essay. Think about examples that work with the topic or that correspond with the topic.
You may need to review your sources to help you get ideas for the topic. Have the sources, such as online scholarly articles or textbooks, close by so you can review them during your brainstorm.

, Create a short outline for the essay so you are organized during the writing process and more efficient with your time. Start by writing the topic on the top of the page. Then, make a space that says “Introduction.” Underneath that, quickly note how many paragraphs you plan to have in the body of the essay. Finish with a space that says “Conclusion.”The standard rule is to have one introduction paragraph, at least three body paragraphs, or three supporting points for your thesis statement, and one conclusion paragraph. This makes a five paragraph essay.
However, many teachers will accept essays that are longer than five paragraphs and will allow you to have many body paragraphs in your essay. Speak to your instructor about their expectations on the structure of the essay so you can follow their guidelines.

, Once you have your outline, include a brief one to two sentence summary of what you plan to discuss in each section. Keep the summaries short and to the point. You can use bullet points or complete sentences.


Note what you will include in your introduction, such as a strong opening line, a thesis statement, and a discussion of the main points of your essay.
Briefly note the claim or focus of each body paragraph. Include a note on sources or quotes you will use in each body paragraph to support your claim.
Have a brief summary of what will be in your conclusion section, such as a rephrasing of your thesis statement and a strong final line.

, Your thesis statement will act as the guide or map for your essay. The thesis statement responds directly to the prompt of the essay and should be no longer than one sentence. Creating a strong thesis statement up front will help you save time as you write the essay. A strong thesis statement can make the essay writing process more efficient.


Your thesis statement should tell the reader the point of your essay. It will consist of two parts. The first part will state the topic and the second part will state the point of your essay.
For example, if your topic is “Do you think Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream is a comedy, a tragedy, or a combination of both? Why?”, your thesis statement might be, “Though there are elements of tragedy in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the structure, themes, and staging of the play fall into the genre of comedy.”

, As you write your body paragraphs, break them down by thinking about them as mini-essays. Each body paragraph should be at least three to five sentences and should be relevant to your thesis statement. Follow this structure for each body paragraph: claim, evidence, and analysis.In each body paragraph, start with an introductory sentence that explains what the paragraph is going to be about, or your claim. Then, use quotes from your sources as evidence to support the main idea of the paragraph. Finish by responding to the quote and analyzing how it supports your idea.
Make sure you end each body paragraph by answering the question, “What does this paragraph have to do with my thesis?” This will help to ensure you stay on track as you transition from paragraph to paragraph. It also keeps every body paragraph relevant to the overall idea of the essay.

, Your conclusion should include your final thoughts on the topic. It should also reword your thesis statement in a creative way. Do not add new information to your essay in the conclusion, as this will look sloppy and confusing. Instead, have three to five sentences that include your final thoughts on the topic.For example, you may reword your thesis statement as, “While there are tragic moments in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the structure, themes, and staging of the play fit within the genre of comedy.”

, Rather than try to work through the introduction cold at the beginning of the essay writing process, leave it to last. This way, you do not waste time getting stuck on the introduction and complete the essay more efficiently. Doing the introduction at the end of your essay usually makes for a stronger essay overall. It is often easier to do the introduction after you have examined and explored your thoughts in the body paragraphs.Your introduction should include your thesis statement. You may find yourself editing your thesis statement when you complete your introduction. This is to be expected, as some of your wording in the thesis statement may need to be sharpened or adjusted.

, Refer back to your outline and make sure your body paragraphs hit all of your supporting points. Notice if your thesis statement is present in your introduction and in your conclusion. Check that each paragraph develops a claim with supporting evidence and relates back to your thesis statement.Confirm that each of your body paragraphs includes quotes from the source text to support your claims. You should also cite your sources properly in your essay, based on whether your instructor wants APA or MLA style.

, Take the time to review the essay for flow and organization. Note if the transitions between each paragraph are clear and effective. Check that your sentences make sense and are easy to read. Remove any paragraphs that do not fit or rearrange them so they flow better.


You should also revise any sentences that sound awkward or long-winded. Break sentences up into several sentences if they are too long.
If you are revising a handwritten essay, only cross out a word or phrase once and write neatly above it. Do not write large marks or dark scribbles on the essay, as this will make it harder to read.

, You should also check that all your spelling, grammar, and punctuation is correct in the essay. Do this by reading the essay backwards so you can check each word to ensure it is spelled correctly. Always proofread your essay before you turn it in.


Reading the essay out loud can also help you catch any spelling, grammar, or punctuation mistakes.
If you are writing the essay in class, leave at least five to ten minutes to proofread the essay carefully and thoughtfully before you turn it in.

Make an outline.,
Write your introduction and conclusion.,
Work on your body paragraphs.,
Cite your sources.",How to Write an Essay on Sociology2," The thesis, or argument, is the most important part of your paper. It tells your reader exactly what you are writing about, and lets them know the point of your paper. Without a strong thesis, the rest of your paper will be vague and general. Write your thesis before you structure the rest of your essay.You can use several methods to come up with a thesis statement. For example, you can start by asking a series of questions. Once you find a good one, turn it into a declarative statement.
Another method is to use ""free association"". Write down all of the terms that come to mind when you think of your topic. An idea for a thesis might jump out at you.
Your thesis must have two key parts: first, it must be debatable. This means that your argument is not a basic statement of facts, but that it is open for critical debate. Second, your thesis must be tightly focused enough that it can be clearly supported with evidence.For example, perhaps you have been assigned an essay about gender. Your thesis statement could be something like this: ""Gender is essentially a social construct, particularly during the early to mid-twentieth century. There are actually much fewer biological differences between men and women than previously thought; the divide between the sexes has actually been created by society.""

, After you construct your thesis, outline the rest of your paper. An outline is key for creating an organized and structured essay. Your outline should be thorough, indicating the topic for each paragraph (or section, if this is a longer paper). Your outline should also include references to your sources.When writing your outline, make sure that all of the parts of your essay support your thesis. If the information is not directly related to your thesis, you don't need it.
For example, if you have been assigned an essay about racial segregation in Chicago, you do not need to spend time discussing sexism in the same city.
If you are writing a brief essay about race, your outline could indicate that you will discuss the historical precedents, the quantitative date, the scholarly interpretations, and trends for the future.
Don't worry if your outline takes a while. Once you have a sturdy outline, the rest of the writing progress will be much more efficient.

, For many people, getting started is the hardest part of writing. Tackle your introductory paragraph first; you'll feel much better once it is out of the way. Make sure it is tightly focused and introduces your thesis statement.Try using a specific example in your introduction. In the example essay of racial segregation in Chicago, you might include a story about a young child who was not allowed to attend the school nearest her house.
It is useful to write the conclusion before you write the body of your essay. This will help you to stay on track and make sure that your essay clearly relates to the conclusion you are making.

, Each body paragraph should have a main point and several supporting statements. Make sure that you use your data to support the main points in each paragraph. It is important to include clear transitions between each paragraph so that your paper flows nicely.For example, if you are writing an essay about ageism in America, one of the topic sentences for a body paragraph might be, ""Ageism is a prejudice that makes it difficult for older citizens to get hired for certain jobs, even if they are the most qualified.""

, Typically, your professor will require you to cite your sources in using the American Sociological Society system. This method requires in-text citations using parenthetical documentation. The important information to include is the author, title, and date.An ASA citation could look like this: ""The results gathered by Davis (1982: 78) demonstrate that...Make sure to check with your professor to ensure that you are supposed to use ASA style. Then familiarize yourself with the rules of this documentation system.

Use spell check.,
Edit carefully.,
Read it out loud.,
Ask a friend to edit your essay.,
Review the guidelines.",How to Write an Essay on Sociology3," You don't want your important intellectual findings to be unclear because you misspelled a few words in your introductory paragraph. Make sure to utilize spell check, and correct any errors that are highlighted. It is also a good idea to make sure that your software is also set to check grammar and style. Use spell check, but do not overly rely on it. Remember, you know what your paper is supposed to say--your computer is not familiar with the points you are making.

, In addition to spelling and grammar, you need to edit for content. Read a draft of your paper, and make sure that your points are all clear and concise. This is also a great time to make sure that your writing flows smoothly., During the editing process, it can be very helpful to read your paper out loud. This can help you catch errors that you might have skimmed over during your first read. Reading out loud can be very helpful in catching any awkward phrases., A second set of eyes is always helpful during the writing process. Recruit a classmate, family member or friend and ask them to look over your paper. Remember, choose someone you trust to be both thorough and honest., Go back one more time and make sure that you have fulfilled all of the requirements. Have you numbered your pages? Used the required font size? All of these things are important. Double-check everything. Then you can breathe easily once you have turned in your paper."

Start with the body of the essay.,
Write the conclusion.,
Finish your first draft by writing the introduction.,
Write a second draft.,
Ask someone to proof read your essay.,
Proof read the essay on your own.,
Read the essay backwards.,
Type your final draft.",How to Write an Essay About a Famous Person in History," If your teacher has provided a handout of what they want from you, then read this handout very carefully. It probably includes all of the information you will need to get a good grade on your essay. If your teacher only told you about the essay assignment in class, hopefully you have taken notes on what you should be doing. If you didn’t take notes, go back to your teacher and politely ask them questions about the assignment to get all the instructions you need.


Should you choose your person or has one been assigned?
Does your teacher want you to use a citation style? For example, they may want you to use the MLA format or maybe they want you to use Chicago Style. If your teacher says they don't care, then there's nothing to worry about, but make sure that you include a “References” page at the end of your essay. On this page, you should include all of the different websites, books, and/or magazines that you used to write the essay.
Is there a word limit? Does your teacher require a specific font or font size? Should you double-space the essay? If you're not sure, ask you teacher.;
, If you are able to choose who you write about, then think about it carefully. Don’t just pick the first person that comes to mind. Choose someone that is interesting to you personally. This will make learning about this person and writing your essay more fun.Try to think about the things you know the person has done. Did they live a pretty normal life, but did one really cool thing? A person who was more or less “normal” could be harder to write about if your teacher wants a ten page essay. For example, although Adolf Hitler was not in any way an admirable human being, writing a historical essay about his life would be pretty easy because he did a lot of different things.
On the other hand, if there is a historical figure you are really interested in, you will have a good time researching and writing about your person whether they led very busy lives or not. The most important thing is to choose someone you find fascinating.

, Sometimes it can be difficult to know how to get started on an essay. Writing an essay outline will help get you started and will also help you have a clear idea about what information you want to include.In your outline, write down all of the questions you want to answer about your person. If your teacher told you what questions to answer, then use those. If your teacher did not, then this is up to you. Make sure you talk about when and where they were born, whether they had a good childhood or not, what makes them special and interesting, what they accomplished (whether good or bad), and why you find them interesting.
Try to write your outline so that the questions you want to answer are in the same order that they will be in in the paper. For example, don't put questions about how they died before the questions about where they were born and who their parents were.

, Now that you have outlined your essay, you can start finding out all the information you need to know to write your paper. This is called research. Start by searching the internet for information about your person. Don’t forget to search your school library for information.Write down anything you find interesting and want to include. At the same time that you do this, write down the source of that information. For example, the name and author of the book or the address of the website.
If you are having a hard time finding information about your person in the library, ask the librarian to help you search. They’re there to help you, and may have ways of finding information that you hadn’t thought of. Plus, if you find the information through the library, there is a better chance that you will find high quality information.
Make sure that you understand what is considered an acceptable source of information by your teacher. For example, some teachers may consider it OK to use websites such as Wikipedia, while other teachers may not. If you’re not sure, just ask them.

, Ask your teacher if they have an example essays that you can look through. Many teachers keep one or two really good essays written by past students.Don’t plagiarize though! If you copy someone else's work without giving them credit for their work, this is called plagiarism. If you do find something interesting that you want to include, be sure to give credit to that person. Plagiarism is a big deal, so it’s best to learn early that it isn’t worth the risk.

, In most cases, essays will be made up of three parts: the introduction, the body, and the conclusion. In the introduction you will introduce your person, and talk briefly about what you will be writing about. It's hard to write the introduction well if you haven’t written the body yet. This is because the introduction is suppose to be a preview of what’s in the rest of the essay. It will be easy to write the introduction if you first write the body.In the body, you will write about all of the information that you found when you were researching. It is the part of the paper where you answer any and all questions you have come up with.
Your essay will be more clear if you separate different parts of this person’s life into paragraphs. For example, the first paragraph might start out by explaining when, where, and to whom this person was born. In this paragraph you might talk about what kind of childhood this person had, and whether they had any big experiences that made them into the person they were.
In later paragraphs, you can talk about what the person did that made them famous. You might also want to include interesting things that you found about this person’s personal life. For example, whether or not they got married or whether or not they suffered from any mental disorders.

, The conclusion of the essay is where you will summarize everything you have written about this person in the body. In the conclusion you will not bring up anything new about the person. If you find yourself trying to include something new, then go back and find a place to include this in the body of the paper.Don't write more than one or two paragraphs for your conclusion. It should simply go over what you have written in the body about who this person was and why they were interesting and important.
For example, you might write, “In summary, Martin Luther King Jr. was a driven man who, although his life was tragically cut short, accomplished amazing things in his life. Though his upbringing presented many challenges, he went on to become a great man who wasn’t afraid to stand up for what he believed in.”
In the next paragraph, you can summarize what you wrote about why you find him so interesting. For example, “This great man inspires me every time I read about him. I hope that I too can stand up for the right thing if I am ever in a position to do so, even if it is difficult or scary to do so.”

, Now that you have written the body and conclusion of the paper, you will have no problem writing the introduction. In this section, introduce the person you are writing about, and state what they were most famous for. Then, in a few sentences, outline what you will be talking about.For example, you can say, “In this essay, I will be discussing a man that nearly everyone has heard of. He was a minister who became famous during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s for standing up for the rights of not only African Americans, but for all human beings.”
After you introduce your person, you will state what you will be telling your reader about this person. For example, “In this essay, Martin Luther King Jr.’s life will be discussed beginning with his birth in Georgia, to his travels to Germany where he officially began to be known as ‘Martin,’ to his untimely death in 1968.”
Don’t give everything away in the introduction. Think of the introduction like a movie preview. You want to give enough information to get the reader interested, but not so much information that they will already know everything else written in the essay before they read it.

, What you have written now is considered the “first draft” or “rough draft.” In the first draft there is no reason to worry about spelling, grammar, or sentence structure. The idea is simply to get all of the things you want to say down on paper. After you have finished the first draft, you can begin on the second draft.


Don’t expect the second draft to come out perfectly either. The purpose of the second draft is to fix up any major spelling mistakes or grammar errors, and to see how you feel about the information you’ve written now that it’s all out there.
A second draft is what you will give to anyone who has offered to proof read your essay, so make sure that it is easy to read. It is best to have this version typed and double-spaced so it will be easy for whoever is helping you to make notes on things you can improve in your final draft.

, You can ask a friend, a parent, or other family member, but try to choose someone you know will really spend time checking your paper for errors, and will also pay attention to what you've written. A lazy friend might glance through your essay for spelling errors. However, what you really want is someone who will evaluate what you’ve written to point out places where you can improve.For example, a good proof reader might point out to you that your paragraph about the death of your person might be better if you put it before your paragraph which talks about the legacy this person left behind.
Try asking a classmate to read your essay. It's a win-win for both of you because you can offer to read their essay in return. Meet up a few days after reading to talk about errors and ways to make each of your papers better.
If the person has done a good job, they may have a lot of things to say about your paper. Try not to take anything bad they say about your paper personally. They're not trying to make you feel bad, they just want to help you get a good grade.
Give them a physical copy of the paper that is double-spaced. This will make it easy for them to make corrections and write notes on your paper.

, After you have made any corrections or changes based on the feedback from your helper, go back and proof read your own essay. Try to pretend that you are reading this for the first time, and that you are reading someone else’s essay.Make notes as you read in a bright colored pen on a physical copy of your paper.
Read your paper twice. The first time, focus on what you've written, and don't look for spelling mistakes or other grammar errors. While you're reading think about whether it is easy to follow and whether or not it makes sense. This will be the time to consider rearranging any information, adding anything extra, or removing anything that doesn't seem important.
Read through the article a second time to check for grammar and spelling issues. Mark any misspelled words or typos, and make a note of any awkward sentences that you want to go back and change.

, It may sound strange, but reading the essay backwards sentence by sentence helps you to focus on each sentence. This will make it easier to catch mistakes.You should also read the essay out loud. Reading the essay out loud will help you find sentences that sound strange.

, Once you are satisfied with your work, prepare your final draft. If you have only handwritten your essay, then you will need to type the entire thing on the computer. If you already have a computerized draft, then you don’t need to re-type the entire essay, but go through and fix any mistakes that you noticed.Make sure to follow any instructions your teacher has given you about how to format the document. For example, with regard to font, font size, and line spacing.
By now, you should feel confident that you have a well-written paper. If you still feel unsure, you can ask a different person to read your essay to reassure yourself that you have caught any mistakes.
If your teacher said they don’t care about the formatting, then stick to the defaults of your word processing program. Generally, it is a good idea to stick to font size 12 and a standard font such as Times New Roman. To make your paper easier to read, consider changing the line spacing to 1.5 or 2, unless your teacher has said not to do this.
Your teacher probably expects you to turn in a typed copy of your essay. Unless your teacher has specifically asked for handwritten papers make sure you turn in a neat, typed copy.

Make your own applesauce, if possible.,
Review your recipe to see if it calls for oil or melted butter.,
Substitute using a 1 to 1 ratio.,
Start substituting applesauce for a portion of the fat to get familiar with the effect of the oil.,
Measure applesauce the same way as oil, in a liquid measuring cup.,
Incorporate the applesauce into the wet ingredients with a mixer before combining the dry ingredients.,
Refrain from changing the cooking time on the recipe.",How to Use Applesauce to Bake," Making the applesauce will allow you to control the amount of sugar and preservatives, resulting in even healthier baking.









To make your applesauce, wash, core and quarter 2 lb. (908 g) of apples. Put them in a large pot filled with water that is at least an inch (2.5 cm) deeper than the apples. Boil until the apples are soft. With a bit of cooking water or unsweetened apple juice, put them through a blender or food mill. Add 1 tsp. (2 g) of spices like nutmeg and cinnamon.
For baking purposes, use unsweetened applesauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (96 g) of sugar or 1/3 cup (113 g) of honey to homemade applesauce, if you plan to eat it on its own.
Reduce the amount of sugar you use in a recipe if you are using sweetened applesauce.;
, Applesauce should be substituted for these ingredients, but not softened butter. The substitution works best for cakes, muffins and quick breads.









Substituting applesauce for oil or butter in cookies is not recommended. It can result in mushy cookies that do not hold their shape.

, For example, 1/2 cup (118 ml) of oil is equal to 1/2 cup (56.5 g) of applesauce.








, For example, if a recipe calls for 1/2 cup (118 ml) of oil, substitute 1/4 cup (28.3 g) of applesauce and also add 1/4 cup (59 ml) of oil. Taste the result and move toward replacing more oil with applesauce next time if it compliments the recipe.









You do not need to substitute all of the oil to get a healthy effect. If your recipe turns out better with a little oil and a little applesauce, you can consider it a healthy substitution.

, This will provide a more accurate measurement than using a dry measuring cup.








, This will ensure the applesauce is well mixed. The recipe will also turn out to be more moist, if the dry ingredients are mixed with the wet ingredients right before baking.








, Low-fat recipes should not be over-baked as they can be extra dry.

Cook with aluminum foil.,
Do not use aluminum foil in a microwave.,
Keep food warm or cold.,
Preserve food with aluminum foil.,
Soften brown sugar.",How to Use Aluminum Foil1," If you're cooking with a grill or an oven, you can wrap meat, vegetables, and other dishes in aluminum foil to retain moisture and flavor. The added bonus of cooking with aluminum foil is that you can simply throw away the foil afterward – no pots or pans to scrub.



Grill fish or vegetables. Add seasonings to raw fish or vegetables, and then wrap securely. Place on the hot grill. When the dish is done cooking: open the foil, put the fish or vegetables on a platter, and throw away the foil. The convenience of this method is that there is nothing else to clean up.

Roast a turkey. Place the raw turkey on a baking pan, and tent it with aluminum foil. This will retain the juices in the turkey while baking, so as to cook completely through without burning. Remove the tent for the last hour of roasting, so that the turkey skin gets browned and crisp.
Line a baking pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Then, add the meat and/or veggies, along with the sauce of your choosing. Secure the foil so that it is tightly folded over the stew. Put in the oven and cook. When dinner is ready, remove the roast, and then toss away the foil without having any pots to wash or scrub.;
, Aluminum deflects the electromagnetic waves that cook food so efficiently in a microwave oven. This might cause your food to cook unevenly, and it might even damage the appliance. Remember: metal and microwaves do not mix!, Aluminum foil is a great insulator, meaning that it is great for keeping hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Use it to wrap leftovers or pack your lunch. Individually wrap each food item into a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Bend the foil into a ""tent"" shape, and fold the ends down tightly to trap heat. If you wrap your meal well, it should hold the same temperature for hours.

, Aluminum foil has the lowest moisture-vapor transfer rate of almost any wrapping material. This means that it is extraordinarily good at keeping food from drying out. Foil is also great for retaining the odor of smelly foods.Wrap leftovers in an airtight seal of aluminum foil, then store in the freezer or refrigerator until you are ready to eat again.


If you don't have access to a freezer or refrigerator, you can still use aluminum foil to keep food fresh. Store the wrapped-up food items in a cool, dark, dry place.
Aluminum foil is even better than plastic wrap at retaining odor and moisture. Just make sure that you carefully seal each item so that it's as airtight as possible! This will make the food less prone to freezer burn.

, Wrap a clump of hardened brown sugar in aluminum foil. Then, bake it in a 300-degree oven for five to 10 minutes to melt down the clumps."

Remove static in the dryer.,
Line your ironing board with aluminum foil.,
Polish tarnished metal.,
Sharpen scissors.,
Slide heavy furniture on foil pads.,
Clean pots and pans.",How to Use Aluminum Foil2," Crush aluminum foil into homemade ""dryer balls"" in order to reduce static cling when you tumble-dry your clothes. Compress the foil into two or three balls, each about two inches in diameter. Make sure that each ball is tight and smoothly-pressed so that it won't snag on the garments in the dryer. This can be a cheap and chemical-free alternative to commercial dryer sheets.You can continue to use the same dryer balls for months. When the balls start to come apart, replace them with freshly-crumpled foil.
Be aware that the aluminum dryer ball will not soften your clothing like a commercial dryer sheet. Furthermore, it might make your dryer a bit noisier. Consider whether these downsides are worth the cost-effectiveness.

, A standard ironing board is designed to absorb heat and moisture. Aluminum foil will trap heat and moisture around your clothing, which should speed up the ironing process. Be aware of the risks of trapping high heat and moisture: if you aren't careful, you will greatly increase the chance of burning yourself.Use this method to steam garments that aren't iron-safe. Lay the the clothing on the aluminum foil, and hold the iron 1-2 inches above the fabric. Continually press the ""steam"" button to quickly steam out the wrinkles.

, First, line the inside of a bowl with aluminum foil. Then, fill the foil with warm water; one tablespoon of salt; one tablespoon of baking soda; and one teaspoon of dish soap. Soak your tarnished metal items: jewelry, silverware, coins, etc. Let the mixture do its work for ten minutes. Then, remove the metal items and dry them off., Fold a piece of aluminum foil until it is five or six layers thick. Then, cut it repeatedly with a pair of dulled scissors. This should gently sharpen the blades and increase the lifespan of the tool., Before you move a piece of furniture, cut up pieces of aluminum foil. Slide the foil pieces beneath the legs with the dull side down. These foil patches should help the furniture slide smoothly across the floor.

, Use crumpled-up aluminum foil like you would use steel wool. Scrub hard with the foil ball, and it should pick up most caked-on and burnt material. It may not be as effective as an actual cleaning product, but it will suffice in a pinch. Use foil to clean any metal: grills, bicycle parts, etc."

Entertain cats.,
Use aluminum foil for crafts.,
Make a fire.",How to Use Aluminum Foil3," Pull out a piece of foil, and crush it into a ball with your hands. Toss it to your cat, and watch them enjoy themselves tossing it and holding it in their teeth. This can save you from spending money on rubber balls. The method is also great for kittens, as you can make the foil balls as large or small as you want.


Place a piece of aluminum foil on couch cushions to keep your animals off. Once they land on the seat and hear the crackling noise on the surface, they may learn to keep off it.

, Foil can be a shiny, decorative material, and it can also serve as an easy-to-clean workspace for messy craft materials. Get creative and imagine all of the ways that you can use aluminum foil!


Wrap gifts with decorative foil. Foil products may come in various colors and patterns. This can be a cheap and creative way to wrap things!
Use foil for crafts instead of paper. Cut it into shapes and letters. It's easy to fold, and it can add a shiny flair to your projects!
Mix paint on aluminum foil. When you paint, line a metal roller pan with aluminum foil before pouring in the paint. This way, the cleanup is a breeze: just throw out the foil!

, You can use aluminum foil, cotton, and a AA battery to start a fire within minutes.Cut out a aluminum foil, about a four inches long and half an inch wide. Cut away the foil in the center of the strip to make a thin, two millimeter-wide slit, roughly 3/4 inches long. Wrap the thin connector in the middle with cotton. Then, attach each end of the foil strip to opposite ends of the AA battery. The cotton should quickly catch on fire.Add more kindling once the cotton sparks. Build the fire and tend it as it grows.

Always practice fire safety!

Combine flour, fat and salt with water (or milk) to make the dough.,
Divide the dough into 5 or 6 depending on your taste and serving needs.,
Prepare your filling ingredients.,
Heat a barbecue flat plate or grill section, or heat a large cast iron pan.,
Fill your piadina.,
Serve immediately.

",How to Make Piadina," Knead for 5-10 minutes until smooth in a mixer or by hand. Leave in a cool place (such as the refrigerator) to rest for 2-3 hours, preferably overnight.


This dough will make thin piadina, to make thicker piadina you may add 1 tsp of baking powder to the dough. Rest the dough for only half an hour. Alternatively, you may add 1 teaspoon of yeast, however yeast is not a traditional ingredient and will make your dough more like a pizza.;
, Gently roll out your dough into a circle approx 20cm or 8 inches. To make thin piadina, roll out your dough 2mm or 1/12th of an inch thick.


For thicker piadina, roll out the dough 5mm or 1/5th of an inch. This will make a smaller piadina approx 17cm or 7 inches across.
You may also make 10 small piadina as a hand held party food 10cm or 4 inches across.

, Ideally piadina should be served hot, fresh from the pan, so it is recommended to have your fillings ready for a quick meal.

, Brush the piadina with a little olive oil and add to the hot pan or BBQ. Cook 1-2 minutes each side for thin piadina, until golden brown and crisp. Thick piadina should be cooked more gently for 2-3 minutes.


The barbecue adds a delicious smoky taste to the bread which cannot really be replicated with a frying pan. This makes Piadina an ideal starter or lunch for BBQ parties, or when the weather is too hot to cook indoors.

, Place your filling on half of the piadina, season with salt and pepper and a little extra virgin olive oil if desired. Fold in half to eat similar to a taco, or cut into portions to serve.


Alternatively, you may brush each hot piadina with garlic butter or top with bruschetta or salsa, cut into quarters and serve as a party food at a BBQ.
For sweet Piadina, spread thickly with chocolate or hazelnut spread and enjoy hot.

Add less coconut flour than you would wheat flour.,
Consider adding extra protein.,
Pay attention to differences between flours.,
Add liquids in equal parts.,
Add extra eggs.,
Try an established recipe first.",How to Use Coconut Flour1," Coconut flour is much more absorbent than wheat flour. That means that you usually need much less of it in a baking recipe. How much less depends on the recipe, but you may be using as little as a third of what you'd normally use., Because coconut flour has less protein than wheat flour, it can sometimes come off as a bit dense. Wheat flour produces gluten, which helps provide stretch and bite to baked goods. It can help to add in a bit of whey powder to your recipe when using coconut flour to help replace the gluten., Not every coconut flour is the same. Some are denser than others, making your recipes turn out differently. Pay attention to what the dough looks like before you bake it. It should be similar in consistency to a dough made with wheat flour. If it's not, you may need to adjust the recipe., Unlike recipes calling for wheat flour, you need to add a significant amount of liquid to dough using coconut flour. Usually, you'll use one part liquid to one part coconut flour. You can use water, coconut milk, milk, or any other liquid you think would go well with the recipe.Another way to avoid dryness is to add pureed fruits to your baked goods, such as applesauce or pumpkin.

, When baking with coconut flour, the texture of the finished product relies more heavily on the eggs than it does on the flour. That means you need to add extra eggs when baking with coconut flour. You may use as many as 6 eggs while only using 1/2 a cup (118 milliliters) of coconut flour., That is, you may decide you want to just substitute coconut flour in your favorite recipe. However, that's likely to end in disaster if you just substitute coconut flour for wheat flour one to one. It's better to use a recipe made for coconut flour that someone has already tested. Once you get the hang of baking with coconut flour, then you can start making changes to fit your needs."

Add it as a binder for meatloaf and meatballs.,
Experiment with using it in sauces.,
Use it as a base for coconut shrimp or chicken.",How to Use Coconut Flour2," Coconut flour works well as a binder in recipes where you'd normally use ingredients like cracker or bread crumbs, such as meatloaf. However, you will need to double the liquid in the recipe because the coconut flour will absorb so much of it., Some people have good luck using it to thicken sauces, while others do not.In fact, some cooks recommend not trying it at all.However, you should experiment and see what works for you. You may find it works well as a thickener for your purposes. Don't forget that coconut flour will absorb more liquid than wheat flour, though, so only try a little bit at a time.

, If you want to make coconut chicken or shrimp, coconut flour makes a good base. Simply dip the meat into an egg wash first (whisked egg), then dip it into the coconut flour.

Unroll the cinnamon rolls.,
Create more filling.,
Add flavorful ingredients to the filling.,
Add an exotic flavor.,
Create your own icing.",How to Upgrade Canned Cinnamon Rolls1," Look for a flaky variety of canned cinnamon rolls so you can easily unroll them. Open the package and remove all of the cinnamon rolls. Carefully peel unwind each cinnamon roll and lay them flat so that the filling is facing up.

Try to place them next to each other so you can quickly spread filling over the dough.;
, If you'd simply like more of the classic cinnamon roll filling, dice butter into very small cubes and scatter it over the unrolled dough. Sprinkle enough brown sugar to cover the dough. This will make more of the gooey filling. Or you could spread a different filling over the unrolled dough. Consider spreading one of these:Chocolate hazelnut spread
Jam
Honey
Pumpkin puree with maple syrup
Lemon curd

, You can also add some delicious textures to the filling of canned cinnamon rolls. For another classic variation, add chopped pecans or walnuts. You could also scatter dried fruit (like raisins or dried cranberries) for a chewy bite. For decadent cinnamon rolls, sprinkle mini-cinnamon or mini-chocolate chips. You could also spread apple pie filling over the unrolled dough.

Keep in mind that if you use a lot of extra filling ingredients, it may become difficult to wrap the dough back into a cinnamon roll.

, Classic cinnamon rolls rely on standard spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Give your canned cinnamon rolls a unique flavor by brushing the dough with a bit of rose water, orange liqueur, or scotch. You could also try one of the following flavor combinations:

Almond extract and chocolate chips
Chopped dates and walnuts
Ground cardamom and pearl sugar
Ground ginger and chopped pistachios

, Since the icing packet or can that came with your cinnamon rolls probably isn't enough to cover the cinnamon rolls, you should make your own icing. If you'd like to keep a similar icing flavor, just mix a few tablespoons of melted butter with about 3/4 cup of powdered sugar. Add a few splashes of milk to get the right consistency. Or mix up one of these icings:Softened cream cheese with powdered sugar and a splash of orange juice
Brown sugar heated with bourbon and butter
Espresso powder and powdered sugar mixed with milk

Fold the strip of dough in half and twist it around a few times to make a spiral. Bake the cinnamon twists at 350 degrees F (175 C) for 18 to 20 minutes.While you can drizzle the twists with icing, you could also serve them with a side of icing for dipping.

, Divide one can of cinnamon rolls into five rolls. Place one of the rolls in the center of a baking pan and unroll the remaining four rolls so they're long strips of dough. Loosely wrap each of the strips around the center piece of dough so you make one large cinnamon roll. Bake the giant roll at 350 degrees F (175 C) for 20 to 25 minutes.You can drizzle the giant cinnamon roll with the icing while it's still warm from the oven.

Use white spelt flour instead of all-purpose flour.,
Reduce liquids by ¼. Spelt flour is more water soluble than all-purpose flour.,
Mix the dough or batter lightly.",How to Substitute Spelt Flour for All‐Purpose Flour1," Spelt flour is available in two varieties: white and whole. White spelt flour has the bran and germ removed so it will provide a lighter texture in baked goods. As a result, it’s the best substitute for all-purpose flour in your favorite recipes.You can usually find white spelt flour at natural food stores and the organic section of traditional grocery stores.;
, That means you don’t need to mix as much liquid into your recipes if you’re substituting spelt. Reducing the amount of liquid ingredients in the recipe by ¼ usually provides the best results.If you’re making a recipe with a liquid that’s hard to reduce, you can increase the amount of flour than you use instead. For example, if you need to add whole eggs, increase the spelt flour by 10 to 15% instead of reducing the amount of the eggs.

, The gluten in spelt flour is different than the gluten in all-purpose flour, so it’s important to handle the dough or batter you make with it accordingly. All-purpose flour can be kneaded or mixed for a long time, but if you overmix spelt batters or doughs, you can wind up with crumbly baked goods. Knead or mix until the dough or batter is just combined."
"
Start with just ¼ spelt flour to test.,
Use 100% spelt flour for pancakes.,
Use half spelt and half all-purpose for cookies, muffins, and breads.,
Opt for 50% spelt flour with yeast breads.",How to Substitute Spelt Flour for All‐Purpose Flour2," When you’re beginning to experiment with spelt flour substitution, it’s best to ease your way into it. Replace just ¼ of the all-purpose flour in your recipe with spelt and use all-purpose flour for the remaining ¾ to see how the finished product turns out. You can gradually begin to increase the amount of spelt when you know how it will affect the recipe.If you’re only using ¼ spelt flour for a recipe, you don’t necessarily have to reduce the amount of liquid. See how the final product turns out before deciding if you have to adjust the liquids.

, For pancakes, you can make a 1 for 1 substitution with spelt and all-purpose flour. The spelt will give the pancakes a rich, sweet whole wheat flavor, while still creating a moist, fluffy texture.If you’re doing a 1 for 1 substitution with spelt in your pancakes, be sure to reduce the liquids by ¼.

, With baked goods like cookies, muffins, or sweetbreads, having a moist, soft texture is important. Instead of using a 1 for 1 substitution with spelt and all-purpose flour, you’re better off using half spelt and half all-purpose. That will keep them from being too crumbly.It usually isn't necessary to reduce the liquid in a recipe if you're using half spelt and half all-purpose flour.

, If you’re making a delicious yeast bread, using all spelt flour in place of all-purpose can lead to dry bread that has a pronounced whole wheat flavor. Using half spelt flour instead keeps the bread moist and provides a sweet, mild flavor.You don't have to reduce the liquid if you're only using 50% spelt flour in your yeast bread recipe.

Sift spelt flour.,
Weigh spelt flour for accurate measurements.,
Add baking powder for self raising flour.",How to Substitute Spelt Flour for All‐Purpose Flour3," White spelt flour is less refined than whole spelt. As a result, it’s a good idea to sift it before mixing it into your recipes as a substitution for all-purpose flour. That will help break up any lumps and remove any chunks of bran., Spelt flour often weighs differently than all-purpose flour, so using a cup of spelt may not necessarily weigh the same as all-purpose. To be sure that you get the proper amounts, weigh the spelt flour on a food scale before adding it to a recipe.1 cup of white spelt flour contains 102 grams, while 1 cup of all-purpose flour contains 125 grams.

, Spelt flour doesn’t allow baked goods to rise all that much. If you are replacing self-rising all purpose flour in recipe, mix in ¾ teaspoon (3 g) of baking powder for every cup (102 g) of spelt flour that you’re using to get a good rise."

Add the yeast.,
Cover the bowl.,
Check the yeast mixture.,
Protect dried yeast from the elements.,
Store fresh yeast in the fridge.,
Organize your storage space.",How to Test the Freshness of Yeast," If your yeast is in a jar, measure one teaspoon (5 ml) of loose yeast. Set the yeast aside.;
,

Use a food thermometer to measure the temperature of the water. The target temperature is between 110 and 115 degrees F (43-46 degrees C)., Fresh yeast will react with the either granulated sugar or flour.For sugar, measure 1 teaspoon (5 ml). If you choose flour, use 2 teaspoons (10 ml). Stir or whisk the mixture until the sugar or flour dissolves.

, Most experts recommend stirring the yeast into the sugar water. However, you can also sprinkle it over the surface of the water., If the bowl does not have its own cover, you can use a towel or aluminum foil. Leave the yeast to proof for 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature., Live yeast will cause the surface to bubble to the 1 cup (250 ml) mark.This means the yeast is good and will work in your baking. On the other hand, if there is no sign of activity after 10 to 15 minutes, the yeast is no longer viable and should be discarded.

, Sealed sachets or unopened jars protect dried yeast from heat, light, and moisture. However, once exposed to oxygen, it must be kept in a cool, dry, and dark place. Dried yeast may be stored in a cabinet, pantry, or freezer., Refrigerators provide the necessary cool, dry, and dark environment to preserve yeast temporarily. However, because fresh yeast contains moisture, it must be used within two weeks., Note the use-by dates on all products in your cabinet or pantry. Place the items with earlier dates, such as yeast, in the front and those with later dates in the back. This way, items that expire within short time frames catch your attention easily."

Reduce it bit by bit.,
Substitute the sugar.,
Increase the flour.,
Be careful of reducing sugar in recipes using yeast.,
Reconsider any sugar based toppings for baked goods.",How to Reduce Sugar in Baking Recipes," Start by cutting back to three-quarters the amount the recipe suggests. Then halve it. Many French chefs halve the amount of sugar recommended in a baked goods recipe with nobody the wiser as to the flavour impact. With a gradual reduction, you'll find yourself getting used to the new way that the baked items taste.;
, Another great way to reduce sugar intake is to substitute it with something as tasty. Some choices include:


Stevia

Spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, mixed spice, etc.)
Fruit puree (but beware, this is still fructose, and see ""Tips"")
Syrups, such as maple, rice or agave (agave syrup is very high in fructose and may not be a suitable substitute)
Honey
Artificial sweeteners (you'll need to know if they can be baked though)
Fresh fruit, berries, or sweet vegetables.

, Use this to make up the missed volume of sugar. For most recipes this will work but you do need to experiment.

, Yeast requires the sugar to activate. If you can discern how much sugar the yeast needs and set that aside and only fiddle with the rest of the sugar, that's ideal. If not, experiment with daring, and you'll discover by trial and error what does and does not work.

, Icing sugar, granular sugar, fine sugar, etc., are all still sugar and adding them to your freshly baked goods can increase the sugar overload. Find topping substitutes that are healthy, such as fresh fruit, spices like cinnamon, or sugar-free grated chocolate. Or why not just leave it bare?

Use applesauce.,
Try mashed bananas.,
Substitute dried fruit.",How to Sweeten Baked Goods Naturally1," Applesauce can be a great alternative to sugar. It’s sweet and moist, which can make it easy to use in a variety of dishes. You can sweeten things like yogurt and oatmeal by stirring in applesauce instead of sugar.Make sure to use applesauce with no added sugars. You can make your own from apples, or you can buy unsweetened applesauce.
Make sure to read the label to look for added sugars. Sugar goes by other names, such as cane sugar, corn syrup, or sucrose.;
, Mashed bananas are another way to naturally sweeten baked goods. Bananas are sweet enough to add enough flavor to your recipes. You can half or fourth the sugar in the recipe and replace it with mashed bananas.Many recipes include mashed banana as an ingredient instead of sugar. You can try to look for one of those recipes.
Bananas work well sweetening almost all baked goods, including cakes, cookies, brownies, muffins, breads, and even pancakes and waffles.

, Dried fruit, like prunes and dates, are another good way to naturally sweeten baked goods. You can puree prunes or dates and add them in place of sugar, or reduce the amount of sugar and add prunes or dates instead.Other dried fruits you can use are raisins, apricots, berries, or cherries.
Try making date paste by soaking dates in water for around three hours, and then putting them in the food processor.Make sure to get natural dried fruits. Do not get candied dried fruit or dried fruit that contains added sugar. This defeats the point.

Use stevia.,
Try honey.,
Add maple syrup.,
Use beets.",How to Sweeten Baked Goods Naturally2," Stevia is an herb that acts as a natural sweetener. It is sugar and calorie free, and can be used in place of sugar. However, you have to use different doses. You can find stevia in most grocery stores.Make sure to choose an all natural stevia. Read the ingredients list and try to avoid stevias that contain dextrose, maltodextrin, erythritol, and inulin.

, Honey is another way to sweeten your baked goods naturally. Honey can be very sweet, so you should use about ⅓ the amount of honey for the amount of sugar you’d use. However, you can’t use honey in a recipe where you need to beat butter and sugar together. This leads to denser baked goods.Many people believe honey is not a good substitute for sugar because it breaks down the same in the body, so you really aren’t improving anything. If you are concerned about this, you can try one of the other alternatives.
You can use honey with softer, moister cakes, breads, and pancakes., Maple syrup can be added to baked goods to sweeten them. Maple syrup has antioxidants, which adds benefits other than a limited sugar content for the baked good. You can’t use maple syrup in any recipe where you need to mix butter and sugar.You can use less maple syrup than sugar in recipes.
Maple syrup has less calories than honey, so it may be a better option.

, Beets are naturally sweet, and they are used in making sugar substitutes. You can shred beets or use beet pulp in place of sugar in a recipe. Plus, beets add extra nutrients to any baked good. Try beets when making cakes or muffins.Many people add vanilla extract, vanilla powder, or unsweetened vanilla almond milk when baking with beets.

Replace half the sugar with an alternative.,
Leave out the sugar in fruit desserts.,
Find the natural sweetener that works best for you.",How to Sweeten Baked Goods Naturally3," If you want to bake with a sugar substitute, you may not be able to eliminate all the sugar. However, you can significantly reduce the amount of sugar in your recipe by substituting half the sugar with an alternative.When doing this, cut about ¼ cup of the liquid element in the recipe.
You can try applesauce, pureed dates or other fruit, or mashed bananas.

, Fruit desserts can be delicious and sweet without the added sugar. Follow the recipe the same way, but eliminate all the additional sugar. You may even consider adding more fruit for extra fruit sweetness or tartness.This can be done for pies, cobblers, tarts, parfaits, or any other fruit-based dessert.

, Not all of these options will be right for you. You may not like the taste of one of them. That doesn’t mean you should go back to sugar. Instead, keep trying sugar alternatives until you find the one that is right for you. You also may find that some natural sweeteners are better in certain recipes or types of baked goods than others.


For example, you may hate the taste of pureed prunes and maple syrup, but love shredded beets in cakes and muffins sweetened with bananas.
If you cannot figure out how to sweeten with these alternatives, there are many recipes and cookbooks that contain baked goods made with natural alternatives.

Separate the eggs.,
Let the egg whites sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.,
Beat the egg whites with cream of tartar.,
Add sugar and continue beating.,
Test the peaks.",How to Produce Thick and Glossy Meringue1," Using the freshest eggs possible, carefully separate the whites from the yolks over a clean, dry mixing bowl. Crack the shell, separate the halves, and pour the yolk gently from one shell half to the other as the white drops into the bowl. Repeat with as many eggs as your recipe calls for (usually 2 or 3 for a typically pie topping).


Reserve the yolks for later use in custard or ice cream.
Use a different egg separating technique if you prefer not to use the shell transfer method.;
, The temperature of the eggs greatly affects the texture of the finished meringue, so it's important to allow time for them to come to room temperature. Make sure the bowl isn't too close to a hot oven or a cool spot.

, This binding substance helps the egg whites form into thick, glossy peaks. Most recipes call for about 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar for 2 egg whites. Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with a hand mixer until the mixture is white and foamy with soft peaks. , The sugar should be added slowly with one hand as you continue beating the meringue with the other hand using a hand mixer. You'll typically need 1/4 cup sugar for every 2 egg whites. Continue beating until stiff peaks begin to form. The mixture will take on a glossy, satin sheen as you add the sugar.

, Lift the hand mixer from the bowl of meringue. When you remove the beaters, stiff, thick, glossy peaks should rise and stay in place. When you tilt the bowl, the mixture should remain in place, rather than sliding forward. This means the meringue is ready to be used in a recipe.

"
"
Make sure the mixture is at room temperature before beating.,
Avoid mixing yolk or shell with the egg whites.,
Avoid getting water in the bowl.,
Don't pour in the sugar all at once.",How to Produce Thick and Glossy Meringue2," If it's too warm or cold, you won't be able to create the stiff, glossy peaks you need to make a good meringue.

, One little splatter of yolk will prevent you from achieving good volume and high peaks. The heavy yolk changes the composition of the mixture, as do bits of shell.


If you drop some yolk or shell into the meringue, it's best to start over rather than trying to fish it out.
You can avoid getting shell in the whites by cracking the eggs over a bowl different from the one you use to mix up the meringue, then transferring the whites carefully to the mixing bowl.

, Make sure the mixing bowl you start with is completely clean and dry. During the mixing process, avoid getting even the merest drop of water in the bowl, as it throws off the composition of the meringue and ruins the dish.

, To achieve stiff, glossy peaks, you need to add the sugar slowly to give it time to mix in thoroughly and evenly.

"
Use meringue as a pie topping.,
Make meringue cookies.,
Finished.

",How to Produce Thick and Glossy Meringue3," This popular use of meringue requires a bit less finesse than you need to make cookies, since baking the pie with slightly softer peaks will still turn out beautifully. When your pie filling is prepared, simply spread the meringue across the top, then place it in the oven and bake it until the top of the meringue is light brown at the tips.You can make the pie look more decorative by creating mini peaks and curls. After you spread the meringue on the pie surface, use the back of a spoon to lightly touch the surface of the meringue and lift it into a small peak. Repeat in the pattern on the rest of the pie.
Be sure that your oven temperature isn't too hot when you're baking meringue pie. In order for the peaks to hold, the moisture needs to evaporate gradually with relatively low heat.

, To make cookies, be sure your batch of meringue has been beaten long enough to form quite thick, stiff, glossy peaks. Spoon dollops of the meringue onto a cookie sheet. Use the back of the spoon to lightly press the center of a cookie, then lift up to form a small peak. Repeat with the remaining cookies and bake them for about 10 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.


You can flavor meringue cookies by stirring in cinnamon, pumpkin spice, small chocolate chips, or cocoa powder.
For prettier cookies, fill an icing bag with meringue and pipe them onto the cookie sheet through a decorate tip. This way you can make ridged swirls and other patterns.
To make peppermint meringues, mix a few drops of peppermint extract and red food coloring in a bowl. After piping the meringue onto the cookie sheet, use a small clean paintbrush to pain candy cane-like stripes around the ridges of the cookies before baking them.

If you have baking powder in your cabinet, simply add triple the amount of baking powder to your recipe. For example, if your recipe calls for one tablespoon of baking soda, add three tablespoons of baking powder.You can substitute baking powder for baking soda in pretty much any recipe that requires baking soda.;
, If you're out of baking powder as well, check to see if you have self-rising flour. Self-rising flour contains a small amount of baking powder, so it can also be used as a baking soda substitute. Simply replace the regular flour in your recipe with self-rising flour., If you don't have baking ingredients to use as substitutes, check your medicine cabinet for potassium bicarbonate. This is a medication sometimes used to treat conditions like acid reflux or hypertension. For each teaspoon of baking soda in a recipe, add one teaspoon of potassium bicarbonate mixed with a third a teaspoon of salt.This usually works out best when baking cookies. It may not work out as well for recipes like cakes, pancakes, muffins, and other baked goods.

, Baking powder contains salt. It's a good idea to either omit or reduce the amount of salt in the recipe if you substitute for baking powder for baking soda. This will prevent the recipe from turning out too salty., Baking soda is designed to interact with acidic ingredients. If you substitute baking powder for baking soda, replace any acidic liquids for non-acidic ones. Acidic liquids include things like sour cream, yogurt, vinegar, buttermilk, molasses, and citrus juices. Whole milk or water can be used as a replacement. Use the same amount of the substitute ingredient as the liquid in the original recipe.For example, if the recipe calls for one cup of buttermilk, use one cup of whole milk instead.

, Recipes that use baking soda often have citrus-based liquids like lemon or lime juice. In this case, flavor water with a small amount of grated lime or lemon and use this as your liquid replacement. This will help preserve the citrus flavor., Baking soda adds carbonation to a recipe. Whisking the eggs before adding the flour can increase the amount of air bubbles produced. This increases the likelihood your baking soda substitute will work correctly., If you have a carbonated beverage, like beer, in your kitchen, add a splash of that to your batter. This can add a bit of carbonation, helping your baking soda substitute function correctly., Even if you have another baking soda substitute on hand, you should still use self-rising flour when you don't have baking soda for making pancakes. Pancakes may become denser without baking soda. Self-rising flour can make your pancakes fluffier."

, Make notes of some ideas as they come to mind. If the transcripts are too extensive, do not attempt to read them all at once. When your mind starts to wander or you become impatient or start to feel disinterested, it is time to pause. Refrain from reading the transcripts from the beginning of the document. When you start out, you are in peak form. If you always confine this energy to the first section of your data, you are more likely to exclude or overlook valuable information from later sections.

, This can be the most interesting, the shortest transcript or the one on top of the file. Go through it and ask yourself: What is this all about? Do not think about the content of the information, but focus on its underlying meaning. Write down your thoughts in the margin.

Skip abbreviations.",How to Write a Strong Title for an Argumentative Essay," Pull out a piece of paper for brainstorming. You can also work on the computer. However, writing it out can sometimes be helpful to combine and reuse ideas. Have a pen and paper ready to jot down ideas.


Also, read through your paper. Start making notes on the main ideas. If you organized your paper well, you should have the paper divided into several main ideas.
Write down any ideas you have about what you think should go in your title.;
, If you haven't already, make a summary of your paper. Your conclusion is usually a good summary of your paper, but you should distill it down to just the basics.Try to get it down to one sentence if possible, such as ""Soup is significantly more flavorful when made with stock than when made with water.""
It's good to save the title for last, so you know what your paper is going to say.

, What are the main ideas that make up your paper? List the words that are essential to your paper. Write down the words that are so essential that your essay paper couldn't exist.For instance, if you wrote a paper on why soup is better when made with stock than water, think about what words are essential to that paper.
Your list of keywords might include ""soup,"" ""stock,"" and ""flavor,"" as an example.

, When making a title, it's important to consider your audience. If your teacher is super-serious, a silly title might not work. However, if she has a sense of humor, silly may make the perfect title.Also, think about the tone of your essay. If it's lighthearted, a lighthearted title will fit. For instance, an essay on stock and chicken soup lends itself to lightheartedness.
However, if your essay is very serious, stick to a serious title. For instance, if you're trying to convince people that poverty needs to end, that's a pretty serious topic and needs a serious title.

, One way to create a title is to pull a sentence out of your paper that offers insight into what you're saying. You can also use your summary sentence. Sometimes a sentence will work as a title, or it will work if you shorten it up a bit.Read over your paper. You can use this opportunity to proofread while you look for a good sentence.
Write out any sentence that may work. For instance, one sentence that might work is ""Soup is delicious, but it is even more delicious when made with stock.""
Shorten it up to work as a title: ""Soup Is More Flavorful With Stock.""

, Sometimes, using a question as a title can help draw your reader in. Frame a descriptive title in the form of a question that your paper answers or addresses.For instance, you could write, ""Why Does Stock Make Soup So Flavorful?"" That establishes your topic, as well as invites your reader into your paper.
Just be sure you are answering the question you propose.

, Your title, of course, needs to be informative. However, making it creative, too, helps draw your reader in. You may have heard this element referred to as a ""hook"" because you are hooking your readers into continuing with your essay.Come up with something that is contrasting or surprising. A concrete image works well, meaning something that invokes the senses. For instance, you could write something like ""The Flavor of Boiled Chicken Bones Is the Best for Soup.""
People don't necessarily think bones are tasty, but they are used to create your flavorful broth. Therefore, it's a bit surprising, but it plays into your essay.

, One way you can lead into your essay is to play with your words. For instance, make a pun. Another way is to use a famous quote, poem, or song to lead into your title.As an example, a pun you could use would be ""Use Your Backbone to Make Soup."" ""Backbone"" is a play both on the fact that you're using stock (made from bones) and that you need to use your backbone to stand up for stock.
As for a saying, you could use something like ""Chicken Soup: Only the Opiate of the Masses If Made With Stock."" ""Opiate of the masses"" is a reference to Karl Marx and will attract attention.

, You've come up with an idea. Great! However, your first idea may not be your best one. Give yourself some time to play around with it.That is, move words around to see if you can make a better statement.
Try mixing and matching among titles that you like. Pick the parts you like best.

, Being as specific as possible plays to your advantage. It prepares the reader to know exactly what is coming, which in turn, means they are more ready for your argument.For instance, if you are discussing a specific type of soup, add that in: ""Chicken Stock Makes the Best Chicken Soup.""
If you are specifically talking about homemade stock, add that in ""Homemade Chicken Stock Makes the Best Chicken Soup.""

, A subtitle can help you include everything you want to in your title. That is, if you have creative and informative parts, it can be hard to smash both in. If you want to use both, you can use one as the title and one as the subtitle.The most common method is putting the creative part first as the main title, followed by the informative part in the subtitle. However, you can do it either way.
For example, you could write: ""Use Your Backbone: Why You Should Advocate for Stock in Soup.""
If the titles are on the same line, separate them by a colon. If not, you don't need the colon.

, Make sure you've included as many of your keywords as possible. If your keywords are essential to your paper, they're essential to your title, too.Compare your title to the list you made earlier.
Does it include at least 3/4 of your keywords?

, Read the title you've decided on. What would you think the topic of your paper is from that title? If what you say is anything different than the topic of your paper, then you need to shift it some.In the case of an argumentative essay, that not only means that you've presented what your topic is but also what your stance on that topic is.
Try it out on a parent. Ask her what she thinks the paper is about from your title.

, When you use an abbreviation in a title, you're going to confuse your reader. Reserve them for later in your essay when you can explain them.The exception to this rule is very common abbreviations.
For instance, using ""HIV"" probably wouldn't confuse your readers.

Title your essay.",How to Write a Synthesis Essay," The purpose of a synthesis essay is to make insightful connections between parts of a work, or multiple works, with the goal of ultimately presenting and supporting a claim about a topic. In other words, when you do research on a topic, you will look for connections that you can form into a solid perspective on a topic. The different types of synthesis essays can be categorized as follows:


Argument synthesis: This type of essay has a strong thesis statement that presents the writer's point of view. It organizes relevant information gathered from research in a logical manner to support the thesis' point of view. Business white papers known as position papers often take this form. This is the type of synthesis essay that students will write during the AP test.
Review: Often written as a preliminary essay to an argument synthesis, a review essay is a discussion of what has been written previously on a topic, with a critical analysis of the sources covered. Its unstated thesis is usually that more research needs to be done in that area or that the topic problem has not been adequately addressed. This type of paper is common in social science classes and in medicine.
Explanatory/background synthesis: This type of essay helps readers understand a topic by categorizing facts and presenting them to further the reader's understanding. It does not advocate a particular point of view, and if it has a thesis statement, the thesis is a weak one. Some business white papers take this form, although they are more likely to have a point of view, if understated.;
, Your topic should be broad enough for pulling several related sources together, but not so broad as to bring widely disparate sources together. If you have free choice on a topic, some preliminary reading may help you decide what to write about. However, if you're writing a synthesis essay for a class, you may be assigned a topic or have to pick it from a list.



Example of a broad topic narrowed down into a reasonable synthesis essay topic: Instead of the broad topic of Social Media, you could discuss your view on the effects texting has had on the English language.

, If you are taking the AP test, your sources will be provided for you. You'll usually want to select at least three sources for your essay, and possibly one or two more, depending on the amount of time you have to research and write it. Look for material within your sources that relates to the reason for writing your essay (what your argument is).

, Once you have read the sources you are provided with, or have done your own outside research, you will have to come up with an opinion on your topic. Your thesis will be the main idea presented in your essay. It should encompass the topic and state your point of view on that topic. It should be stated as a complete sentence. Depending on the essay, your thesis statement can be either the opening sentence of the essay itself or the last sentence of the first paragraph.



Example: Texting has had a positive impact on the English language as it has helped the millennial generation create their own form of the language.

, Go through your sources and pick out key quotes, statistics, ideas, and facts that support your thesis. As you find them, write them down. You will use these throughout your essay.


If you wish to take on a claim by an opponent of your idea, and to poke holes in it, you should also find some ideas or quotes that go against your thesis statement, and plan ways to disprove them.

Example: For the thesis statement listed above, excellent sources would include quotes from linguists discussing the new words that have developed through ‘text-speak’, statistics that show the English language has evolved with almost every generation, and facts that show students still have the ability to write with the use of grammar and spelling (which your opponents would bring up as the main reason texting has had a negative effect on the English language).

, You can either do this as a formal outline or just plan it in your head, but you need to decide how to present your material for best effect. If you are writing this paper for the AP test, know that the graders will be looking for a specific structure. This structure is as follows:


The introductory paragraph: 1. An introductory sentence that acts as a hook, capturing the reader’s interest. 2. Identification of the issue you will be discussing. 3. Your thesis statement.
The body paragraphs: 1. Topic sentence that gives one reason to support your thesis. 2. Your explanation and opinion of the topic sentence. 3. Support from your sources that backs up the claim you just made. 4. Explanation of the significance of the source(s).
The conclusion paragraph: 1. State further significance of your topic from the evidence and reasons you discussed in the essay. 2. A profound thought or thoughtful ending for your paper.

, If you are not writing this argumentative synthesis essay for the AP test, you should plan to use a more elaborate structure than the one listed above. You can use one or more of these approaches to develop your essay:


Example/illustration. This may be a detailed recount, summary, or direct quote from your source material that provides major support for your point of view. You may use more than one example or illustration, if your paper calls for it. You should not, however, make your paper a series of examples at the expense of supporting your thesis.
Straw man. With this technique, you present an argument opposed to the argument stated in your thesis, then show the weaknesses and flaws of the counter-argument. This format shows your awareness of the opposition and your readiness to answer it. You present the counter-argument right after your thesis, followed by the evidence to refute it, and end with a positive argument that supports your thesis.
Concession. Essays with concessions are structured similar to those using the straw man technique, but they acknowledge the validity of the counter-argument while showing that the original argument is stronger. This structure is good for presenting papers to readers who hold the opposing viewpoint.
Comparison and contrast. This structure compares similarities and contrasts differences between two subjects or sources to show the facets of both. Writing an essay with this structure requires a careful reading of your source material to find both subtle and major points of similarity and difference. This kind of essay can present its arguments source-by-source or by points of similarity or difference.

, While most synthesis essays are entirely focused on stating and supporting a thesis, background and review essays explore the ideas found in the sources rather than focusing on the author’s point of view. There are two basic ways to structure these sort of synthesis essays:


Summary. This structure presents summaries of each of your relevant sources, making a progressively stronger argument for your thesis. It provides specific evidence to support your point of view, but usually omits presenting your own opinions. It's most commonly used for background and review essays.
List of reasons. This is a series of sub-points that flow from the main point of your paper as stated in its thesis. Each reason is supported with evidence. As with the summary method, reasons should become progressively more important, with the most important reason last.

, Be prepared to deviate from your plan, however, if you find new ideas and information in your source material that supports your thesis. If you are writing the synthesis for the AP test, you will not have time to write more than one draft, so pace yourself and make it the best it can possibly be.Your essay should have an introductory paragraph that includes your thesis, a body to present evidence that supports your thesis, and a conclusion that summarizes your point of view.

, Writing in the third person means using ""he,"" ""she,"" ""it"", and using complete, unambiguous sentences. Present enough information to show your credibility in the subject of your essay. You should write in the active voice as much as possible, although passive voice is acceptable in circumstances where you would otherwise use first (""I"") or second person (""you"").

, Transitions are a great way to show places where your sources support one another: ""Hallstrom's theory on price-fixing is supported by Pennington's paper 'Cliffhanger Economics,' where she makes the following points:""


Lengthy quotes of three lines or more should generally be set off as block quotes to better call attention to them.

, This is the time to strengthen arguments and improve transitions between points and paragraphs. You should try to make your argument as succinct and easy to follow as possible. It helps to read your essay out loud because when you read out loud, you are more likely to notice awkward sentences or incoherent arguments.


Ask someone else to proofread your paper. The saying “two heads are better than one” still holds true. Ask a friend or colleague what would they add or remove from the paper. Most importantly, does your argument make sense, and is it clearly supported by your sources?

,


Read through your paper and look for any grammar, punctuation or spelling errors. Are all of the names and proper nouns spelled correctly? Are there any run-on sentences or fragments? Correct them as you go.
Read the paper aloud to guarantee that you don't accidentally add in or take out words when reading in your head.
If you can, get a friend or classmate to proofread your essay as well.

, For most papers, this means using footnotes to cite material in the body of your essay and a bibliography of cited works at the end. Footnotes and in-text citations should be used for any quoted, paraphrased, or cited material. If you are writing this essay for the AP test, you will not be using a specific style of citing but you will have to state which source you used after you cite it.



Example of citing in an AP synthesis essay: McPherson claims “texting has changed the English language in a positive way--it has given a new generation their own unique way to communicate” (Source E).
For college essays, you'll most likely use MLA format. Whichever format you use, be consistent in its use. You may also be asked to use APA or Chicago style.


, Your title should reflect the point of view in your thesis statement and supporting arguments. Choosing your title last helps assure that the title fits your essay instead of writing your essay to fit the title.

Start withholding only a little bit of sugar at a time.,
Start with small amounts for fillings.,
Prepare to experiment.",How to Reduce Sugar in Baked Goods1," Expect a lower amount of sugar to affect not only the taste, but the texture of baked goods as well. While you may be eager to cut back on sweetness, be conservative with how much sugar you leave out at first. Each time you bake a particular item, cut the recipe’s sugar by only a tenth. Then cut an additional tenth from the original amount the next time and compare the results.Continue cutting the sugar by tenths and testing each batch for both taste and texture. Once you make a batch where either one feels off, you’ll know you left out too much sugar.
To find the perfect amount to use sooner, you could also make several test batches all at once, each with a different percentage of the recommended sugar content.;
, If you’re making a baked good with a filling (like a cake, pie, or doughnut), do the reverse of what you did in the previous step. Instead of cutting back by small increments, start by adding only a fraction of the recommended sugar at a time to your filling. Mix it in with the other ingredients, and then taste-test. Continue adding small increments (again, say a tenth of the recommended amount) until it’s just the right amount of sweet.This works best when the filling contains other ingredients that are naturally sweet, like fruits. However, bear in mind that fruits with tart skins and/or bitter seeds will taste more sour after they’re baked.
With these, try adding an extra tenth of sugar to your filling in order to compensate.

, Keep in mind that the amount of sugar included in most recipes is there not only for the sake of taste, but other reasons as well. Whenever you start tinkering with the amount of sugar to be used, be prepared for it to take a few tries before you get a result that you like. So if you’re looking to perfect a recipe with less sugar in one weekend, be sure to buy enough ingredients to make multiple batches.The amount of sugar used affects a baked good’s taste, texture, and shelf life.The effect of the amount of sugar withheld will also vary depending on the other ingredients in a particular recipe.
This means that only using ⅓ of the recommended sugar in one cookie recipe may not work as well doing the same with another cookie recipe.

Choose a suitable technique for writing the notes out.,
Organise these notes, so that you will be able to work well from them as you start off writing your paper.,
Report what an author has said.,
Use paraphrasing to translate a sentence or a whole passage into other form/structure of words, most of the time using clear and to-the-point language, so it may be easily understood.,
Write a summary/commentary.",How to Take Notes for Your Research Paper," Whether you are using index cards or blank sheets, there are essentially three techniques (forms) to make use of when taking notes:


(i) direct quotation;
(ii) paraphrase; and
(iii) summary/commentary.

, This is known as the working bibliography. This is very helpful in the sense that it saves time and helps you later in compiling your bibliography or works-cited list.

, Quote the material verbatim, that is, word by word. Direct quotations reproduce an author’s exact words. This technique is used when the original wording is essential to understanding exact meaning, or otherwise interesting. That said, the author may be an expert or a key-figure in his/her area of expertise; therefore, he or she is quoted to avoid the possibility of misunderstanding.


For instance, in doing research on the difference between poetry and prose, you might tend to quote a passage from Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “A Defence of Poetry.” Since the distinction is succinctly stated there, a paraphrase would perhaps be a bit longer than the original, and probably less interestingly stated. Material as such ought to be quoted verbatim (directly): A poem is the very image of life expressed in the eternal truth. There is this difference between a story and a poem, that a story is a catalogue of detached facts, which have no other connection than time, place, circumstance, cause and effect; the other is the creation of actions according to unchangeable forms of human nature, as existing in the mind of the Creator, which is itself the image of all other minds.;
, It is a re-statement of the original passage. This technique can be used to paraphrase passages, diagrams, tables…etc. in terms of describing the elements of these aspects.


For example, in reading for a paper on economics, you frequently run across a number of tables of statistical data. Such tables should be quoted directly in entirety if all the items in them pertain to the specific topic you are exploring. There is no time to waste in copying parts of the tables that are not relevant to your study. A single line from the table may be all that is needed.

, Summarising and commenting is the third type of note-taking. A summary is needed when you want to keep track or record of the general idea of large amounts of material. Its purpose is to condense an extended idea or argument into considerably fewer words. And, therefore, you are compelled to omit less important details. If direct quotation is a re-production of the author’s exact words, the summary is a reproduction of the sense of the passage being summarised. Alongside, you might, in addition to summarising, want to comment on the passage you’re summarising. It’s a kind of combining both paraphrase and summary.

Do a basic internet search about the person.,
Go to the library and gather more information.,
Take notes.,

Have someone else edit your report.",How to Write a Report on a Famous Person," If you don't know anything about the person you are going to write about, it makes sense to do a basic online search of their name, so that you understand the basics of who they are. Pick your favorite internet search site and look the person up simply by typing in their name.


For most reports, this preliminary search will not give you sources that you want to cite in your paper. Instead, it will give you the basic information you need to do a more in-depth search for credible sources.Try not to cite sources in your paper that are created by non-experts or are sources that can be edited by anyone. However, these can be great jumping off points for further research.;
, Check out books from the library, search the library databases, and read newspaper or magazine articles. A good way to find out if you are finding all of the sources a library has to offer is to talk to a librarian about your project. They can steer you towards a wide variety of great and reliable sources.


When researching the subject, be careful to evaluate the credibility of your sources. If possible, use a variety of reliable sources to get the best information about the subject.As a general rule, you want information that has been created by experts on the person you are researching., It is one thing to read everything you find about a person, it's another to remember all that information and where you found it. This is why taking notes is so important. As you read a source, take notes about the important details. These notes will help you remember the information and they will be very important to refer to when you start to write your actual report.There are all kinds of different ways of taking notes and you will have to find the one that best suits you. Begin by writing the name of the source and then listing points or pieces of information as you find them. It's also good to note a page number, so that you can find the information again.
Some people like to take notes on paper and some people like to type them in a computer. Do whichever you prefer.

, Any person's life cannot be completely covered by one class report. Instead, you will want to give your reader all the basic information about the person, but spend most of your time looking into one particular aspect of the person.


For example, if you are researching Eleanor Roosevelt, you will want to know when she was born, who her parents and her husband were, and why she is famous. However, you will also want to focus most of your attention on looking into one aspect of her life. Perhaps it is her time as First Lady of the United States or her work for women's rights. Whatever you find most interesting, that should be your real focus.
You could also pick the aspect of the person that you relate to most. For example, perhaps you are most drawn to Elvis Presley because he spent time in the military. You could write your report about his time in the military.

, You will want to keep track of where you get all of your information.This is because when you write about that information, whether it be when the person live or died, or where they were raised, you need to tell your reader where to acquired that information. This is done with a citation, which lists the source of the information.


Ask your teacher if they want citations and how they would like you to include them. Citations can come in a wide variety of forms, so it's important to understand what exactly your teacher expects.
Your teacher may also want to you to write a bibliography as well. This is simply a list, in a specific form, of all of the books or websites you referred to or used in your report. Making a list of all of your sources as you do your research will make the bibliography easier to make at the end.

, This is a rough plan for the report that will help you to organize your thoughts and it will actually make writing the actual paper easier.Begin with your main point. This should be the main subject of the introduction. Then list sub points, these are the specific topics of the body paragraphs of the report. The sub points are usually all the ways that you can prove your main overarching point.


For example, if your main point about The Beatles is that they were the most popular band in the 1960s, you will say that in the introduction and then the point of every following paragraph will be to support that assertion. You may have a paragraph about album sales, a paragraph about huge concerts, and a paragraph about their huge number of fans and fan clubs.
The outline can be created in any form you like. Some people just like to start listing points they want to make in any order and then reorganize later, while others create a very structured outline that lays out the organization of the paper in detail.
You can also list an outline for the conclusion but the conclusion usually just reiterates the main point brought up in the introduction.

, Start your introduction by using an attention grabbing statement or startling fact to draw the reader's attention. Also be sure to include significant information about this person in the introduction, so that a reader who doesn't know who this person is can have a bit more information.


You also need to introduce your main point. This should be a topic sentence that usually goes toward the end of the introduction. It is usually located at the end so that you can build up to it.
Include when and where this person was born in the introduction but consider waiting until the end of your report to discuss when he or she died, if they are not alive.
Don't address the person by his or her first name. It sounds very unprofessional. In your introduction, you may call them by their full name, but you must use their last name throughout the rest of the paper.

, These will be the sentences that make the clear point of each paragraph. The rest of the paragraph, after this topic sentence, will be all about proving the point of the topic sentence.


For example, if the point of one paragraph is that The Beatles sold more albums than other artists in the 1960s, state that as the topic sentence.
Another example could be if your point is that Martin Luther King was a strong public speaker you could write, ""Martin Luther King was a bold, provocative, and persuasive public speaker.""
Don't mince words about your point. State it clearly and strongly.
Each paragraph needs to have a topic sentence. If you think your paragraph doesn't have one, then you need to do some editing., If you are new to writing reports, try giving three examples to support your topic sentence for each paragraph. This could include specific information, such as dates or figures, that you found during your research for the report.Each example you give to prove your paragraphs point, which is the topic sentence, should itself be in a separate sentence. This means that your paragraphs should be from 4 to 5 sentences long, at least.
Giving specific examples in the body of a paragraph really helps you prove the point of the paragraph. Instead of giving your opinion, back up your points with facts.
How many paragraphs you need for your report will vary. The basic structure you can use most of the time for an essay is five paragraphs, with one introductory paragraph, three body paragraphs, and one concluding paragraph.However, your teacher may give you a number of pages that you need to write. In that case, you may need to either expand your three body paragraphs or increase the number of body paragraphs you include.

, Restate your three main points, and conclude your paper with a sentence stating the significance of the person, which was the topic sentence of your introduction. The purpose of the conclusion is simply to restate your assertions and how you proved them, so that the reader goes away with a clear picture of what your report was about.


Begin the concluding paragraph with a rephrasing of the main point and your examples of why it is true. For instance, in a essay on The Beatles popularity, you could state, ""Clearly, The Beatles staggering record sales, huge fan base, and enduring legacy illustrate the bands lasting importance.""
In some cases, the conclusion may remind the reader of your attention grabbing sentence used in the intro.
Don't introduce new information in your conclusion. If you are tempted to, find a place to include it in the body of the essay instead.

, When you read, pretend that you don't know anything about the subject and your are learning about it for the first time. Does your report explain who the person is and why they are important? Can someone who has never heard of the person you are reporting on get a clear picture of the person from your report?If you think you need to explain your subject a little more, take the time to do it. You have spent a lot of time already on your report, it's worth a little more time to make it the best it can be.
After you're done writing your paper, it's a good idea to read it out loud to catch mistakes. This will help you to catch areas of your writing that are awkward or confusing., When reading over your report you also want to make sure that the grammar and spelling is correct. Most word processing programs have a spell check function built in, so that will have caught many of the typos you made while you typed. However, its important to look it over yourself to make sure your grammar correct and that you have used all of the right words.For example, did you use the right version of the word ""there"" throughout your paper? Did you mean ""there,"" ""their,"" or ""they're?"" A spell check program will not catch it if you used the wrong version of a word with multiple spellings.

, It is not ""cheating"" to have someone edit your paper, unless your teacher specifically prohibits it. Instead, getting the help and input of others in an important part of the writing process and of becoming a better writer.


Getting editing help and the perspective of other people will only make you a better writer. If you get a lot of feedback, meaning the person reading your paper suggests a lot of editing, don't take it personally. They are only trying to help make your report the best it can be.
Consider having a parent or a classmate read over your report. If you have a classmate do it, offer to read over their paper in exchange for them reading over yours.

Be cautious with agave and honey.,
Use xylitol to make life easy.,
Experiment with stevia.",How to Reduce Sugar in Baked Goods2," Although these are often referred to as “sugar substitutes,” recognize that label as being slightly misleading. Use these only for the added benefit of vitamins and minerals not found in regular granulated sugar. At the same time, keep in mind that “substitute” in this case only means substituting one form of sugar for another. Remember that these are “healthier” only in the sense that they contain more nutrients, while still containing sugar. The same applies to:Coconut sugar
Golden syrup
Maple syrup
Rice syrup

, Xylitol is a natural sweetener derived from trees, fruits, and vegetables. If you hate to convert measurements or want to make as few test batches as possible, use this instead of sugar. Not only does it contain fewer calories, but equal portions of xylitol and sugar are equally sweet, so simply measure an equal amount of xylitol that the recipe calls for in sugar. However, be aware that:Xylitol won’t add the same amount of coloring as sugar would when baked.
Although it works well in most recipes, it isn’t a good sugar-substitute for those who use sugar as a leavening agent.
In large amounts, xylitol works as a laxative, so don’t pig out on your finished goods.
Xylitol is toxic to dogs, so don't feed them any baked goods made with it.

, If xylitol turns you off, try this instead to reduce the number of calories in your baked goods. However, keep in mind that a little bit goes a very, very, very long way. As many as 300 parts sugar would be needed to equal 1 part stevia, so expect to use drastically smaller amounts of stevia than the recipe calls for in sugar. With this in mind:Monkeying with sugar-based recipes on your own may require a lot of trial and error.
Baked goods that utilize sugar for more than just taste may be drastically affected in terms of texture and moistness.
Searching for stevia-specific recipes may be a more effective use of time and resources.
Stevia also has a licorice-like taste, which may affect the overall flavor of your finished bake."
"
Use cacao, not cocoa.,
Reduce sugar in toppings.,
Avoid refined flour.",How to Reduce Sugar in Baked Goods3," Whenever a recipe calls for chocolate (or cocoa), use cacao instead. This is the rawest form of chocolate, so opt for this instead of a more refined “cocoa” product, which will most likely contain added sugars. Cacao can be purchased in such form as as:Nibs or chips
Butter
Powder
Paste

, Say you’ve tinkered with reducing sugar from your favorite cake recipe, but found you couldn’t cut as much out as you hoped before it start affecting the texture and moisture. In that case, compensate by eliminating as much sugar as you can from your icing or frosting. Do this by using:Less sugar than the recipe calls for in your topping. Unlike baking, this should only affect its taste.
Sugar-free substitutes to make your topping just as sweet as you like with fewer calories.
Using alternate toppings for added flavor, like cream cheese, cacao powder, and cinnamon.

, Again, if your experiments still result in more sugar than desired, compensate by being picky about which flour you use with it. Expect refined flours to cause blood sugar levels to spike once they’re digested. Since the sugar in your recipe will likely do the same, minimize the effect by using wholemeal flour instead.The issue with flour isn’t the amount of sugar in it, because there isn’t any. Instead, the issue is how long it takes to digest.
Wholemeal flour takes longer to digest than refined flour, which can help reduce the “sugar-high” sensation after you feel after eating.

Before you begin writing your seminar paper, it is important to make sure that you understand how a seminar paper differs from a research paper. Unlike a basic research paper, a seminar paper also requires:an argument that makes an original contribution to the existing scholarship on your subject
extensive research that supports your argument
extensive footnotes or endnotes (depending on the documentation style you are using);
, While you may have written many papers in the past, it is important to make sure that you understand the details of your current assignment before you get started. As soon as your professor assigns the paper, read the guidelines carefully and highlight anything that you do not understand. Ask your professor to clarify the instructions if anything seems unclear or if you just don’t understand the assignment. You may also consider talking to your professor about your intended topic to make sure that you are on the right track.Make sure that you understand how to cite your sources for the paper and how to use the documentation style your professor prefers.
Don’t feel bad if you have questions. It is better to ask and make sure that you understand than to do the assignment wrong and get a bad grade.

, Your professor will be expecting original analysis, extensive research, and excellent writing. Therefore, it is important that you get started early and do the best work that you can do. Begin working on the paper as soon as it is assigned and take advantage of your university’s writing center for extra help.


Do not attempt to research and write a seminar in just a few days. This type of paper requires extensive research, so you will need to plan ahead. Get started as early as possible., Before you begin writing your paper, you should take some time to explore your ideas and get some things down on paper. As with other types of writing, basic invention activities like listing, freewriting, clustering, and questioning can help you to develop ideas for your seminar paper.Listing List all of the ideas that you have for your essay (good or bad) and then look over the list you have made and group similar ideas together. Expand those lists by adding more ideas or by using another prewriting activity.Freewriting Write nonstop for about 10 minutes. Write whatever comes to mind and don’t edit yourself. When you are done, review what you have written and highlight or underline the most useful information. Repeat the freewriting exercise using the passages you underlined as a starting point. You can repeat this exercise multiple times to continue to refine and develop your ideas.Clustering Write a brief explanation (phrase or short sentence) of the subject of your seminar paper on the center of a piece of paper and circle it. Then draw three or more lines extending from the circle. Write a corresponding idea at the end of each of these lines. Continue developing your cluster until you have explored as many connections as you can.Questioning On a piece of paper, write out “Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?” Space the questions about two or three lines apart on the paper so that you can write your answers on these lines. Respond to each question in as much detail as you can., A research question is what you will attempt to answer with your research. Creating a research question will help you to stay focused as you research your topic. It can also serve as the starting point for your thesis later on.For example, if you wanted to know more about the uses of religious relics in medieval England, you might start with something like “How were relics used in medieval England?” The information that you gather on this subject might lead you to develop a thesis about the role or importance of relics in medieval England.
Keep your research question simple and focused. Just try not to make it so focused that it is difficult to find any information on the subject. You can always narrow your question a bit if you are turning up too much information.

, In order to find support for your argument, you will need to gather information from a variety of sources. See your assignment guidelines or ask your instructor if you have questions about the types of sources that are appropriate for your seminar paper. Books, articles from scholarly journals, magazine articles, newspaper articles, and trustworthy websites are some sources that you might consider using. You might begin by doing some background research and then move into some more focused research as you learn more about your topic.Use your library’s databases rather than a general internet search. University libraries subscribe to many databases. These databases provide you with free access to articles and other resources that you cannot usually gain access to by using a search engine.

, It is important to use only trustworthy sources in a seminar paper, otherwise you will damage your own credibility as an author. Using the library’s databases will also help to ensure that you are getting plenty of trustworthy sources for your paper. There are several things that you will need to consider in order to determine whether or not a source is trustworthy.Author's credentials Choose sources that include an author’s name and that provide credentials for that author. The credentials should indicate something about why this person is qualified to speak as an authority on the subject. For example, an article about a medical condition will be more trustworthy if the author is a medical doctor. If you find a source where no author is listed or the author does not have any credentials, then this source may not be trustworthy.Citations Think about whether or not this author has adequately researched the topic. Check the author’s bibliography or works cited page. If the author has provided few or no sources, then this source may not be trustworthy.Bias Think about whether or not this author has presented an objective, well-reasoned account of the topic. How often does the tone indicate a strong preference for one side of the argument? How often does the argument dismiss or disregard the opposition’s concerns or valid arguments? If these are regular occurrences in the source, then it may not be a good choice.Publication date Think about whether or not this source presents the most up to date information on the subject. Noting the publication date is especially important for scientific subjects, since new technologies and techniques have made some earlier findings irrelevant.Information provided in the source If you are still questioning the trustworthiness of this source, cross check some of the information provided against a trustworthy source. If the information that this author presents contradicts one of your trustworthy sources, then it might not be a good source to use in your paper., Once you have gathered all of your sources, you will need to read them. Read your sources very carefully. Read the sources multiple times if necessary and make sure that you fully understand them. Misunderstanding and misrepresenting your sources can damage your credibility as an author and also have a negative effect on your grade.


Give yourself plenty of time to read your sources and work to understand what they are saying. Ask your professor for clarification if something is unclear to you.

, Highlight and underline significant passages so that you can easily come back to them. As you read, you should also pull any significant information from your sources by jotting the information down in a notebook. Indicate when you have quoted a source word for word in your notes by putting it into quotation marks and including information about the source such as the author’s name, article or book title, and page number.


Be careful to properly cite your sources when taking notes. Even accidental plagiarism may result in a failing grade on a paper.

, Once you have developed your ideas for your seminar paper and read your sources, you should be ready to write your thesis statement.Effective thesis statements express your argument in a clear, direct manner. Remember that a thesis should not be more than one sentence in length.Make sure that your thesis presents an original point of view. Since seminar papers are advanced writing projects, be certain that your thesis presents a perspective that is advanced and original.For example, if you conducted your research on the uses of relics in medieval England, your thesis might be, “Medieval English religious relics were often used in ways that are more pagan than Christian.”

, Writing an outline before you begin drafting your seminar paper will help you organize your information more effectively. You can make your outline as detailed or as scant as you want. Just keep in mind that the more detail you include in your outline, the more material you will have ready to put into your paper.Organize your outline by essay part and then break those parts into subsections. For example, part 1 might be your introduction, which could then be broken into three sub-parts: a)opening sentence, b)context/background information c)thesis statement.

, Your first sentence should be interesting enough that your readers will want to know more. Your introduction should also be engaging. Begin discussing your topic right away and help your readers understand your position in the first paragraph of your paper. Think about what you will discuss in the rest of your paper in order to help you determine what you should include in your introduction. For example, in a paper about medieval relics, you might open with a surprising example of how relics were used or a vivid description of an unusual relic.
Keep in mind that your introduction should identify the main idea of your seminar paper and act as a preview to the rest of your paper.

, Providing adequate background information or context will help to guide your readers through your essay. Think about what your readers will need to know in order to understand the rest of your paper and provide this information in your first paragraph. Do your readers need to know about the history of your subject? Do they need to know what other scholars have written on the subject? The information your readers will need to know will depend on your subject and the argument you plan to make.For example, in a paper about relics in medieval England, you might want to offer your readers examples of the types of relics and how they were used. What purpose did they serve? Where were they kept? Who was allowed to have relics? Why did people value relics?
Keep in mind that your background information should be used to help your readers understand your point of view., Rather than trying to talk about multiple aspects of your topic in a single paragraph, make sure that each body paragraph focuses on a single claim or piece of evidence. Your discussion of each of these separate items should help to prove your thesis.For each body paragraph, you should do the following:


Remember to use topic sentences to structure your paragraphs. Provide a claim at the beginning of each paragraph. Then, support your claim with at least one example from one of your sources. Remember to discuss each piece of evidence in detail so that your readers will understand the point that you are trying to make.

, Since seminar papers are often upwards of 10 pages, many writers use headings and/or subheadings to help organize their paper. These headings/subheadings help readers follow your argument by showing them what each section is about before they start reading.


For example, in a paper on medieval relics, you might include a heading titled “Uses of Relics” and subheadings titled “Religious Uses”, “Domestic Uses”, “Medical Uses”, etc.

, Concluding a seminar paper can be difficult, especially if you have presented a long, complex argument. There are several ways that you can conclude that will be helpful and interesting to your readers. Before you write your conclusion, spend some time reflecting on what you have written and try to determine the most logical way to end your paper. Some possibilities for concluding your paper include:



Synthesize what you have discussed. Put everything together for your readers and explain what other lessons might be gained from your argument. How might this discussion change the way others view your subject?

Explain why your topic matters. Help your readers to see why this topic deserve their attention. How does this topic affect your readers? What are the broader implications of this topic? Why does your topic matter?

Return to your opening discussion. If you offered an anecdote or a quote early in your paper, it might be helpful to revisit that opening discussion and explore how the information you have gathered implicates that discussion., Follow your instructor's directions for making your bibliography. Make sure that you use the correct style and that you have cited all of your sources. Before you finish with your essay, you will need to make sure that you have cited all of your sources. Not citing sources using in-text citations or a works cited page may be considered plagiarism and lead to failure of the paper or even the course.Ask your professor what documentation style he or she prefers that you use if you are not sure.
Visit your school’s writing center for additional help with your works cited page and in-text citations.

, Just as you should plan to begin working on your paper as early as possible, you should also plan to finish early.You will need to allow yourself plenty of time to do a thorough revision of your paper, so plan to finish your paper at least a few days before the due date. Giving yourself plenty of time can help you avoid simple mistakes as well as some major problems such as poor logic or faulty arguments.

, By taking a break after you have finished drafting your paper, you will give your brain a rest. When you revisit the draft, you will have a fresh perspective. It is important to begin writing a paper far enough ahead of time to allow yourself a few days or even a week to revise before it is due. If you do not allow yourself this extra time, you will be more prone to making simple mistakes and your grade may suffer as a result., Revision is different from proofreading. When you revise your paper, you are thinking about the content and consider how you might improve the content. Proofreading helps you correct minor problems such as grammar and punctuation errors. As you revise your paper, you should consider multiple aspects of your writing to make sure that your readers will be able to understand what you have written. Consider the following questions as you revise:


What is your main point? How might you clarify your main point?
Who is your audience? Have you considered their needs and expectations?
What is your purpose? Have you accomplished your purpose with this paper?
How effective is your evidence? How might your strengthen your evidence?
Does every part of your paper relate back to your thesis? How might you improve these connections?
Is anything confusing about your language or organization? How might your clarify your language or organization?
Have you made any errors with grammar, punctuation, or spelling? How can you correct these errors?
What might someone who disagrees with you say about your paper? How can you address these opposing arguments in your paper?, Read your paper out loud to make sure that it is polished and ready for your professor to read it. Use your final read through as a chance to weed out any typos, grammatical errors, wordy or incomplete sentences, and other minor mistakes that may have a negative effect on your grade. Highlight or circle these errors and revise as necessary before printing your final copy.

Proofread carefully.",How to Write a Persuasive Essay," The thesis statement is your argument boiled down to one sentence. For a persuasive essay, this statement needs to take a strong, active stance on the issue. Don't try and play both sides and be wishy-washy -- it won't persuade anyone.



Good: ""Affirmative action relegates minorities to ""helpless"" status, keeps the best minds from the best positions, and should be eliminated.""

Bad: ""Affirmative action does help many minorities, but it hurts some other groups as well.""
Note that you can persuade people to be open-minded. Saying ""affirmative action is a nuanced issue in need or serious overhaul, not to be destroyed or continued completely,"" still shows you taking a strong, defendable stance.;
, Consider the beginning of each paragraph as a mini-thesis statement. This allows your argument to flow cohesively. You build the argument brick by brick for the reader so there is no confusion.



Good: ""The destruction of the world's rainforests also destroys the incredible potential to find medical and scientific breakthroughs in the diverse, mysterious ecosystem.""

Good: ""The rainforest is home to a wide variety of plants and animals that may have medical and scientific benefits -- benefits we lose if we keep destroying it.""

Bad: ""Destroying the rainforest is not a good thing.""

, The best rule of thumb is, whenever you make a claim or point that isn't common sense, you need to back it up. One of the best ways to do this, however, is in reverse. Let the evidence lead to your arguments -- bringing the reader with you.



Good: ""A recent poll shows that 51% of young white millennials believe they suffer as much discrimination as minorities. Young white millennials may believe in having racial equality, but they also believe that they've already found it.Good: ""Equality and liberty aren't just good for individuals, they're good for society. Furthermore, the lack of this liberty is said to be “a source of perversion and demoralization” to everyone involved, and prevents “any really vital improvement... in the social condition of the human race” (Mill, 98).

Bad: ""The prisons system has kept dangerous drugs and criminals off the streets, and Americans are definitely safer because of it."" Unless you back it up, this claim is meaningless.


, Only make one point or argument in each sentence. You want the reader to be able to build the argument logically, but this is impossible if they get lost in the weeds.



Good: While the United States’ founding fathers were intellectual, the same could not be said for the majority of the populace. Education was the right of the wealthy, and achieved through expensive private schools or tutors. In the early 1800’s, Horace Mann of Massachusetts devoted himself to rectifying that situation.

Good: Public education is no longer a priority in this country. As it stands, only 2% of tax dollars go to schools.Clearly, we need to find a way to increase this budget if we expect to see any real improvement in our education system.

Bad: The United States was not an educated nation, since education was considered the right of the wealthy, and so in the early 1800's Horace Mann decided to try and rectify the situation., The art of persuasion has been studied since ancient Greece. While it takes a lifetime to master, learning the tricks and tools will make you a better writer almost immediately. For example, on a paper about allowing Syrian refugees, you could use:



Repetition: Keep hammering on your thesis. Tell them what you're telling them, tell them it, then tell them what you told them. They'll get the point by the end.

Example: Time and time again, the statistics don't lie -- we need to open our doors to help refugees.



Social Validation: Quotations reinforce that you aren't the only one making this point. It tells people that, socially, if they want to fit in, they need to consider your viewpoint.

Example: ""Let us not forget the words etched on our grandest national monument, the Statue of Liberty, which asks that we ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” There is no reason why Syrians are not included in this.



Agitation of the Problem: Before offering solutions, show them how bad things are. Give them a reason to care about your argument.Example: ""Over 100 million refugees have been displaced. President Assad has not only stolen power, he's gassed and bombed his own citizens. He has defied the Geneva Conventions, long held as a standard of decency and basic human rights, and his people have no choice by to flee.""



, You need to sound an expert, and like you should be trustworthy. Cut out small words or wishy-washy phrase to adopt a tone of authority.Good: ""Time and time again, science has shown that arctic drilling is dangerous. It is not worth the risks environmentally or economically.""

Good: ""Without pushing ourselves to energy independence, in the arctic and elsewhere, we open ourselves up to the dangerous dependency that spiked gas prices in the 80's.""

Bad: ""Arctic drilling may not be perfect, but it will probably help us stop using foreign oil at some point. This, I imagine, will be a good thing.""

, Persuasion is about upending commonly held thoughts and forcing the reader to reevaluate. While you never want to be crass or confrontational, you need to poke into the reader's potential concerns.



Good: Does anyone think that ruining someone’s semester, or, at least, the chance to go abroad, should be the result of a victimless crime? Is it fair that we actively promote drinking as a legitimate alternative through Campus Socials and a lack of consequences? How long can we use the excuse that “just because it’s safer than alcohol doesn’t mean we should make it legal,” disregarding the fact that the worst effects of the drug are not physical or chemical, but institutional?

Good: We all want less crime, stronger families, and fewer dangerous confrontations over drugs. We need to ask ourselves, however, if we're willing to challenge the status quo to get those results.

Bad: This policy makes us look stupid. It is not based in fact, and the people that believe it are delusional at best, and villains at worst.

, While the majority of your essay should be kept to your own argument, you'll bullet-proof your case if you can see and disprove the arguments against you. Save this for the second to last paragraph, in general.



Good: It is true that guns can be used to protect you against threats. However, it has been proven time and time again that you are more likely to hurt yourself with a gun than protect you against someone else.

Good: While people do have accidents with guns in their homes, it is not the governments responsibility to police people from themselves. If they're going to hurt themselves, that is their right.

Bad: The only obvious solution is to ban guns. There is no other argument that matters.

, In most cases, you will be given a specific assignment for your persuasive essay. It’s important to read the prompt carefully and thoroughly.Look for language that gives you a clue as to whether you are writing a purely persuasive or an argumentative essay. For example, if the prompt uses words like “personal experience” or “personal observations,” you know that these things can be used to support your argument.On the other hand, words like “defend” or “argue” suggest that you should be writing an argumentative essay, which may require more formal, less personal evidence.
If you aren’t sure about what you’re supposed to write, ask your instructor.

, If you can, make the time to craft an argument you'll enjoy writing. A rushed essay isn’t likely to persuade anyone. Allow yourself enough time to brainstorm, write, and edit.


Whenever possible, start early. This way, even if you have emergencies like a computer meltdown, you’ve given yourself enough time to complete your essay.

, All writing has a rhetorical situation, which has five basic elements: the text (here, your essay), the author (you), the audience, the purpose of the communication, and the setting.The text should be clear and well-supported with evidence (and considered opinion, if it’s allowed).
You should always add a rhetorical question in your persuasive text, for example: how would you feel if someone littered your home with rubbish?, Would you like it if someone polluted your home and etc. Rhetorical questions are a type of question that do not need to be answered.
Opinion is a good way to persuade someone, and some examples of an opinion is like I believe dogs are better than cats. Or like country life is better than city life and etc.
You, as the author, need to retain credibility by doing necessary research, stating your claims clearly, and providing a fair argument that doesn’t misrepresent facts or situations.
The purpose of the communication here is to convince your readers that your view on your topic is the most correct one.The setting varies. In many cases, the setting will be a classroom assignment that you turn in for a grade.

, Unless your prompt or assignment states otherwise, you’ll need to follow some basic conventions when writing your persuasive essay.


Persuasive essays, like argumentative essays, use rhetorical devices to persuade their readers. In persuasive essays, you generally have more freedom to make appeals to emotion (pathos), in addition to logic and data (logos) and credibility (ethos).You should use multiple types of evidence carefully when writing a persuasive essay. Logical appeals such as presenting data, facts, and other types of “hard” evidence are often very convincing to readers.
Persuasive essays generally have very clear thesis statements that make your opinion or chosen “side” known upfront. This helps your reader know exactly what you are arguing., What’s persuasive to one person may not be persuasive to another. For this reason, it’s crucial to consider to whom you are targeting your essay. Obviously, your instructor is your primary audience, but consider who else might find your argument convincing.For example, if you are arguing against unhealthy school lunches, you might take very different approaches depending on whom you want to convince. You might target the school administrators, in which case you could make a case about student productivity and healthy food. If you targeted students’ parents, you might make a case about their children’s health and the potential costs of healthcare to treat conditions caused by unhealthy food. And if you were to consider a “grassroots” movement among your fellow students, you’d probably make appeals based on personal preferences.

, You may have a topic assigned to you. However, if you have to choose your own, there are a few things to consider:

,

Pick something that appeals to you. Because a persuasive essay often relies heavily on emotional appeals, you should choose to write on something about which you have a real opinion. Pick a subject about which you feel strongly and can argue convincingly.
Look for a topic that has a lot of depth or complexity. You may feel incredibly passionate about pizza, but it may be difficult to write an interesting essay on it. A subject that you're interested in but which has a lot of depth — like animal cruelty or government earmarking — will make for better subject material.
Begin to consider opposing viewpoints when thinking about your essay. If you think it will be hard to come up with arguments against your topic, your opinion might not be controversial enough to make it into a persuasive essay. On the other hand, if there are too many arguments against your opinion that will be hard to debunk, you might choose a topic that is easier to refute.
Make sure you can remain balanced. A good persuasive essay will consider the counterarguments and find ways to convince readers that the opinion presented in your essay is the preferable one. Make sure you choose a topic about which you’re prepared to thoroughly, fairly consider counterarguments. (For this reason, topics such as religion usually aren’t a good idea for persuasive essays, because you’re incredibly unlikely to persuade someone away from their own religious beliefs.)
Keep your focus manageable. Your essay is likely to be fairly short; it may be 5 paragraphs or several pages, but you need to keep a narrow focus so that you can adequately explore your topic. For example, an essay that attempts to persuade your readers that war is wrong is unlikely to be successful, because that topic is huge. Choosing a smaller bit of that topic -- for example, that drone strikes are wrong -- will give you more time to delve deeply into your evidence., Your thesis statement presents your opinion or argument in clear language. It is usually placed at the end of the introductory paragraph. For a persuasive essay, it’s especially important that you present your argument in clear language that lets your readers know exactly what to expect.It also should present the organization of your essay. Don’t list your points in one order and then discuss them in a different order.
For example, a thesis statement could look like this: “Although pre-prepared and highly processed foods are cheap, they aren’t good for students. It is important for schools to provide fresh, healthy meals to students, even when they cost more. Healthy school lunches can make a huge difference in students’ lives, and not offering healthy lunches fails students.”
Note that this thesis statement isn’t a three-prong thesis. You don’t have to state every subpoint you will make in your thesis (unless your prompt or assignment says to). You do need to convey exactly what you will argue.

, Once you have chosen your topic, do as much preparation as you can before you write your essay. This means you need to examine why you have your opinion and what evidence you find most compelling. Here’s also where you look for counterarguments that could refute your point.A mind map could be helpful. Start with your central topic and draw a box around it. Then, arrange other ideas you think of in smaller bubbles around it. Connect the bubbles to reveal patterns and identify how ideas relate.Don’t worry about having fully fleshed-out ideas at this stage. Generating ideas is the most important step here.

, Once you have your ideas together, you may discover that some of them need research to support them. Doing your research before you begin “writing” your essay will make the writing process go smoothly.


For example, if you’re arguing for healthier school lunches, you could make a point that fresh, natural food tastes better. This is personal opinion and doesn’t need research to support it. However, if you wanted to argue that fresh food has more vitamins and nutrients than processed food, you’d need a reliable source to support that claim.
If you have a librarian available, consult with him or her! Librarians are an excellent resource to help guide you to credible research.

, Persuasive essays generally have a very clear format, which helps you present your argument in a clear and compelling way. Here are the elements of persuasive essays:An introduction. You should present a “hook” here that grabs your audience’s attention. You should also provide your thesis statement, which is a clear statement of what you will argue or attempt to convince the reader of.
Body paragraphs. In 5-paragraph essays, you’ll have 3 body paragraphs. In other essays, you can have as many paragraphs as you need to make your argument. Regardless of their number, each body paragraph needs to focus on one main idea and provide evidence to support it. These paragraphs are also where you refute any counterpoints that you’ve discovered.
Conclusion. Your conclusion is where you tie it all together. It can include an appeal to emotions, reiterate the most compelling evidence, or expand the relevance of your initial idea to a broader context. Because your purpose is to persuade your readers to do/think something, end with a call to action.

, Your hook is a first sentence that draws the reader in. Your hook can be a question or a quotation, a fact or an anecdote, a definition or a humorous sketch. As long as it makes the reader want to continue reading, or sets the stage, you've done your job.For example, you could start an essay on the necessity of pursuing alternative energy sources like this: “Imagine a world without polar bears.” This is a vivid statement that draws on something that many readers are familiar with and enjoy (polar bears). It also encourages the reader to continue reading to learn why they should imagine this world.
You may find that you don’t immediately have a hook. Don’t get stuck on this step! You can always press on and come back to it after you’ve drafted your essay.

, Many people believe that your introduction is the most important part of the essay, because it either grabs or loses the reader's attention. A good introduction will tell the reader just enough about your essay to draw them in and make them want to continue reading.Put your hook first. Then, proceed to move from general ideas to specific ideas until you have built up to your thesis statement.Don't slack on your thesis statement. Your thesis statement is a short summary of what you're arguing for. It's usually one sentence, and it's near the end of your introductory paragraph. Make your thesis a combination of your most persuasive arguments, or a single powerful argument, for the best effect.

, At a minimum, write three paragraphs for the body of the essay. Each paragraph should cover a single main point that relates back to a part of your argument. These body paragraphs are where you justify your opinions and lay out your evidence. Remember that if you don't provide evidence, your argument might not be as persuasive.Start with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main point of your paragraph.
Make your evidence clear and precise. For example, don't just say: ""Dolphins are very smart animals. They are widely recognized as being incredibly smart."" Instead, say: ""Dolphins are very smart animals. Multiple studies found that dolphins worked in tandem with humans to catch prey. Very few, if any, species have developed mutually symbiotic relationships with humans.""
When you can, use facts as your evidence. Agreed-upon facts from reliable sources give people something to hold onto. If possible, use facts from different angles to support one argument. For example:

""The South, which accounts for 80% of all executions in the United States, still has the country's highest murder rate. This makes a case against the death penalty working as a deterrent.""
""Additionally, states without the death penalty have fewer murders. If the death penalty were indeed a deterrent, why wouldn't we see an increase in murders in states without the death penalty?""


Consider how your body paragraphs flow together. You want to make sure that your argument feels like it's building, one point upon another, rather than feeling scattered.

, In order to establish flow in your essay, you want there to be a natural transition from the end of one paragraph to the beginning of the next. Here is one example:End of the first paragraph: ""If the death penalty consistently fails to deter crime, and crime is at an all-time high, what happens when someone is wrongfully convicted?""
Beginning of the second paragraph: ""Over 100 wrongfully convicted death row inmates have been acquitted of their crimes, some just minutes before their would-be death.""

, You might not be required to do this, but it makes your essay stronger. Imagine you have an opponent who's arguing the exact opposite of what you're arguing. Think of one or two of their strongest arguments and come up with a counterargument to rebut it.


Example: ""Critics of a policy allowing students to bring snacks into the classroom say that it would create too much distraction, reducing students’ ability to learn. However, consider the fact that middle schoolers are growing at an incredible rate. Their bodies need energy, and their minds may become fatigued if they go for long periods without eating. Allowing snacks in the classroom will actually increase students’ ability to focus by taking away the distraction of hunger.”
You may even find it effective to begin your paragraph with the counterargument, then follow by refuting it and offering your own argument.

, As a general rule, it's a good idea to restate each of your main points and end the whole paper with a probing thought. If it's something your reader won't easily forget, your essay will have a more lasting impression. Don’t just restate the thesis; think about how you will leave your reader.Here are some things to consider:How could this argument be applied to a broader context?
Why does this argument or opinion mean something to me?
What further questions has my argument raised?
What action could readers take after reading my essay?

, If you've planned ahead, this won't be hard. Then, come back to the essay after a day or two and look it over. The rest will give you a fresh set of eyes and help you spot errors. Any tricky language or ideas that needed time might be revisited then.

, A common error with many student writers is not spending enough time revisiting a first draft. Read through your essay from start to finish. Consider the following:Does the essay state its position clearly?
Is this position supported throughout with evidence and examples?
Are paragraphs bogged down by extraneous information? Do paragraphs focus on one main idea?
Are any counterarguments presented fairly, without misrepresentation? Are they convincingly dismissed?
Are the paragraphs in an order that flows logically and builds an argument step-by-step?
Does the conclusion convey the importance of the position and urge the reader to do/think something?

, Revision is more than simple proofreading. You may need to touch up your transitions, move paragraphs around for better flow, or even draft new paragraphs with new, more compelling evidence. Be willing to make even major changes to improve your essay.


You may find it helpful to ask a trusted friend or classmate to look at your essay. If s/he has trouble understanding your argument or finds things unclear, focus your revision on those spots.

, Use the spell checker on your computer to check the spellings of the words (if applicable). Read through your essay aloud, reading exactly what is on the page. This will help you catch proofreading errors.


You may find it helpful to print out your draft and mark it up with a pen or pencil. When you write on the computer, your eyes may become so used to reading what you think you’ve written that they skip over errors. Working with a physical copy forces you to pay attention in a new way.
Make sure to also format your essay correctly. For example, many instructors stipulate the margin width and font type you should use.

Revise the essay.",How to Write a Personal Essay," Your life may not be littered with exciting stories or intense drama, but that's okay. Your personal essay can still be engaging for your reader if you focus on finding an angle for your essay. You should try to find a unique or interesting take on an experience or moment in your life. Looking at an experience from a particular angle can turn it into deep, meaningful subject matter for your essay.For example, maybe you want to write about an experience where you learned about failure. You may think the time you failed a pop quiz in class. Though the quiz may have seemed insignificant to you at the time, you realized later that failing the pop quiz forced you to reassess your goals and motivated you to get a passing grade. Seen from a certain angle, your small failure became a gateway to perseverance and determination.;
, A good personal essay will explore a specific experience that created a sense of conflict in your life. The personal essay can be a way to explore how and why you were disturbed, bothered, or hurt by the experience. Think of it as a space where you can discuss a significant moment and reflect on its impact on your life.This could be a seemingly small moment that ended up having a profound influence on you later, such the first time you experienced disgust as a child or the look on your mother’s face when you told her you were gay. Try to really dig into why you were bothered, hurt, or disturbed by this moment in your essay.
Remember that moments charged with strong emotion will often be more engaging to readers. Having a strong reaction to a specific moment will allow you to write passionately about it and keep your reader interested in your essay.

, You may also explore a specific event in your life that left a lasting impression on you. Often, personal essays act as reflections on an event that occurred in your life and shifted it in some way. Think of a specific event that is unique and personal to you. The stranger the event, the more likely the essay will be engaging to read.For example, you may focus on the day you found out your father cheated on your mother or the week you mourned the death of a loved one. Think about a heavy experience in your life that shaped who you are today.
You may also decide to write about a seemingly light topic or event, such as your first ride on a roller coaster, or the first time you went on a cruise with your partner. No matter what event you choose, make sure it is an event that triggered a strong emotional response, ranging from anger to confusion to unabashed joy.

, You may want to explore a tenuous relationship with a person in your life in your personal essay. Think about a person you have grown apart from or feel estranged from. You may also choose a person that you have always had a difficult or complicated relationship with and explore why this is in your essay.For example, you may think about why you and your mother stopped speaking years ago or why you are no longer close to a childhood friend. You may also look at past romantic relationships that failed and consider why they did not succeed or a relationship with a mentor that went sour.

, Good personal essays consider the specific, such as your experiences, as well as the general, such as a current event or larger issue. You may focus on a current event or topic that you feel passionate about, such as abortion or refugee camps, and consider it from a personal perspective.Ask yourself questions about the current event, such as: How does the current event intersect with your own experiences? How can you explore a current social issue or event using your personal thoughts, experiences, and emotions?
For example, you may have an interest in writing about Syrian refugee camps in Europe. You may then focus your personal essay on your own status as a refugee in America and how your experiences a refugee have shaped the person you are now. This will allow you to explore a current event from a personal perspective, rather than simply talk about the current event from a distant, journalistic perspective.

, Personal essays are usually formatted in sections, with an introductory section, a body section, and a concluding section. These sections are broken down as follows:The introductory section should include “the hook”, opening lines where you catch the reader’s attention. It should also have some sort of narrative thesis, which is often the beginning of an important event in the piece or a theme that connects your experience to a universal idea.
The body sections should include supporting evidence for your narrative thesis and/or the key themes in your piece. Often, this is in the form of your experiences and your reflections on your experiences. You should also note the passage of time in your body sections so the reader is aware of when and how certain events occurred.
The concluding section should include a conclusion to the events and experiences discussed in the essay. You should also have a moral of the story moment, where you reflect on what you learned from your experiences or how your experiences changed your life.
In the past, it was advised to have five paragraphs total, one paragraph for the introductory section, two paragraphs for the body section, and one paragraph for the concluding section. But you do not need to be limited to five paragraphs only for your personal essay as long as you have all three sections.

, You should open your personal essay with an introductory section that is engaging and interesting for your reader. The opening section should introduce the key characters of the essay as well as the central theme or themes of the essay. It should also present the central question or concern in the essay.Don't begin with a line that explains exactly what is going to be discussed in, such as, “In this essay, I will be discussing my fraught relationship with my mother."" Instead, draw your reader into your piece and still provide all the information needed in your opening line.
Start instead with a specific scene that contains the key characters of the essay and allows you discuss the central question or theme. Doing this will allow you to introduce the reader to the characters and the central conflict right away.
For example, if you are writing about your fraught relationship with your mother, you may focus on a specific memory where you both disagreed or clashed. This could be the time you and your mother fought over a seemingly insignificant item, or the time you argued about a family secret.

, Though you are writing a personal essay, you still have the freedom to use a unique writing voice or point of view. Like other writing genres, personal essays are often more successful when the writer uses a writing voice that entertains and informs the reader. This means using word choice, syntax, and tone to create an engaging narrative voice in the essay.This writing voice may be conversational, much like how you might speak to a good friend or a family member. Or, the writing voice may be more reflective and internal, where you question your own assumptions and thoughts about the subject of the essay.
Many personal essays are written in the first person, using “I”. You may decide to write in the present tense to make the story feel immediate, or past tense, which will allow you to reflect more on specific events or moments.

, Be sure to describe your characters with sensory detail and physical detail. Even though you are pulling from your real life experiences in your essay, you should still consider storytelling elements like plot and character. Using these elements in your essay will keep your reader engaged and help your essay to flow smoothly.You can also include lines of dialogue spoken by your characters, based on your memory of the event. However, you should limit dialogue to only a few lines a page, as too much dialogue can start to veer away from personal essay and more toward fiction.

, You should also have a sense of plot in your essay, where a sequence of events or moments add up to a realization or moment of conflict at the end of the piece.You may use a plot outline to organize your essay. The plot points should act as supporting evidence for the central question or issue of the essay.

, This means thinking about the deeper meanings that are at the core of your personal experiences. Try to discuss your experiences with honesty and curiosity, where you are trying to uncover a hidden truth or a truth you did not know was there at the time. Often, the best personal essays will try to expose a truth that is uncomfortable or difficult for the writer to discuss.It’s important to remember that though an experience may appear to have all the drama necessary to make a good personal essay, it may be a drama that is too familiar to the reader already. Be wary of experiences that are familiar and filled with pathos that a reader may have experienced before.
If you are writing about the sudden death of a loved one, for example, it may feel important and deep to you. But the reader will likely know what to expect of an essay about a dead loved one, and may not relate to your essay because they did not know the loved one like you did.
Instead, you may try to uncover a truth that is deeper than “I am sad my loved one died.” Think about what the loved one meant to you and how the loved one affected your life, in positive and negative ways. This could lead to the uncovering of a deeper truth and a stronger personal essay.

, You can add richness to your writing by experimenting with different literary techniques and forms, such as metaphor, repetition, and personification. Your personal essay may be that much stronger once you add in literary techniques that show how well you can tell your story.For example, you may use metaphor to describe the experience of telling your mother you are gay. You may describe your mother’s face as “impenetrable, a sudden wall”. Or you may use a simile, such as “my mother’s reaction was silent and stunned, as if she had been struck by lightning.”

, Once you have written a first draft of your personal essay, you should read through it and listen to how it sounds. You may read it out loud to yourself or to a sympathetic audience.As you read it out loud, you should highlight any sentences that are confusing or unclear as well as sentences that do not appear as strong as the rest of the draft. You should also make sure your characters are well developed and your essay follows some kind of structure or sense of plot. Consider if you are hitting a deeper truth in your draft and what you can do to get there if it is not yet on the page.Revising your essay will only make it that much stronger.

, Once you have a strong draft of the essay, you should sit down and revise it. You can take into account the notes you made on the draft as you read it out loud as well as feedback you receive from trusted readers.When you are revising, you should consider if your content is really worth writing about, if you are writing about a topic or subject you are passionate about, and if your reader will understand your writing. You want to avoid confusing your reader, as this can turn her off from reading to the end of your essay.
You should also make sure the focus and themes of the essay are clear. Your experiences should center around a central question, issue, or theme. This will ensure your personal essay is well written and concise.

Have a friend test it out.",How to Write a Process Essay," Before you begin writing, take some time to think about what you’ll need in each part of your paper for your audience. This will help you think about what you need to address absolutely first for your readers.


Do you need to let them know upfront that the task will take all day? That it requires a very specific set of tools? What do new readers need to know first to wrap their mind around the task?
For the sake of this article, let’s say you’re writing a how-to article, telling the reader how to make pasta Bolognese. For most audiences, you won't want to discuss the nuances of herbs in the sauce – you'll need to back up and talk about needing a colander, knowing when pasta is done, etc. Once you cover the basics, you can move onto the advanced stuff.;
, What are your readers going to need to complete this project? Will they need anything at all? If they do, make a complete list of materials needed. As you go through your task, if you come across an item you neglected in your list, go back to it and write it down.


For our pasta example, this includes tools such as a large pot, a saucepan, a spoon for the sauce, and a pasta spoon. And don't forget the actual ingredients for the pasta dish (ground beef, Italian seasoning, etc.). Sometimes it's surprisingly easy to neglect a category of items if it's almost too obvious.

, Maybe you need to actually go through the task yourself so that you know exactly what happens, writing the steps down as you go. It's easy to neglect a step or two when you're just going over it in your mind. However, if you feel you can go through it in detail in your head, that can suffice.


Remember that you can make it easier on your audience, too. Instead of just, ""Boil water,"" or ""Add in your pasta,"" you can add helpful tips and tricks like, ""Pre-measure your ingredients,"" which are sometimes steps that can be forgotten if you don't actually do the task yourself.

, If it’s not possible, make a good estimation of how long the process takes. Most people want to know how long the process will take to determine whether or not they're going to do it.


If you're writing your process essay on a topic that is particularly difficult that you're a whiz at, you may wish to add more time to your estimate. People that are less familiar with the task will likely take longer.

, Don't just launch into the process – ease your readers in with a short but sweet introduction. This is a good platform to let them know what they're getting into and to help them decide that this is actually something they want to do.


In the case of the pasta Bolognese, you might begin by giving the reader a short history of the dish and the region it originated from. Give them a little background in the beginning to motivate them further.
Alternatively, you could begin by telling the readers why it’s a good idea to cook the dish, such as it’s a way to get their families to eat vegetables or it’s a hearty, quick meal suitable for a weeknight.

, Let your reader know how long it will take to complete the task, whether it's 30 minutes or a week. Include a list of what the reader will need in this section, too. Don’t forget the small things!


In other words, your readers need to have everything at their disposal to launch into the task. The introduction and list of equipment and ingredients makes the actual essay easy to follow and helps the reader feel prepared.

, A transitional sentence spurs the reader on to read more and cues them to action. They'll know exactly when the introduction is up and when it's time to get started.


For instance, if you write, “This dish will take about 30 minutes to make” near the end of the introduction, your next sentence could be, “Follow the steps below to get started.”

, Remember not to skip over steps. Your body section will include enough steps to tell your reader about the whole process; the number of steps you need to use depends on the process.


For instance, it will take more steps to tell someone how to cook something complicated, like beef Wellington, than it will to make something simple, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Do not unnecessarily add steps just to make it look more complete. Sometimes simple is better.

, Group your steps in paragraphs by ideas or time. This differentiation will make it clear to the writer what to expect within each topic and not have them going back and forth between topics needlessly. If by idea doesn't work, try grouping the steps chronologically.


For instance, when making pasta, consider writing a paragraph on how to boil pasta and another paragraph on how to make the sauce. This separates the ideas for easy clarification.
Alternatively, you could group the essay by beginning steps (boil the water; heat the oil in the pan; begin frying the onion), middle steps (brown the meat, add the pasta to the water, add the tomato sauce to the meat), and end steps (let the sauce simmer, remove the pasta from the water).
How many steps you use in each paragraph will depend on how long it takes you to write about each step. Just keep in mind 100 words is a good paragraph size, though that is not a hard and fast rule. Don’t overwhelm your reader with too many words at once to keep them motivated.

, Transition from one step to the next; don’t just list each one. In fact, as you introduce each step, consider using transition words. As you go along, you can transition from one thing to the next with words like “next,” “now,” or “then.”


At the beginning of this section, you could introduce it by saying something to the effect of “To begin making pasta Bolognese, retrieve a large pot from the cupboard.” With a phrase like, “To begin…,” you are cluing your reader into the fact that the process is actually beginning.
For instance, you can also say something like, “Next, place the pot on the stove.” However, don’t overuse transition words, as the writing can come across as stilted.

, The extra details help your reader follow the process more easily. When everything is crystal clear, they know exactly what their job is. However, be sure not to get off on a tangent. Stay true to the course to keep the reader on track.


For instance, you could just tell your reader to, “Boil water for the pasta.” However, someone who hasn’t cooked much may not know at what stage to add the pasta. Therefore, give a more detailed description of the step. Instead of ""Boil water,"" consider the following:

Fill the pot up ¾ of the way with water.
Turn the burner on high heat, and set the pot on the stove. Add about 1-2 tablespoons of salt to the water.
Drop the pasta gently into the pot when the water reaches a rolling boil. A rolling boil is when the surface of the water is creating small waves, and you can stir the water without disturbing the boil.”



, Be sure to give your readers an idea of what they should end up with by the time they are finished. Help them visualize the final product, and offer them ideas for the next steps. Just because they've completed the process doesn't mean they know what to do with the end result!


In the case of the recipe, you could write something like, “You now have a bowl of boiled pasta and finished Bolognese sauce. Serve up plates of pasta and sauce to your family, topping them with parmesan, if desired. You can serve garlic bread or a side salad with this dish, too.”

, Reiterate why this task is important or why your reader may want to do it. Remember, in a conclusion, you are summarizing what has been said, not repeating it word for word.


A simple example for our newly-made dinner might be, ""And there you have it! A delicious yet quick meal fit for the entire family that you can make over and over again without complaint. Next time, experiment with different herbs and spices to find your own spin on this classic dish.""

, As a process essay guides your reader through a task, always keep in mind that your readers may be beginners. Be sure to give details, but try to say it as plainly as possible. With this type of essay, there's little room for flowery language.


Look at your number of steps. If there aren't many, is that because the process is simple or because you overlooked something that could be broken up? If there are too many, where are you getting too specific and demotivating the reader? If the amount of steps doesn't seem right, go through it and make modifications as necessary.
Don’t try to use big words to impress your readers. Rather, the best writers know when to use simple language, and a process essay is one of those places. Your readers are looking for clear directions on how to do something, like cooking pasta Bolognese; they don’t want to spend time looking up words in a dictionary.

, Since you know the process like the back of your hand, you following the essay yourself might not do any good. Instead, get a friend to test out your essay, actually doing the task. If any problems arise, they'll be able to point out holes in your essay that you can easily fill.


Often this will be a tiny detail or two that you overlooked for a specific situation. For example, let's say you wrote your recipe to serve 4. When someone making it for 2 doesn't know what to do with their leftover ground beef, they're left guessing. It's seeing little details like this that an extra pair of eyes (and hands) can make much easier.

Explain the facts in narrative form.,
Add a paragraph for each important fact.,
Insert a conclusion.,

File the statement with the judge.",How to Write a Probable Cause Statement," You need facts to include in your probable cause statement. These facts should be the “who, what, where, when, and how” that explain the crime committed and the defendant’s suspected role in the crime.;
, If you secure a search or arrest warrant based on false information, then the warrant could be quashed. Any evidence you gathered from a search could be excluded at trial.You also could face civil liability. A defendant can sue you for a civil rights violation and get a money judgment.
To protect yourself, you cannot include any information you know is false. You also cannot include any information that you could have discovered was false had you not been reckless in your disregard for the truth.You behave “recklessly” where you are aware that the statements are probably false, or where you omit facts that the judge would find critical in determining probable cause., Your police department will probably have a form for you to fill out. You can also ask the prosecuting attorney for the form.


You can see a sample form for the state of Wisconsin at http://www.wicourts.gov/forms/CR-215.PDF.

, If no form exists, then you will need to type up a probable cause statement. You can begin by opening a word processing document. At the top of the document, center the words “Probable Cause Statement” in all caps. Make the words bold., You identify yourself in the introduction and acknowledge that you are not relaying false statements to the judge.


Sample language could be, “I, Jamilla Clarkson, am the Chief of Police for the City of Pinecomb Point, and in full knowledge that false statements are punishable by law, state the facts contained in this statement are true to the best of my knowledge.”, In the second paragraph, you should identify the suspect and the crimes committed. Sample language: “I have probable cause to believe that Evan Smith, III, committed one or more crimes, specifically: Armed Robbery, Aggravated Assault, Aggravated Battery, and multiple instances of Obstruction of Justice.”, In the second paragraph, open with a general statement, such as “The relevant facts supporting a probable cause determination are as follows.”Then provide a narrative of the facts as you know them.


Always be sure to introduce any incident by establishing the date. For example, “On Saturday, May 12, 2015, Evan Smith (“Evan”) and his ex-wife, Sue-Ann Smith (“Sue”), were attending a family barbeque to celebrate the anniversary of their best friends, Kyle and Carol Walker. At the barbeque, Evan complained to Kyle Walker that he did not have the money to continue to make payments on his house….”
Then describe other incidents that support probable cause. For example, “On June 1, 2015, Evan had only $24.32 in his checking account, and his savings account was empty. At approximately 12:32, he pulled into the parking lot of the Pinecomb Point Savings and Loan. Video footage shows him stepping out of the car wearing a black mask….”

, Your narrative will probably cover more than one day. You will want to explain each important incident that you believe establishes probable cause. To help make the statement readable, you should create a new paragraph for each new day or incident.


To continue with the bank robbery example: after explaining the bank robbery in a paragraph, use another paragraph to explain what happened on another day. Include all relevant facts that establish probable cause.

, You should end the probable cause statement by reiterating that you believe the suspect has committed the crime. The final paragraph is your summary of the evidence as well.Sample language might be, “Based on the facts described and the inferences drawn from them, Evan Smith, on June 1, entered the Pinecomb Point Savings and Loan and, using a loaded weapon, robbed the bank. He then took the money to his ex-wife’s house, where they stored the money in a vault in the basement. When the police interviewed Evan on June 4, 2015, he lied and stated that he had been visiting his sister out of state on the day of the robbery. On June 5, 2015, he burned the face mask and gloves used in the robbery, which was done with the purpose of obstructing the investigation of the robbery.”, Type your name and then space down a few lines and create a signature line. Sign on the signature line. Also include the date.You may need to have the statement notarized.If you do, then don’t sign until you appear in front of the notary. Ask a colleague where you typically go to get documents notarized.

, You need to file the probable cause statement with the judge. Each station may have different procedures. Check with a supervisor for more information.

Collect information and data required to populate your report.,
Begin with a summary statement or paragraph not exceeding 4 lines.,
Follow up the summary with a factual representation of performance.,
Capture the current status of key resources.,
Capture activities undertaken during the period.,
Prepare the appendices section.,
Review the report for accuracy and grammar.,
Submit the report and follow up on action items.

",How to Write a Periodic Report," The information or data may include (but not limited to) performance, current status, challenges faced during the period, activities undertaken (and not undertaken).;
, The summary should begin with a sweeping statement of how the facility/organization/unit performed in the period, and state whether normal, exceptional, below par etc. Next, if there were insurmountable challenges, express them in the fewest possible words and reference another section of the report where the challenges are explained in detail. This section must be brief and therefore should only capture a maximum of two unresolved challenges or better, one.

, Compare achieved figures against targets where available beginning with the most significant performance objective in order of significance. Use summarized and total data and limit this section to one page but plan to include detailed information in appendices. Use tables, charts etc to illustrate and add one sentence explanations for the performance both positive and negative. If the performance is qualitative in nature rather that quantitative, write them out in the following thematic order: objective - activity - results achieved. After highlighting the performance achievement, discuss factors that led to the performance, both positive and negative preferably using numbered/bulleted lists.

, These are those that enable you to achieve your objectives which may include staff, machines, facilities, energy resources, budget, cash, etc. If there is any challenge that was encountered in the period with any of these, mention the person/office you communicated the challenge to and what action has been undertaken or is being awaited (include the dates of the communication and other relevant details). In addition, include the risks associated with the unresolved challenges while projecting to the future impact as well. Usually tables come in handy to organize this section.

, Include activities that were to be undertaken but weren't for some reason (which must be stated as well). For activities that are long term in nature and can affect performance, include the current status and the next step action awaited plus the person/stakeholder involved.

, This should consist of data that may be used to substantiate data that is summarized in the report.

, If possible, let someone assist you with this last crucial step. Check that the facts are accurate and conveyed in the best way way possible with simple language. Also check for grammar and spelling errors and correct as necessary.

, Candidates who run for office often write position papers that outline their proposals and express their support or disavowal of laws, ideas and plans.

, Policymakers, elected officials, students and other interested parties often write position papers when a problem needs to be solved or an issue resolved.

, If you seek to establish yourself as an expert on an issue or in a field, writing a position paper is a good way to do it. For example, a tax lawyer might write a position paper on proposed changes to the tax code.

Try thinking about your favorite subject of study - it may be a particular author, theory, time period, etc. Imagine how you might further the study of that subject.
If you are having trouble thinking about your academic interests, you might consider skimming through papers you wrote for your graduate courses and see if there is any apparent topic that you tend to gravitate towards.;
, Carefully consider questions for your Master's thesis that will generate important research and answers for the members of the educational community and their clients. In your Master's thesis, you must answer the thesis question with conviction and clarity in the written presentation submitted to complete a Master's degree.


Make sure that your question and the answers provided will provide original content to the body of research in existence. A judicious question will also keep research focused, organized, and interesting.

, In order to answer the central question of your Master's thesis, you'll need to conduct the research necessary. Read the texts, conduct the experiments, do what you have to do to answer your thesis question. This will allow you to see if your project is worth moving forward with, or if there are some inherent problems that you may need to work out. It will also help you gather the information you'll need to move forward to the next steps.

, Usually a thesis committee is made up of three professors: a chair (the ""head"" of your committee), and two readers. It is important to choose committee members with whom you get along, who have enough time in their schedules to dedicate to your project, and whose area of expertise is relevant to the work you propose to do.Nothing is more frustrating than your thesis progress being held up by a professor who has too many obligations to make time to meet with you.

, Review the literature and research currently available that is relevant to your Master's thesis.This review of the literature must be exhaustive to ensure that your Master's thesis will be important and not be redundant. It is important that your thesis idea be original and relevant. In order to ensure this is the case, you need to be aware of the context of your research, what other people have said on the subject, and what the general opinion of your topic is. Take notes on the background information about your topic and on the people involved in the available material.

, Primary sources are those that are written by the person who created the idea/story/theory/experiment/etc.They are the important factual base that you will use in your Master's thesis, especially if you are writing an analytical thesis.


For example, a novel written by Ernest Hemingway or a scientific journal article in which new results are documented for the first time would both be considered primary sources.

, Secondary sources are sources that are written about primary sources.They are important to include in your Master's thesis because you'll need to demonstrate that you have a solid understanding of the critical context of your topic and that you understand what the major scholars in your field have to say about the subject.


For example, a book written about Ernest Hemingway's novel or a scientific journal article examining the findings of someone else's experiment would both be considered secondary sources.

, Depending upon your field, you might front-load most of your research into an early chapter of the thesis, or you might include sources throughout the entirety of the document. Either way, you’re likely to need to keep track of many different citations. You need to keep track of your citations as you write, rather than trying to add them after you are finished writing.


Use the in-text citation format appropriate to your discipline. The most common formats are MLA, APA, and Chicago.
Create a coordinating works cited or reference entry for each source you cite in the text of your document or in a footnote.
Consider using a citation management software such as EndNote, Mendeley, or Zotero. These will enable you to insert and move citations within your word processor program and will automatically populate a works cited or reference page for you.

, An English Master's Thesis has different requirements and employs different formats than a Master's Thesis in Chemistry. There are two types of Master's theses:


Qualitative. This type of thesis involves completing a project that is exploratory, analytical, or creative in some way. Usually students in the humanities will complete this kind of thesis.
Quantitative. This type of thesis involves conducting experiments, measuring data, and recording results. Students in the sciences usually complete this kind of thesis.

, Prepare a clear statement of the central thesis question that you intend to answer with your research. Being able to state your thesis explicitly and clearly is important. If you struggle stating the question, you might need to rethink your project altogether.

, The outline will be beneficial to you to ""see where you're going"" as you move forward in your project, but also to give your committee members an idea of what you want to accomplish and how you plan to do so.

, You should check with your university for the exact requirements, but most Master's theses should include the following:


Title page
Signature page (with the completed signatures of your advising committee - usually attained at the defense, or after the project is deemed complete)
Abstract - this is a short (one paragraph or so) description/summary of the work completed in your thesis
Table of Contents (with page numbers)
Introduction
Body of paper
Conclusion
Works Cited or Bibliography
Any necessary appendices or endnotes

, One approach that works for many people is to use a reverse calendar, where you plan your writing schedule from the due date and work backwards.If you know how much time you have to complete the project and break it up into manageable parts with individual due dates (whether these due dates are simply for you or if they are for your committee chair as well), you'll be less likely to get overwhelmed by the scale of the project.

, Writing 30 finished pages in two weeks is a daunting task, but if you write 500 words every day, then you will be able to meet that deadline with ease. Try not to get frustrated and put off your work because then it will pile up and become unmanageable.

, Many people who have trouble motivating themselves and being productive with their theses find it useful to work in “tomatoes” using the Pomodoro Technique.The basic idea is that you complete 25 minutes of completely focused work, then you get a 5 minute break. This breaks your work into manageable chunks and can cut down on the feeling of being overwhelmed that often accompanies a large, long-term project.

, It is important, especially when working on a large-scale project, to give your brain a break every now and then. You can't stay focused and on-task 100% of the time without losing content quality, and letting yourself step away from your ideas for a couple days will give you fresh eyes when you come back to your work. You'll catch mistakes you didn't see before and come up with new answers you couldn't think of before.

, Some people work best in the morning, while others are able to focus more effectively at night. If you are unsure of when you are most productive, try different approaches and see what seems to work the best for you.

, You may find that your thesis proposal is a useful jumping off point for writing your introduction. You might want to copy and paste sections of your proposal for the start of your introduction, but remember that it’s okay to change your ideas as they progress. You may want to revisit and revise your introduction at several points throughout your writing process, perhaps even each time you finish a large section or chapter.

, If you were required to write a review of literature prior to beginning your thesis, good news: you’ve already written almost an entire chapter! Again, you may need to reshape and revise the work, and you will likely also find occasion to add to the review as you move forward with your work.


If you do not already have a review of literature written, it’s time to do you research! The review of literature is essentially a summary of all of the existing scholarship about your topic with plenty of direct quotations from the primary and secondary sources that you’re referencing.

, After reviewing the existing scholarship, you should explain how your work contributes to the existing scholarship—in other words, you’re explaining what you are adding to the field with your work., The remainder of the thesis varies greatly by field. A science-based thesis will involve few secondary sources as the remainder of your work will involve describing and presenting the results of a study. A literary thesis, on the other hand, will likely continue to cite secondary scholarship as it builds an analysis or reading of a particular text or texts.

, Your conclusion should details the importance of this Master's thesis to the subject community, and may suggest the direction that future researchers might follow to continue with relevant information on the subject., Be sure to include relevant charts, graphs, and figure as appropriate. You may also need to add appendices at the end of your work that are germane to your work but tangential to the central question of your Master's thesis. Be sure that all aspects of your work are formatted in accordance with the guidelines of your institutional and discipline expectations.

, The formatting requirements for theses and dissertations are notoriously tedious and complicated. Make sure that your documents adheres to all of the requirements laid out by your department, in general, and by your committee chair, in specific.


Many departments or programs provide a document template for theses and dissertations. If you have one of these, it may be easiest to use such a template from the beginning of your work (rather than copying and pasting your writing into it).

, Take a week or so off, if possible, once you have finished writing and give your brain a break. Then, go back with fresh eyes to catch any grammatical errors or typos you may have made. When you are so deep in the writing process, it is easy to just read what you mean instead of what you actually wrote. So it is important to take a step back so that you can evaluate your work and your writing more effectively.


Alternatively, ask a trusted colleague or friend to read over your thesis to help you catch any minor grammar/spelling/punctuation errors and typos.

, You will probably have to pay (our of pocket) to print one or more copies of your Master's thesis for your university, as well as any other personal copies you may want for yourself. Make sure you abide by these guidelines to avoid any potential setbacks during this final stage.

, After completing the written portion of your Master's thesis, you will probably have to participate in a defense involving you presenting the ideas discussed in your thesis to your committee members. This is a great opportunity to show what you have learned during the process and to give your committee members a chance to bring up any questions or concerns they might have. It is usually more of a conversation than actually defending your stance, as the name might seem to imply.

, Your institution likely has very specific guidelines for submitting your thesis. Most universities require you to upload your thesis to Pro Quest for electronic publication (or at least tracking) through their dissertation and thesis archive. Be sure to follow your school’s specific guidelines for submission.


Some institutions require you to submit your thesis for a formatting check prior to uploading the document to ProQuest. Be sure to check with your department’s Director of Graduate Studies for specific instructions.
Be aware of thesis submission deadlines, which are often well in advance of your graduation date. Late submission of your thesis may force you to push back your graduation date, which may affect your employment or continuing graduate studies.

Revise your essay.",How to Write a Narrative Essay," Generally, narrative essays involve two main components: a story and some analysis of that story. A narrative essay may be ""about"" a particular issue, theme, or concept, but it uses a personal story to illustrate that idea.


Most of the time, narrative essays will involve no outside research or references. Instead, you'll be using your personal story to provide the evidence of some point that you're trying to make.Narrative essays are a common school assignment used to test your creative story-telling skills, as well as your ability to connect some element of your personal life to a topic you might be discussing in class.;
, Often, narrative essays are school assignments and they're written based on a prompt you'll receive from your teacher. Even if you've got a crazy story about the time you escaped from a deserted island on a hot air balloon, read the prompt closely to make sure your story fits the assignment. Common topics for narrative essays include but are not limited to a description of some moment that:


You experienced adversity and had to overcome
You failed and had to deal with the consequences of that failure
Your personality or character was transformed
You experienced discrimination or experienced privilege

, Good narrative essays tell specific stories with very vibrant and luminous details. You're not writing a novel, so the story needs to be fairly contained and concise. Try to limit it as much as possible in terms of other characters, setting, and plot. A specific family vacation or weekend with a friend? A disaster holiday, or night out during high school? Perfect.


Bad narrative essays are generally too broad. ""My senior year of high school"" or ""This summer"" are examples of stories that would be far too big to tell in the amount of specific detail that a good narrative essay requires. Pick a single event from the summer, or a single week of your senior year, not something that takes months to unfold.
It's also good to limit the number of characters you introduce. Only include other characters who are absolutely essential. Every single friend from your fifth grade class will be too many names to keep track of. Pick one.

, Good narrative essays are full of specific details, particular images and language that helps make the story come alive for the reader. The sights and smells in your story should all be discussed in particular details. When you're thinking of stories that might make for good essays, it's important to think of some that are rich in these kinds of details.


Let your imagination fill in the gaps. When you're describing your grandmother's house and a specific weekend you remember spending there, it's not important to remember exactly what was cooked for dinner on Friday night, unless that's an important part of the story. What did your grandmother typically cook? What did it usually smell like? Those are the details we need.
Typically, narrative essays are ""non-fiction,"" which means that you can't just make up a story. It needs to have really happened. Force yourself to stay as true as possible to the straight story.

, Where does your story start? Where does it end? Writing up a quick list of the major plot points in the story is a good way of making sure you hit all the high points. Every story needs a beginning, a middle, and an end.


It helps to limit things as much as possible. While it might seem like we need to know a bunch of specific details from your senior year, Try to think of a particularly tumultuous day from that year and tell us that story. Where does that story start? Not the first day of school that year. Find a better starting point.
If you want to tell the story of your prom night, does it start when you get dressed? Maybe. Does it start when you spill spaghetti sauce all down your dress before the dance? While that might seem like the climax of a story you want to tell, it might make a better starting place. Go straight to the drama.
You don't need to write up a formal outline for a narrative essay unless it's part of the assignment or it really helps you write. Listing the major scenes that need to be a part of the story will help you get organized and find a good place to start.

, Generally, narrative essays will be written in first person, making use of ""I"" statements, which is a little unusual compared to other assignments you'll be given in school. Whether you're giving us scenes with dialog, or discussing what happened in past-tense, it's perfectly fine to use first person in a narrative essay.


Don't switch perspectives throughout the story. This is a difficult and advanced technique to Try to pull off, and it usually has the effect of being too complicated. There should only be one ""I"" in the story.
In general, narrative essays (and short stories for that matter) should also be told in past tense. So, you would write ""Johnny and I walked to the store every Thursday"" not ""Johnny and I are walking to the store, like we do every Thursday.""

, Who else is important to the story, other than yourself? Who else was present when the story took place. Who affected the outcome of the story? What specific, particular details can you remember about the people in the story? Use these to help build the characters into real people.


Particular details are specific and only particular to the character being described. While it may be specific to say that your friend has brown hair, green eyes, is 5 feet tall with an athletic build, these things don't tell us much about the character. The fact that he only wears silk dragon shirts? Now that gives us something interesting.
Try writing up a brief sketch of each principal character in your narrative essay, along with the specific details you remember about them. Pick a few essentials.

, Good narratives often have a protagonist and an antagonist. The protagonist is usually the main character (in most narrative essays, that'll be you) who is struggling with something. It might be a situation, a condition, or a force, but whatever the case, a protagonist wants something and the reader roots for them. The antagonist is the thing or person who keeps the protagonist from getting what they want.


Who or what is the antagonist in your story? To answer this question, you also need to find out what the protagonist wants. What is the goal? What's the best case scenario for the protagonist? What stands in the protagonist's way?
The antagonist isn't ""the bad guy"" of the story, necessarily, and not every story has a clear antagonist. Also keep in mind that for some good personal narratives, you might be the antagonist yourself.

, Just as important to a good story as the characters and the plot is the setting. Where does the story take place? At home? Outside? In the city or the country? Describe the location that the story takes place and let the setting become part of your story.


Do a freewrite about the location that your story takes place. What do you know about the place? What can you remember? What can you find out?
If you do any research for your narrative essay, it will probably be here. Try to find out extra details about the setting of your story, or double-check your memory to make sure it's right.

, Good writing is in the details. Even the most boring office environment or the most dull town can be made compelling with the right kinds of details in the writing. Remember to use particulars–unique details that don't describe anything else but the specific thing you're writing about, and let these vivid details drive the story.


A popular creative writing phrase tells writers to ""show"" not to ""tell."" What this means is that you should give us details whenever possible, rather than telling us facts. You might tell us something like, ""My dad was always sad that year,"" but if you wrote ""Dad never spoke when he got home from work. We heard his truck, then heard as he laid his battered hardhat on the kitchen table. Then we heard him sigh deeply and take off his work clothes, which were stained with grease.""

, After you've written your rough draft, read back over it with an eye for your theme. Whatever the purpose of your telling us the story that you're telling us needs to be made very clear. The last thing you want is for the reader to get to the end and say, ""Good story, but who cares?"" Answer the question before the reader gets the chance to ask.


Get the theme into the very beginning of the essay. Just as a researched argument essay needs to have a thesis statement somewhere in the first few paragraphs of the essay, a narrative essay needs a topic statement or a thesis statement to explain the main idea of the story.
This isn't ""ruining the surprise"" of the story, this is foreshadowing the important themes and details to notice over the course of the story as you tell it. A good writer doesn't need suspense in a narrative essay. The ending should seem inevitable.

, All narratives are made of two kinds of writing: scenes and summaries. Scenes happen when you need to slow down and tell specific details about an important moment of the story. Scenes are small moments that take a while to read. Summary is used to narrate the time between scenes. They are longer moments that you read over more quickly.


Scene: ""On our walk to the store, Jared and I stopped at the empty grass lot to talk. 'What's your problem lately?' he asked, his eyes welling with tears. I didn't know what to tell him. I fidgeted, kicked an empty paint bucket that was rusted over at the edge of the lot. 'Remember when we used to play baseball here?' I asked him.""
Summary: ""We finished walking to the store and bought all the stuff for the big holiday dinner. We got a turkey, cornbread, cranberries. The works. The store was crazy-packed with happy holiday shoppers, but we walked through them all, not saying a word to each other. It took forever to lug it all home.""

, When you're writing a narrative essay, it's typically somewhere between a short story and a regular essay that you might write for school. You'll have to be familiar with the conventions of formatting both types of writing, and since most narrative essays will involve some dialogue, you should make formatting that dialogue correctly a part of your revision process.


Anything spoken by a character out loud needs to be included in quotation marks and attributed to the character speaking it: ""I've never been to Paris,"" said James.
Each time a new character speaks, you need to make a new paragraph. If the same character speaks, multiple instances of dialog can exist in the same paragraph.

, Revision is the most important part of writing. Nobody, even the most experienced writers, get it right on the very first run through. Get a draft finished ahead of time and give yourself the chance to go back through your story carefully and see it again. How could it be improved?


Revise for clarity first. Are your main points clear? If not, make them clear by including more details or narration in the writing. Hammer home your points.
Was the decision you made about the starting place of the story correct? Or, now that you've written, might it be better to start the story later? Ask the tough questions.

Proofreading is one part of revision, but it's a very minor part and it should be done last. Checking punctuation and spelling is the last thing you should be worried about in your narrative essay.

Formulate a thesis.,
Construct a concise thesis statement.,
Refine your thesis.",How to Write a Literary Analysis1," This is a sentence (or sentences) that expresses the main ideas of your paper and answers the question or questions posed by your paper. To form a solid thesis, think about the following:


What am I arguing?
What is my reasoning?
How should I organize my reasons/evidence?;
, A good thesis should:


Allude to the 3 main points you wish to address in the main body of the essay.
Touch on the organization of your argument
Explain what significance your argument has.
Appear in the first paragraph, as it serves as an introduction to your approach to the literary work. Generally, a thesis appears at the end of the first paragraph -- letting the reader know what to expect for the body of the work.

, Often, as the paper evolves, the thesis evolves with it. Don't hesitate to revamp your thesis to accurately summarize your paper, after you've written it.

Pick a general area of research that interests you.,
Do some preliminary research.,
Brainstorm ideas.,
Avoid questions that have been overdone.",How to Write a Research Question1," You’re likely writing your paper for a particular class. If you’re taking something like Introduction to Biology, try narrowing down the field a bit to find out what interests you.


What kind of biology will you write about? Is it connected to an experiment you will conduct? What are the physical limitations of your experiment? All of these answers will help you narrow your question.
Maybe you want to write specifically on botany, and even narrower, on grafting in plants. Or say you’re in a humanities field, such as history. If you’re class is An Overview of American History, maybe you want to narrow it specifically to the Civil War, and then narrow it down even more to Lincoln’s influence on the Civil War.;
, At this point, it’s fine to use internet search engines like Google and Wikipedia. You’re just trying to get a general idea of the topic. Read general articles that discuss the topic you are thinking about discussing in your paper, and jot down things that catch your attention.

, What fascinates you about your given topic? Why did you choose it in the first place? Draw a diagram on a paper with the main topic in the center. Branch ideas off the center. Continue branching until you come up with a branch that seems interesting to you; that will be what you focus your question on.


For example, if you start with the Civil War as your main topic, one branch could be Lincoln’s influence, which could lead to another branch about Lincoln’s childhood. If it interests you, your research could explore how Lincoln’s childhood affected his decision making during the Civil War.

, You want your question to be as original as possible, especially if you are in a postgraduate program. As an undergraduate, your professor is mainly looking to see that you can research and think through an argument, but by the time you’re a postgraduate, your professor will be looking to see if you can make an original argument.


If you run internet searches on the topic you are thinking about discussing, and you find that the research topic you have in mind has been answered in many different books and documents, you may want to come up with a different topic.

Research the subject of your position paper.,
Think about your own viewpoint.,
Consider your audience.,
Gather all the proof or documentation you will need to support the position you choose.

",How to Write a Position Paper2," This will allow you to make an articulate, informed case to support your position.


Visit libraries and conduct research online. Check books, journals, newspapers, blogs and websites for recent news on the topic and relevant studies that support and oppose different positions.
Take advantage of primary sources as well as scholarly articles, news reports and statistics. An example of a primary source is a constitutional lawyer if you are writing about the death penalty or a professional football player if you are writing about head injuries in athletes.

, Most people write position papers based on their own views, but you may be a student assigned to a specific position, or you may want to explore all sides of the issue in your paper.

, They might be expecting a particular position in your paper. If your audience is doctors, for example, they might be surprised to read a colleague's position paper on preventative medicine being unnecessary.


Remember that you do not need to change your own position to suit your audience. You should choose your own position or viewpoint, just keep in mind the way your audience things or reasons as you being to write the paper.

Present the opposing viewpoint.,
Conclude your position paper by re-stating your position and briefly summarizing why you took that point of view.

",How to Write a Position Paper3,"


Include the history of the topic as well as any current developments. For example, if you are writing about gay marriage in 2013, you could reference the federal Defense of Marriage Act enacted in 1996 as well as the states that recently passed laws allowing or prohibiting gay marriage.

, This outlines the position you are taking in your paper.

, These should be informed and educated points, with documented facts to back them up.


Reference at least one source to back up each point you make in your argument.

, Provide background on any other positions pertaining to the issue your paper describes.

Build a strong, intriguing introduction.,
End your introduction with your thesis statement.",How to Write a Literary Analysis2," This is where your paper starts -- the first impression needs to be assertive, interesting, and encourage the reader to continue on. A few ideas to start with:


A relevant quotation or anecdote. This could be lines or dialogue, depending on the text you're analyzing
An interesting fact or question.
An acknowledgment of the counterargument.
Irony, paradox, or analogy

, It should seem to usher in the rest of the paper.

"
"
Develop convincing body paragraphs.,
Consider context.",How to Write a Literary Analysis3," This will be where you give evidence for your argument. A standard body has three paragraphs, though a longer essay might require more.


In answering questions posed, think about what evidence you have to make your assertion. How does it relate to the overall theme? Are you leaving anything out?
Perform a close reading and analyze multiple factors in your literary analysis. You might discuss a character's development -- how the individual changes from the beginning to the end of the work. You could focus on a character's fatal flaw and examine the person's mistakes.
Consider focusing on the setting and theme of the literary work you're analyzing. Emphasize the ways in which these elements contribute to the overall quality of the work.
A paper fails when the writer chooses to ignore elements that don't fit his or her thesis. Make sure your argument doesn't pick and choose which parts of the text to address and which parts to ignore.
Emphasize one major point per paragraph in this section. No need to rush all of your evidence into one idea.

, If your author writes heavily in symbolism and other literary devices, obscuring the true intent of their work, research his/her experiences. What was going on in the world or in his/her life? Does your argument fit these circumstances?


This should advance a specific point of view about the text. You could argue that a given story is the product of the culture and time period from which it sprang. To follow up, provide details about the historical aspects of the literary work within the text and outside of it.
Don't hesitate to use secondary sources (texts from other authors).

A book or article discussing the same text
A book or article discussing a theory related to the text
A book or article discussing the historical or social context of the text "
"
End with a firm conclusion.",How to Write a Literary Analysis4," Sum up your overall paper in the last paragraph. It should drive home all the major points you have made in the foregoing elements of your literary analysis, but also touch on the implications of your argument.


Do not reiterate points repetitively
Suggest the next step
Draw connections between genre and context

Pick a captivating title.,
Write in the present tense.,
Write in the third person.,
Use literary terms.They will make your paper sound well-informed, balanced, and thought out.,
Use secondary sources.",How to Write a Literary Analysis5," You may want to hold this off till the end, when your paper is fully formed and your argument is clear.

, Regardless of the time your text was written, voice it in present-day terms: ""The orange peels float away in the water, along with his innocence.""

, Avoid using ""I"" or ""you"".


Some professors may allow first or second person. If so, you can express the level of enjoyment you experienced while reading the text (if this is within the scope of your assignment and your professor will allow it). You can discuss the qualities of the text that most impressed you or the reasons you found or did not find the main characters believable.

, A few examples include:


Allusion: Indirect or brief references to well-known characters or events.
Hyperbole: Exaggerated statements or claims not meant to be taken literally, used for emphasis or effect.
Irony: A reference to how a person, situation, statement, or circumstance is not as it would actually seem.
Metaphor: A type of figurative language in which a statement is made that says that one thing is something else but, literally, it is not.
Simile: A comparison in which one thing is likened to another.

, They can be great for supporting your argument. Keep in mind, though, that secondary sources should be secondary. It is your paper -- use other authors' opinions as padding for your argument -- not doing the work for you. They can be found a number of ways:

Stay away from questions that are too broad.,
Make your question more specific.,
Make sure your question isn’t one that can be easily answered through a search engine.,
Avoid making your research question too ambitious.",How to Write a Research Question2," Maybe you have a general question, such as “How can grafting be used on plants?” or “How did Lincoln influence the Civil War?” However, these are very broad. If you research these questions, you will end up with too much to read and a paper that isn’t focused. You have to narrow your topic down.

, Look at each part of your question, and consider how you can make it more specific.


For instance, with the “How can grafting be used on plants” question, ask yourself what kind of grafting you want to focus on. To what end? What kind of plants? If you answer those questions and others like it, you may end up with something more specific, for example “How can whip grafting be used to produce consistent Honeycrisp apple trees?”
If you have a humanities question, ask yourself similar questions. What issue in the Civil War do you want to focus on when considering Lincoln’s influence? Do you want to look at the overall outcome or how Lincoln influenced specific battles? What part of Lincoln’s influence do you want to look at? By answering those questions, you can end up with a more specific question: “How did Lincoln’s personal beliefs on slavery affect the Emancipation Proclamation?”

, You want something interesting that requires research, thinking, and the development of an argument.


For instance, something like “What is chlorophyll?” is can be answered with a simple search through the dictionary. Your topic should force you to actually do research.

, Despite wanting your question to be unique and interesting, don’t bite off more than you can chew. That is, don’t make your question too ambitious. You want to be able to answer it in the confines of a paper. In the same vein, you don’t want a question that is unanswerable. Through your research, make sure you will be able to draw some sort of conclusion through your arguments.

Think about the kinds of articles, books, and primary sources you’ll need to read to cover your topic.,
Gather a list of places you want to look for source documents.,
Look at your university’s databases.,
If possible, don’t forget to use primary resources.",How to Write a Research Question3," You’ll want a few general books to cover your topic, but you’ll also want to find research that is as close to your topic as possible.


Don’t worry if you end up finding a paper with a similar topic. Use it to help develop your own argument in contrast to the other paper.

, Use your university’s library for research. You’ll be able to find books, journal articles, and primary sources like journals and letters, usually. However, you can also search online.


The Library of Congress has a great deal of its archives online, and you can find high-quality information there, as well as other educational archives; you can find photographs, journal articles, personal journals and correspondence, and other types of primary sources.

, Most universities will have some databases like EBSCOhost and JSTOR. EBSCOhost is a collection of databases. You will mainly find journal articles and newspaper articles, though you may be able to access a few books.


What you have access to will depend on what your university pays for. However, you should at least have access to a database in your field of study.
Narrow your search to only those databases that will return relevant results. JSTOR has older articles, but it is still useful in researching a topic.

, For example, for the Lincoln topic, looking at his personal correspondence, notes, and journals would be very helpful in establishing an argument about his personal belief system.

If you are currently living outside the US, contact your state election department or FVAP.",How to Absentee Vote1," Every state has its own set of laws and regulations governing the process of absentee voting. In many states, voters can vote by absentee ballot without excuse. In others, voters must provide a valid reason why they cannot vote on election day.]

As of 2012, 27 states and Washington, D.C. offer ""no-excuse absentee voting."" Voters in these states can request an absentee ballot without stating a reason why they wish to vote using that method.
No-excuse absentee voting states include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Understand the eligibility requirements.If you are stationed outside of your state or outside of the country, you can still vote in all local, state, and federal elections as long as you are a US citizen, a minimum of 18 years old, and registered to vote.,
Know your legal voting residence.,
Use FVAP.",How to Absentee Vote2," This is true in all states.


Eligible spouses and children of military members can also vote as long as they are US citizens who are at least 18 years old. If a child is a US citizen but has never resided in the country, many states will allow that child to claim a parent's state or residence as his or her own.

, Typically, your legal voting residence is the state in which you lived prior to enlisting.


You may no longer have a formal connection to your past residence, but if you have not claimed a new place of residence since, that location will be the one you must use.
You can claim a new legal voting residence as long as you are physically present at that location and can show intent to return there as your primary place of living outside of the military.
You can change your legal residence every time you change your permanent duty station, or you can keep the same legal residence without changing it.

, Regardless of your legal voting residence, the easiest, most streamlined way to request an absentee ballot is by contacting the Federal Voting Assistance Program and requesting a Federal Postcard Application.An online version of the FPCA is also available.

Learn about the big issues.,
Research the competition.,
Find your base.,
Identify swing voters.,
Poll regularly.",How to Persuade People to Vote for You1," Talk to voters to find out what they care about in this election. Are they concerned with big questions about the quality of the incumbent's leadership, or are they just worried about getting their tax bill lower. Learn everything you can about these issues, and develop considered but strong stances. Don't just run for election because you want to win—you need to care about the issues that are at stake.;
, Elections aren't solitaire: you have to consider the other candidates and figure out how to outwit their campaign and dissuade people from voting for them. Find out everything there is to know about your main competitors. Try to distinguish yourself from them on key issues and play up any weaknesses or scandals they might be trying to hide.

, Not everyone is going to like or vote for you, but nor is every voter going to be a tough sell. Find the core groups and demographics that are excited to vote for you, and reach out to them early. These supporters are vital to organizing volunteers and raising campaign funds. You don't have to spend a lot of time convincing these people, but don't neglect them too much—a candidate that alienates his or her base is almost always done for.

, Undecided voters might infuriate the politically savvy, but they still make or break every election. Learn what they care about and what factors or policies could earn you their votes—then market to them aggressively. After building and organizing your base, winning over voters that are on the fence or that you can steal from your opponents is the main mission of your campaign.

, It's rare that the first campaign strategy you try will work perfectly. Conduct polls of voters to find out how you are doing and adjust your campaign accordingly. Be sure to break down your poll samples by demographic and how likely they are to actually vote.

Tell a story.,
Use your winning personality.,
Stay on message.,
Come up with a slogan.,
Go on the attack.",How to Persuade People to Vote for You2," Voters don't connect with a set of bullet-pointed policy positions—they connect with a narrative. Rags to riches, the underdog fighting against entrenched interests, a movement that takes the community back from outsiders or insiders that have undermined it—these are narratives people believe in. Your campaign has to tell voters a story about you—and themselves—that moves them and gets them excited to vote for you. Your campaign materials should describe your vision of what this election means and where the community is going.

, It's perhaps a sad truth of politics that people prefer to vote for the most likable candidates over the ones that are more experienced or that offer better policies for their demographic. Many great candidates have thrown away an election by appearing too stiff or aloof. People need to feel that you are like them, that they could be friends with you or at least share a meal with you. Do everything you can to be charismatic, humble, polite, friendly and humorous, and avoid sounding elitist or like a career bureaucrat.

, Both the media and your opposition will be trying to get you to talk about scandals in your past, issues where you stance doesn't resonate with voters, or whatever story dominates the current news cycle. Don't get distracted! In debates and campaign events, always try to bring the topic back to your core message and areas of strength.

, Make it short and sweet—it has to be something that people can remember. Try to make it rhyme, alliterate, or give it a cadence that people can chant. Bonus points if you can use it to help people remember your name. Nuanced policy papers can help you win endorsements, but the average voter is only going to remember what as much about you as you can fit on a bumper sticker—so make sure it distinguishes you from your opponents and connects with something they care about.


If there is a single issue that dominates the campaign that you can take a stand on, don't be afraid to make that your slogan, like: ""John Smith: People Over Pipelines"" or even ""John Smith: No to the New Stop Light.""

, Call out your opponents on any controversial positions they may have held in the past, or any personal skeletons they have in their closet. People don't like negative campaigning, but it still works. Too much mudslinging can backfire on you, but successful campaigns have to have some bite. A vote against your opponent is usually as good as a vote for you.


If you can manage it, try to have a third party do the criticism while you appear to stay above the fray. Successful presidential candidates often let their running mates act as an ""attack dog"" while they focus on the positive.

Rally volunteers.,
Press the flesh.,
Distribute swag for name recognition.,
Fundraise.,
Get out the vote.",How to Persuade People to Vote for You3," Even in a small election, it's hard to run a winning campaign alone. Sign up volunteers to help you organize your campaign events and go out to make your case to voters. Get your friends and family to work with you. One dedicated volunteer can be worth 100 votes on election day.

, Meet as many people in person as you can. Even in the digital age, face-to-face conversations are still the best way to win people over. Have you and your most persuasive volunteers and campaign staff canvas door-to-door and meet voters at busy events and public spaces as much as possible. Many people might turn you away, but the ones that take the time to listen to you—or even shake your hand—are far more likely to vote for you, donate or volunteer.

, The most tangible products of any big campaign are signs, posters, pamphlets, buttons, bumper stickers and t-shirts. Many of these products have little more on them besides your name and slogan—or even just a logo. They don't do much to actually win individual votes, but they do get your name out there and potentially get people to look up your website. They also show voters where you have existing support in the community, and many are only willing to join a movement when it is already suitably popular.


You might not actually change any minds with your yard signs, but your volunteers will be demoralized if they have to campaign in a neighborhood that only has signs for your opponent. Politics is an arms race. If your opponents do it, you need to be prepared to match them.

, Winning doesn't come cheap. Every major campaign needs money to print campaign materials, organize events and potentially pay hired campaign staff. Start with potential big donors, but small donations of just a few dollars can add up quick too. If a voter seems well convinced to support you, always ask them to donate as well.

, All the fundraising, campaign events and compelling arguments won't matter if you can't get people to show up on election day. Do everything you can to get your supporters to the polls, from a simple reminder email to providing transportation.

Avoid voting purely on your political party affiliation, instead of using it as a baseline.,
Look for places you agree with candidates instead of worrying about smears and attacks.",How to Decide Who to Vote for US President1," Don't let yourself by led by just one good speech or your friend's point of view: decide what you like first, then look to the candidates second. Some themes and issues to consider include:



War and Peace: Should the US go to war to protect human rights abuses, or only to protect US interests?

Economic Priorities: Should businesses be left totally alone, or are business laws and regulations essential to protect consumers?

Social and Moral Responsibility: Is it the President's job to influence this country's ""moral character,"" or is this beyond government's reach?;

Simple but powerful, these quizzes are a fantastic place to base further research, discussion, and decisions on. Try out:

, Broadly speaking, Americans tend to crowd into two political schools of thought, and each school corresponds (more or less) to a political party. While real people and candidates can, and do, fall anywhere on the spectrum, knowing the broader trends is a good way to start pinpointing who, and what, you agree with.



Conservative / Right-Wing / Republican / Constitutionalist:

Big government should never step in the life of people and businesses
The Constitution is generally infallible
Strong moral and social values are key to American strength
A large military presence is crucial
Free-to-act, private business is key to economic growth



Liberal / Left-Wing / Democrat / Progressive:

Government must step in to protect minority and prejudiced groups
The Constitution was written 200 years ago and needs occasional re-inspection
It is not the government's place to regulate social/moral life
Diplomacy trumps war whenever possible
Private business must be regulated to prevent abuses.



, Try to take a big-picture look, studying the past 4-8 years instead of the past 4-8 months. Consider the following areas, doing research as needed to fill in the blanks, and ask yourself if the things are better or worse than when the current president took office. If they are better, then voting for the same party's candidates (voting Democrat, for example, if you enjoyed President Obama) generally continues these policies:



Economic Growth: Is unemployment higher or lower than when the President took office? What about GDP or the wage gap?

Foreign Entanglements: Are we involved in more disputes, battles, or issues now or when he/she took office? How many US soldiers have lost their lives in this President's wars?

Domestic Affairs: Have crime rates gone up or down? How about poverty?

, The most common reason to choose a candidate is that they share the same party as you. But for every group, Republicans, Democrats, or Independents, party affiliation does not completely dictate a candidate's views. The views of political parties matter. For example, if you agree the government should get out of business regulation, must crack down on social and moral order, and needs an aggressive military, you're more likely to vote Republican. But don't forget that the candidate matters more. Despite the Republicans agreeing as a party to roll back gay marriage and transsexual bathroom laws, 2016 GOP candidate Donald Trump said these aren't his views or priorities and would not strive for them., Many news outlets focus on the ""thrilling"" moments of debates, highlighting differences instead of actual proposals and policies. Remember, however, that you are voting for a candidate, not against the others. It is fair to dislike a candidate's ideas and policies, voting against these beliefs. But it is another and far more dangerous thing to vote based on attacks, name calling, or non-political issues like race or gender.


Frame your research as ""why should I vote for X,"" instead of ""why shouldn't I vote for Y."" There is no end to the negative things candidates will say about each other, so move towards the positive and proposals instead."
"
Focus on concrete proposals, not vague promises or generalizations.,
Pay attention to your personal bias.,
Read up on political fact-checkers to avoid being led astray.,
Stay informed throughout the election.,
Keep third parties in your mind, researching all candidates fairly.",How to Decide Who to Vote for US President2," Just about any candidate can say ""I want to lower taxes and create jobs."" The best candidates, however, go much further to say how they are going to do it. Avoid the huge, empty promises and focus on the specifics instead. A good proposal must:



Be time-based -- There is an idea when things will get done or how to phase plans in.

Attack specific issues with specific demands-- ""making jobs"" is not a plan. Creating jobs in North Dakota by subsidizing (helping pay for) new solar panel farms is a plan.

Recognize Difficulties-- No plan is perfect, but the best candidates note where the plan might fail and suggest ways to fix these things before they become real problems.

, Having a bias is not necessarily bad -- if you didn't prefer for some ideas or politics, after all, you could never vote. While all humans have a bias, conscientious voters go out of their way to make sure it doesn't lead them to an ""echo chamber,"" where all you read or see are stories that you already agree with. An informed voter knows their bias and checks other opinions to ensure they aren't missing vital information from both sides.


Aggregate sites like RealClearPolitics offer articles from across the web, helping you get a more balanced news diet.
Make an effort to watch the shows and read the columns you don't agree with, at least occasionally. Both sides are biased, meaning both sides will leave out some things and emphasize others. It's best to sift through these things yourself., Facts and figures are argued, retracted, edited, contradicted and forgotten every day of the election. Some of them are enormous talking points, others are subtle attacks and smears. What is most important to remember about all of them is that just because a candidate said it doesn't mean it's true. Web sites like Politfact.com. Snopes and FactChecker.org are essential for getting to the bottom of key issues and facts, especially during a contentious election.

, Just because you think you've made your mind up doesn't mean you should stop paying attention. US elections are intentionally long, forcing candidates to speak to a broad spectrum of voters and issues. Furthermore, current events constantly change the world an incoming President must deal with, which can quickly change a candidate's desirability or effectiveness. For example:


In October of 2008 the global recession was just beginning, and candidates John McCain and Barack Obama needed to respond appropriately. When McCain asserted that the US economy is fundamentally strong just a week before its collapse, he showed a lapse in economic judgment that some believe cost him the election., If there is no one truly exciting you on the two major tickets then there are still other options. Ignore those that say ""a vote for a third party is a wasted vote."" The point of our democracy is that your voice counts as much as any other persons, even if it doesn't match up to the mainstream. Furthermore, voting for a 3rd party can have real benefits for your political ideas:


Third parties get federal funding depending on how many votes they receive, which can help them continue running candidates and promoting ideas.
Significant 3rd party support can pull the major parties to their side, as Democrats and Republicans modify their stances to win over on-the-fence voters."
"
Search for a temperament and personality that you want as the face of our nation.,
Consider the people the candidate will hire if they win.,
Keep an eye on the Supreme Court, especially seats that may soon be vacant.,
Take note of how well a candidate works with their opponents.,
Emphasize foreign policy when studying candidates, as this is the President's largest sphere of influence.",How to Decide Who to Vote for US President3," One of the President's most significant roles is as our ambassador to the wider world. The president must meet and talk with world leaders from across the globe, and a US president is an especially crucial go-between for deals and peace talks. For better or worse, the United States is often the diplomatic head of major treaties and conversations -- make sure you've got someone who can handle the pressure of these talks with grace and poise.


How does the candidate respond to criticism or comments? Do they keep composure or fly off the handle?
How does the candidate respond to a crisis or tragedy? Do their speeches have a tone that inspires and leads in times of need?, The people a President chooses to serve beside them are just as important than the policies they enact, as individual jobs shape laws and policy for years to come. And the president may hire over 10,000 people each term.More than any campaign promise, the people a President chooses to delegate work to will shape their Presidency profoundly. While you don't know exactly who a candidate will hire, there are ways to get a good idea of their leanings:


A Vice President is frequently a trusted advisor and surrogate, standing in for the President in discussions and negotiations and advising on key situations. What is their track record, and what do they usually support or oppose?
Who does the candidate choose to speak on their behalf? Other politicians who frequently campaign for a candidate are often vying for a spot in the administration if they win. Are you comfortable with these people leading as well?
What Presidents does the candidate admire? What traits do they seem to respect in others -- honesty, experience, intelligence, courage, business success, etc?, Without a doubt, one of the most important duties of a President is appointing Supreme Court Justices, who all serve for life and make perhaps the most lasting, important decisions in the country. In 2016, for example, whoever wins the election will likely fill an open spot immediately, and the court is currently split between liberal and conservative judges. This means that whoever wins the election will likely pull the entire court their way -- at least until the next judge passes away or retires.


Consider recent major Supreme Court cases, and check online to see how each candidate feels about them. If you agree with their assessment, you'd likely agree with the people they'd put on the court.
A president has 4-8 years of service. This means that any justices over the age of 80 are at risk of leaving within their term limit, meaning the President gets a ""free"" pick. The more justices near this mark, the more seriously you should consider the Supreme Court in your decision., The US democracy is full of checks and balances that prevent any one President from completely running the country. This is a good thing, but it also means taking in any outlandish promises with a grain of salt, especially if the opposing party is vehemently opposed to it. The president often dictates policy, but they don't actually write any laws.


What issues do the candidates claim they cannot compromise on? Do you agree that there is no room to budge, or do you see some common ground?
Historically, have you seen evidence that a candidate can work with opponents in order to make progress (such as votes/bills in congress, work as a governor or leader with disagreeing state legislatures, etc.)? Is the candidate someone who can put aside small issues for the greater good?, Economic decisions, while key, are decades-long processes that are largely determined by Congress and the Fed, not just the president. Social issues, like gay marriage or abortion, require laws and court rulings to be enacted, few of which the President can do unilaterally. But, especially in recent years, the Commander in Chief has taken the primary role in our interaction with other nations, including deciding war and peace, with Congress largely sitting behind.


While war is supposed to be approved by Congress, the US has not had formal congressional approval since WWII. The President has, instead, used their Constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to direct ""military engagements."" Sometimes they have congressional approval (Afghanistan, Iraq) sometimes they don't (Libya)."

Apply at least 7 days prior to the election. You can use the application that comes with your sample ballot, or download the application form.


If you have moved since the last election, or if you have changed your name, you must re-register to vote.;
, Be certain to read the instructions and make clear marks for each vote.

, The envelope is traceable to you, so keep it with your ballot, and do not trade envelopes with other registered voters in your household.

, Many ballots get rejected because they are not signed.

, Remember, the ballot must be received by the end of election day. It is not a postmark deadline. Late ballots are rejected.



Use sufficient postage on your ballot. Many ballots weigh over one ounce, so they require multiple first-class stamps to mail. Walk into any post office and request help weighing the envelope if you are unsure of the weight or how much postage to affix.
According to the study, some 60% of uncounted ballots failed to be counted because they arrived late.

, The poll workers there can help you make sure your ballot is signed and collected in the right box. You may also be able to drop off your ballot at the office of the registrar of voters, city hall, county offices, libraries, or other government office in your county. A quick web search should help you find drop-off locations near you.


If you want another member of your household to drop off your ballot for you, make sure that person also signs. The envelope will have a specific place for that person's signature.
Some counties require that the person dropping off your ballot must be a member of your household, so read the instructions on the ballot and the envelope carefully.

, Many counties now have pages where you can look up the status of your ballot. It may take a few days before your ballot shows up on such a website. If your county has no such website, phone them and ask, instead.

Choose a political party.,
Evaluate each candidate.,
Research the popularity of candidates and parties.,
Create a network of like-minded voters.",How to Engage in Tactical Voting1," The party you choose will likely have overarching values that you agree with. So if your sincere preference is to vote for candidate X but X is clearly not going to win, you might be better off voting for another candidate in your party who does have a likelihood of winning. By choosing a political party, at least your general views will likely be represented in office if a candidate from your party wins.


In some cases, party preference will actually determine what candidates you can vote for in the primaries. For example, in a California closed presidential primary, only voters who have indicated their party preference can vote for their party’s presidential nominee.You can choose a political party by filling out a new voter registration form. You can fill out this form either online or in person.;
, Do your due diligence by learning about the candidates and the issues they are passionate about. Read articles or op-eds written about or by the candidates online or in newspapers. Look for an official voter information guide. Listen to radio podcasts about the election or watch televised candidate speeches and debates.


Look through each candidate’s website. The information will be biased, but you can still use it as a guide to determine what issues the candidates are most passionate about.
You could also attend a debate or a forum in person. Consult your local party for information on how to obtain tickets.

, You can most easily do this by keeping track of favorability, opinion, or exit polls, all of which can be found online. You can also gauge general consensus about the favorability of different parties and candidates by regularly listening to the news or reading about political developments.


Sign up for daily or weekly newsletters from reliable sites like the New York Times, Politico, or the Wall Street Journal to stay updated about breaking news or political developments.

, You don’t necessarily have to undertake a tactical voting strategy on your own. Voting is in great part a numbers game, so the more people who adopt your desired strategy, the more likely it is that your election goals will be met.


You can advocate for your views and create a network by recruiting others to vote, hosting discussions so you can learn about different views and talk to others about your own, and even driving people to polls.

Rank candidates.,
Vote in the primaries.,
Vote for whoever in your party you think has a greater chance of winning.,
Cast a bullet vote.,
Participate in straight-ticket voting.",How to Engage in Tactical Voting2," If you go into the election with a clear idea of who you would like to see win, who less favorable choices are, and who you most definitely would not like to see in power, you will be able to vote in a more decisive manner.


The research you have conducted up until this point should prepare you to make a clear and informed choice.

, Primaries can be open, closed, or semi-closed. You can try different tactical voting methods depending on the type of primary.


In an open primary, where voters can vote for any party regardless of their own party preference, you can try “crossover” voting. In this case, you would attempt to influence the nomination of a party which allows “crossover” voting by voting in that party’s primary. This way, you could try to swing the other party's nomination to be more liberal or conservative, depending on your preference.

For example, if you are a Libertarian, you could vote in the Democratic primary for the candidate who you find most agreeable or the one you dislike the least.Parties allowing “crossover” voting this election are the American Independent, Democratic, and Libertarian parties.Certain states will only permit “crossover” voting for unaffiliated voters. In that case, you have to be registered as No-Party Preference in order to cast a vote for a specific party different from your affiliation.Another tactical voting strategy for primaries involves partisans voting for the candidate generally considered to be weaker or the “lesser of two evils” in another party’s open primary. The goal with this strategy is to have the other party’s nominee be easier to defeat in the general election., This might mean casting an insincere vote - not voting for the option you actually prefer but instead simply voting for somebody who has a higher chance of winning and who you tolerate.If you gauge from the election forecast that your preferred candidate/party has a fair chance of winning - is in first or second place, say - then simply vote for them, or rank them highest in your list of choices.
If your preferred candidate is less likely to win according to the election forecast, then vote for your second or third choice candidate (if they are more likely to win).

, In this case, you would only vote for one candidate even though you have the option to vote for more.


This could be a good strategy if there are, say, two seats available and you know your preferred candidate is not going to get the most votes but might come a close second. In such a case, you would not want to risk having a third candidate take the second spot, so only vote for one candidate., This means voting for a party’s entire slate of candidates for every office. While only a few states offer this option, this is a good strategy if your goal is for nominees to be only from your party."

To vote in U.S. federal elections, for example, you will need to be 18 years of age or older, a U.S. citizen, and meet the residency requirements of your state., You can register to vote online or by visiting certain public facilities like a local voter registration office or the department of motor vehicles.You can also get information about how to vote overseas through the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP).

Wrap the burrito in foil.",How to Roll a Burrito1," A good rule of thumb is to have your burrito at least twice as big as the contents you'll put in it. That means that you have fold the burrito in half, with the contents inside, and easily reach both ends together with room to spare.






;
, This step is essential. Getting your tortilla warm and moist makes it pliable, meaning that it's easier to work with. To get that warm moisture into your tortilla, try any one of the following:









Place the tortilla under a large panini press on medium setting for 20 to 30 seconds.
Place the tortilla on a plate in the microwave for 30 seconds, using the high setting.
Steam the burrito, using a commercial steamer.

, You probably already have an idea of what you want to put into your burrito, but if not, you can take a cue from these examples:









Beans (black, refried, pinto, etc.)
Rice (white, brown, or ""Spanish"")
Meat (carnitas, carne asada, chicken, etc.)
Cheese
Lettuce
Salsa (""red,"" i.e. pico de gallo, or ""green,"" i.e. tomatillo salsa)
Sour cream
Guacamole

, Make sure to keep the contents of the burrito in the tortilla. Set it back down again, open faced.








,, Your tortilla flaps probably won't overlap at this point.









Don't pull too hard on the ends of the flaps as you fold them over to the center. This could rip the tortilla, causing the contents to spill out before they spill into your mouth.

,, This will bring the burrito together into a cylindrical shape. If you can, let the burrito rest on top of the last little flap for a minute or two; this helps fuse the ends of the tortilla together, making them stick together.








, This does three things: It provides insulation to keep the burrito warm; it helps compact the burrito even more; it gives the person eating the burrito a mold to help keep the burrito together.








"
"
Put some moisture into your tortilla.,
Carefully add the contents of the burrito to the center of the tortilla, being careful not to overload.,
Fold the left and right sides of the tortilla toward the center.,
Grab the bottom flap of the tortilla and tuck it over and then under the contents of the burrito.,
Continue rolling the tortilla until it assumes its traditional cylinder.,
Wrap the burrito in foil.",How to Roll a Burrito2," Again, this step is essential. You can microwave your tortilla, steam it, or put it through a panini press to get the desired heat and moisture. Whichever works best for you.








, Place a smaller amount of burrito filling directly into the center of the tortilla.








, Either the tortilla sides will meet, or the contents of the burrito will tell you when you should stop.








, This is much like the tuck motion you performed rolling a larger burrito.








, Your smaller burrito has been successfully rolled.








, This provides insulation to keep the burrito warm; helps compact the burrito even more; and gives the person eating the burrito a mold to help keep the burrito together.

You can find a portal that links to all fifty of the various Secretary of State websites at http://www.canivote.org/. The portal is maintained by the National Association of Secretaries of State.;
, Once you are on your Secretary of State's website, find the section where you can register to vote, or print off a voter registration form. It might be under a section entitled ""elections,"" ""voting,"" or ""registering to vote.""

, Most Americans age 18 and older are eligible to vote, regardless of race or gender. However, voting and elections are regulated at the state level. That means that states can enact their own specific rules regarding who can register and who can vote.


Some states bar felons and people in prison from voting, and some states bar people with certain mental conditions from voting. You can read up on the requirements specific to your state on your Secretary of State’s website. The ACLU also maintains a map at www.aclu.org/map/state-criminal-re-enfranchisement-laws-map.

, Again, each state will have different rules about how far in advance a person must register in order to be eligible to vote in a particular election. In most states, a registrant must register two weeks to a month prior to the election.However, thirteen states allow for same-day voter registration, also known as election day registration (EDR). The National Conference of State Legislators maintains a list at http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx.

, If you live in a state where the entirety of the registration process can’t be completed online, you’ll need to print the form out and send it in to your local county registrar of voters. Typically, the address of the registrar will be on the form itself.Follow up with your county registrar. Most of the time the registrar will send each voter a voter registration card. But the card doesn’t make you a registrant—it just provides you and the election supervisor with easy to access information about your identity and your polling place. So if you don’t receive a card in a timely manner, it doesn’t mean you aren’t registered, but you should follow up with the registrar to make sure.

, The rules determining who can and can’t vote absentee vary more widely than voter registration rules. Some states allow anyone to cast an absentee ballot (no-excuse absentee ballot), and some states only allow certain categories of people to cast them. Nonetheless, most voters are eligible in most states, even the states that don’t allow unlimited access to absentee voting.There are 27 states that offer no-excuse absentee voting, while Washington, Oregon and Colorado conduct all elections through the mail. The remaining 20 states require an excuse for the voter to cast an absentee ballot. You can find a complete listing at http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx

Curiously, while the requirements for showing ID are typically less stringent than they are for in-person voting, there are so many differences from state-to-state, and even for different categories of people within each state, that it is difficult to make any general guidelines. Simply check your state’s rules to make sure that you comply. They should be found on or near the absentee ballot application itself.

, There is so much variance in absentee voting deadlines that it is difficult to make any general comments about what is typical. The best advice is to check your state’s laws and make sure that you comply with them., Return your absentee ballot by mail or in person to the board of elections or registrar for the county in which you are registered within the appropriate deadline.

Login to the web portal and vote.",How to Vote Online3," Casting an absentee ballot through an online web portal is probably what most people would think of when they think of online voting. Unfortunately, it is also the least available of all types of online ballot access.Currently, only Alaska, Missouri, Arizona, and North Dakota offer access in this way. Alabama tried a pilot program for the 2016 primary election, and has not decided yet whether to implement it on a permanent basis.
Only Alaska offers this option to all voters. In the other states, only military and overseas voters are eligible, as provided by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voter Act (UOCAVA), although additional restrictions may apply based on your own state’s laws.

, If you are eligible, you will need to request the ballot. The exact procedures differ by state, so you will need to check with your state’s Secretary of State’s office.


You can find a listing of links to those offices at http://www.canivote.org/. No matter what, you will need to begin the process by requesting the ballot. In states like Arizona, you might be able to complete the process in one sitting. In other states like Alaska, you might need to request the ballot first, then wait for the state to email you the actual ballot.

, Once you’ve received the ballot, you can login to the web portal and vote. In some states, all you will do is enter a user ID and a password and cast the ballot.

""Midterm"" elections refers to the House of Congress and, as the name indicates, they come in the middle of the President's term. Here are the requirements you have to fulfill to be eligible:


You have to be a US citizen
You have to be a resident of the state you're voting in (each state has different residency requirements, so make sure that you meet them in advance)
You cannot be currently serving a prison term, on parole, or in another form of post-release supervision (though check with your local election board to be sure, since some states, such as Vermont or Maine, do not regulate felon voting)
If you're looking at the Presidential election, know that you may not have to be 18. Some states allow 17-year-olds (who will be 18 by election day) to vote in the primaries and caucuses.;
, Visit Canivote.orgto figure out if you're already registered. Some states give you a form to register when you apply for your driver's license, so you might have registered without knowing it. If you're not, this site can hook you up with the registration form or you can access it directly at the Election Assistance Commission's website.It's available in multiple languages, too!


Keep in mind that, even if you're already registered to vote, you will need to register again if you've changed your name, address, or if you'd like to officially change your political party affiliation.

, If you have not yet registered to vote, then there are four main ways to do it, depending on your state. You can register online in certain states, send in a National Mail Voter Registration Form, register in person, or fill out an absentee ballot. The most important thing is that you're aware of your state's deadline for registration, which typically falls between 2-4 weeks before an election. You also need to make sure you have the appropriate personal information, such as your name and address, before you register.


Registration in person is easy and you can do it at any of the following locations: the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), election offices, your state's voter registration office, the Armed Service recruitment centers, public assistance facilities, or state-funded disabilities centers.
You can also register online if your state is one of the 20 states that allows it.You can check this table to see whether or not you can vote online in your given state. If you can, then all you have to do is to visit the Federal Election Assistance Commission site to find your state's registration forms, right here.
You can also easily print, fill out, and mail in a National Mail Voter Registration Form. As long as you don't live in Wyoming, North Dakota, or the U.S. territories, then this option will work for you.

, Your town probably has dozens. They can be almost anywhere — government buildings, offices, restaurants, and sometimes even citizens' houses. Once in a while, a certain area will let you vote anywhere, but most places require you to vote at your polling place. Make sure you know how to get there well before election day.


Vote411.org can inform you of your polling place.Your state's election office website can do the same, too.
If you've recently registered, you should make sure to get confirmation of your registration at least a few weeks before it's time to vote. Check in with your state or local offices if you still haven't received word of your official registration.
Find out what you need to bring to the polling place. Each state has different requirements for what you need to bring for identification, whether it's a driver's license, voter registration card, or bank statements or bills with your name and address on them.

, This will let you know exactly who is running for which office, how many seats are open for the office, and how many votes you are entitled to cast for each office. It will also spell out any referendum or initiatives appearing before the voters.


If you're new to voting, it may be a good idea to familiarize yourself with your state's ballot. Each one is a bit different.
Mark your sample ballot according to your choices. This will help prevent confusion once you get to the voting booth and will allow you to cast your vote in the way you intend.

, Read the newspapers and look for voters' guides which may be published by nonpartisan groups in your area. Listen to radio or TV candidate debates or attend a debate or a forum in person. In local elections, where coverage is limited, it can be very effective to pick up the telephone and speak to a candidate.


Use the internet! Entire websites are dedicated to outlining the candidates' platforms, helping you learn about their stances and whose beliefs are in line with yours.

, Obtain a ballot and follow any instructions you are given. Be prepared for a wait — if you go before or after normal working hours, you may have a line ahead of you. Bring a book or your iPod to kill time. You can also make friends with your fellow citizens while you're waiting.


Bring identification with you! It's best to have a driver's license or passport; however, some places will allow you to bring in a check stub or some sort of bill (again, check your state's policies).
Before you vote, you'll need to check in with the official volunteers so they can know who you are and can give you a sticker or another ""reward"" for voting. If you have any questions about the voting process, they would be happy to answer them.

, Then, turn your ballot into the appropriate person or feed it into the machine. There are four types of counting you may run into:



Optical Scan Paper Ballot Systems: These are similar to devices used for standardized testing as if voting were like a multiple choice test. Once the ovals are filled in or the arrows are connected, the ballot goes through an optical scanner which can record the markings as a vote. This is done either at the polling place itself or at some central location. If this is what you run into, harken back to your college days and fill in each bubble darkly and evenly; don't use Xs, dashes, slashes, or check marks.Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Systems: This is a touchscreen computer that you walk up to record your vote; there is no paper. All the info is stored on a flash drive that is removed upon the poll's closing and sent to a central location by a police officer. Since touchscreens are foreign technology to some, instructions can't be missed. It's pretty simple, though; push the start button and you're off. If you wish to vote for a write-in candidate, there's a keyboard, too.Ballot Marking Devices: This method is reserved for disabled voters. It sort of combines the first two technologies into one — a touchscreen computer (that works well for the visual and hearing impaired) records the input information onto a physical ballot. It is then scanned or even hand-counted. New York City, believe it or not, still goes mano-a-mano with their ballots, old-fashioned as this tactic may seem.The Punch Card Ballot: If you were around for the 2000 election, you're familiar with this version — it was used in several counties in Florida and led to weeks of discrepancy. Since then, only four countries across all of the US have kept this methodology, so odds are you won't run into it. What once was prevalent in 30% of America has now been relegated to Bonneville, Clearwater, Franklin, and Shoshone counties — all in Idaho., If you want to make sure you cast your vote correctly, you may want to spend a minute reviewing your choices and making sure that your ballot was cast successfully, whether you fed it into a machine or turned it in another way.


If anything does seem to be amiss, call over one of the poll workers — they'll be able to help.

, Include your name, address (as registered), ward and precinct if known, the address where you'd like your absentee ballot sent, and your signature. If you're voting in a primary, you'll also need to include the party for which you wish to vote.


The majority of states allow for in-person and postal voting when it comes to doing it early. Some states are only postal or in-person and some have no early voting at all. Check your state's policies to see if this is an option., It should come with instructions and various return envelopes. However, if your state allows it, you can go cast your vote in-person before the election (depending on the state, it will be somewhere between 4 and 50 days prior to election day) to avoid the lines and hassle.

, Then, place it in the smaller brown envelope. Read and complete all information on the front of the envelope. Sign it when you're done.


Make sure all your choices are clearly marked — don't leave any room for interpretation. Follow the instructions on the ballot carefully.

, Place the proper postage on it, and then mail it to your city/town hall. The address should be indicated somewhere on the form or envelope.


Alternatively, you or a family member can hand your ballot to your local election official. Once more, check with your state's policy.
It must be received by the closing time on the date of the election day unless you're voting internationally. In that case, it can be received no more than 10 days after the election, so long as it is postmarked on or before election day. "

",How to Win a Chili Cook Off2,"


Do not use tender cuts of meat such as sirloin, because they may cook away or crumble into the chili.
Keep your choice of meat traditional by using beef or pork as opposed to exotic meats like ostrich or snake.
Do not use meat that contains gristle or large chunks of fat. Leaner cuts of beef will prevent large quantities of grease from forming in your chili.

Do not use one specific spice that will dominate the taste of your chili.
Unless the chili cook-off is a competition for the spiciest chili, do not allow spicy peppers to overpower the taste of the chili.

Party Preference will determine your primary vote in some states. In places like NY, registered Democrats cannot ever vote in Republican primaries and vice versa. In some states, party preference means nothing.Absentee Ballots allow you to mail in your actual vote. The US government will mail you a ballot in September, giving you a month or more to vote remotely.

, To do so, you'll need 1-2 valid forms of ID (depends on state) and a few hours to wait in line. You will be given a simple form to fill out and your ID will be checked to make sure you're who you say you are. That is it!

, You will receive a card in the mail with your name and vote registration on it if you were successful. However, if you don't get a card, you can still check to ensure you're registered properly. Go to Can I Vote.Organd enter your 2-digit state abbreviation to go to your state's registration database. You will be directed to fill in your name, date of birth and the town you live in.

, While a person's personality and temperament are important to consider, you need to think about each candidate not just as a person but as a set of positions. This is your representative from America to the rest of the country and the world, so you need to vote with a clear idea of the sorts of ideas and policies they will implement. Some early considerations must include:



Social Policy: Do you want a candidate who enforces a traditional social order, attempting to ground America where it is, or a candidate who wants to keep the government from interfering in social practices, like marriage equality?

Economic Policy: Do you believe taxes should be used to improve communal government infrastructure and services, or cut low, leaving these services to private businesses?

Foreign Policy: What would it take a candidate to send American troops overseas? Do you want someone who willingly uses force or someone who prefers diplomacy?

Domestic Policy: A big, big topic, this covers everything from immigration, renewable energy, gun rights, and more. Domestic policy varies even within the two major parties.

, There are a variety of good, independent websites that note the major similarities and differences between candidates, and you should use this as a launching point for your research. Never, however, trust just one of these sites. Read 2-3 different overviews to help cover your bases and minimize any biases for either candidate that the original writers might have had.


Try out Project Vote, Rock The Vote, Vote Smart, or I Side With for good starting spaces., A candidate's major website is, more or less, one giant advertisement. It will, of course, contain a lot of bias and benefits for the candidate. But that doesn't make it unhelpful. Rather than trust these sites as news sources, use them to see where the candidates really want to focus their energy. For example, a candidate may have a stance on immigration that you like, but they never talk about immigration on their website. Chances are good it is not a priority for them if they win the election, even if you agree.


Are the top three ideas on the site ""Crime,"" ""National Defense,"" and ""Foreign Policy?"" Then you know the candidate's major focus all election will be safety and defense.
Click on ""Major Policies,"" ""Positions,"" ""Ideas,"" ""Tenets,"" or any similarly broad word to find a list of candidate priorities.

, Don't trust everything you read -- take it straight from the source. Give each candidate the chance to win you over in ""real-time."" While the positions are important, you still need to think about a candidate's temperament, ability to speak, and their calm (or lack thereof) under pressure.


Spread out the subjects of the speeches. You can usually look up things like ""Obama on Foreign Policy,"" or ""Obama on Tax Cuts"" to get his perspective on a variety of topics.
While you should also check into debates, don't watch them in place of a few speeches. Candidates are very different when given 30 seconds to speak as opposed to 30 minutes.

, It is much harder to cram then to study a bit about the candidates in the months before the election. Sites like the New York Times, Real Clear Politics, Politico, and FiveThirtyEight all have weekly or daily press releases. Usually, they are short paragraphs filling you in on any political changes over the week, with links to articles you might like.


Alternatively, make a site like Google News or Real Clear Politics your home page. Every time you open your browser, key news and articles will be there if you're interested.

, Many people instinctively think that, because they won't likely win, 3rd party candidates are a waste of a vote. Nothing could be further from the truth. Independent parties actually receive government money based on their votes that lets them bring their ideas to the winners not as party positions, but as the will of many real voters. While a 3rd party candidate might not win outright, enough support can help 3rd party ideas win and gain traction with Democrats and Republicans.For a recent example, look no further than the 2016 primaries. While Bernie Sanders didn't win enough votes to become the nominee, his ""independent"" votes have caused Hillary Clinton to adopt his supporters' views ($15/day minimum wage, anti-Trans-Pacific Partnership), knowing she needs to respect her voters and the will of the people., Especially today, when voting issues have already consumed primaries in NY, AZ, and elsewhere, there is no reason not to be extra-sure of your Constitutional right to vote. Head once more to Can I Vote.org and check in with your local election board. You do not want to have this fight on election day if there is an issue.

, Call or look up your local election board. In most cities, this is simply the city's board, like ""The San Francisco Board of Elections."" In smaller towns, it is likely a county board. Still, a call to city hall or a quick internet search should reveal the location easily. Be sure to look up:


Polling place address.
Alternative polling place.
Hours of operation.

, Different states have different needs, so bringing an ID is always worth it if you're unsure about the requirements. If you have your voter registration card and want to be sure of no issues or problems, bring this along as well. Note, however, that many states only require ID.

, Depending on timing, population, and the available polling staff, you could be out the door in two minutes or two hours. Long waits to vote are supposed to be rare, but, again, recent issues with the 2016 primary (where voters waited 4-5 hours in some areas) have exposed problems with the system that have yet to be addressed. Instead of forfeiting your right to vote because you have to leave, make sure you give yourself time in case of issues.

, The most common ways to vote are:



Paper ballot. You simply mark your choices with a pencil (the ballot looks similar to the type of school test you used to take by filling in answer circles). You place your marked ballot in a locked box or put it through a scanner (someone will help you with this if you aren’t comfortable doing it yourself) before you leave the polling room.

Mechanical voting machines. Many localities still use mechanical voting machines. You step inside the “box” and the curtain automatically closes behind you so that you may vote in private. The candidates and issues are listed on the left side of the machine. Depress the small lever next to each name or ballot question—either “yes” or “no.” When you have cast all your votes, you will slide a large lever (located at the base of the machine) all the way to the right. Your votes are registered in the machine and the lever opens the privacy curtains so that you can exit.

Electronic voting systems. Even though most voters are computer savvy these days, each state that uses electronic voting provides an instructional tutorial to voters before they vote. If you can navigate your way around a computer or a smart phone, then voting electronically will pose no challenge to you. You simply look at the screen, make your selections (touch point screen) and when you have cast all your votes, you touch the “Cast my Vote” button that is located at the bottom of the screen.

Ask for your ballot.",How to Vote Early," Early voting is a process by which a voter can cast their ballot in a given election before Election Day. Some states actually call the process “early voting,” while others use “in-person absentee voting,” meaning that you cast an absentee ballot by physically showing up at your local board of elections. If your state allows in-person absentee voting without requiring the voter to give an excuse, it is the same thing as early voting.There are currently 32 states which allow early voting, and all states allow absentee voting, although many states require voters to have an excuse such as age or sickness in order to cast an absentee ballot. The National Council of State Legislatures has a record of early and absentee voting rules by state. You can find a list at http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx.
In Washington, Oregon, and Colorado, all elections are conducted by mail. The state mails all registered voters a ballot for each election, rendering early voting and absentee voting procedures irrelevant.;
, Absentee voting also allows voters to cast a ballot before Election Day, but involves mailing a ballot instead of voting in person. Absentee voting was originally designed only to serve voters who would actually be absent from their precincts on Election Day, but has gradually expanded in many states to cover a variety of circumstances.If your state does not allow early voting, it may allow absentee voting with or without an excuse. Because this method of voting allows the voter to cast a ballot before election day, it can be considered a type of early voting, but they are typically distinguished from one another. You can see what your state’s rules are by going to http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx


, Even if your state allows early voting, your local board of elections may lag in implementing an early voting system. If you cannot find the county elections office number, go to the website of your state's secretary of state, which will maintain a listing of contact information for local boards of elections.


You can find a portal that links to all 50 of the various secretary of state websites at http://www.canivote.org/. This portal is maintained by the National Association of Secretaries of State.
Delays in implementing early voting, unreasonably short hours for early voting, and very few locations for early voting have all been used in the past as cheap tactics to suppress the vote.If you suspect this is happening in your area, you should contact your state attorney general’s office or the US Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division’s Voting Section.
You can file a complaint with the Department of Justice at http://www.justice.gov/crt/complaint/votintake/index.php. A directory of state attorneys general is located at http://www.naag.org/naag/attorneys-general/whos-my-ag.php.

, If you aren’t already registered to vote, you’re going to need to register in order to vote early. In most states, you’re going to need to register at least 15-30 days before the election in which you intend to cast a ballot, although some states have Election Day voter registration. You can see a list of deadlines at https://www.usa.gov/voter-registration-deadlines.


Luckily, registering to vote is easier than ever in many places. If you would like to register, simply go to https://vote.usa.gov/, and indicate in which state you would like to vote. The website will take you to the appropriate state website, where you can register online if your state allows.
If your state does not allow online registration, you can fill out a PDF of a voter registration form that you can then print out and mail to the appropriate address.Even if ID is required to vote, it is typically not required to register.

, As of 2016, at least 34 states have some type of Voter ID law in effect.That means that you will be required or requested to show ID at the polls in order to cast a non-provisional ballot. In addition, in order to vote where you are registered, you need to have an ID showing that you reside at the same address that is on your voter registration form.


Although each state decides which types of ID are acceptable, all states accept a state-issued photo ID with your residential address listed.
The National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a guide to the 50 states and their various rules regarding voter ID at http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx.
Ironically, voter registration cards are usually insufficient for the purposes of ID. Although a voter registration card provides a record of your registration, it is not necessary to bring it with you to cast a ballot.

, Most states require voters to register at least 15-30 days before the election, and in addition to voter registration deadlines, many states that allow early voting only allow early voting on certain days or in certain weeks leading up to the election. The rules governing the days early voting is held vary widely by state. You can find a list of each state’s rules at http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx.

, Most states do not hold early voting in each precinct as they would on Election Day.In some states, your early voting location will be on your voter registration card.


If early voting locations are not listed on your voter registration card, you can call your county board of elections for the locations. In addition, this information will be available in many states through the secretary of state’s website.

, Many states will have statewide rules for the times of day early voting can take place. Other states will allow the county boards of elections to determine what times of day to hold early voting.


You can find out what your state does at http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx.
If you live in a state with a Voter ID law, remember to bring identification with you.

, Whether or not your state uses electronic voting machines, the poll workers can give you limited assistance should you need assistance in completing your ballot. If your state uses paper ballots, submit yours to the poll workers after you fill it out.

Fill one-half of the tortilla with roughly 2 tablespoons of cheese.,
Fold the tortilla over the cheese and add to the hot pan.,
Flip after the bottom is golden-brown, usually 3-4 minutes.,
Remove and serve once both sides of the tortilla are crisp and golden and the cheese is melted.",How to Make Cheese Quesadillas1," You can use whatever cheese you want, though the classic choice would be a Mexican queso. Feel free to mix and match the cheeses depending on what you have one hand, as well:


Queso
Cheddar
Monterrey Jack
Pepper Jack
Mozzarella
Fontina
Colby;
, Quesadillas need to be cooked slowly enough that the cheese melts, but fast enough that the outsides crisp and brown quickly. Medium will pull this off perfectly.

, Keep it light as you can, a teaspoon of oil and just a touch of butter-- tortillas are very absorbent, and will get soggy if there is too much liquid. Don't use olive oil, as it has a strong flavor that doesn't usually mesh well with the cheese.


For a deliciously rich quesadilla, spread butter on the bottom side of your tortilla., Fold the tortilla in half and add your cheese on just one side. While a ton of cheese is always delicious, over-stuffing the quesadilla will prevent it all from melting and holding its shape. For a typical tortilla, two tablespoons of filling -- whether just cheese or cheese and meat, will perfectly fill the quesadilla.If you buttered one side of the tortilla, you want to keep this as the outside. Fill the other side.

, You'll know the pan is hot enough when the oil just starts to let off some smoke. Don't worry if the tortilla starts to unfold, simply press it back down into the cheese as best you can while it cooks.

, Use a flat, thin spatula to lift the tortilla and check that it is cooked, then, working quickly, flip it to the other side. This is the time to make sure it is nicely folded over, as the cheese will melt and hold it all together as the second side cooks.

, This is all the cooking you'll need to do, and they usually take roughly 5-7 minutes total to cook. When done, add a little more oil to the pan if you plan to cook more than one. Serve quesadillas hot.


If the cheese is melting but the tortilla is not crisp yet, turn up the heat a bit and use less butter or oil next time.
If the side is blackened but the cheese inside is still cool, lower the heat for the next few."

Cook your quesadillas in the microwave for quick, near instant cooking.,
Broil the quesadillas in the to make quick quesadillas in the oven.,
Grill the quesadillas on high heat for an outdoor cooking solution.",How to Make Cheese Quesadillas2," This simple snack is often easiest with two tortillas. Simply top one of them with cheese, like it was a pizza, and then lay another tortilla on top. Cook in the microwave for 30-45 second bursts until all the cheese is melted.


You can only really melt the cheese here, you can't get a nice crispy color brown.

, They will usually not have the same crunchy-gooey texture of a stovetop quesadilla, but they come close. This is also a great way to make multiple quesadillas at once. Start the oven on high and make your quesadillas on a foil-lined baking sheet. Then, as the oven is still heating, put the quesadillas in the oven. Flip them roughly halfway through, and cook until they outsides are browned and the cheese inside is melted.


If the outsides are browned before the cheese melts, turn the heat down and cover them all with a sheet of foil. This prevents burning while still applying heat.
Brush the tortillas with oil or melted butter beforehand for a more golden-brown crust.

, Simply get the grill nice and hot, using medium-high burners, and clean off the grates. Spray the grill with a non-stick cooking spray and lay the quesadillas directly over the heat. Flip them quickly, after 1-2 minutes or when you see the cheese melting. Keep flipping until the sides are crisp to your liking.


You can wrap the quesadillas in foil for a less messy grill. This is especially useful if you believe the filling is going to drip out easily. Do not, however, let the quesadillas cool in the foil, or they will get soggy with steam and moisture.

Add a spice blend to the cheese to kick up the flavor.,
Avoid seafood and vegetables that are best served cold.",How to Make Cheese Quesadillas3," All of the following ingredients can be added, mixed, and matched to make incredible quesadillas. You simply need to mix it all up with the cheese and then add the scoops of the filling mixture before cooking -- no other work needed!


Remember that you can mix and match cheeses, as well.
A little extra cheese never hurt anyone. Feel free to play with the ratios to find your perfect quesadilla.

, The most common addition to quesadillas is a protein of some sort -- either shredded chicken or pork, steak, or beans. Add at least one cup of bite-sized meats or beans to your cheese and enjoy. For meats, be sure to add a light seasoning, such as half a packet of taco seasoning, to get a little extra flavor.


Black or pinto beans
Chopped or shredded chicken
Mexican pulled pork
Thinly sliced flank or skirt steak.
Crumbled bacon

, Meat eaters aren't the only ones who get something more than cheese. The following veggies are perfect if you simply brown them in some oil, then toss with the cheese after they're cooked.


Mushrooms
Onions (well-caramelized)
Squash
Zucchini
Leeks
Bell peppers
Poblano peppers (roasted), Lettuce and other greens will tend to wilt unappealingly under the heat. You want to add only the vegetables that can hold their flavor and texture under the heat of cooking, such as:


Diced yellow onion
Jalapeno peppers
Fresh green peppers
Sliced avocado
Chopped garlic

, Feel free to get creative, as you can really customize the flavor of your quesadilla with just a few pinches of spice. While most of these are for a Mexican-inspired dish, you can even try out a set of Italian spices if you're using cheeses like Mozzarella or Fontina:


Cracked red pepper
Garlic powder
Paprika
Cayenne Pepper
Chili Powder
Oregano
Dried onions
Basil, rosemary, thyme

, Fresh tomatoes are incredible on top of a quesadilla, but they lose some of their punch and flavor when cooked in a pile of cheese. Seafood, as well, tends to drown out in cheese, leading to bland bites of food where there should be much more flavor (the only exception is cooked shrimp) Keep these ingredients out of the heat and you'll be much faster:


Seafood
Greens (though a thick layer of spinach can work)
Tomatoes
Cabbage
Uncooked meats

Serve.",How to Fold a Tortilla," Before you add your fillings or work on any folds, you should heat the tortilla slightly in the oven, on the stove, or in the microwave. A warm tortilla is less likely to crack than a cold or room temperature tortilla.To warm tortillas in an oven, first preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Wrap a stack of eight tortillas in aluminum foil and heat them in your preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes.
If warming a tortilla on the stove, turn one burner on high. Grab one tortilla with a pair of tongs and hold it over the burner for a few seconds, occasionally swapping sides. Remove once it softens and starts to turn brown.
To warm tortillas in the microwave, wrap a stack of eight in a clean, semi-damp paper towel or dish towel. Microwave the stack on full power for 30 to 45 seconds.;
, The filling should take up no more than one-fourth of the total area of the tortilla, if that. If you fill the tortilla with too much, it will likely burst open no matter how you fold it.









The placement of the filling will vary depending on how you plan to fold the tortilla, but you should always follow this principle no matter which fold you use.
Check the individual method instructions for more details concerning filling placement.

, Spoon the filling just below the center of the tortilla.Arrange it in a straight line and do not lump it into a single pile.


Make sure that you have plenty of extra room on the ends.For small tortillas, 1 inch (2.5 cm) will probably work. For larger tortillas, you may need to leave 2 inches (5 cm) on each end. If you fill the tortilla to the end, the contents will spill out as you fold it.

, Gently fold the bottom up and over the lower edge of the filling.









For a more secure fold, you should hold the tortilla up so that the filling slides down into the new fold you just created, making it tight. Do so carefully to prevent the filling from falling out.

, Fold one side of the tortilla in toward the center, followed by the other side. The two sides do not need to meet.









Note that you should fold into the center of the tortilla so that these two folded edges will fold to the same side as the folded bottom.

, Wrap the tortilla around the filling from the bottom up, covering your three previous seams in the process.









To prevent the fillings from falling out, you may need to gently place your fingers over the folded bottom edge at the point where it meets the filling, at least until that section has been covered by folded tortilla.
Keep rolling the tortilla up until the entire thing has been used.

, Your tortilla should be stable enough to enjoy as is. If desired, though, you could also secure the tortilla with toothpicks.

, The filling should be placed slightly off-center, just a little below the actual center of the tortilla.









The filling should be spread in a thick line and not in a large clump or pile.
Make sure that there is enough extra room at each end of the tortilla to prevent the filling from falling out. If you have a smaller tortilla, 1 inch (2.5 cm) might be enough. For larger tortillas, you may need up to 2 inches (5 cm) on each end.

, They should almost but not quite touch.









As you fold, some of the filling might slide down to the bottom of the tortilla or over the center mark. This is fine as long as none of the filling slides off the lower edge.

, Use your thumbs to bring up the bottom of the tortilla, wrapping it up and over the fillings as well as the lower portion of your folded sides. Continue rolling the tortilla up using this same general motion.









Make sure that each fold you make as you roll the tortilla up is as tight as possible. You should squeeze the roll back toward you a little each time to ensure a tight roll.
Continue rolling the tortilla all the way up like this until the entire shell has been used.

, At this point, you should be able to serve and enjoy the tortilla without any problems. You should even be able to cut it in half without the tortilla coming undone.


If it still seems a little loose to you, however, you could also place a few toothpicks in it to help keep the tortilla secure.

,









Note that this folding technique only works if you are working with sliced deli meats, flat greens, soft cheeses, chutneys, or thick spreads. It will not work with crumbly fillings like ground beef or shredded cheese.

, Wrap the tortilla up in a tight roll, working from bottom to top.









Gently fold the bottom up and over into a cylinder with a diameter of about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Continue rolling the rest of the tortilla over this initial cylinder until you reach the top edge.
If you have ever rolled up a jelly roll, the process is very similar.

, For this method, a good way to serve the tortilla is to cut it into thirds on the diagonal.


You could also create smaller appetizer-size portions by cutting the wrap on the diagonal into four to six pieces.

, Spread the filling down the center third of your tortilla in a straight line.









Mentally divide the round tortilla into equal thirds vertically. Spread the filling in a line down one line marking off one of the final thirds.
If you are working with a square tortilla, you will need to draw a line of filling down the diagonal of the shell, from one corner to its diagonal opposite.
Make sure that you leave at least 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) of space at each end so that the filling does not fall out as you fold the tortilla.
Note that this fold is not quite as secure as some others are, so it is generally best to use it for larger fillings like sliced deli meats and sauteed vegetables since these are less likely to spill out.

, Bring the side nearest the filling in toward the center. The edge of the side should extend just past the center of the tortilla.









Make sure that the filling is completely covered by this side of the wrap.

, Fold the other side of the wrap over the filling and the first side of the tortilla. Wrap this side around the previously folded edge and around, tucking it beneath the bottom of the tortilla to hold it in place.









Fold the tortilla as tightly as possible without breaking it. You can make the fold tighter by gently pushing the filling against the sealed fold you first created while folding over the second side.

, The tortilla should be ready to enjoy as is. You may want to secure the wrapped tortilla with toothpicks if it seems too loose, however.

, Spoon the filling over your tortilla so that it stops just short of the edge, roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) all the way around.









Note that this will work better with fairly solid fillings, like diced or sliced vegetables, spreads, sliced deli meat, fruit, or large chunks of meat or fish. Do not use this method for fillings that have watery sauces or small pieces that could slip out easily.

, Divide the tortilla into four quarters. Cut it down the vertical center once and the horizontal center once.









Do not fold the tortilla before doing this.
Make sure that you completely cut through the fillings, as well. Each wedge should be equal in size and shape, and the fillings should all be clearly separate.

, Wrap the tortilla around the filling from one rounded corner to the other.









The two rounded corners are the corners connected to one flat edge one on side and the rounded edge of the tortilla on the other side.
Imagine a diagonal line connecting the rounded corners. Fold one corner into the tortilla, gradually rolling it toward that other corner along the imaginary diagonal line. When done, you should have a cone-shaped tortilla with one closed point and one open end.
Alternatively, you could simply fold one of these rounded corners over so that it meets the other rounded corner. Press the edges together to seal them.

, The tortilla and its fillings should be ready to enjoy at this point, but you may wish to keep it secured with a toothpick if the tortilla shell seems loose.

, Mentally divide the tortilla in half. Spread the filling over one of these halves, stopping at the imaginary center line and leaving one half untouched.









Spoon the filling out over this half so that it stops short of the rounded edge by about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).
If working with a square tortilla shell, divide the shell in half diagonally rather than doing so crosswise or lengthwise.
Note that this is the method usually used for half-moon quesadillas., Bring the untouched half of the tortilla shell up and over so that it completely covers the filling. The two edges should overlap evenly.









If you press the edges together firmly, you might be able to help pinch them in place, especially if you gently moisten them with water before doing so or if you plan to bake, sauté, or fry the tortilla afterward.

, The filled tortilla should be ready to enjoy.


For quesadillas and other similar dishes, cut the folded tortilla into four wedges, with each cut starting at the center point along the folded edge and going outward toward the open edges.
The tortilla should not be bulky, but if it is, secure it with a toothpick before enjoying.

If you can't get Primula cheese, you can replace it with another soft spreadable cheese like Manouri, Brie, or Brillat-Savarin., Remove your bacon from the bowl that you set aside and place it over the tortilla covered in cheese. Line up the apple slices so that there's an even distribution over the tortilla., Place the other tortilla cooked side down and press down on your quesadilla. Allow it to cool for another minute before serving it. The soft cheese and bacon will add a smoky saltiness, so no seasoning is required.

Stir the ingredients together and season to taste.Include a 6 ounce can of tomato paste if you prefer thicker chili.
Add some heat to your chili with half a cup of diced jalapeño, poblano or ancho chile peppers.;
, If you’re in a pinch, simply pick up a couple cans of premade chili from the supermarket rather than making your own from scratch. This will save you time and money, helping you get dinner served faster and simplifying the cooking and cleaning processes. 2-3 cans should be enough for a standard pot pie.Enhance the flavor of storebought chili with an extra dash of chili powder, cayenne or garlic.
Look for hearty stew-style chilis. Stay away from the thin, watery types of chili used for hot dogs., Bring the chili to a low boil, then reduce the heat and let it continue to heat and thicken. The chili should just begin to bubble slightly around the edges. Stir every few minutes to keep the temperature consistent throughout.The longer you simmer the chili, the more time the individual flavors will have to set up and mingle with one another.The chili should already be hot when it goes into the oven.

, Fill the baking dish about ⅔ of the way full. This will leave you with enough room to layer on the cornbread topping, which will rise as it bakes. Make sure the dish you use is oven safe and large enough to hold the prescribed amounts of both chili and cornbread batter.Another idea is to use a small single-serving dish, such as a miniature baking mug or muffin tin, to make fun individual portions. Just make sure to leave about an inch of space at the top of the dish.
Baking the cornbread topping with the chili underneath will keep it moist and help it cook faster.

, In a large mixing bowl, measure out the cornmeal, flour, salt and baking soda. Shake or stir the ingredients together to blend them.You can also include any additional ingredients at this stage, such as dry herbs and seasonings or diced onions and jalapeños.
If time is an issue, consider picking up a box of instant cornbread mix. Just add milk or water and stir!, Crack two whole eggs into a separate bowl. Add 1¼ cups buttermilk, as well as 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Beat the wet ingredients vigorously to incorporate them.For richer-tasting cornbread, use melted butter or ghee in place of regular oil.
Using a hand mixer to beat the eggs will help produce an especially light and fluffy topping., Sift the dry ingredients into the eggs, buttermilk and oil gradually, whisking as you go. Continue stirring to break up any big lumps of flour and cornmeal. Once thoroughly blended, the mixture will form a thick batter that will bake up into a fluffy, crumbly cornbread crust.If your batter comes out too thick, add an extra splash of buttermilk. If it’s too thin, shake in another teaspoon or two of cornmeal and flour.

, Layer the cornbread batter on top of the chili in the baking dish you’ve already set aside. Fill the remaining ⅓ of the dish so that the batter is level with rim. Use a spatula to scrape out and smooth the sticky batter.Spread the batter to the corners of the dish to achieve maximum crust coverage.
The cornbread topping will expand as it bakes, so be careful not to overfill the baking dish.

, Once it beeps, the pot pie will be ready to go in.You want to cook the pot pie somewhat slowly to reheat the chili and prevent the topping from burning.

, Place the baking dish on the center rack. Set a kitchen timer and watch the pot pie’s progress as it cooks. When it’s done, the outer crust will take on a crispy, golden brown texture.If you’re preparing pot pies in single-servings or smaller dishes, they may not need the full 20 minutes to finish cooking.Since the chili has already been cooked, the cornbread topping will be the main indicator for determining when the pot pie is ready.

, Remove the pot pie from the oven and let it sit and cool for a few minutes before dishing it out. Once it’s an edible temperature, scoop the chili and cornbread crust into bowls and throw on a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese, a handful of sliced jalapeños or a dollop of sour cream. Serve the pot pie with tortilla chips and a juicy lime wedge.Offer other tempting options like shredded lettuce, fresh cilantro, avocado wedges and hot sauce.
Set out a variety of toppings so that everyone can have fun building their own perfect bowl., Whatever you don’t eat can be transferred to a lidded storage container and placed in the refrigerator. You can also simply cover the baking dish with a sheet of aluminum foil before stowing the entire thing away. Chili pot pie makes for great leftovers, as it warms equally well in the oven or microwave and tastes even better once the individual flavors have had more time to set up.Homemade chili will stay fresh for 3-4 days when properly refrigerated.
Enjoy leftover chili pot pie as a quick dinner for one or a hearty midnight snack.

Try a vegetarian version.",How to Make Copycat Wendy's Chili2," Brown the meat and place it into a slow cooker along with all the other copycat chili ingredients. Stir the chili well to combine the ingredients. Put the lid on the slow cooker and cook the chili on LOW for 6 to 8 hours or on HIGH for 4 to 6 hours.To help the chili thicken, you can leave the lid off of the slow cooker for the last hour of cooking.

, Replace the 2 cups (480 ml) of water called for in the copycat chili recipe with a flavorful liquid like stock. You could use beef, chicken, or vegetable stock. Or consider using one of these:


Wine
Beer
Tomato juice

, Although the copycat recipe calls for ground beef, you could use ground turkey or pork. Keep in mind that the ground turkey will make a leaner chili while the ground pork may make the chili greasier.


You can also combine different meats for more flavor. For example, use one pound of ground pork with one pound of lean ground beef.

, If you like the flavors and seasonings of the chili, but don't want to include the meat, make a few adjustments. Leave out the ground beef and use chopped mushrooms instead. You could also crumble in tempeh for a texture similar to meat.


For a vegetarian version, remember to use water or a vegetarian broth.

Begin by cooking the chicken.,
Dice the onion.,
Add the ingredients to your crockpot.,
Cook the chili for 6-8 hours.,
Shred all the breasts.,
Return the chicken to the crockpot.,
Prepare the cheese and cilantro.,
Serve your crockpot creation.",How to Make Chicken Chili1," The two best ways to cook chicken for chili are by either simmering in a pan or by boiling. These methods will help retain their moisture so they're not too tough when you later add them to the rest of the ingredients.


To simmer chicken, put about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil in a 12-inch frying pan and heat on medium. As it warms up, lightly salt and pepper each side of the chicken breasts, place them top down in the pan and cook for 5 minutes until they are golden brown on the top. Flip the breasts, add 3⁄4 cup (180 ml) water, cover and simmer over medium-high for 7-10 minutes. Make a small slice in the middle of each to check for any pink. If not, they’re done!
To boil chicken, fill a medium-to-large pot about halfway with water and add the chicken breasts. Turn the burner to medium-high heat until the water starts boiling. Reduce the heat until the water is simmering and cover with a tight lid. Cook for about 15-20 minutes. Again, check to make sure they are fully cooked by slicing into them to ensure there is no pink in the center.;
, Dicing onions isn’t the most pleasant task. In fact, it often reduces one to tears, but here are the basic steps.


First peel off the outer, papery skin, and then place the onion on its side on a cutting board.
Cut off the top of the onion (where the stem is), and then turn it so it’s sitting on the flat surface created from cutting off its top.
Now cut it in half. Take one of the halves, lay it flat-side down and cut 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) slices lengthwise toward but not all the way through the end, or root, so the onion doesn’t fall apart.
Turn the onion and cut 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) slices perpendicular to the ones before, and the pieces will start to break away. Do the same for the other half of the onion., Mix the onions, cannellini beans, corn, Rotel, chicken broth, green salsa verde, cumin, oregano and chili powder together in the crockpot. Arrange the chicken breasts on top.

, After about 6-8 hours, or when you get home from work, for instance, open the crock pot, remove a chicken breast and slice into the middle to make sure it’s not pink. The chicken should also be very tender.


Aside from the time convenience of cooking with a crockpot, there’s also a nutritional advantage as well. Because a crockpot cooks at a low heat level, it doesn’t suck out all the vitamins and minerals in food.As for chili, crockpots are a great solution because the longer you let chili cook, the more flavorful it will become.
It also takes the heat out of cooking chili in the summer since you’re not standing over a hot pot, stirring for a couple of hours. You don’t even have to be at home while your food essentially cooks itself.

, Allow the breasts to cool before you begin shredding or they will be too hot to handle. The quickest way to do this is by putting them in a pan of cool water for a few minutes. Once they’ve cooled down, you’re ready to proceed. There are a couple of ways you can go about shredding.


You can pull the chicken apart with your hands and place the shredded pieces on a plate.
You can hold a breast with either one hand or with a fork and use another fork to tear the chicken into pieces and place the pieces on a plate., After you’ve shredded the chicken, put it back into the crockpot and stir everything together. Heat for another 20-30 minutes to warm the chicken back up.

, While the chicken is warming back up, get your toppings out and ready to go. Shred the Monterey or cheddar cheese. If it's in a refrigerated package, measure it out and let it sit so it's not as cold and hard when you put it on your chili. Also wash, dry and prepare your cilantro.You can either top your chili with whole leaves, or you can top it with chopped cilantro.


To chop cilantro, simply gather the bunch in your hand and begin chopping from the flowering tops toward the roots. Only chop off as much as you think you will use. Then put the tip of the knife on the chopping board and rock back and forth over what you've already cut to create smaller pieces., Ladle the chili into serving bowls and top it off with either the Monterey or cheddar cheese (or both) and the cilantro.

Serve.",How to Make Birria," Traditional birria is made with goat meat, but you can make the dish with beef, lamb, or pork instead if these types of meats are easier for you to find or more palatable to your family or dinner guests. Regardless of the type of meat you select, look for a hindquarter cut.


The meat can either be bone-in or boneless. Bone-in meat can take longer to cook, but cooking the stew while the bones are still in the meat can result in a more flavorful sauce. On the other hand, boneless cuts of meat are usually easier to work with and often cook to done in less time.;
, Use a sharp knife to cut the fat off the meat. Cut the meat into two to four chunks.


You do not need to cut the meat into serving portions at this point. You simply need to cut the meat into smaller portions so that it will be easier to brown. Note that smaller portions will also take less time to cook.

, Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) vegetable oil to a large Dutch oven or skillet. Heat on medium-high, then add the meat and cook it in the hot oil until all sides have browned evenly.


If you plan on cooking the stew on the stove or in the oven, you should use a Dutch oven for this step. Once the meat has browned, cover the Dutch oven and temporarily remove it from the heat until the rest of the stew is ready.
If you plan on cooking the stew in a slow cooker, you could use a large skillet for this step, instead. After browning the meat, remove it from the heat source and temporarily set it aside.
Browning the meat is not an essential step, but doing so can enhance the flavor of the dish, so it is strongly recommended nonetheless.

, The types of chile most often used for this dish are guajillos, pasillas, anchos, and cascabels. You can stick with just one chile type if you strongly prefer its flavor, or you can add further dimension to the flavor profile of the dish by using a combination of these peppers.Guajillos are medium-hot chiles. When used fresh, they are known as mirasol chiles.
Anchos, also called mulatos when dried, have a mild heat profile and are known as poblanos when used fresh.
Pasillas are sometimes confused with anchos or even marketed as such for their similar appearance and flavor profile, even though the two are technically separate varieties.
Cascabels are medium-hot chiles, as well, and are known as bell chiles when fresh.

, Add the chiles to a separate dry, heavy saucepan. Toast them on medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently, or until they become more fragrant and begin to look puffy or enlarged.


For an even stronger, hotter sauce, wait until the chiles begin to darken. This may take 6 to 8 minutes.

, Pour the broth into the saucepan with the chiles. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the chiles simmer in the broth for 20 to 30 minutes.


The broth should just barely be at a simmer. If you notice rapid bubbles forming as the chiles sit, you may need to turn the heat off completely for a few minutes before switching it back on to low.
If you do not have broth, use water instead.

, Remove the chiles from the broth using a slotted spoon. Transfer them to a cutting board and slice them into pieces, removing both the seeds and veins as you work.


Reserve the cooking liquid after you remove the chiles. You will still need it for the sauce.
Note that if you want more heat in your birria sauce, you can actually leave the seeds and ribs. Simply cut out the tough stems and use the rest of the chiles as they are.
Use food-grade gloves when handling the chiles. When the chile juices get onto your hands, they can cause mild burning and discomfort. Even worse, if you accidentally touch your eyes while the juices are on your hands, you can experience an extreme burning sensation in your eyes.

, Place the chopped chiles, cooking liquid, pepper, garlic, salt, tomatoes, onion, cloves, cumin, thyme, and apple cider vinegar in a large food processor. Process on medium to high speed until the entire mixture appears thick but smooth.


If necessary, you can add fresh broth or water to thin the sauce some if it appears too chunky or heavy. The sauce should be thick, but it definitely needs to be a sauce and not a paste.
Use a blender if you do not have a food processor or if your food processor appears too small.

, Place the browned meat in your slow cooker and pour the sauce over it. Stir gently to coat all sides of the meat, then cover the appliance with its lid.


If you want to add the bay leaves for more flavor, place the leaves into the sauce before covering the slow cooker.
A slow cooker uses lower heat than any other cooking method and, therefore, requires the greatest amount of cooking time. As a result, though, the meat will be the most tender when this method is used.

, When done, the meat should be extremely tender.


If you used the bay leaves, fish them out of the sauce as soon as the dish has finished cooking.
Do not open the lid of the slow cooker at any time during the cooking process. Doing so will release the steam that has built up inside, dropping the cooking temperature as a result and lengthening the final cooking time by another 15 to 30 minutes.

, Use two forks to shred the tender meat into the sauce. Mix well with a serving spoon to spread the meat out evenly into the sauce.


Note that if you used a bone-in cut of meat instead of boneless meat, you will need to remove the bones from the dish after shredding the meat.
Hold the meat still with one fork while shredding portions off the sides of the meat with the second fork.

, Ladle the stew into large bowls and enjoy.


You can serve the birria with lime wedges, if desired. Squeeze the juice over the stew before eating it for a zesty twist of flavor.
You could also garnish the dish with additional chopped onion, chopped cilantro, or chopped radishes.
Consider serving the dish with a side of tortillas, as well. You can fill the tortillas with the meat and dunk them into the broth as a different method of eating the stew.

,


If you want the meat to be even more tender, preheat the oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius) instead. Note that the lower cooking temperature will require you to cook the stew for an additional 30 to 60 minutes longer than specified in the remaining instructions.

, The meat should already be in the Dutch oven if you browned it. Pour the sauce over the meat and stir well to coat all sides. Cover the Dutch oven with its lid.


Add the bay leaves to the sauce at this point, if desired.
If you do not have a Dutch oven, you could use a roasting pan or any other oven-safe dish that can fit all of the stew. This dish should preferably have a lid, but if it does not, tightly wrap aluminum foil over the top to cover it.

, Place the dish into your preheated oven and cook until the meat begins to fall apart. Check the dish after the first 2-1/2 hours, then check every 30 minutes after that.


Remove any bay leaves from the broth before shredding the meat.

, Use two forks to shred the meat. Mix the shredded meat back into the broth until evenly spread out.


If there were any bones in your cut of meat, remove them from the stew before serving it.
To make the shredding process easier, hold the meat still by sticking it with one fork. Use your other fork the remove bite-size shreds of meat from the sides of the roast.

, The birria is now ready to eat. Ladle it into separate serving bowls and enjoy.


Garnish the dish with lime, chopped onion, chopped cilantro, or chopped radishes, if desired.
You can eat this dish as you would eat any other stew, or you can spoon the meat into warm tortillas and dunk the filled tortillas into the broth.

, Pour the sauce over the meat already in your Dutch oven. Switch the heat on your stove to high and stir the contents of the Dutch oven until the sauce begins to boil. Immediately reduce the heat to low.


If you want to add a bay leaf or two to the sauce, now is the time to do so. Add the bay leaves after the sauce boils and just before you reduce the heat.
If you do not have a Dutch oven, use a large, heavy stockpot with a tight lid.

, Stir the contents of the dish occasionally as it cooks.


If you decided to use bay leaves, you will need to find them inside the sauce and remove them now. Do not shred the meat or serve the stew with the bay leaves still inside.

, Use two forks to shred the tender meat into fine pieces. Use a serving spoon to thoroughly stir the pieces into the sauce.


Strip the meat off the bones, if applicable, before shredding it.
Hold the meat still with one fork and use the other fork to shred bite-size pieces off.

, Scoop the stew into large, individual serving bowls and enjoy while still hot.


Eat the birria like a standard stew by spooning out the broth and meat with your tablespoon.
Alternatively, you can eat the birria by spooning the meat into warm flour or corn tortillas. Dip the filled tortillas into the sauce of the stew as you eat them.
For a bit more decorative flair and flavor, consider garnishing the dish with chopped onions, chopped cilantro, chopped radishes, or lime wedges.

Using a very sharp knife, cut straight strips about 1 inch (25 mm) apart down the length of the breast. Turn the cutting board and cut straight strips about 1 inch (25 mm) apart across the width of the breast. Lightly salt and pepper the cubed chicken.

, These three ingredients will take some time to prepare as they require mincing, dicing and de-seeding, but the kick they’ll give your chili will be well worth the effort.


Dice the onion as you did for the crockpot chicken chili recipe.
To mince garlic, you must first pick off a clove from the bulb and peel it. Start by laying the flat side of the clove on a cutting board. Take a wide-blade knife, hold the handle with one hand and lay either of the flat sides of the knife on top of the clove. Push down hard with the heel of your hand to smash the clove, which will allow you to easily take off the peeling.Now lay the clove on one of its flat sides on a chopping board, cut off both ends and cut the clove in thin strips lengthwise, or from root to tip. Turn it 90 degrees and cut strips in the opposite direction, which will form a pile of garlic. Put the tip of the knife on the cutting board and, using a rocking motion, move the heel of the knife in different directions as you cut into the pile. And Voilà! Minced garlic.To de-seed and mince jalapeno peppers, first consider wearing a pair of gloves! Next, cut the stem off the pepper, slice it in half lengthwise, take a spoon and scoop out the seeds.Now, cut very thin, or roughly 1⁄16 inch (1.6 mm) lengthwise slices. Take the slices, turn them crossways and make very small cuts across.

, Heat a saucepan deep enough for soup over medium or medium-high heat for a few minutes, or until the pan is quite hot. Next add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil to the pan and swirl it around so that it coats the bottom. Continue heating for 10-30 seconds, or until the oil begins to shimmer, looking almost colorful or iridescent.Toss in the onion, garlic and jalapeno, stirring frequently for about 3 minutes or until tender.

, Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil into the pan and add the cubed chicken, cumin, chili powder, oregano and crushed red pepper. Stir them all together until the chicken is lightly browned on all sides.


Flip and stir the chicken frequently so each side browns, but does not burn.
If the oil splatters, turn the heat down a bit.

, Pour in the chicken broth and add the corn, cannellini beans and Rotel. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.


You will want to stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.
This is also a good time for a taste test to see if you want to add more spices, which is best to do while cooking because heat draws out the flavor in spices., While the chili is cooking, you will want to get the bacon prepared. There are three ways to do this: pan fry it, cook it in the oven or microwave it.


To pan fry bacon, lay out the slices so that they don’t overlap but still fill up the pan. You want enough slices in the pan to produce plenty of grease. Otherwise, they’re likely to burn. If you overlap them, they won’t cook evenly. Turn the burner to medium heat and let them cook for several minutes before flipping. Once they are crispy enough for you, use a fork or spatula to remove them from the pan and put them on a paper towel-covered plate to soak up the grease.To cook bacon in the oven, pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lay out the slices in the pan horizontally and don’t overlap them. Cook them for about 10-15 minutes, flipping once. To cook bacon in the microwave, put 3 layers of paper towels on a plate and lay the slices side-by-side across the plate. Cover them with another paper towel. The total cook time depends upon microwave wattage and whether or not there’s a rotating tray, so you will just have to go slow and watch it., After you've crisply cooked the bacon, let it cool for awhile. Then crumble it so it's larger than bacon bits but not in massive chunks. You can crumble it by breaking it apart with your fingers or by using a knife to chop it.

, Add the cream cheese to the chili and stir until it is well blended and fully melted. Next add half of the crumbled bacon and stir.


Setting out the cream cheese while the chili is cooking will soften it up and make blending it much easier.

, Ladle the chili into serving bowls and top it off with shredded Monterey or cheddar cheese and more crumbled bacon.

Prepare the rotisserie chicken.,
Prepare and cook the vegetables.,
Add the remaining ingredients and cook.",How to Make Chicken Chili3," The standard rotisserie chicken is 2 pounds (0.91 kg) with a seasoned skin, which will need to be peeled. You will also need to shred it.To do so, start by removing the wings and legs by cutting through the joints with a knife and then pulling them off. Peel off the skin from each piece as you go.
Use a knife to run down the center along the breast bone to remove the breast meat.
Try to get as much meat off the back as you can.
When shredding, use either your fingers and hands or one hand and a fork. If the meat gets stuck in the fork, gently pull it off.

, Dice the onion and green pepper, and mince the garlic. Place them all in a 3-quart casserole dish with enough water to coat the bottom of the dish. Microwave on high for 3-4 minutes, stirring once halfway through.


To dice a green pepper, first cut off the top and bottom ends before standing it up and making a cut down one side. Next, lay the pepper on its side, slide your knife in the opening and, while turning the pepper, cut between the pepper and the core/seeds. Discard the core, and cut the pepper in half. Take one half, holding it flat, and cut it into thin slices. Keeping the slices in a row, turn them perpendicularly and again cut thin slices, forming dice. Do the same for the other half., Toss in the shredded chicken, Rotel, tomato sauce, kidney beans, chili powder, salt and paprika. Microwave everything on high for 25-30 minutes. When done, make sure you use hot pads while removing the casserole dish from the microwave as it will be very hot.


Make sure you stir the chili frequently while it's cooking. Microwaves cook quickly but very unevenly, even those that rotate.
To give it a bit more punch, try crushing up some tortilla chips and throwing them on top, along with a dollop of sour cream and a squeeze of lime juice.

Carne asada is marinated skirt, flank, or flap steak that is then grilled over high heat and lightly charred. It is considered a more expensive cut but is still very forgiving on the grill. Like most Mexican meats, it is readily available in a carniceria.;
, Although chicken is not a common meat ingredient for burritos in Mexico, it is increasingly popular in America. There is a ton of versatility to chicken. Here are just three ways to prepare it for your burrito:



Boiled and shredded. Shredded chicken is a more traditional Mexican preparation style.

Sautéed chicken. Sauteed chicken is generally dark-meat chicken and fried with a bit of oil and Mexican spices before being cut into smaller bits.

Chicken mole. Black mole is a perfect compliment to succulent chicken. Try it out if you've never tasted a variation of this dish that 99% of Mexicans have enjoyed.

, Carnitas is the Mexican name for slow-braised pork — specifically, Boston butt or picnic ham cuts. The meat is first slow-braised to break down the collagens and cook the meat, and then finished off fried or sautéed to develop a crispy texture.

, ""Al pastor"" means ""in the style of the shepherd,"" and it probably originated as a Mexican interpretation of Lebanese shawarma. Today, it is a spicy way to cook pork, and it's absolutely delicious. Try this meat out in a burrito. Do it!

, Chorizo is a spicy pork sausage that comes in a casing. When sautéed, it is deeply aromatic and flavorful. Common in breakfast burritos but also in normal burritos.

, Barbacoa is the name from which we derive the english word for ""barbecue."" In modern Mexico, barbacoa refers to meats (usually sheep) cooked slowly over an open fire.

, Many burrito eaters may not be accustomed to more experimental cuts of meat, but they offer a nice break from the monotony of beer or chicken. Go to your local carniceria and talk with the butcher about picking up some of the following:



Lengua — cow's tongue

Cabeza — cow's head

Tripa — intestines

, Ground beef, flavored with taco seasonings, makes for a perfectly respectable burrito meat. If you don't want to go crazy with Mexican stylings the first time around, try out this simple recipe and take things from there.

, Flour burritos have a wonderful elasticity to them when exposed to heat and a little bit of moisture. If you don't have a burrito steamer handy, try zapping the tortilla in the microwave for 20 or so seconds.

Remember to choose a burrito that's large enough. You can always work a too-big burrito, but trying to wrap a burrito with a tortilla that's too small will only result in headaches and sad ingredients. Do yourself a solid.

, The shape isn't too important, as long as you've given yourself room on all sides of the tortilla to wrap with. If you don't want to cook Mexican rice, you can always use plain white rice or even brown rice for a healthier option.

, If choosing black beans to add to your burrito, make sure to drain off any excess liquid before adding. Again, the portions aren't fixed. Most people add quite a bit, but you can add however much or little you want.

, The meat is the star of the show, so give it time to bask in the lights. The same goes for vegetarian options using tofu, mushrooms, etc.

, You don't have to add cheese if you don't want, but lots of aficionados opt for it. If you buy cheese from the store, look for ""Mexican 4 cheese"" varietals. If you want to use just one or two kinds of cheese, go for one of the following:


Monterrey Jack
Cheddar
Asadero
Queso Blanco

, Neither of these ingredients are strictly necessary, but can make a good burrito even better. If you plan on adding salsa or pico de gallo, don't go crazy with the tomatoes.

, Whether green and mild or grilled and slightly savory, onions are a great touch to a burrito, but you don't want them to steal the show with their strong taste.

, The condiments here contribute added flavor but help keep the burrito from becoming too dry.

, The crisp, watery lettuce cuts through some of the more intense flavors of the burrito nicely. Especially if the contents of the burrito are warm, the lettuce you add will wilt a bit. Add a bit more than you think you want.

, Fold the two side flaps of the tortilla in to the center. Securing the side flaps with your fingers, take your thumbs and bring the bottom flap up over the side flaps. Hold the burrito in the center and simply roll it forward until the top flap of the tortilla is no longer showing.


Finish off the burrito by wrapping it securely in the aluminum foil. The aluminum foil will help keep the burrito warm. It can be simply peeled down as you eat the burrito.

If you lay your tortilla directly onto a gas burner, be very cautious to ensure that it doesn't catch fire. Do not leave the stove until there's nothing over the flame.

, Lay the tortilla out on a flat surface. Place a line of toppings from one edge of the tortilla about 2/3 of the way to the other edge. A smear of hot, refried beans, some warmed chopped meat, some cheese, warmed rice, avocado, salsa, grated cheese, a bit of sour cream. Don't stack your pile more than 1-2 inches wide and an inch high. If you fill your burrito too full, you might not be able to seal it.

, Fold the corners towards the center, then grab the bottom and roll it up. To seal the burrito, try poking the ends in so that they remain tucked. It may help to dip a finger in water and run it along the margin first.


Repeat as needed to make more burritos. At this point, you can serve them right away or toast them in a pan.

, This will lightly brown the sides, seal the fold, and give the tortilla a crispy texture. First, spray a large skillet with cooking spray and turn it to a medium-high heat. Lay the wraps into the skillet, seam-side down. Cook until the burrito is golden brown and crisp on the bottom. Then, turn over and cook until golden brown on the other side.

, Get 2 pounds (907 grams) of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, or boneless pork loin, or flank steak.Trim any fat away. Leave pork whole but cut steak into thin strips. You can cut the chicken breasts into strips or leave them whole.

You can also use boneless chuck roast instead of steak.You can also skip the meat if you'd like a vegetarian or vegan option.

, Trim away the white/pale part from the inner ribs. Finally, cut the bell pepper into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) strips. You can cut them lengthwise or widthwise.

If you can only find one type of bell pepper, substitute it for the other colors.
If the lengthwise strips are too long for you, cut them in half widthwise.

, Cut the onion into quarters. Next, cut each quarter into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) thick slices.

You can use red onion, white onion, or yellow onion.

, Try to get the kind that have green chilies in them. If you don't like chilies, you can get regular diced tomatoes. You can also substitute salsa instead; plan on using 10 to 20 ounces (325 to 650 grams)., Try to spread it as evenly across the bottom as you can. Make sure that your slow cooker is big enough to fit the rest of your ingredients, about 3 to 4 quarts (3 to 4 liters)., You can mix them up first in a big bowl, or you can keep them separate. You will eventually be mixing everything together in the end.

If you want crispier vegetables, hold off for now. You will need to add them during the last 30 to 60 minutes of cooking., Spread the meat evenly across the vegetables. You are adding it last because you will need to take it out and shred it. This will make it easier to take out, and you won't have to ""dig"" for it.

Some people like to rub their seasoning on both sides of the meat first. You can do this too, or save the seasoning for the end.

, If you rubbed the seasoning onto the meat, you should still have some left over. Sprinkle it on top of everything in the slow cooker, focusing on the vegetables., Your fajitas are essentially seasoned, but there are a few things you can add to take things to the next level. What sort of extra seasonings you add depends on the type of meat you are using. Here are some suggestions for you:

Chicken: add 4 cloves of minced garlic or 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) lime juice.Pork: Add up to 2 cups (475 milliliters) of barbeque sauce.Steak: Pour ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of soy sauce over the meat., You can use a low or high heat setting. Let them cook until the meat and vegetables are tender. If you want crispier vegetables, add them into the slow cooker during the last 30 to 60 minutes.

Chicken: cook on low for 6 hours or on high for 3 hours.Pork: cook on low for 8 to 10 hours.Steak: cook on low for 9 hours or on high for 5 to 6 hours., Use a pair of tongs to take the meat out of the crock pot; leave everything else inside. Place the meat onto a cutting board. Cut the meat into thin, ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) thick strips. You can also use a pair of forks to shred the meat instead.

If you already cut the meat and do not wish the cut it down further, you can skip this step.
Use a clean knife and cutting board. Do not use the ones that touched the raw meat previously.

, If the meat has not been cooked all the way, cook it for another 10 to 15 minutes on low, covered.This is not completely necessary for steak, but it is for chicken and pork., Use a pair of salad tongs or two forks to toss the ingredients together. Keep doing this until everything is distributed evenly throughout the mixture. Be sure to grab the goodies from the bottom of the slow cooker as well!, Use a soup ladle to scoop out the excess broth. You can discard it or save it for another recipe.This will make it easier to serve the fajitas and prevent them from being too soggy., You can transfer all of the fajitas onto a large platter so that everyone can serve themselves. You can also scoop out about ½ cup (120 milliliters) onto flour or wheat tortillas instead.You can use store-bought or homemade tortillas.
If you are using store-bought tortillas, heat them up in the microwave for a few seconds. Keep them between sheets of paper towel to prevent them from getting soggy

, Since everyone likes different things, it would be a good idea to have all of the toppings in separate bowls. This way, everyone can take how much they want of whatever they want. Just about anything that goes in a taco or burrito will go well in a fajita. Here are some ideas to get you started:Fresh cilantro/coriander, chopped
Guacamole
Salsa
Shredded cheese (especially Cheddar or Monterey Jack)Sour cream

Once it reaches the desired temperature, set your chicken on the grill. Cook each side for five to six minutes.The Food and Drug Administration advises cooking chicken to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) before consuming. Use a meat thermometer to verify each piece is safe to eat., Once the chicken has cooked, remove it from heat. Let it sit for about ten minutes so it can be safely handled without burning yourself. Once it’s cool enough to touch, cut each piece into bite-sized portions., First, line a heavy saucepan on your stovetop with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Set the burner to medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat up, then add 1 cup (185 g) of basmati rice and 2 tablespoons of lime juice. Stir to mix the juice and rice and spread the rice evenly. Let the rice sautee for one minute.


If starches are a concern, rinse the rice in a strainer under the faucet before adding it to the pan., Once the rice has toasted in the oil for a minute, pour 2 cups (473 ml) of water into the saucepan. Wait for the water to begin boiling. Then cover the saucepan and turn the heat down to low.For white rice, leave the pan covered for roughly 18 minutes before checking to see if the rice has become tender and absorbed all the water. For brown rice, wait for 30.Avoid checking earlier than needed, which will cause moisture to escape as steam.

, First, fluff it with a fork once it’s cooked. Then stir in 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped cilantro. Finally, dish equal portions out into four bowls.

, Divide your chicken into four equal portions. Use each portion to top one bowl of rice.

Use flour.,
Create a cornstarch slurry.,
Try cornmeal or masa harina.,
Opt for arrowroot.Add 1 tsp (5 ml) of arrowroot mixed with about 1 tsp (5 ml) of cold water to the chili and let simmer until thick.,
Let the chili reduce.",How to Thicken Chili1," Alternatively use unflavored protein powder (available at drugstores, and some grocery stores) for thickening low carb chili. Add a slurry made from 1/4 cup (60 ml) cold water (or dip out some of the chili juice to use) and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) flour.Mix the flour and water in a separate bowl, beating well with a fork so that the resulting thickener is smooth and without lumps.
Add the flour mixture to the chili and cook over medium to medium-high heat on the stovetop, stirring constantly, until the liquid boils and thickens. This should only take a few minutes.
Continue cooking and stirring an additional minute after the chili thickens so that the flour is completely combined into the chili. Otherwise, you might be able to detect hints of flour in the flavor of the chili.
For larger batches of chili in which the excess liquid equals 2 cups (500 ml) or more, double the amount of flour and water you use.
While flour is a flavorless thickener, some believe that using too much flour and water in your chili can dull and dilute the flavor, making it less potent.;
, Mix together 1 Tbsp (15 ml) cornstarch with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) cold water to add to the chili.


Beat the cornstarch and water together thoroughly in a small, separate bowl before adding it to the chili. Make sure that there are no lumps.
Stir the cornstarch slurry into the warm chili and heat over medium to medium-high heat until the mixture bubbles and thickens. You should see results within a few minutes.
Add more cornstarch and water, if needed. If the chili is still not thick enough, you can create more of the slurry to add in. Large batches with more than 2 cups (500 ml) of excess liquid may need twice the amount of cornstarch slurry, if not more.
Let the chili cook for an additional 2 minutes after it thickens so that the cornstarch breaks down completely. Otherwise, it could tint the flavor of the chili.
Note that cornstarch gives liquids a slightly glossy appearance.
Also note that cornstarch is flavorless and will not alter the taste of the chili; though, if you add too much of the slurry, it can dilute the flavor and tone it down.

, Adding 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of either cornmeal or masa harina straight to the chili will also thicken the liquid.Add the cornmeal or masa harina to the chili without mixing any water into it first. Mix it in thoroughly so that it absorbs some of the liquid, thickening it up.
Let the chili simmer for an additional 5 to 7 minutes after adding the thickener.Fine cornmeal resembles flour but has a strong corn taste, as it is ground directly from corn. Masa harina also has a strong taste, since it is ground straight from dried hominy, which is a product of corn.
Adding either cornmeal or masa harina will affect the taste of the chili. It can impart the taste of polenta or tortilla shells to the liquid.
While many individuals may find that the added taste complements the flavor of the chili, others argue that it pollutes the taste, instead.

,


Mix the water and arrowroot separately in a small bowl until smooth.
After adding the slurry, allow the chili to come to a simmer, stirring constantly. The liquid should thicken quickly.
Arrowroot refers to a starch obtained from the arrowroot plant. It can usually be found near the cornstarch.
Arrowroot is flavorless and potent, so only a small amount is needed. Since a small amount is used, it should not dilute the taste too much, making it a favorite among many chili fans.
Like other starches, arrowroot will add a slight gloss to the appearance of the chili liquid.

, Remove the lid from your pot of chili and let it simmer for an additional 30 to 60 minutes.


You can bring up the temperature to reduce the amount of time, bringing it closer to 30 minutes. Do not let the chili reach a full boil, though. If you keep the chili cooking on low at a slow simmer, it may take closer to 60 minutes before significant reduction is noticed.
This process uses evaporation to reduce the amount of liquid in the chili. Removing the lid maximizes the effect by allowing more steam to escape.
The remaining chili liquid will have a stronger, more concentrated flavor after the reduction is complete.

Buy an emulsifier.,
Discard excessive fat before emulsifying.,
Add the emulsifier conservatively: a teaspoon for a little pot, a tablespoon for a big one.

",How to Thicken Chili2," An emulsifier, such as lecithin (commonly available in health food sections) will help disperse the fat throughout the chili, adding a slightly thicker, rich mouth feel to every bite without actually increasing viscosity much.

, This process makes the fat more appetizing, if you were going to keep it, but adds fat if you'd otherwise drain it off.

,"
"
Mix in tomato paste.Stir a 6-oz (180-ml) can of tomato paste into the chili during the final 30 minutes of cooking, stirring well to combine.,
If your chili has beans in it, strain out about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the beans and re-fry, or puree them in a food processor or blender.,
Add quick oats.,
Add other solid ingredients.",How to Thicken Chili3,"


Since the vast majority of chili is tomato-based, adding additional tomato paste to the chili does not introduce much new flavor to the chili. It can remove some of the ""kick,"" however, so you may need to bump up the amount of seasoning you use to balance things out.
Since tomato paste can be somewhat bitter, you may also want to add 1 tsp (5 ml) to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of granulated sugar to the chili, as well. The sugar will balance out the bitterness and add a mild sweetness to the chili.
If you only want the chili to become a little thicker, add the tomato paste slowly, using about 1/3 of the can every 10 minutes or so. Stir well after each addition. This will give you an idea of how thick the chili is becoming and can prevent your chili from becoming too thick.

, Return these beans to the chili, mix in, and let cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until well warmed.Be careful when pureeing hot food, especially if using a blender. The puree can spin out of the blender and cause burns if you do not keep the lid held down with a thick towel.
If you expect the chili to be too thin before you start making it, you can make the process easier on yourself by pureeing 1/2 cup (125 ml) or more of the beans before adding them to the chili.
Add home-cooked or canned beans. They do not need to be mashed up in order to make your chili seem thicker. Use a can of pinto or kidney beans.

, Inexpensive canned ""No Beans"" chili, thick and popular for hot dog topping, is not all meat. Its non-meat ingredient is oatmeal! (Really, read the label). Dried oats, for oatmeal, absorb a lot of liquid and form distinct moist kernels transitioning to soft but not completely mushy ones as they cook. Check the canister for the amount of finished oatmeal a certain amount of dried oats will make by absorbing liquid, and add conservatively. Cook for at least a few minutes for ""quick"" (parboiled) oats; at least a half hour for ""old-fashioned"" oats.

, Sometimes the liquid itself is thick enough, but the chili has too few solid ingredients and is not chunky enough. In these instances, feel free to alter the recipe simply by adding more solids. But bear in mind that many ""solids"" have a lot of liquid in them and will soften with or even release it in cooking. Adding precooked items like drained tomatoes, onion, corn, beans or okra, etc. toward the end of the cooking makes the chili chunky, but adding them midway through and cooking much longer can bring out additional juices and make the chili soupy.


Add uncooked noddles to simmering chili to take-up liquid. Let it simmer for 10 to 15 minutes to heat and check the noodles until they are as tender or al dente (firm) as you like.
Add diced tomatoes -- either canned or fresh. Let this to simmer gently for 10 minutes or so to heat well, or longer to soften the fresh tomatoes, if you wish.
Use diced peppers, such as 1/2 to 1 bell pepper, diced, for a mild, sweet flavor. Use 1 chili pepper to add more heat to the chili, if desired. Let it simmer, gently, for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir in minced or powdered, dried onion and let it simmer to absorb water. Onion adds a spicy sweet flavor but does not linger on the breath like raw onion would do.

Wait until the end for this method.,
Crumble a few saltine crackers and stir them into your individual serving of chili.,
Try crushed corn chips.,
Stir in potato flakes.,
Add crumbled cornbread, such as a single muffin or slice of cornbread into the chili and stir a little.,
Stir in grated cheese, chipped-up soft cheese or cheese dip/sauce.",How to Thicken Chili4," If you have a thin chili pot that doesn't spread heat well, don't like to stir the chili, or want extra thick chili, it's best to wait until the end because thickening will decrease convection that spreads heat throughout the chili mass without creating hot spots that can scorch.

, Start with 3 or 4 crackers, adding more to bring the chili to your desired thickness.


You could also use miniature oyster crackers, but it is still a good idea to break them up so that they can absorb more of the liquid.
To add an interesting dimension of flavor, you could also use flavored gourmet crackers. Try garlic-and-cheese, green onion, or four-cheese flavored crackers, for instance.

, Add a layer of crushed corn chips into your bowl before ladling the chili in. Stir to combine.


While corn chips do not thicken the chili quite as much as crackers do, many prefer the flavor of corn chips to the flavor of crackers for chili. While they do not thicken the liquid itself, they do thicken the overall texture of the chili by adding another solid to it.

, You can sprinkle 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of dried potato flakes into a large individual serving of chili while it is still hot.


The potato flakes will lighten the color of the chili slightly. They may also alter the flavor, giving it a heartier taste, but the difference is not especially dramatic.

, The cornbread will absorb some of the liquid, making the chili seem thicker overall.

, The cheese adds rich, creamy smoothness to the lucky partaker's palate.

",How to Cook the World's Tastiest Chili Con Carne Recipe," Firstly, you need two pans for this, one for the veg/chili/garlic and one for the meat.


Put only a teaspoon or two of oil (preferable groundnut oil, but it doesn't matter) in the veg pan, once hot, add the chopped chili first, this infuses the oil with the chili heat and flavor. The first thing you put in the pan is essential.





;
, if you don't have the seeds, and you only have the powder, then add a touch of this now instead, not all at this stage.

,,


You don't need a lot of oil at all, as the meat gives off some good juices. The meat starts to sweat the fat off itself as it starts to brown, once this has happened, pour 95% of the fat juice from the meat into the veg pan, so essentially, the veg is now cooking in meat fats. They soak up that flavor and make them really really tasty!!






Next put some more of the cumin into the veg, not all of it, and a little bit of salt and black pepper.






You want the lamb (or if you really want to use beef, go ahead) to be brown but not burnt, keep it moving, sprinkle a touch of cumin on the meat, stir it round, remember, you don't need it 100% cooked, as you're still gonna be stewing it a little later on.






Making sure you don't overcook it here is key to keeping the tenderness of the lamb.






Once the meat is at a point you're happy with, and the veg is nicely softened a little (the peppers won't soften so much but they are now packed full of flavor and burst in your mouth when you eat them), add the meat to the veg, or veg to the meat, which ever pan is bigger.






Add your chopped tomatoes and your chili kidney beans stir around and add all the cumin now, don't be shy with it, it's what gives a good chili real flavor. Add a decent amount of black pepper and salt to taste.







, At this point, depending on how confident you feel you can try experimenting with a few different flavors, you could grate a little nutmeg in now, add a touch of paprika or even cinnamon. Feel free to experiment.

, remember do not think you've put in too little of this, as you can overdo it easily. 10drops max.

,,,,, Also works well with tortilla chips, sour cream , and garlic bread.

,, The grated carrot and onion give it texture too and the soft lamb is delicious, and because of the RED beans and general red color of the dish, and the YELLOW peppers, and the GREEN peppers, that's why I've named it ""Traffic Light Chili"".

Add the cheese.,
Cook the nachos.,
Dress the nachos.,
Serve and enjoy.",How to Make Nachos1," Classic nachos highlight the two most essential nachos ingredients: chips and cheese. Build on this foundation by adding whatever toppings you desire. Pick up the following items:


Tortilla Chips: flour or corn, the fresher the better. The perfect chip is thick enough to hold serious toppings but light enough to let the other ingredients shine.
Cheese: cheddar is the classic, but mozzarella, monterey jack, cotija; if it can shred, it’ll taste good. Mix them for color.
Salsa: your choice. The classic is chunky pico de gallo.
Sour cream: Try not to choose low fat. Sour cream gives Nachos part of their umami and balances the spice.
Pickled jalapenos: available in most supermarkets. Leave these out if you can’t handle the spice.
Beans: black beans or refried beans are the most popular choices. This optional ingredient adds some heft to your nachos.
Meat: seasoned ground beef or shredded chicken. Adding some well-cooked and seasoned meat, while optional, can make your nachos much more satisfying.
;
, You can also use a pie dish or a casserole dish for this purpose. If you’re microwaving the nachos instead of heating them up in the oven, use a microwave-safe dish., Sprinkle a liberal amount of cheese over the nachos. Try to get some cheese on every chip.

, Nachos taste just as good whether they’re cooked in the oven or the microwave. Choose one of these cooking methods:


Broil them. Set the oven rack 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the heat source and broil until the cheese melts. This will usually happen in 5 minutes. Be careful not to burn the cheese. Remove and let cool for a few minutes.
Microwave them. Microwave on high for 2 minutes. Remove and let cool for a few minutes.


, Place dollops of sour cream in a ring around the top of the nachos. Sprinkle the jalapenos and salsa on top.

, Napkins are a must; forks are scandalous. Select a nacho, dip it in some sour cream, use it to scoop a jalapeno, and eat up.


Classic nachos taste great with the addition of any of your favorite meats or vegetables. Favorites include ground beef, grilled steak or chicken, sliced sauteed mushrooms, raw minced onion, black olives, and shredded lettuce.Individual portions can be served on small plates or in bowls; just divide the chips and melted cheese up before adding other toppings.

Potato chips: get either flavored or plain, ruffled or smooth.
Cheese: choose pepperjack, cheddar or both, shredded.
Salsa: pico de gallo is the clear winner for this dish, as anything saucier will compete with the BBQ.
Sour cream: you can skip this if you want, but it’s surprisingly delicious with BBQ sauce.
BBQ: pulled pork is available at any BBQ joint and most grocery stores. Make sure to get the sauce, too.

BBQ chicken is also delicious, but never serve anything with bones.
Vegetarian chili or baked beans are also great substitutes for meat.

If you are making more nachos than one plate can support, you can use two plates and microwave separate batches.;
, Add 1/2 cup of Pico de Gallo and microwave for 30 seconds. Mix together.


If your beans are still too firm to easily mix after 30 seconds, microwave them in 15 second increments until soft. Only microwave them until they are warm, you don't need to get them hot.

, Here comes the fun part. Scoop the bean and Pico de Gallo mixture all over the surface of your chip pile. Because the refried beans may be a little sticky, you might find it easier to drop globs all over rather than trying to spread them over the chips.

, Take a few pinches of your shredded cheese and evenly distribute it until you have used 2 cups. You can use less cheese if you prefer. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons of diced green chilies on top if you prefer a spicy kick to your nachos.


You can use a prepackaged bag of Mexican blend cheese or grate your own cheese. Freshly grated cheese may melt easier in the microwave.Spread the cheese evenly over the tortilla chips. You do not want any naked chips.

, Place the platter in the microwave and cook for 1-2 minutes. If the beans are still cool after 2 minutes, microwave them in 30 second increments until they are hot.


Don't let the beans get so hot that they boil, this will cause them to dry out and get crusty. When refried beans boil, they can also make a mess in your microwave.
Be careful when removing your platter from the microwave, it may be hot enough to burn you.

, Remove the platter from the microwave once your beans are hot and scoop 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of guacamole directly on top in the center or across the entire platter.


You can use more or less guacamole and sour cream if you desire.

",How to Make Nachos in the Oven," Set your oven to convection and make some room on the center rack. Let it begin warming up as you assemble the nachos.A lower cooking temperature will allow everything to heat evenly throughout without burning the chips.;
, Melted cheese and other temperamental ingredients can stick and harden on an ungreased cooking surface if you’re not careful. A quick spritz of cooking spray will prevent that from happening, even with the cheesiest nachos.Nonstick cookware can be cleaned with a simple wipe, saving you a lot of messy cleanup.
Choose a deep pan or casserole dish that will contain all the ingredients you’ll be heaping onto your nachos., Distribute the chips out to the edges of the dish. Make sure they’re lying as flat as possible. This way, they’ll be able to hold toppings better and won’t be as likely to break.Use a hearty style of tortilla chip that will hold up to heavier toppings.Try to overlap the edges of the chips so there are no open spaces between them.

, Distribute the cheese evenly over the top of the tortilla chips. Use as much as you please—for smaller portions, a couple handfuls should be enough, while you may need to use an entire package for party-sized platters.Freshly grated cheese tends to melt better than bagged shredded varieties.Put down two layers of chips and cheese to achieve just the right ratio of crunch to creaminess., With your first layer complete, you can now pile on any and all of your other favorite nacho toppers. Fresh tomatoes, diced red onion, black olives, refried beans, jalapeño peppers, corn and black beans are all popular options. Once again, aim for even coverage with your ingredients.Sprinkle a little more cheese on top to help tie it all together.
Get creative with your nacho toppings. Try bacon-bleu cheese nachos with sliced scallions, or serve them fajita style with caramelized bell peppers and onions., Place the nachos in the oven on the center rack and heat until the cheese is melted and perfectly gooey. Keep an eye on the nachos as they heat up to prevent them from getting too done.Switch the oven light on so that you’ll be able to tell exactly when your nachos are ready.
Be sure to remove the nachos before the chips begin to brown around the edges.

, The nachos will be piping hot when they first come out of the oven, so give them a minute or two to cool. Afterwards, you can add your choice of fresh and non-heatable ingredients. Spoon on a dollop of sour cream, guacamole or salsa, then use a few sprigs of chopped cilantro or a squeeze of lime to provide the finishing touches.Add your fresh toppings just before serving the nachos. If allowed to sit for too long, they may get soggy.
Ingredients like sour cream and guacamole don’t do well when heated.

, If you prefer your nachos to have a little heat to them, feel free to include a few bonus add-ons like fresh jalapeños, roasted poblanos or cayenne. You can also add a dash of hot sauce or chipotle pepper for a subtle smoky finish.Leave the spicy toppings on the side to take it easy on eaters with milder tastes.

, For a scrumptious snack for one, only use about half a bag of tortilla chips, or as many as you can eat at a time. Combine them with smaller amounts of each of your other ingredients and run them through the oven for around five minutes. You’ll have just enough to satisfy your hunger without having to deal with leftovers.Snack-sized nachos make a great afternoon pick-me-up or fun finger food for a movie night.

, If you plan on having company over and need something to feed them, it doesn’t get any easier than homemade oven nachos. Just use a larger piece of cookware, like a roasting pan or cookie sheet, to make sure you can fit all of the nachos in the oven at once.Set up your toppings assembly line-style so that everyone can customize their nachos individually.
Take all the difficulty out of serving and cleanup by serving the nachos on disposable plates and encouraging hungry guests to help themselves by hand.

, With the addition of ground beef, chicken, chorizo or even a fried egg, you can turn a simple batch of nachos into a satisfying lunch or dinner. Have the protein cooked and ready by the time you add your second layer of toppings so it will be nice and hot when it comes out of the oven. And bring an appetite, because these loaded nachos are extra filling!Top nachos with smoky marinated chicken or pulled pork barbecue and serve them as a tasty food court-style meal., Meat eaters don't have to be the ones having all the fun. Nachos are one dish that's extremely easy to modify for plant-based dietary restrictions. In fact, most types of meat-free nachos already qualify as vegetarian. If you're a vegan, simply use your favorite plant-based cheese substitute in place of regular dairy cheeses.Add some substance to vegetarian nachos using tofu, sweet potatoes or baked tempeh.
Vegans should also double check that the tortilla chips they use, along with any other prepackaged ingredients, aren't made with animal products.,"

Stir the veggies frequently to prevent them from sticking.You can substitute olive or canola oil for the vegetable if you prefer.;
, After you’ve sauteed the vegetables for several minutes, add 2 pounds (907 g) of ground beef to the pot. Allow the mixture to cook until the beef is completely browned, which should take 5 to 10 minutes. Drain off the excess fat when the meat is finished cooking.For the best results, use extra-lean ground beef.
You can substitute another ground meat, such as ground turkey or chicken, for the beef if you prefer. Just make sure that the meat is cooked through before moving onto the next step.

, Once the meat is browned and you’ve drained the fat from the pan, add two 28-ounce (794 g) cans of diced tomatoes with the juice, an 8-ounce (227 g) can of tomato sauce, 1 cup (237 ml) of water, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of Worcestershire sauce, 1 to 2 tablespoons (8 to 16 g) of chili powder, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground oregano, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground cumin, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of pepper to the pot.

Instead of using the individual spices, you can also use a premixed chili seasoning packet from the grocery store, which typically contains chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, cumin, and other spices.

, After you’ve mixed all of the ingredients together, raise the heat to medium-high. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.Leave the pot uncovered as you bring it to a boil.
Stir the pot regularly as you heat it to ensure that none of the ingredients stick to the bottom or sides.

, When the pot reaches a boil, lower the heat to medium-low or low. Place the lid on the pot, and let it simmer for an hour and a half.If you don’t have a lid for your pot, you can cover it with a piece of foil or a flat baking sheet.
Stir the mixture periodically to ensure that it’s cooking evenly.

, Once the mixture has simmered for an hour and a half, pour 2 15.5-ounce (439 g) cans of kidney beans that have been rinsed and drained to the pot. Mix them into the chili well, and let it simmer for another 10 minutes.Don’t cover the pot when you simmer the chili with the beans added.

, When the chili has been simmered for another 10 minutes with the beans, remove it from the heat. Use a ladle to place it into individual bowls and serve.Classic chili is often served with toppings such as shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, chopped onions, and tortilla chips.
Store any uneaten chili in the refrigerator. It should keep for 3 to 4 days in an airtight container.
You can freeze the chili if you don’t eat all of it. Place it in freezer-safe containers, such as plastic freezer bags, in individual serving sizes after it’s cooled completely. It will usually keep for 4 to 6 months in the freezer.

Some of the other popular items people use in their nachos include:Meat, especially ground beef
Beans, refried or whole
Pickled jalapeños
Olives
Salsa
Guacamole
Sour cream;
, Tortilla chips are often laden with salt and fat. As a way to make your chip base healthy, consider trying store bought chips made of grains such as quinoa or baked instead of fried options. You can also make your own chips or use a vegetable such as sweet potato or zucchini in place of corn chips.Look around the chips aisle at your local food store. You’ll likely notice standard corn and wheat chips, but may also see many companies are now providing healthier alternatives made of quinoa or flaxseed. Read the nutrition information on the product label to see which suits your health needs best.
Cut thicker slices of sweet potato, zucchini or even beet for an even healthier “chip.”Bake these before you make your nachos so they’re crunchy like a chip.
Make your own healthy chips by cutting 12 tortillas into 6 slices each. Then place each chip on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for about 6 minutes at 350° F (175° C) and turn over with a pair of tongs. Leave in the oven for another 6-9 minutes and sprinkle with a small dash of salt to flavor., Nachos wouldn’t be nachos without the ooey-gooey delight of cheese. Like chips, cheese can also be laden with fat. If you’re trying to be healthy, find a cheese that won’t hurt your meal but still give you all of the flavor of “regular” nachos. Finding options high in calcium and protein can also boost the healthy factor.Try cheeses that are naturally less caloric. These include Parmesan, feta, goat cheese, and part-skim mozzarella.Even a processed cheese such as Velveeta can be lower in calories than more traditional options.Buy low-fat varieties of pre-shredded cheddar, Monterey Jack, Colby or other cheeses.
Consider using less cheese on your plate if you want to stick with a favorite, possibly less healthy cheese. Grating it finely will cover the entire platter without adding excess fat. Good quality may be better than a huge quantity., The basic and popular ingredients of nachos can be very bad for any person’s diet. They may be lacking in important vitamins and nutrients in addition to being high in empty calories and fat. However, substituting less healthy options with healthier alternatives can provide you a satisfying and more nutritious nacho.Use lower fat beef as well as chicken or pork for your protein. You can also use other proteins such as tofu or tempeh.
Try whole kidney and black beans instead of refried beans. Soaking dry beans overnight and using them on your nachos increases their nutritional value significantly. Remember that you will need to cook them. You can also use vegetarian or vegan refried beans or mash you own beans for healthier options.Opt for low sodium canned beans.Sprinkle on only fresh vegetables that you chop instead of pre-cut or canned options.
Make your own salsa and guacamole with only fresh ingredients and no oils.
Choose low- or nonfat sour cream and cheese.

, An excellent way to further increase the health factor of your nachos is adding fresh vegetables to your platter. Not only can a variety of veggies make for more lively and eye-catching nachos, but they also provide you vitamins and nutrients to maintain your health. Some fresh vegetables you could add to make your nachos more healthy include:Diced red, orange, yellow, or green pepper
Grilled corn
Mushrooms
Diced red onions
Fresh tomatoes
Roasted squash or sweet potato cubesShredded lettuce
Limes or lime juice
Avocado chunks

, Tortilla chips—flour or corn— are the canvas for your nachos. They should be thick enough to hold your toppings while not overpowering your nacho platter. Try using freshly baked chips that are not laden in frying oil or processed in a plant. This can help make your nachos slightly healthier.Spread your chips so they cover the bottom of an oven safe baking dish or platter. They don’t need to be arranged in any special order because part of the fun of nachos is just throwing them together.

, Keep your heavier ingredients towards the bottom of your nacho platter. Things such as beans and meat can support the weight of smaller ingredients, your chosen toppings and the melted cheese.Spread on refried beans if you’re using them. If not, season your meat or non-animal protein as you like it before cooking it. Mix the cooked protein with any beans you may be using. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the top of the chips.
Use less meat or non-animal protein in favor of extra beans or vegetables. These will provide just as much bulk to your nachos while upping the nutrition factor., For a little extra crunch, sprinkle on any fresh vegetables you like. These can enhance the layers of different flavors in your nachos while providing a nutritious boost. Avoid cooking the fresh veggies before you put them on the nachos so they retain more vitamins and nutrients and stay crunchier.Sauté onions lightly for a more subtle flavor. Consider adding a bit of garlic to the onions for another nutritious flavor boost.
Layer on as many different colored vegetables as you can. Vegetables are generally low in calories, which allows you to include more of them on nachos. This makes the nachos not only visually stimulating, but also good for your health.

, The crowning glory of your nachos is arguably the cheese. It hugs your chips, protein, and veggies with a heavenly and creamy layer of deliciousness. The melted cheese also sets the scene for whatever colorful toppings you may choose for your nachos.Shred your cheese finely. This will go farther in covering the nachos.
Spread your cheese over the top of your nachos sparingly. If you buy a better-quality cheese, you may not need as much because it is big on flavor. This is much healthier than wrapping your nacho platter in a dome of cheese.

, One of the best things about nachos is you can make them however you like. You may have some extra room at the top of your platter and extra ingredients to use up. If this is the case, make a second layer of nachos using the same formula as above. This can further enhance your eating experience and give you some additional nutrients.

Eat fewer nachos if you layer them to minimize the risk of getting too many calories and too much fat at one meal.

, Another great thing about nachos is that you can bake them in any type of oven. Your nachos will taste good whether you cook them in a conventional oven or microwave. Choose an option you have available or that makes it easiest for you to eat your nachos as soon as you want them.Preheat your broiler in a standard oven, toaster oven, or convection oven. Set the rack 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the heat source. Broil until the cheese melts or even let the cheese brown a bit. This may take 5 - 10 minutes. Let your nachos cool for a few minutes before serving them.
Set your microwave on medium for 2 minutes. Then let your nachos cook for the allotted time. Check the nachos to make sure that cooking is even across your platter. You may need to let the nachos cool for a few minutes after you take them out of the microwave., Many people like an extra layer of toppings on their nachos. These generally include salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. Toppings add another layer of flavor to already delectable nachos. Instead of using processed toppings, make your own and spread them on your nachos sparingly. Homemade toppings used sparingly can add lots of flavor and nutrients to your nachos.Consider setting your toppings on the side. This will allow you and your guests to decide how much of each topping to eat.

, Once you’re bubbly platter of deliciousness is ready, serve it to yourself or your guests. Use small individual plates to make your stomach think that you’re eating more than you actually are.

Make sure you’ve got plenty of napkins to clean off nacho-ed up fingers and hands. You or your guests may love the nachos so much that napkins aren’t even necessary!

, Every platter of nachos has two main ingredients: the chips and the cheese. If you’re making nachos for four people and want to keep it healthy, consider how much of each you’re placing on the platter. Try the following amounts and adjust as necessary for your guests or wishes:4-8 ounces of your chosen chips
1/4 cup of cheese, finely grated, Beans, meats, and non-animal protein are often go-to ingredients to any nacho platter. These are also a great way to get extra nutrients without extra fat and calories. Choosing one protein in the following amounts can keep your nachos healthy and delicious:1-15.5 ounce can of refried or whole beans or a pound of soaked an cooked beans
8 ounces of chopped shrimp8 ounce shredded rotisserie chicken breast
1/2 cup of chick peas
6 ounces shredded grilled pork tenderloin
8 ounces thinly sliced seared flank steak
15 ounces extra firm tofu, drained, Vegetables are loaded with lots of important nutrients and vitamins. They’re a great way to make nachos more flavor, add some extra crunch, and boost nutritional value. Add any of the following vegetables to make healthier nachos:1/4 of a red or yellow onion, diced
1 rib of thinly sliced celery
1/2 avocado, diced
3 ounces thinly sliced olives1 cup chopped tomato
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 cup shredded red cabbage
1 cup chopped sautéed red bell peppers and onions

, After you’ve added all of your healthy ingredients to the platter, cook your nachos. You’ll likely want to top the melted deliciousness with even more toppings. This is a further chance to make them healthy without losing out on flavor. Just a little of the following toppings goes a long way:1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves
2 tablespoons sliced or canned jalapeño1/2 cup fresh salsa
2 tablespoons low fat sour cream or 1/4 cup guacamole

Heat the chiles over medium-low to gently toast them until they become fragrant. It should take approximately 2 to 3 minutes on each side of the chiles.You can substitute guajillo or pasilla chiles for the New Mexico. You can also use any combination of the three.
Make sure not to let the chiles burn or they will become bitter.

, After the chiles are toasted, transfer them to a bowl. Cover them with very hot water, and allow the chiles to soak for 15 to 45 minutes or until they are soft.The water that you soak the chiles in doesn’t have to be boiling. Use the water from your tap’s hottest setting to soak them.

, Once the chiles are soft, remove them from the water. Use a sharp knife to cut off the stems and split the chiles open to take out the seeds.Handling hot chiles can irritate your skin and eyes. It’s a good idea to wear rubber gloves when cutting the chiles open.
Running the chiles under water can help rinse out the seeds. Be careful not to rinse away any of the flesh, though.

, After you’ve removed the stems and seeds, add the chiles to a blender with 1 ½ teaspoons (3 g) of ground cumin, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of freshly ground black pepper, 1 tablespoon (18 g) of kosher salt, and ¼ cup (59 ml) of water.

, Heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vegetable oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of 2 ½ pounds (1.1 kg) of boneless beef chuck that’s been trimmed and cut into ¾-inch (19-mm) cubes, and lightly brown the meat on at least two sides, which should take about 3 minutes per side.

Allow the mixture to simmer for another 10 minutes.It’s normal for the chili to appear to have too much sauce even after simmering. The next step will help absorb some of it.

, When the chili has finished simmering, turn off the heat. Let it stand for about 30 minutes, or until the meat absorbs approximately half of the sauce in the pan., After the chili has had a chance to stand for a half hour, stir it to determine if the consistency is right. Taste it as well to see if you want to add more of any of the seasonings.If the chili seems too dry, mix in more broth and/or water.
If the chili seems too liquidy, turn the heat back on and allow it to simmer until it thickens further.
Mix in additional salt, brown sugar, and/or vinegar to suit your taste.

, Turn the heat back on under the skillet to low or medium-low and reheat the chili gently. When it’s warmed through, transfer it into individual bowls and serve the chili with a lime wedge and spoonful of sour cream.Store any uneaten chili in the refrigerator.

Pour enough water into the pot to cover the kiełbasa.,
Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce it to a simmer.,
Consider browning or grilling your cooked biała kiełbasa.",How to Cook Kielbasa1," Biała kiełbasa (BEEYAH-wah keeyehw-BAH-sah) is usually white in color. Because it is raw, it needs to be cooked first. After it is cooked, you can serve it as is, or you can bake, grill, or fry it to further improve its flavor.


If you have dried kiełbasa, such as kabanos, you do not need to cook it. Simply slice it up, and eat it on its own, or add it to a sandwich.
If you have kiełbasa zwyczajna (keeyehw-BAH-sah zvih-CHAI-nah), or ""regular"" kiełbasa, you do not need to cook it, although it is highly recommended that you do to kill off any potential bacteria.You can bake it, fry it, or grill it.;
, The pot needs to be wide enough to comfortably fit the kiełbasa without cramming it in. If you are cooking a lot of kiełbasa, it might be a good idea to cook it in several batches. Store your extra kiełbasa in the fridge while you cook it.

, How much water you use depends on the size of your saucepan and the thickness of the kiełbasa.

, Let the water simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, or until the kiełbasa's temperature reaches between 168 and 174°F (76 and 79°C). You can test the temperature with a meat thermometer

, Once your kiełbasa is cooked, you can toss it into żurek (a popular soup served during Easter in Poland), or you can heat it up by baking, frying, or grilling.

This recipe takes about 15 minutes to prep, and about 6 hours to cook. All said, you can expect to get about six servings, though with suitable slow cookers, you may be able to fit a double recipe to make more., At this point, your slow cooker should not be on or plugged in. Mix together these ingredients in the slow cooker thoroughly with a mixing spoon., Spread the meatballs as evenly as possible when adding them to the cooker. Those that are piled up too high may not baste in the sauce and take on its flavor. Then plug in the slow cooker., Cover your slow cooker with its lid. If you set it to the ""Low"" setting, your meatballs should be finished in 6 to 8 hours. For a shorter cook time, set your cooker to ""High"" and they'll be ready in 3 to 5 hours., When the meatballs are done, you can turn your slow cooker to the ""Warm"" or ""Buffet"" setting, to keep the food hot while preventing it from overcooking. Then use your mixing spoon to stir 1 cup of sour cream into the slow cooker mixture.

, Put a pot of water large enough to accommodate your noodles on your stove top. Bring the water to a boil and prepare your egg noodles according to the instructions on their packaging. Generally you can expect regular egg noodles to take 8 to 10 minutes, and extra wide ones to take 10 to 12 minutes.Although you may be in the habit of adding salt to boiling noodles, you may want to avoid doing so here. It's very easy to add too much salt to the meatballs., Place a colander/strainer in a clean sink. Remove your noodles from the stove top, then pour them into the colander to drain the water. Transfer the noodles to the crock pot and mix everything together.


You may want to give your colander a few sharp, back-and-forth shakes to knock loose any water sticking to the noodles.
You might also want to serve the noodles on a plate to form a bed for the meatballs and sauce., Or, if you're planning on serving the meatballs buffet style, you may want to set your slow cooker to the ""Warm"" or ""Buffet"" setting. This way the food keeps warm without being overcooked. Otherwise, allow it to cool, serve, and enjoy your Swedish meatballs.


To dress up your meatballs a little, you may want to sprinkle some parsley flakes on top of the mixture."

For this reason, you'll likely want to hand-mix the meat.

, After the meat is well mixed, tear off small pieces from it and roll those pieces into 1-inch meatballs. Place finished meatballs on the baking rack positioned on top of your pan. Roll meatballs until there is no meat left.If you're not a fan of doing this by hand, you may be able to use a melon baller or similar tool to scoop the meat into a meatball shape. Then deposit the meat on the baking rack.
Try to leave a little space between meatballs. Those that are too close could fuse together while baking. Should this happen, use a knife or kitchen scissors to cut the meatballs apart after they are baked.

, At this point, your oven should be preheated. Take hold of the pan and transport the baking rack and the meatballs on it carefully to your oven.

Find an authentic lambic beer.,
Chill the lambic to serving temperature.,
Set out the correct glassware.,
Remove the foil if desired.,
Pop off the cap.,
Uncork the bottle.,
Pour the lambic.,
Smell and taste the lambic.",How to Drink Lambic Beer," Authentic lambic beer must be from Belgium, and the label of true lambic beer should display the word “lambic” (or ""lambiek""). Beer that is spontaneously fermented but is not from Belgium cannot be true lambic beer. Lambics are typically aged for six months to three years, and young and old lambics are traditionally blended. Lambics should be made from natural ingredients and not artificially flavored or colored. Lambics by Lindeman's, for example, are usually artificially sweetened. If the ingredients are listed on the bottle, look for malted barley, unmalted wheat, and hops. Fresh, whole fruit is also frequently an ingredient, and is added to the base lambic beer. The fruit is then fermented in the beer, as it is rich in fermentable sugars. Pits and other unfermentable material are removed before bottling. Look for beer that is packaged in 375 mL and 750 mL champagne bottles. Bottles of lambic are corked like wine and champagne, but some will have bottle caps that have been capped over corks. The cork will not be visible until the cap is removed from the bottle.

Fruit lambics are commonly labeled as kriek, pecheresse or peche, framboise, and cassis. These lambics are named according to the type of fruit that they have been made with, and will typically show pictures of the fruit that they are made with on their labels.



 


Gueuze (also spelled geuze) and faro are traditional styles of lambic beer that are not made with fruit. It is customary for gueuze to be a blend of one year old, two year old, and three year old lambics. Gueuze can be quite sour or tart, while faro is sweeter, as it is traditionally made with added sugar. The sour and tart qualities are primarily a result of certain bacteria, such as acetic acid and lactic acid producing bacteria, that act upon the fermenting beer.






Unblended or straight lambic can be young six month old lambic or considerably older, and traditionally contains very little carbonation. Faro is traditionally unblended. Other types of lambic tend to be highly carbonated.





;
, Chill in the range of about 4C to 12C (40F to 55F). Use cooler temperatures for fruit lambics and warmer temperatures for gueuze and unblended straight lambics. Warmer temperatures will bring out the complicated aromas and overall flavors that are produced by the many different microorganisms that ferment the beer. Oak fermentation vessels, long aging periods, the ingredients used, and other factors also influence the aroma and overall flavor. As refrigerators tend to be colder than the optimal serving temperatures, set a chilled lambic out on the counter for a little while so that it can warm up slightly before it is opened and poured.

, Use tulip, snifter, and stange (slender cylinder) glasses for gueuze and fruit lambic. Use flute glasses for gueuze, fruit lambic, and faro. Most unblended lambics can be served in flute and strange glasses. Use personal preference when choosing among types of glasses. Different glasses will modulate aromas and flavors in certain ways, and specific lambics may be more enjoyable when drunk from a certain type of glass. Wine glasses complement lambics well, but short stems are generally desired. Also, collins glasses can be substituted for stange glasses. Specific lambics may be paired with proprietary glassware that is provided by the brewery. Consider how much capacity certain glasses have, and be sure that you can fill them appropriately. Also take into account that most lambics are highly carbonated and will foam a lot, and that it is usually desirable to serve such lambics with a good amount of foam.

, Cut or tear off the foil that may be wrapped around the cap and bottle neck. Cut it neatly around the cap with a wine foil cutter or just tear it off like a brute. Alternatively, just pop off the cap without removing the foil, as the foil should not hinder the action of the bottle opener or hold down the cap. However, the bottle opener may slip somewhat if the foil is not removed initially.

, If a cap exists, pop it off with a bottle opener. The cap may be larger than standard beer bottle caps, so some standard bottle openers may not work well.


Try using large openers that are typically used by bartenders.

, The bottle may be corked with a cork is that is underneath the cap, or with a large bulbous champagne cork. If the cork is under the cap, use a corkscrew wine opener to remove the cork.


Bulbous champagne corks should be kept in place by a wire cap until the bottle is ready to be opened, as the cork can shoot out explosively if not kept in place.






To uncork a bulbous cork, begin by removing the wire retainer.






Then, if desired, use your thumb or fingers to loosen the cork. It will most likely pop out with a good deal of force and fly across the room or up into the sky. The cork should pop out after the cork has been only slightly moved out of the bottle. To prevent the cork from popping out of the bottle and to prevent excessive foaming, hold your hand firmly over the cork while working it free of the bottle, or even hold a cloth napkin or towel over the cork while pushing it out. The napkin or towel should hold the cork within it.






Allow for foam to be released from the bottle as it is opened, especially of the cork was allowed to pop out freely. Don't further agitate the lambic by moving your arm or jumping around, because then it will just foam more and much of the lambic will end up on the ground or on your clothes.







, Most available lambics such as gueuze and fruits lambics are highly carbonated, and will foam very easily. Try to get a good amount of foam when pouring, but not so much that there is not enough liquid beer. The exact amount of foam that is desirable for specific lambic beers can certainly vary, and there may be no perfect amount of foam for any lambic. Keep in mind that lambics are all quite different, and are the result of spontaneous, natural conditions.

Begin by pouring somewhat slowly down the side of the glass while holding the glass at an angle in your hand. This will minimize excessive foaming.






When the glass is about one quarter to half full, gradually move the glass upright. This will cause a decent, desired amount of thick, dense or rocky foam to form as the pour is completed. Increase the speed by which the glass is tilted upwards and the height from which the beer is poured to increase foam formation. Alternatively, pour at a lower height and pour for a longer period of time down the side of the glass to minimize foam formation. A fair amount of the glass should usually be occupied by foam, as the foam has a wonderful appearance and is often an important part of lambic beer.






The poured lambic may appear quite hazy, as it is traditional for lambics to be unfiltered. Such unfiltered lambics will also have a sediment on the bottom of the bottle that can produce cloudiness. To avoid a cloudy appearance, do not agitate the bottle before pouring, pour gradually without tilting the bottle much, and do not pour out the very last amount of beer. The bacteria present during fermentation can also be responsible for making lambics hazy. These bacteria can produce a slime that is subsequently broken down over time, and the remnants of the slime result in a haze. This type of haze is perfectly acceptable. Filtered lambics are not unusual, so don't be surprised if one lambic is hazy and another is not. Also, unfiltered lambics may appear quite clear if the lambic was not agitated and provided with enough time to allow the particles in the lambic to settle out naturally. In this instance, the lambic may pour clear initially, then become cloudy as the dregs of the bottle are poured into the glass. Fruit lambics may be quite dark, depending on the kind of fruit that was used.

, Expected aromas are typically described as fruity, citric, horsey, barnyard, goaty, sweaty, hay, horse blanket, earthy, and acidic. Lambics can taste quite sour and tart, and can be reminiscent of sherry or cider. Tannic astringency can also be present, and the oak that the lambic may have been aged in can be detectable. Hop bitterness should be low or absent. Undesirable aromas and overall flavors may be described as cigar-like, smoky, enteric, and cheesy. Very sweet fruit lambics may have added sugar primarily for the American market, but authentic, artisanal fruit lambics such as those brewed by Cantillon or Hanssens should only impart sweetness that is from fresh fruit and fruit juice. The flavor and color of the type of fruit that was used to make a fruit lambic should be apparent.

Base your voting process off your research.,
Make sure that the candidate you are voting for has addressed every issue.,
Go and vote.",How to Choose a Good Political Leader," Know who they are and what party they are representing.


Visit their offices in their electorates, ridings, zones, areas, etc. Ask to meet with your local representative.
Go to ""meet the candidate"" events hosted in your area. This will give you the opportunity to meet them and to listen to their policies.
Follow their Twitter and Facebook accounts.
Watch them in action in the legislature, lower/upper house, council chamber, parliament, or wherever they appear. Some countries, states, and provinces have televised debates or parliamentary/legislative sessions. Some have select committee sessions open to viewing (you can visit in person or watch online or on TV). Some provide YouTube clips or their own viewing portals. Contact your local representative to find out what is available for you in terms of direct viewing.;
, Look up what they want to provide for you and others. Make sure you know what they're talking about. Also do a bit of research on them, such as their educational background and any criminal records. Be direct––write letters with your questions to the relevant persons and expect a reply. If you don't get a reply, follow up on it; they will know you are serious about learning more.


Find out how they are viewed within their party, not just by outsiders; remember that everyone remains an individual, even when toeing the party line.
Keep an open mind––politics is an area where reform can occur, so if someone does have a criminal past, see how they have absolved themselves and whether or not you consider their current work sufficient to overcome that and whether their experience is being put to good use.

, There have been many great leaders from the main parties, and their greatness has been based on their abilities/skills, their knowledge, their experience and their intellectual prowess. Don't let their title or party membership sway you. Look for someone who is capable, competent and responsible, who is willing to put people before power.

, Go with your gut and the knowledge you've gleaned from doing your research. Do listen to what others have to say––it is important to gauge what others feel and think but you must still reach an opinion based on what you know, think and feel is the right choice.

, Try to have at least two sources for each candidate. You can't get all the information you need, based off of one website or book. If you agree with everything the research says about them, vote!

, If they try to change the subject when a certain issue comes up or they don't even pay attention to that issue, they're not the candidate you want. They are going to be slick avoiders, which is stage management, not political progress. You want a leader who will address every issue, no matter what, no matter how hard, no matter how tedious and most of all, no matter how unglamorous.

, You're ready! With your research and by going with your gut, you're sure to pick a leader that will benefit your country. The act of voting in itself is a sign of caring about your future and being an active citizen, so reward yourself afterward. You deserve it, for its effort well spent.

Re-register to vote as a democrat.",How to Become a Registered Democrat1," The registration process is pretty simple across the board, but varies in minor ways across the Union. There is no universally-accepted, federal registration form—you’ll have to interface with your state’s own, separate web portal in order to register. This makes specific instruction more difficult, but state-by-state help exists. Luckily, the U.S. Government has built a website to point you in the right direction.


Even heading to the Democratic National Committee’s website doesn’t provide any appropriate links, unfortunately. It will, however, provide you with a wealth of information once you’re good and registered!
Every state doesn’t have an online registration form yet. Currently, only 23 states support online registration. Typical requirements of registration are U.S. citizenship (natural born or naturalized), being 18 years old on election day, and not having been declared mentally incompetent by a court of law.Some states also revoke the voting rights of convicted felons.;
, In the first section, shortly down the page, click on the rectangular, red button that reads “Register to Vote.”

, After choosing, a pop-up should inform you whether your state supports online registration. For those with online registration, clicking the button will take you to the site.


In selecting Georgia, for example, we’re informed that the state supports online registration and has its own website set up for that purpose.
In selecting Florida, we’re instead presented with a graphic detailing a three-step mail-in process. For states requiring mail-in forms, you’ll click the button to download the form, then follow all subsequent instructions for mailing it in. If you don’t have a printer, they’re often available for use at your local public library.
In selecting New Hampshire, we’ll be dealing with a state that does not support online registration or recognize the National Mail Voter Registration Form. Instead, we must register in person at our local election office. Clicking the button in the window will provide a list to help us determine where the most convenient office is.

, That site might require a driver’s license number alongside other identifying information, such as name, address, and social security number. The requirements of each state vary, though options will be provided by the site should you lack the appropriate documentation. Read the instructions and follow all successive steps, and before you know it you’ll be registered!


Make sure you specify “democratic” as your party affiliation. That’s what we’re here for, after all.

, Once registration has been completed, be patient. Voter I.D. cards can as many as 5-7 weeks to arrive.You do not actually need a voter registration card to vote, regardless of what you may have heard elsewhere. You only need to be sure that you're registered, and know the county in which you're registered to vote.If your voter registration card never comes, you'll want to call your voting office and ensure you're registered. You can also request that they re-send your card.
36 states have passed laws requiring photo I.D. to vote, however. You should check with your state's identification requirements before heading to your polling place on election day., If you’ve previously registered to vote, registering as a democrat is essentially the same process. Many registration forms will have the option to specify that you’re already registered, and are simply changing or updating information. Just make sure to check the box, fill in the field, or bubble the bubble for party affiliation so that it says “democratic.”

Question the usual politicians in the primaries who hide more and more taxes that you must pay, indirectly (called hidden taxes).

,
Identify your hidden taxes: you pay dozens of them.,
Examine the taxes that are costs in all products.,
Consider Taxes As Usual.,
Consider voting against those who claim to be against inflation and high taxes -- but, who:


Pass more expenditures that require more taxes and borrowing;
Whose taxes may cause costs including inflation that can contribute to your job opportunities or job losses to countries with lower standards and/or lower costs;
Can abolish redundant and excessive bureaucracies but don't;
Can be influenced by lobbyists, whose excessive gifts and advice they could outlaw;
Who do not well regulate the regulators, to whom they give their powers and from whom they could take the powers.

,
Consider working against those who together (see the 545 to consider blaming below) create all national policy, laws, taxes and the spending (and possible deficit) problems.,
Blame taxes and allocations of funds for spending on the U.S. House of Representatives on their Constitutional authority to pass/or not any spending (called appropriations)United States House of Representatives:


It's their tax code -- Congress and their committees can handle that to lower or raise taxes.,
Decide whom to blame among: 100 senators, 435 congressmen, plus The President, and 9 Supreme Court justices which equals the 545 human beings out of the 300 million that are directly, legally, morally, and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country.,
Decide which of these 545 people support:


More taxes on anyone and do nothing about the thousands of pages of tax codes.,
Analyze the United States Constitution regarding their duties.,
This nation of 300 million can replace 536 of the 545 people (the 9 Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life.).,
Remind your politicians of their oaths of office.

,
Let them know that the people are watching and following their efforts and outcomes -- so that the days of easy, unnoticed pork and earmarks are over.

,
Do not accept their blaming forces called: ""the economy,"" ""inflation,"" ""deflation,"" ""global institutions,"" or ""politics"".,
Examine your representatives to see if they are voting for expenditures that overburden the economy with taxes required by their spending.,
Help the other voters in their jurisdictions to have the information to manage -- fire them and hire their own ""employees"" among those 545 employees.,
Consider starting now!",How to Avoid Politics As Usual,", Taxes on corporations, or on ""mom and pop businesses"" are always necessarily passed on to you, the consumer.

, Dozens of taxes that you pay, increasing your costs, are listed below.


If candidates of both parties (Democrats and Republicans plus independents) are against deficits -- why are there ongoing deficits?

, Hardly any taxes existed early in the 20th century and increased throughout the last 100 years since the U.S. Income Tax was first imposed (under Article I, section 8, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution) during the Civil War, then again in the 1890s, and again after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in 1913.Income tax in the United States Before that the United States cities, states and the nation had the most opportunity in the world, with low taxes, with little or no national debt.

,, Consider whether to blame:


Those who campaign against problems - but who actually created them and continue to make them worse: Career politicians with their daily inaction, or ineffective actions.
Those who proposes the federal budget: The U. S. President and his office. Blame the White House for running the government badly.
The ones who criticize the U. S. President for creating the deficits.

The president proposes spending and the budget. He cannot vote for the laws or funds or force the Congress -- who does vote them up or down -- to accept his plans and/or budgets.



,
It's their fiscal policy (taxes and spending). Congress sets that fiscal policy; plus they oversee and can indirectly influence or control monetary policy which is set by the Federal Reserve Bank.

, That 545 excludes the members of the Federal Reserve Board which was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency off onto a federally chartered, but private, central bank.
That also excludes the special interests like organizations and lobbyists. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a president to do one thing. If they offer a politician a large contribution to vote for their ideas -- the politician has the power to accept or reject it. But, no matter what the lobbyists promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes.;
, If there is are unfair taxes: blame congress.
Unfair red ink (overspending) is because they don't ""put the budget in the black"". Your taxes and fees have to pay for their decision, good or indiscretion.
Wars, and undeclared wars -- when the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines are engaged it is because ""the majority of the 545 allow that"". Whether politicians are acceptable rests upon their power to declare war, and to rule on the way it is done. Of course, wars cost money and lives.
Very high retirement checks for the 545 are because ""they setup their perks"" that way or do not object loudly enough.

, This supreme law of the land gives sole responsibility to the U. S. House of Representatives for originating taxes and spending (appropriations) bills. If the senate originates them, the House will not accept that. The speaker of the House who handles coordinating this responsibility is elected by House colleagues as the leader of the majority party in the House. The Senate can make changes and then it has to be agreed between the two.


The Speaker and fellow House members, not the president, can approve any budget that they want. If the president vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to with a 2/3 vote of the members.

, Complex domestic problem solutions and failings are largely traceable to those 545 people. Consider:


Working through the ballot box by helping your candidates and voting for your ideals.
Writing letters to officials, editors,...
Calling talk shows on radio and TV: hold news and television shows accountable for not exposing bad policies that are not exposed.

,,, These cannot prevent their trying to do what they took their oath to do.

, They can be held accountable by you as one of their individual bosses.

, Working together you can vote great numbers of them out of office and clean up their messes.

, You're it!

Explain that voting shapes the future of a country.,

Explain that the person’s vote does make a difference.,
Drive the person to the polls.",How to Convince Someone to Vote," When you want to persuade someone to do something, one of the best ways you can accomplish this task is to make that person feel obligated to you. So before you ask the person to vote, do something nice and unexpected that will make that person feel the need to reciprocate the favor.To create the sense that the person owes you something, consider giving a small gift or token to the person before engaging in your conversation about voting.;
, Another great way to persuade people is by making them feel like they're missing out, because people are much more likely to participate in something if they feel like they're the only ones not doing it.For this method of persuasion, try to have some facts and figures on hand about proud voters who are similar to the person you're trying to convince.
For instance, if you're talking to a firefighter, have statistics on hand about how many firefighters voted in the last election, and what campaign issues they were passionate about and why.

, People are much more likely to be interested in things they can't have, so you may be able to persuade people to vote by questioning whether that right will always exist. Many people take for granted that they always have and always will have the right to vote, but shedding doubt on that may be enough to make people realize that they shouldn’t squander their votes. Consider referencing some of the following historical facts:African-Americans won the right to vote in 1870, but it wasn’t until 1965 that discriminatory laws that prevented them from voting were overturned.
Women have only had the right to vote since 1920, meaning many great-grandmothers and some grandmothers lived in a time when they weren't allowed to vote.
There are many countries in the world where citizens don’t get to vote and have no say in who rules their country or what kind of government dictates their laws.

, People are much more likely to acquiesce to requests from people they like and feel a connection with, so try to establish a bit of a personal relationship before asking them to vote. Even if you're total strangers, you can establish a connection by:Complimenting the person
Finding some things you have in common
Being nice and showing an interest in things they care about.

, One of the most effective ways there is of getting people to vote is by simply asking them to. Once you have used your persuasion techniques, ask the person to get out and vote at the next election. You can say something like:


“Will you please vote?”
“Can you do me and yourself a favor and vote?”
“Are you going to vote?”

, Especially if the person you're talking to wasn’t moved by your persuasive techniques, you can continue the conversation by explaining all the reasons why that person should vote.One of the biggest reasons that people don’t vote is because they don’t see the point, so you can explain that the only way they can be heard is by casting a vote. A vote isn't just a piece of paper: it’s a person’s way of weighing in on who should be running the country, so not voting is the same as throwing away their say in the matter.

, To make this as clear as possible, use an example that showcases two very different political candidates, and go over how the election of each candidate could change the future for a particular country.


Once you’ve explained the two very different possible futures, continue by saying that voting is your way of making sure that situation A doesn’t occur, or ensuring that scenario B does come to fruition, depending on what's important to the person you're trying to persuade.

, Another main reason people cite for not voting is they don’t know which candidate to vote for, so you can alleviate this stress by knowing the candidates’ platforms and being able to explain them clearly. If you can make people understand the political platforms and what’s at stake, you may be able to convince them to weigh in by voting.It’s also a good idea to have a few nice things to say about each candidate, even if you don’t endorse them. People are often turned off by politicians, so if you have some nice things to say about the candidates, you'll make them seem more likeable, more human, and more relatable., A major argument against voting is that it makes no difference, and if that’s the case, you may be able to convince the person to vote by showing them otherwise. The 2000 U.S. election is a great example to use:


The 2000 American election all came down to Florida, and George W. Bush won by fewer than 600 votes.This means that if just a couple hundred more people had gone to the polls that day, the following four years of American history could have been completely different.

, Another reason people often say they don’t vote is because they have no means of transportation to and from the polls, so you can alleviate this reason quickly and easily by offering to drive on election day."

For example, a summer minestrone could include fresh basil, tomatoes, summer squash, zucchini and eggplant. An autumn version could include butternut squash, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts and cabbage.


When altering the recipe with different vegetables, the approach is essentially the same. Sauté the vegetables in olive oil or bacon drippings at the very beginning, along with the onions.
Brussels sprouts, cabbage and sweet potatoes are usually added when the broth is poured in.
Season with fresh herbs while you're creating the soup and use them as garnish before serving.

, This is done by making a shallow cut along one of the lengthwise ""ribs"" of the plantain and carefully peeling the skin. This is made a little easier if you soak the plantain in hot water for no more than two or three minutes to soften the skin.

,, Do not fry them too much; if they turn brown they may not have the right consistency. You want them cooked through, not toasted.

,, Add a couple of garlic cloves, a few pieces of pork rind (the idea is to make it a little crackly without overpowering the taste), a tablespoon of olive oil, salt and pepper to taste into the pilón. Mash the mixture again. Alternatively, you can use a food processor with a cutting blade, though the consistency of the finished product will not be the same and may require a bit more olive oil.

Be conservative with adding extra fluid. The sauce should be absorbed into the vegetables so there is not so much as a gravy or sauce but that the vegetables remain distinct. If you can get away with adding no extra liquid the dish will be more intense in flavour.

",How to Can Salsa," Make sure the vegetables you use are ripe and undamaged with no spots or bruises. You will need:


5 pounds tomatoes
1 pound canned green chilis, chopped
2 jalapeños, seeded and chopped (if you want extra spicy salsa, add two more jalapeños)
2 cups chopped white onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon sugar;
, Canned tomato salsa tastes best when the tomatoes have been peeled. To peel the tomatoes, use the following method:


Remove the stems from the tomatoes and give them a rinse.
Use a sharp knife to cut an ""x"" at either end of each tomato.
Put a large pot of water on the stove and bring it to a boil.
Blanch the tomatoes by dropping them in the boiling water and allowing them to cook for 30 seconds.
Remove the tomatoes, allow them to cool, and peel off the skin at the ""x."" It should come right off.
Taking care to preserve the juices, use a knife to slice out the core of the tomatoes.
Chop the tomatoes and set them aside in a bowl with their juices.

, Bring them to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and allow the salsa to simmer. Taste to make sure the salsa has enough spices, and add more if necessary.

, Use a thermometer to make sure it reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius). This kills any enzymes or bacteria that may otherwise spoil your canned salsa.

, Fill the jars to within a quarter inch (half a cm) of the rim. Use a funnel to ensure that the seal between the jar and the lid stays clean.


You may want to wash the canning jars using the hot water cycle on your dishwasher before starting the process. Place the lids into boiling water for a couple of minutes to sanitize them.
If you spill salsa on the rim of the jars, wipe it off with a paper towel before proceeding.

, Screw on the lid rings to make sure they stay put. Don't tighten the lids too much at this point, since air needs to escape at the next stage of the canning process.

, Fill the pot with water until it covers the jar by 2 inches (5 cm). Turn the burner to high heat and bring the water to a boil.


If you live at low elevation, boil the jars for 15 minutes.
If you live at high elevation, boil the jars for 25 minutes.

, Allow them to cool completely. The lids will make popping noises as they cool and seal.

, If a lid makes a popping noise when pressed down and released, the can has not been properly sealed. You can place unsealed jars in the refrigerator to use immediately, or put them through the canning process again.

Serve warm.",How to Make Fufu1," Corn fufu, also called ugali, is one of the many types of fufu that you can make. As the name suggests, it’s made by combining boiling water and corn, in the form of cornmeal.

Add the full amount of water to a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the salt, and bring the water to a boil over medium heat.
When the water boils, remove 1 cup (237 ml) of the water and set it aside. Keep the rest of the water on the heat.;
, Slowly pour the cornmeal into the pot of water, whisking constantly as you add it. Once all the cornmeal has been added and incorporated, switch to a wooden spoon and continue stirring the mixture.Once all the cornmeal has been stirred in, turn the heat to low.

, Stir the cornmeal vigorously with the wooden spoon to prevent it from burning. If any lumps form, remove the pan from the heat momentarily to stir out the lumps, then return the pan to the heat.

As the mixture heats up, the starch in the cornmeal will thicken the mixture. This will take about five to 10 minutes.
When the mixture is ready, it will start to smell like roasted corn., Once the fufu has thickened, add the reserved cup of water back into the pot. Stir to combine, then put the lid on the pot. Let the fufu cook for 10 to 15 minutes.When the cooking time is up, remove the pan from the heat.

, Use a ladle or small bowl to portion out the fufu. Use your hands to shape the fufu into a ball before serving."

You'll also need a large saucepan, a knife, a bowl, and a ladle or small bowl.
If you don’t have a large pestle and mortar, you can use a smaller scale one and work in very small batches to make single-serving fufu.

, Peel the plantain and cut it into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. Cut the cassava into one-inch (2.5-cm) disks. Peel each disk, and then chop the disks into cubes.

It’s important to use sweet cassava instead of bitter, because bitter cassava requires a different processing method to remove all the harmful cyanogenic glycosides present in the root.You can substitute yam for the plantain and cassava in this recipe to make yam fufu. Just make sure you use yam, which has white flesh and brown skin, and not sweet potato, which is sometimes mistakenly called yam., Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. When the water is boiling, add the cassava and plantain chunks and bring the water back to a boil.

Boil the cassava and plantain for about 15 minutes, or until you can easily insert a knife into the flesh., When the cassava and plantain are cooked and soft, strain them and reserve the water. Either use a slotted spoon to remove the chunks, or place a strainer over a large bowl to catch the water when you strain the chunks.

The water you used to boil the cassava and plantain now contains starches from both, and you'll use this later to help bring the fufu together.

, Add the plantain to the mortar one piece at a time. Mash each piece a couple times with the pestle to break down the larger chunks before adding another piece. Repeat until all the plantain pieces have been mashed into a chunky pulp. Continue pounding, and start folding the plantain dough over on itself in between each pound so that you remove all the smaller chunks as well.When the plantain is ready, you'll have a smooth dough that’s free of chunks.
Remove the plantain dough from the mortar and place it in a separate bowl.
It’s easier to work the large pestle and mortar with two people, where one person concentrates on pounding with the pestle and the other person manages the ingredients in the mortar.

, Repeat the same process with the cassava. Pound one piece at a time until all the cassava has been mashed. Then fold the dough between each pound to remove all the small chunks.

When the cassava is ready, it will have the appearance of a smooth, white dough.

, Return the plantain dough to the mortar. Pound the doughs together with the pestle, folding the dough between each pound to fully incorporate the plantain and cassava.

If the dough starts to stick, add the reserved starch water in ¼ cup (60-ml) increments.
The fufu is ready when the two doughs have been fully incorporated and the fufu is soft and fluffy.

, Use a ladle or small bowl to portion out the fufu. Work each fufu portion in your hands to form it into a doughy ball before serving."
"
Boil the water.,
Add the semolina.,
Add the rice.,
Serve hot.",How to Make Fufu3," In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the water to a boil over medium heat. It’s important to use a heavy saucepan, because this will help prevent the fufu from burning as it cooks and thickens.

If you don’t have access to ground semolina and ground rice, you can substitute 2 cups (454 g) each of ready-made baking mix (such as Bisquick) and instant mashed potatoes, plus 2 cups (244 g) of cassava or tapioca flour., Slowly pour the semolina into the water, whisking constantly as you do. Once all the semolina has been incorporated, switch to a wooden spoon. Stir constantly for three to four minutes, giving the mixture time to thicken.

Fufu made in a pot can get quite thick, so you may need to get someone to help you hold the pot while you stir.

, Slowly pour the ground rice into the mixture as well, stirring constantly to mix all the ingredients. When all the rice has been stirred in, put on the lid, lower the heat, and let the fufu cook for 10 minutes., Use a ladle to portion out the fufu, and serve it fresh and hot with your favorite soups and stews."

Prepare the baking dish and place the enchiladas inside.,
Bake for 30 minutes.",How to Make Spicy Chicken Enchiladas2," This delicious recipe sounds and tastes gourmet, but it’s very easy to put together. The prep time is only 15 minutes. The cook time is 45 minutes. The recipe will yield 4 servings., Husk the tomatillos. Slice them up, along with the onion, garlic and jalapeno. Spread the chopped vegetables on a baking tray and roast them in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Carefully remove the tray from the oven. Dump the roasted vegetables into a food processor, along with any juices that collected at the bottom of the tray.

Add the cumin, salt, cilantro and lime juice directly to the processor.
Pulse the processor several times, making sure the contents combine well but remain chunky. Don’t liquefy the salsa.
Set the salsa aside and prepare the enchiladas.

, Heat ½ ounce (15 milliliters) of olive oil in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Dice the onion and add it to the saucepan. Cook the onion for 5 to 7 minutes, until it’s tender and caramelized. Add the chopped garlic and cumin to the pan. Cook for an additional minute. Sprinkle a small amount of flour into the pan, stirring continuously.


Add the rest of the flour gradually, stirring constantly so that it doesn’t burn.

Slice and marinate beef.,
Add the broccoli, garlic, and ginger.,
Deep fry.,
Stir fry.",How to Make Beef and Broccoli," Take the 1 pound of beef tenderloin and put it in the freezer for around twenty minutes to make it firmer and therefore easier to slice. When slicing, cut against the grain of the meat. You can either make thin or thick slices, depending on your tastes. Place the beef slices in a large bowl and mix in 1 tablespoon rice wine, 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 egg white, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. Thoroughly mix this marinade with the beef and set aside for one hour to fully marinate. Do not let the beef marinate for over two hours as the baking soda will damage the meat.;
, While the meat marinates, remove the broccoli florets by making a slight indentation with a knife into the bottom of the broccoli stem and then pulling apart. Do this until you have bite-sized broccoli florets comprising 2 cups. Now crush and mince some garlic cloves to make 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. Finally, grate a ginger root to make 1 teaspoon of ginger.

, Pre-heat about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet. The oil should be between 325º-350º (163º-177º C). You will know when the oil is hot enough when you start to see smoke or little squiggly lines in the oil. For 1 pound of beef, deep fry in two to three batches so as not to overcrowd the pot. Stir continuously. Once the meat floats to the top or changes color, strain and drain on a paper towel. Continue the process with the rest of the beef slices.

, After first pre-heating your wok until it starts to smoke, add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil around the sides of the wok. Let the oil get hot and then add in the broccoli, garlic, and ginger and stir fry for about thirty seconds before adding in the beef. Stir continuously for a few minutes and then add in the sauce ingredients: 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, and a slurry made from 3 tablespoons water mixed with 2 teaspoons cornstarch. Make sure the slurry is fully mixed before you stir it into the beef and broccoli mix. Stir continuously for about a minute and then remove from heat and serve. Enjoy.

Stir the mixture well to ensure that it’s well blended.For the best results, make sure that the water is cold when you add it to the pan.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove, and turn the burner up to medium. Allow the water and sugar mixture to come to a boil, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture constantly as you’re bringing it to a boil so the sugar crystals don’t melt onto the pan.

, When the sugar and water mixture has come to a boil, mix a 12-ounce (340 g) package of fresh or frozen cranberries into the pan. Let the mixture come to a boil once again, and allow the cranberries to boil gently for 10 minutes.Don’t stir the cranberries at all while they’re boiling.

There’s no need to stir the ingredients together because the food processor will do all the work.If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a blender. Just add all of the ingredients to the pitcher.
You can adjust the amount of jalapeno in the salsa depending on how spicy you want it to be. Add less if you prefer mild salsa and more if you want a hot salsa.

, Once all of the ingredients are in the food processor bowl, pulse the appliance a few times. You want to process the ingredients until they are finely chopped and well blended, which usually means 3 to 5 pulses.If you prefer a smoother, more liquid-y salsa as opposed to a chunky style, you can pulse the mixture additional times until it has the consistency you prefer.

, When the salsa is completely blended and chopped, transfer it to a medium size bowl. Let it sit for approximately 15 minutes, so the sugar has some time to soften the cranberries. Serve the salsa at room temperature.If you don’t plan to eat the salsa right away, place it in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator.

Branch out to other ingredients.",How to Make Yakitori Chicken," Look for ingredients such as sake and mirin at Asian grocery stores, especially Japanese ones. If you cannot find sake, use sweet sherry, shaoxing wine, or white wine instead. If you cannot find mirin, use any of these ingredients or additional sake, along with 30 milliliters (2 U.S. tbsp) sugar to mimic mirin's sweet flavors.Scallions are sometimes sold as ""green onions"" or ""spring onions."";
, Mix together all of the soy sauce, mirin, sake, water, and brown sugar from the yakitori sauce section in the ingredients list.

, If you enjoy the flavor of ginger, peel a 2.5 cm (1 inch) section of ginger, discard the peel, and grate the rest, resulting in approximately 15 milliliters (1 U.S. tbsp) grated ginger. For an additional flavor that will match the yakitori skewers, cut off the dark green leaves of one scallion, leaving them whole. Add one or both of these ingredients directly to the yakitori sauce mixture.

, Bring the sauce to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce to a simmer. Simmer uncovered until the liquid reaches about half its original volume, becoming thick and glossy. This typically takes about 30 minutes.If the sauce is slow to thicken, you may add a small amount of corn starch, stirring it in a small spoonful at a time. Be aware that the sauce will continue to thicken as it simmers and even as it cools.

, Turn off the heat and allow the yakitori to cool to room temperature before using. Use a slotted spoon or other utensil to remove and discard the scallion leaves.

, Chicken yakitori is traditionally cooked on a charcoal grill. Light these grills 30–45 minutes before you cook the chicken, waiting until the charcoal turns white and the flames die down. You may use a gas barbecue instead, which could only require 15–20 minutes of heating before use.If you plan to marinade the ingredients, which is optional, you may wish to wait until that step before you light the barbecue.


Binchotan charcoal is favored by yakitori chefs due to its long burning time and minimal odors. However, a fire starting pan may be required to light binchotan charcoal.While grilling is by far the most common method of cooking yakitori in Japan, instructions are also included below for frying pans and broilers.

, Submerge about ten 15 cm (6 inch) skewers in cold water before you start food preparation, so they won't catch fire on the grill. Bamboo skewers called teppo gushi are usually used to make yakitori, since they have flattened sides that prevent the skewers from rolling on the grill.However, you can use any design of bamboo or wooden skewers.

, Cut off the brown ends of the scallions and throw them away. Chop the remaining white and light green sections into chunks about 2 cm (3/4 inch) wide. Chop larger pieces in half lengthwise if necessary to keep pieces roughly the same size.Optionally, the thinner, dark green pieces can be chopped finely and used as garnish on the final dish.


Chopping the scallions first allows you to use the same knife and cutting board for the chicken. If you cut the chicken first, wash the knife and cutting board immediately afterward, to reduce the chance of contamination from raw meat.

, Chop 450g (1 lb) chicken breast or chicken thighs into bite size, easily skewered pieces, about 2.5–3cm (1 inch) on each side., To skewer a chicken piece, fold it in half, hold against a cutting board, and pierce it at a 45º angle with the skewer.Alternate between skewering chicken and scallion pieces for each skewer. Leave a little space at the ends of the skewers, to prevent pieces from falling off and so people can hold them.

, If you have the time, and prefer a stronger taste of yakitori sauce, you may set aside some sauce in a shallow container and marinade the skewers in it for 15–30 minutes.Throw away the marinade afterward, as it is likely contaminated with bacteria from the raw meat.


Warning: always keep the sauce for marination separate from the sauce you will use to brush the skewers during cooking, to avoid the high risk of contamination from raw poultry., Yakitori is most commonly cooked on a grill, especially a charcoal one. While waiting for your grill to heat up, as described in the section on preparing the skewers, brush each chunk of food with yakitori sauce. Place them on the hot grill in an area with strong, even heat.Turn every two to three minutes, brushing more sauce onto the chicken and scallions each time. They are ready to eat once golden brown on all sides, usually within several minutes., While you won't arrive at the same flavor as charcoal-grilled yakitori, an oven broiler cooks meat much like a grill does. Grease the grate of a broiler tray with oil to prevent sticking, and line the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil to catch spills and reflect heat. Lay the skewers on top of the grate, place the tray at the highest level of the oven, and broil for six minutes on a high broiler setting. Brush the sauce on both sides after this point, then continue to cook for 3–4 minutes or until the sauce is dark and caramelized., Oily, fried flavors are not common in yakitori, so add only a very thin layer to your frying pan. Once a drop of water spatters when it hits the oil, add the skewered meat and cook at medium heat for about five minutes on each side, or until it is brown and cooked through., Whichever cooking method you chose, yakitori pairs well with a sprinkle of toasted sesame, and a garnish of the finely chopped dark green scallion leaves left over from earlier. Provide additional yakitori sauce for pouring or dipping, from a container that did not come into contact with raw meat (or with a brush that contacted raw meat.)

, This is a common and simple method of serving yakitori, which may allow you to focus on the flavor of the skewered ingredients instead of the sauce. Sprinkle sea salt over the skewers before cooking. Squeeze lemon juice over them as well, or serve a lemon wedge at the end of each skewer for the diners to squeeze themselves.

, In Japan, many kinds of chicken meat are commonly cooked and served as yakitori, including organs such as hearts, livers, and gizzards. Elsewhere, you may need to ask a local butcher whether these parts are available. These organs can be skewered as normal, but may require shorter grilling times:


Grill hearts for only a few minutes, until brown but not yet dry and crusty.Cook gizzards until no trace of red or pink remains at the surface, but no longer. The inside will be red, firm, and crunchy.Livers can be eaten when the insides are still soft and dark pink., Almost any meat can be chopped into bite sized pieces and skewered for yakitori. From a chicken alone, Japanese restaurants may serve the tail, skin, and cartilage from multiple places, among other yakitori dishes.Try making meatballs or pieces of beef or pork yakitori-style.

, While ""yakitori"" literally means ""grilled chicken"" and usually focuses on the meat and sauce, almost any firm, bite-sized cut of an ingredient can be skewered and grilled. Asparagus wrapped in bacon, extra-firm or deep-fried tofu, and bell peppers are all commonly cooked this way in Japan, and are sometimes referred to as yakitori.

;
, Remove the egg from the refrigerator just before adding, as the egg should be well-chilled.








,, Too much mixing will result in doughy, non-crispy tempura.








,, If you are making fish tempura, wash and debone the fish, then cut the fish into small chunks. If you are using shrimp in your tempura, the shrimp should be de-veined.








, Wash the vegetables thoroughly.








, Avoid soft vegetables, as soft vegetables will become soggy when the vegetables are deep-fried.








, Place the food in the refrigerator until you're ready to deep fry.








, Tempura batter should be kept cold while you work.








, This will add flavor to the food, and also wick away moisture, making the batter stick better.








, You can use nearly any type of oil, including canola, safflower, corn or peanut oil. However, avoid olive oil, which will alter the flavor of the tempura. If you are using a deep fat fryer, fill the fryer to the level recommended by the manufacturer.








, If you don't have a thermometer, heat the oil then drop about a pea-sized bit of batter into the oil. If the oil is hot enough, the batter will drop to the bottom before it sizzles and bounces quickly to the top of the oil.








, It is helpful to place your batter near the oil so you don't spill on the counter when moving it to the oil.








, Remember to place it in the oil gently so it does not splash.








,

Set a timer for 4 minutes.,
Transfer the takoyaki to a plate.,
Prepare the takoyaki sauce.,
Make the Japanese spicy mayonnaise.",How to Make Takoyaki," You can purchase octopus at seafood markets or specialty Asian stores. First, you will need to poach the octopus. This means you will submerge the octopus in a poaching liquid such as water or stock.
Poach for about 13 minutes per pound.
Let the octopus cool in the poaching liquid.
Once cool, remove the skin by rubbing it with a paper towel. It should come away easily.
Sear the outside of the skinned octopus in a skillet or grill for about 8 minutes per side. If sliced thin, only sear the octopus for 2 minutes per side.;
, You will need to do this with a sharp knife on a cutting board. This recipe calls for 3.5-5 ounces of cooked octopus but this amount may vary according to your tastes.Cut the octopus into small pieces. Most recipes call for 1/2 inch cubes of octopus. The chunks of octopus need to be small so several can fit into each piece of takoyaki.
Set aside in a large bowl.

, They will need to be ground into a fine consistency. This recipe uses about 1/4 cup of the flakes. You can do this using a mortar and pestle.
Place the flakes into the mortar and grind them with the pestle by scraping and pushing against the mortar.
Alternatively, you can use an electric spice grinder.

, These include: 1 cup of all purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of kombucha, and 1 tsp baking powder.Put all of these in a medium sized glass bowl.
Whisk together the dry ingredients to make sure they are evenly mixed.
If you do not adequately mix the dry ingredients you can get clumps of baking powder in the batter. This can cause parts of your batter to have an unpleasant taste.

, Make sure this is evenly whisked.Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients.
Use a whisk to stir the mixture.
Whisk until the egg is evenly mixed into the dry ingredients.

, Whisk as you do so to make a smooth batter. The batter should be about the thickness and consistency of pancake batter.
If the batter appears too thin, add a small amount of flour and whisk thoroughly.
If the batter appears too thick, add a small amount of dashi stock and mix.

, You want the outside to cook quickly, but not burn.A takoyaki pan is a metal pan that resembles a muffin tin. It has small round holes for each piece of takoyaki.
If you don't have a takoyaki pan, a mini muffin tin will suffice.
Generously brush the takoyaki pan with oil.
Use a pasty brush to do this. Be careful when working with oil over a hot pan.
Don't forget to oil the ridges in between the small bowls in the pan.

, Fill the holes with the batter completely.It is ok for the batter to overflow slightly.
To make this easier, use a measuring cup with a handle to pour the batter.
This will also help with spilling and mess.

, Do this by putting 3 pieces of octopus into each takoyaki.Sprinkle on 1/2 cup of chopped green onion.
After that, sprinkle on the tenkasu and powdered katsuobushi.
The takoyaki will now need to brown.
If you like red ginger, you can also about 2 tablespoons of Beni shōga to the batter. , During this time, the base of the takoyaki will brown.Don't turn or disturb the takoyaki during these three minutes.
Let the takoyaki cook until the timer goes off.
Afterwards, you will flip the takoyaki.

, Use long skewers to do this by cutting and scraping the batter between each takoyaki.Turn each piece 180 degrees so that the cooked portion on the bottom of the each ball faces upwards.
Stuff the edges as you turn them so the ball ends up a nice rounded shape. To stuff the edges, push any pieces of takoyaki that are sticking up under the edge of each hole.
Use the skewers to do this so you don't get burnt.

, During this time, turn the balls constantly.This will make sure the takoyaki cook evenly.
The takoyaki should be golden brown on all sides when cooked.
When the 4 minute timer goes off, it is time to plate the takoyaki.

, Use the skewers to do this as they will be very hot. You will now add the sauces.Pour takoyaki sauce and spicy Japanese mayonnaise over them.
Sprinkle dried seaweed and some katsuobushi flakes on top.
Serve immediately, but be careful as the takoyaki will be very hot inside.

, This is a very simple procedure involving 4 key ingredients. In a small bowl, add 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon mentsuyu, 3/4 teaspoon sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon ketchup.
Whisk the ingredients together.
Pour over takoyaki.
If you want to make the sauce ahead of time, you can store it in the refrigerator.

, This uses regular mayonnaise and some seasonings. Put 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise in a bowl.
Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar.
Whisk the ingredients together.
Serve on top of takoyaki or refrigerate.

Whisk for 30 to 60 seconds, or until evenly combined.Set the sauce aside once you finish mixing it. If you plan on preparing the rest of the yakisoba immediately, it should hold at room temperature.
Alternatively, you can save time by using commercially prepared yakisoba sauce instead of making your own. When using commercially prepared sauce, you may need anywhere between 8 and 12 Tbsp (120 and 180 ml) total.;
, Cut the onion, carrot, cabbage, and green onion into small, bite-size pieces.


Slice the onion into long strips and the carrot into julienned strips. The green onion should be chopped into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces, and the cabbage should be chopped into 2 inch (5 cm) squares.
The vegetables used in this recipe are among the most commonly used for yakisoba, but many yakisoba recipes also include other vegetables. As you get more comfortable making the dish, consider adding some other vegetables to your own version, too. Good options worth considering may include red bell pepper, green bell pepper, zucchini, broccoli, snap peas, baby corn, bean sprouts, and water chestnuts., Cut the pork or chicken into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces.


If using pork, the meat should be thinly sliced before cutting it into 1 inch (2.5 cm) lengthwise pieces.
If using chicken, cut each chicken breast into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes.
Pork and chicken are the most common meats used in yakisoba, but you can experiment with other options, as well. Thinly sliced steak is fairly popular, as is chopped shrimp. Treat these other meats the same way you would treat pork or chicken in this recipe.

, Pour the vegetable oil into a large wok and heat it on the stove over medium-high.


Allow the oil to heat up for 30 to 60 seconds before adding any of the ingredients to it. The oil should be hot enough to easily glide over the surface of the wok.
If you don't have a wok, use a large, heavy-bottomed skillet with relatively low sides.

, Add the pork or chicken to the hot oil in the wok. Cook at medium-high, stirring frequently, until you can no longer see any visible pink from any side.Depending on the thickness of the meat, expect to spend 4 to 7 minutes browning it.
Don't worry about checking the inside of the meat. It will continue to cook as you add the remaining ingredients, so as long as you brown all sides during this step, it should be safely and thoroughly cooked by the end of the recipe.

, Add the sliced onion to the meat and oil. Fry over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the onion softens and wilts.


Note that if you choose to use any other hard vegetables, you should add them to the wok when you add the onion. Other hard vegetables you may end up using include broccoli, baby corn, and water chestnuts.
Generally, you'll need to cook the onion and any other hard vegetable for 1 to 2 minutes during this step. These vegetables only need to start wilting at this point in the recipe. If you allow the onions to become translucent now, they might become too soggy or brown by the end of the cooking process.

, Add the carrot, cabbage, and green onion to the wok with the onion and meat. Continue cooking and stirring the contents of the pan over medium-high heat until these vegetables soften.


Any other soft vegetables you decide to use should be added at this time, as well. Other soft vegetables you may end up using include sliced or chopped bell pepper, diced zucchini, snap peas, and bean sprouts.
You'll need to cook these vegetables for roughly 3 to 4 minutes during this step. Aside from getting soft and wilted, these vegetables should also begin release water.

, Sprinkle ground black pepper over the meat and vegetable mixture in the wok. Drizzle with 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of your prepared yakisoba sauce, as well.


Toss the contents of the pan lightly to help distribute the pepper and sauce.

, Place the yakisoba noodles in a colander and hold them under hot running water for 15 to 30 seconds.


Running the noodles under hot water should help separate any that were stuck together in the package. If the water alone does not separate the noodles, gently separate them with your fingers.
Note that most yakisoba noodles are actually chukamen noodles, a type of Chinese-style egg noodle. These noodles should not be confused with standard soba noodles, which are made from buckwheat flour.
If you do not have yakisoba noodles, you could technically make this dish with standard dried spaghetti. Boil the spaghetti according to package directions until it is ""al dente."" Do this immediately before cooking the rest of the yakisoba ingredients, then add the noodles to the wok and treat as yakisoba noodles from that point on.

, Lower the heat to medium, then add the noodles to the meat and vegetable mixture currently in the wok.


Do not dump the entire pile of noodles directly into the pan. Instead, use your hands or tongs to grab small portions of the noodles and add them to the pan a little at a time. Continue until all the noodles have been added.

, Stir the noodles into the rest of the yakisoba mixture. Work continuously to prevent the noodles from burning and sticking to the bottom of the wok.


The yakisoba noodles should already be soft when you add them to the wok, so they should cook quickly. Essentially, they only need to remain in the pan for a total of 3 to 4 minutes at most, or until they are heated throughout., Pour the remaining yakisoba sauce over the contents of the wok. Using tongs, toss the ingredients to distribute the sauce evenly.


You may wish to add more or less sauce depending on the number of ingredients you end up using. Ideally, the sauce should coat all of the ingredients without much (if any) excess puddling beneath them.

, Divide the yakisoba, transferring it to individual serving plates. Sprinkle the dried green seaweed powder and red pickled ginger over each serving of yakisoba.


Add only as much of each garnish as you would prefer according to your own tastes. If you aren't familiar with either garnish, start with small amounts. More can be added later if you realize you would prefer a stronger flavor.

, The yakisoba is now ready to eat. You should enjoy it while it is still hot for the best flavor and texture.

Buy the fish.,
Prepare the fish.,
Serve.",How to Make Sashimi," Japanese markets will carry high quality fish trimmed into pieces that are ready to be sliced and served sashimi-style. However, many fish markets and high-end supermarkets carry fish equally suitable for making sashimi. Nearly any kind of fish can be used—freshwater and saltwater varieties apply. Popular choices include mackerel, tuna, snapper, halibut, salmon, sea bass, eel, and scallop.


Fattier cuts of fish tend to work best for this succulent fare. Larger fish such as salmon or tuna easily achieve the nicely formed rectangles customary to the dish, but smaller fish can certainly be used as well, and many species and cuts even have distinct presentation styles.
A market that caters to sashimi makers and restaurants will distinguish between the parts of some fish because different cuts of the same fish can impart vastly different flavors and textures. For example, the high fat content in certain parts of the tuna’s belly is considered more desirable than other cuts of tuna and hence is far more extravagantly priced.
Buying fish from a reputable supplier is very important when it is intended for raw consumption (see “Health concerns” below).

Health concerns: The quality and freshness of fish for sushi and sashimi must be held to exceptionally high standards for both taste and health reasons. Unfortunately, the term “sushi-” or “sashimi-grade” is more a marketing term, less a guarantee of freshness or quality. FDA recommendations and local health department requirements for ready-to-eat foods do apply, but there are no specifics for “sashimi-grade” fish. Because there is no federally regulated grading system for fish that is consumed raw, many suppliers have set up their own parameters to measure and guarantee freshness. Knowing a little about your source can thus be helpful. Nonetheless, there are regulations concerning parasite destruction in raw fish that are enforced by FDA inspectors. This involves freezing and storing seafood at the appropriate temperatures and durations to kill parasites. It is mainly salmon that poses a parasite threat, and for that reason it has not been eaten raw in most Japanese cultures until recently. Now that freezing enables destruction of the parasites found in salmon, it is considered safe, although some connoisseurs believe it degrades the taste somewhat.

;
, Preparation is simple. Use a sharp knife. If the fish isn’t already trimmed, you can trim it into a one to two-inch wide by a half to one-inch high fillet, or simply use it in whatever shape it’s already in. Cut the fish against the grain into ¼-inch thick slices.


Sashimi can also be cut into thinner slices. Paper-thin sashimi (kaku zukuri) is sometimes presented in a pattern.
For taste and freshness, the fish needs to be consumed as quickly after preparation as possible.

, Arrange a few pieces on a plate and serve it with chopsticks and Japanese shoyu soy sauce for dipping. Shredded daikon radish, pickled ginger, wasabi and/or a shiso leaf are often served alongside. The function of the accompaniments is primarily aesthetic, however. A dab of shoyu is really all that’s needed to enjoy what the fish itself has to offer.


Sashimi is more commonly served as an appetizer rather than a main course. When served as a main course, accompany the fish with bowls of rice and miso soup.

Mix thoroughly using a wire whisk until the ingredients are evenly combined.Ponzu sauce is one of the two dipping sauces traditionally served with shabu shabu. It is a fairly common sauce, and as such, you might be able to find a commercially prepared ponzu sauce at an Asian grocer or in the cultural food aisle at a standard grocery store.
The finished sauce will usually be dark brown.;
, Transfer the ponzu sauce to a shallow serving dish.


The serving dish should be low and wide so that you will have no difficulty dipping pieces of meat and vegetable into the sauce.

, The sauce can be served on its own, but for the sake of presentation and taste, you could also add a few garnishes. Grated daikon radish, thinly sliced green onions, and a sprinkle of ground red pepper are common choices.


When using daikon radish, peel the daikon and chop it into handful-sized chunks. Grate one of these chunks using a box grater, then sprinkle it over the top of the sauce as desired.
There is no set amount to use when adding garnishes. Typically, you'll only want to add enough to give the sauce color without completely hiding it.
Set the sauce aside until you are ready to enjoy the shabu shabu.

, Use a spice grinder to grind the toasted sesame seeds into a fine powder. There should be no solid seeds left when done.


If you do not have a spice grinder, consider using a coffee grinder or mortal and pestle, instead.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the ground sesame seeds, dashi, soy sauce, sugar, sake, rice vinegar, and black pepper until the mixture is evenly blended.


For this sauce, you could pulse the ingredients together using a blender instead of whisking by hand, if desired. Doing so can help combine the solid ingredients—the ground sesame seeds, the sugar, and the black pepper—more thoroughly.
Note that this is the other common sauce served with shabu shabu, and it, too, can be purchased commercially to save time.
This sauce will end up being light brown.

, Transfer the sauce to a second shallow serving dish.


The bowl needs to be shallow so that you can dip food into the sauce without difficulty.
Do not combine the sesame sauce and ponzu sauce. The two must be kept in separate dishes.

, The sauce can be served without any garnishes, but garnishes can add color and an extra splash of taste. Thinly sliced green onions, a small sprinkle of chopped garlic, and a dash of ground red pepper are good choices for sesame sauce.


Add the garnishes to taste. Keep in mind that they should accent the sauce, not overwhelm it or mask it.
Set the sesame sauce aside until you are ready to serve the shabu shabu.

, Rinse the cabbage thoroughly under running water and cut it into bite-sized pieces.


Remove any damaged leaves from the freshly cleaned cabbage.
Cut the head of cabbage in half lengthwise, if it has not been cut in half already.
Cut each half into half again, forming even quarters.
Cut two quarters of the cabbage crosswise into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.

, Each standard block of firm tofu should be cut into a total of 16 bite-sized pieces.Cut the block in half lengthwise.
Cut each section in half crosswise, forming quarters.
Cut each quarter in half once more, forming eighths.
Place the knife halfway down the side of the block and cut the stacked eighths in half that way, forming a total of 16 pieces.

, For both the enoki mushrooms and the shiitake mushrooms, wipe away any dirt with a damp paper towel and dry with a separate, clean paper towel. Remove the stems.


For enoki mushrooms, you will need to trim off the base connecting the mushroom strands together. Break the top portions off into small bunches.
For shiitake mushrooms, you simply need to cut off and discard the stems.

, The carrot should be cut into thin, round coins and the leek should be sliced into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.


Peel the carrot before cutting it.
You could use negi or green onions instead of a leek, if desired.

, Use a sharp knife to shave the beef into paper thin slices, measuring no thicker than 1/16 inch (1.6 mm).


If you go to an Asian market, you might be able to find pre-sliced ""shabu shabu"" meat. This beef is just as good as home-sliced beef and can save you a bit of time.

, Use 5 cups (1.25 L) of water, or enough water to fill the pot two-thirds full.


The ideal pot will be large and shallow. A clay pot is the most traditional option, but a stainless steel pot can work just as well. You could even use a skillet if you cannot find a suitable pot that is both large and shallow.You will also need a portable or tabletop electric burner.
Alternatively, simplify the process by using an electric skillet instead of a separate pot and burner.

, Place the seaweed in the water and let it soak for about 30 minutes.


Meanwhile, arrange all of the other hot pot ingredients on a large serving plate, organizing them into clusters based on type. This serving platter will be situated next to the hot pot as your ingredients cook.

, Heat the water on medium-high and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the seaweed when done.You should be able to do this on your tabletop burner, but this step can also be done on your kitchen stove. Using your kitchen stove can save a little time since the water will heat up faster.
Use long cooking chopsticks to fish out the seaweed. These chopsticks should also be used when handling the rest of your ingredients for the hot pot.

, Let the flavored water return to a boil, then add a little of the cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, and tofu to the water. Cook until crisp-tender.


If you used your kitchen stove to boil the seaweed, transfer your pot of water to your tabletop burner and let the water return to a boil before adding your other ingredients.
You should only add a few of the ingredients at a time. The pot should look full on the surface, but there should be plenty of room for you to fish around with your chopsticks.
The ingredients cook at different paces, but most cook within a few minutes at most, so you'll need to continually check on the pieces after you add them.

, Each person should be able to cook his or her beef by dipping a thin slice into the boiling broth using chopsticks. Gently move it around in the hot liquid, keeping it submerged until it changed color from red to brown.


This process should only take 10 to 20 seconds if the beef is truly thin enough.

, Each person must pull out the beef, vegetables, and other ingredients as they cook and eat them while they are still hot. As cooked ingredients are pulled out, raw ingredients should be put in the simmering water in their place.


This cycle continues until all of the ingredients have been cooked and consumed.
Dip the beef, mushrooms, vegetables, and tofu in either dipping sauce after cooking them and before eating them.
Note that you may need to skim the scum and fat from the surface of the broth as the ingredients continue to cook. Use a sieve to remove the unsightly surface contaminants, then dip the sieve in a small bowl of clean water to rinse off the scum.

, Traditionally, the udon noodles are enjoyed last. Add them to the hot broth once all or most of the other ingredients are gone and simmer them for a few minutes, just until they become tender. Fish them out with your chopsticks and enjoy.


You can flavor the udon with salt and pepper, if desired, or simply dip them into either dipping sauce.
Once the udon noodles have been consumed, the meal is done.

, This is where your filling is going to go, so just deep enough to place things in.








, Make sure that you don't overfill it! Fold some rice over the hole/crater so that all fillings are hidden. If you press too lightly, the rice won't stick together and will crumble as you eat it. If you press too hard, the rice will get mushy and soggy. To make a triangle, make an ""L"" shape with your hand and use that to shape your rice with.








, It's up to the person if they wish to use a strip or wrap the whole rice ball in seaweed. The seaweed keeps your hands rice-free and keeps the rice ball in its shape.








, Enjoy!

",How to Stir Fry Vegetables," Almost any combination of vegetables can be used in a stir fry. Aim to include a variety of colors and textures, plus one or more especially flavorful, aromatic ingredients. Either fresh or frozen vegetables work well in stir fries, but avoid using canned vegetables, since they'll throw off the texture of your stir fry. Aim to prepare one and a half cups of any combination of fresh vegetables per serving of stir fry. Try using all of the following ingredients that you enjoy, and add any favorites that aren't listed:


Bell peppers
Snap peas
Carrots
Water chestnuts
Green or red cabbage
Broccoli, or broccoli rabe
Eggplant
Onions
Shiitake mushrooms;
, Fresh vegetables should be rinsed before using them in recipes, while cans of vegetables should be drained of water. Pat them dry with paper towels or a clean dishcloth to make sure they cook correctly. Wet vegetables will steam instead of frying, resulting in a soggy texture.


Frozen vegetables do not need to be thawed if they are already in small pieces, but it's a good idea to rinse off the ice crystals and then pat them dry to keep the stir fry as dry as possible., In a stir fry, the key is to be able to cook all of the ingredients quickly and evenly, so each piece is ready at the same time. The size and thickness of the vegetable pieces will plays a large part in making sure each piece is fully cooked but not overdone. As a general rule, your vegetables will cook more consistently and quickly if cut into thin slices.


As you prep the vegetables, keep each type separate. Since some vegetables cook more quickly than others, you'll be adding them to the wok at different times.
For vegetables that tend to cook more slowly, cut them into slightly smaller pieces so they aren't undercooked when everything else is ready. For example, potatoes, carrots, and other starchier vegetables tend to need more time than mushrooms and eggplant.

, Garlic, ginger, chili peppers, and scallions add depth to the flavor of stir fry dishes. A small amount of any of these ingredients goes a long way. Be sure to peel garlic, ginger or onions before adding them to your stir fry.


Chop aromatic seasonings into the smallest pieces you can, so that their flavor is evenly distributed throughout the stir fry.
For a two-person stir fry, try one clove of garlic, one or two chopped scallions, 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of fresh chopped ginger, and one small minced chili pepper., Stir fried vegetables taste great on their own, but if you want your meal to contain some protein, consider adding tofu, chicken, beef, pork, or another type of meat. To prepare your protein for the stir fry, do the following:


Chop meat into thin, bite-sized pieces. Thicker pieces of meat won't cook quickly enough. It's important to make sure everything gets cooked thoroughly if you're adding meat to your stir fry.
Chop tofu into bite-sized chunks. Choose firm tofu that will hold up to frying. Silken tofu breaks down easily and won't hold up in a stir fry.

, This tangy, sweet sauce is often used to flavor stir fries. You can buy a bottle of teriyaki sauce or mix up your own. This method for making teriyaki sauce makes enough to flavor two servings of stir fry:


Combine 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon rice wine, and 2 tablespoons brown sugar in a saucepan.
Heat the mixture and allow it to simmer until it begins to thicken and the sugar is completely dissolved.
Add salt and red pepper flakes to taste.

, This is a simple, dead-easy sauce for stir fry that kicks it up a notch. All you need is some white wine and soy sauce. A few spoonfuls each of these two ingredients is a simple, tasty option. Dry sherry (not sweet) can also be used in place of white wine. Add salt and red pepper flakes to taste.

, Peanut sauce adds a significantly different flavor than other traditional sauces. It's a popular restaurant option that can be made on your own with surprising ease. To make peanut sauce, do the following:


Combine 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, 2 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon brown sugar.
Add a clove of minced garlic, a few shakes of sesame oil, or red pepper flakes to enhance the flavor.
Let the mixture rest in the refrigerator overnight so the flavors have time to meld.

, For a milder taste, use vegetable, chicken, or beef broth to flavor the stir fry. Consider mixing it with soy sauce to the strength you enjoy, then flavoring with savory herbs and spices.Mix in a teaspoon of sugar and one of rice wine vinegar for a more traditional taste.
Mix equal parts lemon juice and broth for a tart taste.

, Don't add the oil yet; just heat your cooking implement. If you don't have a wok, use a heavy skillet with high sides. This type of skillet will keep the vegetables hot and let you stir them without spilling.


Do not let the wok or skillet overheat, or you could start a fire when you add the oil. The wok or skillet is ready when a drop of water vaporizes within 2 seconds.Open any windows and turn on the oven fan if you have one. Stir frying can produce a lot of smoke and heat.

, Ideally, you should use an oil that can be heated to very high temperatures before it starts smoking. Peanut, canola, corn, safflower, and rice bran oil are all good choices. Don't use extra virgin olive oil, sesame oil, or butter, since these will smoke too quickly in the high heat.Hold the handle of the skillet or wok and rotate it so the oil coats the whole surface. It should break apart into a chain of oil beads and easily run across the bottom of the pan.
If the oil is slow to spread, the skillet or wok probably isn't hot enough. Heat it until the oil is drippy before you start adding ingredients. Otherwise, the stir fry could come out soggy.

, The oil will begin to shimmer shortly before it smokes. That shimmer tells you the ideal time to add the first ingredients. If you don't catch the shimmer, add the ingredients when the oil starts to smoke a little. Now is the time to add garlic, ginger, scallions, and chili peppers, which will flavor the oil in preparation for the vegetables and protein.


Use a wooden spoon to quickly stir the ingredients, or toss them in the oil if you can do it without spilling anything.
Cook the aromatics for about 30 seconds before moving on to the vegetables and protein. Don't wait too long, since garlic and other aromatics burn easily in a hot wok.

, Besides proteins like tofu or meat, now is the time to add hard, dense vegetables like potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, squash, and string beans.Stir the ingredients quickly with a wooden spoon, or toss them with tongs.


To avoid making the stir fry soggy and unevenly cooked, only use enough vegetables to cover the base of the wok or skillet. Since a stir fry only takes a few minutes, you could cook your vegetables in batches, letting the wok and oil warm up in between.
If the ingredients seem to be overcooking, stir more vigorously instead of turning down the heat. This keeps vegetables hot and dry, which results in proper stir fry cooking.
Continue cooking the meat and denser vegetables until the meat is mostly cooked and the vegetables have become bright and slightly soft. This should take anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes, depending on the exact ingredients you're using.

, Once the bulkier ingredients are mostly finished cooking, add the vegetables that don't need much time to cook. Keep stirring vigorously as you add the remaining vegetables.


Vegetables to add at this point include bok choy, bell peppers, and mushrooms.
Ingredients that take even less time include zucchini, shredded cabbage, snap peas, and leafy greens.These can be added at the same time for simplicity, or you can wait until the other vegetables are nearly ready.

, Toss it in so that it coats all the other ingredients, then cook for an additional one to two minutes. Your stir fry should be nearly done after an additional 1–2 minutes.


Pour the sauce in a line on the side of the skillet or wok, not the base, to keep the bottom of the wok hot.
Don't use too much sauce, since it can make the vegetables too wet.

, It's texture is best hot off the wok. As soon as the sauce is on the vegetables, turn off the heat and transfer the food onto plates. The stir fry will be most delicious and tender right away, so don't let it get cold before eating. Steamed rice of any variety goes well with stir fry and soaks up the sauce nicely, but stir fries can also be delicious plain.

, The size of the vegetable pieces, their variety and age, and your personal preference all dictate how long a vegetable should be cooked. Cooking several stir fries using your favorite vegetables will help you get a feel for how long each vegetable should stay in the wok.


If you find a particular vegetable in the stir fry too crunchy, add it earlier next time.
If a vegetable feels too soft or falls apart, add it later next time.

, Carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli are often the culprits, since they are hard and can be difficult to cut into small pieces. If these or other tough vegetables take too long, you have a couple options:Blanch them before frying. If your vegetable pieces are at least half an inch thick, steaming them for a short time will quickly make them softer. Always pat them dry before frying.
Alternatively, add a small amount of water, broth, or dry sherry during the cooking. Cover for one to two minutes until the vegetables are tender, then continue stir frying as normal.

, You'll need to soak dried mushrooms for five to fifteen minutes or until tender before you can use them in a stir fry.Adding them dry will result in hard, chewy bits in your stir fry.


To soak dried mushrooms, boil some water, then remove from heat and add the mushrooms. Remove them from the water once they're plump, after three to five minutes.
Dried shiitake are harder than other varieties, so they may need to be soaked for up to 10 minutes.

, After the stir fry has been taken off the heat, you might want to add a flavorful decoration that doesn't require cooking in the wok or skillet. For that perfect final touch, here are a few good options:


Sesame seeds or toasted nuts sprinkled over the stir fry add satisfying crunch.
Parsley, basil, or other fresh herbs look attractive and add a pleasant scent.
Sprinkle on a few thin slices of raw vegetables to add a brighter color and different consistency to the dish.

Stir the ingredients for a couple of minutes, then add the shredded cabbage, shredded carrots, and the chopped chives., Add salt to taste and the white pepper to the veggie mixture. Continue to stir the mixture to evenly distribute the seasoning. For a spicier flavor in your veggie pot stickers, add a small amount of crushed red pepper., Continue stirring the ingredients until they become soft. Place a suitable colander (strainer) in your sink. Remove your wok or pan from the heat and carefully pour its contents into the colander.Watch out for steam when pouring your ingredients into the colander. Steam can cause burns just as easily as a hot wok or pan.

, Give your colander a shake or two to knock loose any remaining water. Then pour the ingredients into the bowl. Allow them to cool completely., When the ingredients are cool, drizzle the sesame oil over top and add the cilantro. Mix the ingredients thoroughly to distribute them evenly.Taste the seasoning at this point. If you the flavor is a little bland, this is the last chance you’ll have to add a little more seasoning to the potsticker filling.

, Lay out your potsticker skins on a clean, dry surface, like your counter or a cutting board. Place a spoonful of the cooked ingredients into the center of the skin. Fold the outside edges to meet above the ingredients. This should create a dumpling in a half-moon shape.The bottom of your potstickers should be relatively flat. You may need to pinch the ends of skins together with your fingers so they stick together and hold shape.

, Place a medium to large size non-stick pan over medium heat. Coat the bottom of the pan in a thin layer of oil. Place dumplings into the oil so that they are flat with the seam of the skins facing upwards., When the dumplings are brown on the bottom, add ¼ cup (59 ml) of water to the pan. Immediately cover the pan after adding the water. The steam produced by the heated water will cook the potstickers thoroughly., Watch the potstickers carefully while the cook. When the water has completely evaporated, the potstickers are almost done. Look for crispy bottoms on the potstickers. When crispy, remove them from the heat and transfer them to a serving plate.Some stoves may heat pans unevenly. In this case, some potstickers may finish before others.

, Combine the thin soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sliced scallions, sesame oil, and sambal in a small mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients together to thoroughly mix the sauce, or improvise a whisk to stir it., Divide the sauce into equal portions in ramekins or sauce dishes. Dip the potstickers into the sauce before eating them, or enjoy the potstickers plain.

Another favorite sauce to try with your potstickers can be made by mixing chili oil (sometimes called rāyu), soy sauce, and vinegar to your preferred taste.Store cooked dumplings in a plastic container in your refrigerator for 3 to 4 days."

Roll out the dough.,
Cut the dough into squares.,
Flatten each square.,
Use as needed.",How to Make Spring Roll Wrappers1," Place the wheat-based bread flour in a large bowl, using your hands or a spoon to form a well in the center.


While not strictly necessary, it's a good idea to sift the flour into the bowl to remove any lumps and make it less dense.
If necessary, you could use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but the resulting wrappers might be slightly less durable.;
, Add the beaten egg and cold water to the center of the flour well. Gradually beat these ingredients into the flour until well-combined.


The resulting dough should be very smooth.
Start by adding only 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of cold water, then gradually add more water as needed to achieve the desired texture. Use cold water only; warm water may make the dough too sticky to work with.

, Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Knead it for several minutes, or until it becomes notably more elastic.


If there's enough room in the bowl, you could knead the dough in the bowl during this step.
You should handle the dough with well-floured hands either way.

, Return the dough to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then place the dough into your refrigerator. Let it remain there overnight.


While it chills, the dough should become firmer and easier to handle. You need to give it at least 4 hours, but 8 to 12 hours will be best.

, Turn the chilled dough out onto a well-floured surface. Roll the batch into a rectangle measuring roughly 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide and 16 inches (40.6 cm) long.


You also need to apply generous amounts of flour to the rolling pin used for this step.
Avoid sprinkling too much flour directly over the dough since adding too much excess flour may result in denser, less crispy wrappers. If the dough seems too sticky as you work with it, try refrigerating it for a longer period of time.

, Use a smooth knife to cut the dough into 12 squares, each measuring 4 inches (10 cm) on all sides.


You'll need to make four columns across the top and three rows along the side to produce 12 evenly sized squares.

, Using a floured rolling pin, flatten each square until it measures roughly 6 inches (15 cm) on all sides.

, Stack the wrappers, layering plastic wrap or parchment paper in between each one. Tightly wrap the entire stack with additional plastic wrap and refrigerate the wrappers until you're ready to use them.


These wrappers will dry out if stored for prolonged periods, so you should try to use them within several days.

Ladle the batter into the pan.,
Cook until the wrapper sets.,
Repeat with the remaining batter.,
Use as needed.",How to Make Spring Roll Wrappers2," Sift the flour, corn starch, and salt into a medium mixing bowl. Stir well to combine.If desired, you could sift the combined dry ingredients a second time to remove any lumps that formed during the mixing process. The second sift is not strictly necessary, though.

, Pour the water into the dry ingredients. Whisk it into the mixture until a smooth batter forms.


Continue whisking and beating the batter for a few minutes to work out any lumps. The batter should be as smooth as possible before you continue.

, Pour the oil into a medium frying pan. Place the pan on the stove over medium heat.


If you don't want to use vegetable oil, you could grease the pan with nonstick cooking spray, instead.
Turn the pan to spread the oil across the bottom. When the oil is hot enough, it should spread without difficulty.

, Scoop up 1/4 cup (60 ml) or less of the batter, then carefully pour it into the center of the pan.


Working quickly, rotate the pan to spread the batter into a thin, wide circle.
Alternatively, you could spread the batter with the back of the ladle or with a moist pastry brush.

, Cook the wrapper for several minutes. As soon as the edges begin peeling up, remove the wrapper from the pan using a spatula or fork.


Neither side should brown, but both sides should be set.
If the top does not appear set when the edges begin rising, carefully flip the wrapper over to the other side and cook it for an additional few seconds before removing it completely.

, Pour and cook the remaining batter, following the same procedure. Continue until you no longer have any batter left.


Stack the finished wrappers on top of one another, placing wax paper or parchment paper in between layers to prevent them from sticking together.
Cover the entire stack with a damp paper towel to prevent the wrappers from drying out.

, These wrappers are best when used immediately, but if necessary, you can store them in airtight containers in your refrigerator for several days.


Keep the layers separated during refrigeration.
Note that you may need to dampen the wrappers with a little water before use if they dry out during refrigeration.

Gently toss the ingredients together using a wooden spoon.After combining the ingredients, consider sifting them again to remove any lumps that may have formed during the mixing process.

, Place the eggs, vegetable oil, and water into a separate medium mixing bowl. Whisk until evenly combined.


While not strictly necessary, it's a good idea to lightly beat the eggs (enough to combine the whites and yolks) before adding the oil and water. Doing so makes it easier to evenly distribute the whites and yolks.

, Form a well with the dry mixture, then pour the liquid mixture into that well. Gradually combine the two mixtures with a wooden spoon until evenly mixed.


After mixing the two sets, continue beating them with a whisk until nearly all of the lumps are gone. The batter must be as smooth as possible.

, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in your refrigerator for approximately one hour.


Chilling the batter will thicken it slightly, but it should still be a liquid batter instead of a solid dough.

, Spray a medium nonstick frying pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set the pan onto the stove over medium heat.


If necessary, you could add a little oil to the pan instead of using cooking spray. Only add 1 tsp (5 ml) or so, however; adding too much oil can give the wrappers an undesirable greasy texture and taste.
Allow the pan to heat up for 30 to 60 seconds before continuing.

, Scoop up approximately 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the chilled batter, then carefully ladle it into the center of the pan.


Since the batter is thick, it may not spread out far on its own. Use the back of the ladle to swirl the batter around, forming a very thin film over the bottom of the pan.

, Cook the film for a couple of minutes. As soon as it sets and forms a solid wrapper, carefully lift it off from the bottom of the pan using a spatula or fork.


You should not attempt to flip the wrapper over while cooking it. Note that neither side of the wrapper should brown, either.

, Ladle the rest of the batter into the hot pan, working with 1/4 cup (60 ml) or so each time.


Consider keeping the batter in the refrigerator in between batches, especially if it starts getting thin while pouring it.
You can stack the finished wrappers, but keep sheets of wax paper or parchment paper in between each one to prevent them from sticking.

, These wrappers are best when used immediately, but you can also save them in the refrigerator for one or two days.


Keep each wrapper separated by plastic wrap or wax paper. Cover the entire batch with plastic wrap before storing the wrappers.

Serve immediately.",How to Make Lo Mein," Place a large pot on the stove, and add 4 to 5 quarts (3.8 to 4.7 l) of water. To season the noodles, you should also stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons (17-34 g) of salt. Next, turn the heat to high and bring the pot to a boil.Don’t add oil to the water. While it can help keep the noodles from sticking together, it can also make them too greasy to allow the sauce to stick to them.;
, When the water reaches a boil, add 1 pound (450 g) of fresh lo mein noodles and allow them to cook until they are soft but still slightly firm. While you should consult the package instructions for cooking times, it typically takes about 3 minutes.








If you can’t find fresh lo mein noodles at your grocery store, you can use Asian style egg noodles or even thin spaghetti in their place.

, Once the noodles are finished cooking, dump them into a colander in the sink to drain away the boiling water. Next, run the noodles under cold water to chill them slightly. Shake the colander well to ensure that they’re fully drained, and set aside.







, In a small bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of light soy sauce, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of sesame oil, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar that’s been dissolved in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) hot water, and a pinch of five spice powder if you like the flavor. Stir until all of the ingredients are well blended, and then set aside.








Depending on the flavors you like, you can also incorporate 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of hoisin sauce, and/or 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of sriracha sauce into the lo mein sauce.

, In a large wok or skillet, place 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of a neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable oil. Heat the pan on high for 1 to 2 minutes so that the oil is hot when you add the other ingredients.








You can usually tell that the oil is hot enough when it starts to shimmer in the pan., When the oil is heated, mix 1 clove of garlic that’s been minced; 1 cup (115 g) sliced mushrooms, such as shiitakes, button, or your favorite type; and the white parts from 1 scallion that’s been cut in 2-inch (5 cm) lengths. Stir fry the mixture for approximately 30 seconds.








If you like ginger, you may also want to mix 1 teaspoon (5 g) of minced or grated fresh ginger into the pan with the garlic, mushrooms, and scallions., After you’ve briefly stir fried the garlic, mushrooms, and scallions, add 1 red, orange, or yellow bell pepper that’s been julienned and 1 small carrot that’s been julienned to the pan. Allow the mixture to stir fry for another 30 seconds to 1 minute.








Make sure to keep the heat turned to high so the pan stays as hot as possible.
You can add any of your favorite vegetables to the lo mein. Bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, baby corn, and napa cabbage are other options that you may want to consider.

, After you’ve stir fried the vegetables, slowly drizzle in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of shaoxing wine or another rice wine and combine with the other ingredients. Let the mixture stir fry for another minute.You should always be careful when adding alcohol to a hot pan because it’s highly flammable. Measure the wine beforehand and place it in a glass or bowl so you don’t have to pour directly from the bottle.

, Once the wine is incorporated, mix a handful of snow peas that have been trimmed and a handful of leafy greens, such as bok choy or choy sum, into the pan. Stir fry the mixture on high heat until the greens begin to wilt, which should take one or two minutes.







, After you’ve cooked the snow peas and greens with the mixture, stir in the cooked noodles. Use tongs or chopsticks to move them through the pan, so they’re not all stuck together in a clump.








The noodles can sometimes get stuck together when they sit in the bowl after cooking. To ensure that they’re loose when you add them to the pan, you may want to rinse them with warm water to break up any clumps.
If you want to make a hearty meal of the lo mein, consider mixing in some type of cooked meat. Beef, chicken, pork, and shrimp are all delicious additions to vegetable lo mein.

, Once the noodles are incorporated, add the sauce mixture that you created to the pan. Stir fry all of the ingredients until the noodles are well coated in the sauce and a uniform color.








The best way to ensure that the noodles are well coated with the sauce is to use a folding motion as you stir fry. Scoop and lift the ingredients to move them through the pan.

, When the noodles are completely coated in the sauce, transfer the lo mein to a serving platter or individual bowls. The dish is best served while it’s still hot, so get it on the table as quickly as possible.If desired, garnish the lo mein with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil."

Chop the onion and carrots into tiny pieces, roughly 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) if possible. The onion and carrot pieces should be the same approximate size as the individual peas are.



 


Cut the chicken into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) cubes, as well.






The rice should be previously cooked before you fry it. Japanese rice or ""sushi rice"" works best, but if you are unable to find it, you can use any short-grain white rice.





;
, Pour the oil into a medium skillet or wok. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat.


As the oil heats up, turn the pan to coat the entire bottom and all sides.

, Add the chopped onion to the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, until most of the onion has visibly softened. This should take about 2 to 4 minutes.

, Add the chicken to the same pan and cook for several minutes, stirring frequently, until no visible pink remains on any side.


Chicken fried rice is the most traditional variation, but you can try other types of fried rice, as well. For instance, Korean versions of omurice typically use cubes of smoked ham and crab stick. Other meats should be added and cooked in the same basic manner as chicken.

, Add the carrots and peas to the pan. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the contents, then mix it all together until the vegetables appear evenly distributed throughout.


Make sure that the carrots and peas are tender before continuing. If the carrots have been properly diced, this should only take a few minutes.

, Dump the rice into the pan. Mix it into the chicken and vegetable blend until everything appears evenly distributed.


Since traditionally prepared Japanese rice is sticky, you may need to use your spatula or mixing spoon to break it up into smaller chunks before you can mix it into the chicken-vegetable blend.
You'll need to cook and stir the contents of the pan for approximately 2 to 3 minutes during this step. The rice should dry out slightly, but it shouldn't be burnt or crunchy., Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of ketchup and 1 tsp (5 ml) of soy sauce to the contents of the pan. Stir everything together until well combined.Taste the rice once everything has been added to the pan. If it seems bland, add more salt and pepper as desired to improve it to your own preferences.

, The fried rice should be ready at this point. Remove the pan from the heat and set it aside until you are ready to put together the omurice.


The chicken should be cooked through at this point, but just in case, it doesn't hurt to check. If the chicken still seems pink in the middle, continue cooking the fried rice until that pink has vanished. Cook at a low heat, stirring frequently, to prevent the rest of the ingredients from burning.
If you'd prefer to use one pan instead of two, you can transfer the fried rice to a separate plate instead of leaving it in the pan. Quickly wash the pan before using it for the omelette portion of the recipe.

, Crack the eggs into a small bowl and add the milk. Whisk the two together until evenly blended.


The egg mixture should be consistently colored throughout, with the yolks and whites well combined.

, Pour the oil into a clean skillet or wok. Place it on the stove over medium-high heat.


As the oil heats up, turn the pan so that the oil can coat the entire bottom and all sides.

, Pour half of the egg mixture into the hot pan. Lower the heat to medium-low and allow the egg to cook until it no longer appears runny.The egg mixture must evenly cover the bottom of the pan, so you may need to tilt the pan slightly immediately after pouring the eggs in.
You can stir the mixture a few times immediately after pouring it into the pan, but you should stop shortly before the liquid stops spreading over the bottom surface.
To help distribute the heat over the entire egg, cover the pan with a lid just before turning the heat down. If the lid is made of glass, the eggs should be done once the glass feels hot to the touch.
The prepared omelette will no longer be runny, but the top surface should still look moist. Do not wait for the top to completely dry out since, by that point, the bottom will likely be burnt.
Note that you will only use half of the egg mixture right now. The remaining half will be cooked in the same manner, but to minimize the number of pans you'll need to dirty, it's better to finish one omurice before cooking the rest of the eggs.

, Spread half of the fried rice down the center of the set omelette. Keep the rice contained in a fairly skinny pile and do not spread it out to the far edges of the omelette.


Note that the remaining half of the fried rice will be used later with the remaining half of the egg mixture.

, Use a spatula to gently lift both sides of the omelette in towards the middle. The ends should nearly meet and cover the fried rice in the process.


As you fold the sides, you should also use the spatula to gently and slowly move the entire omurice to the far edge of the pan. Doing so will make it easier to turn it onto a serving plate.

, Hold a serving plate directly beneath the pan. Using your other hand, quickly flip the pan to invert the omelette rice onto the plate.


You'll need to keep both the plate and pan steady to avoid making a mess. If you don't think you can handle the pan with one hand, ask someone else to hold the plate while you manipulate the pan.

, Cover the omurice with a clean paper towel. Using your hands, gently maneuver the omurice into the shape of an eye or American football.


You need to do this while the omurice is still hot if you want the shape to form properly. If you wait until it cools, the egg may tear when you try to manipulate it.
Remove the paper towel as soon as you finish shaping the omurice.

, Form another identical omelette with the remaining egg mixture. Pile the rice inside as before, then turn the entire omurice out onto a second serving plate.

, For the best flavor and texture, you should serve and eat the omurice while it is still hot.


Before eating it, decorate each serving of omurice by drizzling it with ketchup.

, Carefully slide the omelette out of the pan and into a deep bowl. Center the omelette into the bowl, carefully pressing down on it with the spatula.


Work quickly to manipulate the omelette while the egg is still hot. If the egg cools too much, it'll be more likely to break as you mold it into the shape of the bowl.

, Scoop half of the rice mixture into the center of the omelette in your bowl.


Like the remaining egg mixture, the remaining half of the fried rice mixture will be used later for the second serving of omurice.

, Place a plate upside-down over the top of the bowl. Carefully yet quickly flip both the plate and the bowl, then remove the bowl.As you flip the two dishes, you'll also flip the omurice. The egg should now cover the fried rice in the form of a neat mound.
Make sure that you have a good grip on both dishes as you invert them. This can be a bit tricky, and if you aren't careful, the dishes may separate during the flip and cause the egg and rice to scatter everywhere.

, Carefully cut an ""X"" across the top of the mounded omurice. The cut should be deep enough to pierce through to the other side of the egg, revealing the fried rice beneath.


Note that you can also slice the omurice down the center instead of cutting an ""X"" into it. Do not slice through the ends, however. You should split the egg to reveal the rice, but you do not want to cut the omurice completely in half., Cook the remaining egg mixture in the same way you cooked the first half. Once the second omelette is ready, combine it with the remaining fried rice and create a second serving of omurice.

, Serve and eat the omurice while it is still hot to enjoy the best flavor and texture.


For a more traditional appearance and taste, drizzle ketchup over the omurice in any design or pattern you'd like before eating it.

",How to Make Japanese Curry," Sprinkle the meat with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper, or season to taste. Set aside.


If the meat is in one large chunk, cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes before seasoning it. You may also want to pat it dry with clean paper towels, as well.
Curry can be prepared in the same way no matter which meat you choose (solid beef, pork, or chicken), but you might want to vary the spices according to your own personal tastes. For instance, many prefer to add more heat when preparing pork curry. You can do so by increasing the amount of pepper you use or by sprinkling chili pepper powder into the curry base before you prepare the roux.
If you decide to make chicken curry, opt for dark meat portions of chicken, like the thigh. Take the skin off before you add the chicken to the stockpot.
Alternatively, you can skip the meat altogether and prepare a vegetarian curry by following the rest of the steps as described.;
, Pour the cooking oil into a large, heavy stockpot and heat it on medium over the stove. Give it a minute or so to warm up adequately.


Note that you must use a heavy-bottomed stockpot with thick walls to avoid burning the curry. The stockpot should also be large enough to hold 5 L (5 qts).
For a slightly richer taste, use butter or ghee instead of oil. Ultimately, however, the difference in taste might be difficult to distinguish since the flavor of the curry tends to overwhelm any subtle variations like this.

, Place the chopped onion in the hot oil and cook for roughly 5 minutes, stirring frequently, or until soft and translucent. Temporarily remove them from the stockpot and place them on a nearby plate.


If your stockpot is wide enough, you could just push the onion to one side instead of completely removing it. The important thing is to keep the cooked onion out of the way as you cook the meat.

, Add the meat to the stockpot. Let the pieces cook on one side for 1 to 3 minutes, or until browned on that side. Afterward, continue cooking for another 5 to 7 minutes, or until all sides have browned.


Browning the meat ultimately adds more flavor to each bite.
If you decided to leave the onions in the stockpot as you cook the meat, keep a close eye on them while the meat cooks. The onions can begin to brown and still taste fine, but if they shift from a dark tan to a dark brown, remove them immediately before they burn and blacken.

, Return the onions to the stockpot. At this time, you should also add the ketchup, water, carrots, and grated apple. Mix well to combine.


Note that the only curry base ingredients you do not want to add at this time are the potatoes and edamame.

, Cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Stir the mixture occasionally to prevent anything from sticking or burning.


As the curry base simmers, you should start preparing the roux.

, Add the butter to a small skillet. Heat over medium on the stove, stirring occasionally, until the butter has completely melted.


To save time, you can skip over the instructions for making your own curry roux and use premade commercial curry cubes, instead. You will need about 4 cubes, or 3.5 oz (100 g), to match the amount of curry roux used in this recipe. Add them to the curry when you would usually add the homemade roux.Do not melt the butter on a higher heat setting. Butter has a tendency to flash-boil once it reaches its smoking point. If you allow this to happen, you could cause the hot sizzling butter the splatter. The fat in the butter may also begin to break down, thereby affecting the flavor of the curry roux.

, Sprinkle the flour into the melted butter. Quickly stir it into the butter and continue cooking for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the roux turns a deep tan color.


You must stir the roux constantly as it cooks, at least until the butter and flour fuse together and begin to swell. After that point, continue to stir the roux frequently.
If you fail to stir the roux enough, it will burn quite quickly and develop a bad taste.
The flour must be allowed to cook thoroughly in this manner. If you do not cook the flour enough, it will retain a strong starchy taste.

, Sprinkle the curry powder and garam masala into the roux. Stir the ingredients into the roux over the heat for about 30 seconds. Remove the roux from the heat as soon as the roux is seasoned.


You'll know that the spices have mixed into the roux once they release a strong aroma.

, Remove roughly 1/2 to 1 cup (125 to 250 ml) of the cooking liquid from the curry base. Rapidly stir this liquid into the roux until a paste forms.


Add a little of the liquid first and mix it in gradually. You only want to use the minimum amount necessary to form a paste. If you add too much at once, combining the liquid with the roux might become difficult.

, Stir well to combine the roux paste with the liquid in the stockpot.


If you are adding commercial curry cubes instead of homemade curry cubes, add them now. Break up the blocks into smaller portions. Temporarily remove the pot from the heat and add the cubes into the liquid, stirring well until completely melted.

, Add the peeled and chopped potato into the stockpot and stir to distribute it evenly. Continue to simmer the curry on low heat for 1 hour, or until the meat and potatoes become tender and the curry liquid is very thick.


Use the full 1 hour if making beef or pork curry. If making chicken curry, you should only let it simmer for 30 to 45 minutes to prevent the chicken from overcooking and drying out.

, If you choose to add edamame, mix them in during the last 5 minutes of the cooking process.You could add green peas to the curry if edamame is not available, or you could skip this part altogether.
Make sure that the edamame have been removed from their shells before you add them into the curry.

, Ladle the curry into individual serving dishes. Serve it with a side of steamed white or brown rice. If desired, garnish with chopped fukujinzuke or rakkyou.


Traditionally, Japanese curry is served in one of two ways: you can put the curry in a sauce boat and serve it with a separate dish of rice on the side, or you can put the rice on the plate and cover half of it with curry.Note that fukujinzuke is a sweet mixture of pickled vegetables and rakkyou are small pickled shallots.
You can store extra curry by freezing it, if desired, but you should prepare the curry without potatoes if you intend to so do. Potatoes that are frozen and later thawed have a tendency to turn into unappetizing mush. Boil the potatoes separately and add them to the frozen curry after you reheat it.
To freeze curry, ladle a serving's worth into a freezer-safe resealable plastic bag. Label the bag with its contents and the current date. Repeat with the rest of the curry, preparing a separate bag for each individual serving.

",How to Make Sushi Rice," Sushi is usually made with special Japanese white hulled sushi rice, commonly called sushi rice. It is a high quality short grain that is sticky and slightly sweet rice (not to be mistaken for glutinous rice).









For best results, go to Asian stores and ask specifically for sushi rice. High quality rice will have very few broken grains. Real sushi rice has a good balance of starches (amylose and amylopectin) so that the rice sticks together when you're using chopsticks to bring it from the plate to your mouth. Most of the time it will be labeled ""Sushi Rice"". Equipment and seasonings such as bamboo sushi-making mats, bamboo spatula,nori sheets and sushi vinegar (Asian white vinegar that has been sweetened is also useable) can also be found there.
If ""Sushi Rice"" is unavailable, the closest alternative is Dongbei rice (a strain native to North-east China whose natural environment resembles Japan's cold climate). Its level of sweetness and stickiness is extremely similar to sushi rice. Dongbei rice is roundish and pearlyand has the rare property of never reverting to the texture of uncooked rice after cooking i.e. will not harden but retains its soft texture, even after it becomes cold. This trait is essential for making authentic sushi and onigri. Dongbei rice is a high quality type of Chinese rice, while relatively expensive, it is still cheaper than ""Sushi Rice"" and can be found in quality/major Chinese grocery stores. The other alternative is to buy ""Sushi Rice"" online.
A cheaper choice is Calrose, some brands are Botan Calrose and Kokuho Rose.
Other rice species will most likely be long-grain (commonly found in supermarkets) such as Basmati. Long-grain rice will not bind and is incapable of coming close to the taste and texture of sushi rice. Brown rice is unhulled wholegrain rice of any species. Brown rice is never used in authentic sushi making, but can be used for healthier eating.

, Depending on how hungry you are, if there are appetizers, desserts, whatever, 600 grams (1.32 pounds) should be adequate for four adults, if your meal includes an appetizer and perhaps something for dessert. 600 grams is also often a very good portion for your regular-sized stove pot, in that you get about a half-filled pot of rice which seems to give the best result, moisture and texture wise. A rice cooker is the most dependable way of making rice.








, One way to do this is by finding a really big pot that you can fill with lots of cold water. Rinse the rice by pouring lots of cold water onto it, then use your hands to move the rice about in the water bath so that it gives off as much as possible of those little dirt and starch particles that make the water all greyish. You don't have to do it very long, just give everything a good tumbling, then pour the water out again, as much as possible. Alternatively, you can put the rice in a strainer and put the strainer in the pot; fill the pot with water, agitate the rice, then lift the strainer out of the pot so you can pour out the milky water. Do this some four or five times, until the water seems relatively clear. After the last rinse, pour fresh water over the rice one last time and leave it to soak for about half an hour. Some sources recommend letting the rice sit, drained, for thirty minutes to an hour.








, of water as we started out with 600 grams (21.2 oz) of rice. Whatever container you used to measure out the rice, use the same to measure out the water. Put the water with the rice in a pot or rice cooker, put on the lid (not to remove it again until the rice is done), and you turn up the heat to high. If you are using a rice cooker, let it do its thing; skip the next two steps, and go straight to cooling the rice (once the rice has finished cooking, of course). There is also the possibility of making sushi rice in the oven, as described in the section below. Otherwise...








, You'd really prefer a pot with a glass lid here, so that you can see the bubbles, because removing the lid would let out the steam and interfere with the cooking process. Once it starts boiling, start your timer. You want seven minutes to pass with full heat under the pot. You'll think ""Oh no, it's gonna burn in the bottom"" and you're partly right - some of the rice will stick to the bottom, but that's fine, because we won't be using that rice for the sushi anyway. It's inevitable that some of the rice will stick to the bottom, but some seeds will have to die for the rest of them to be perfect.









Don't use a pot or rice cooker with Teflon or some other type of non-stick coating inside. We want the rice to get stuck to the bottom, because the alternative is a kind of crust at the bottom of the pot where the rice gets crispy, which tastes great in itself, but is really bad mixed in with the rest of the rice in a sushi maki roll or a piece of nigiri.

, Remember: Never take off the lid or you will ruin the rice. After these last fifteen minutes, the rice is cooked. But, it's definitely not done.








, The trouble about cooling it down is that we don't want the rice to dry out by leaving it on the kitchen table reacting with the air, and we also want it to cool down rather quickly. A good tip is to use a couple of clean kitchen towels dampened with cold water (not wet!). Spread one on the table, spread the rice on top of it (remember not to scrape the bottom, we don't want that half-burnt rice down there in our sushi), and place the other towel on top of the rice, so the air doesn't dry it up. This way, you should be able to cool the rice in about an hour.








, For those interested, the word sushi is actually a compound of the word su - which means vinegar - and the word shi - which means ""skill of hand"". So, sushi basically means something like mastering the art of vinegar. You need a good rice vinegar, some salt (please, coarse salt, not fine, too many additives are put in this stuff to keep it from clumping, and they don't taste very good!) and some sugar. Because different brands of vinegar taste very different, it's a good idea to sample your way through the process by tasting on it along the way. But, a good rule of thumb says that for each 100 millilitres (3.4 fl.oz.) of vinegar, you'll need to add three tablespoons of sugar and one-and-a-half teaspoon of salt. Put it all in a pot and heat it up while stirring, until everything's dissolved. Now, adjust the mixture by tasting it - too vinegary? Add sugar. Not enough taste? Add salt. Not quite there? Add vinegar. Then cool to room temperature.








, Traditionally, this is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle. Alternatively, you can use a baking pan or cookie sheet (but not aluminum foil - it'll react with the vinegar). You toss the rice gently with the su, using a gentle chopping and flipping motion with a paddle, and let the heat escape (if you haven't cooled the rice already). Otherwise, the rice will continue cooking in its own heat. You can also spread the rice so that it cools down faster, but be sure not to mash it!









Adjust to taste. Add a little su, then stir around (gently) with a wooden spatula or spoon, taste. Not enough? Repeat. You'll probably end up using somewhere between 100 and 250 millilitres of su for the portion we're making here. Remember not to try to get too much taste or saltiness out of the rice by adding su - the reason we don't use salt in the rice in the first place and don't want the su to make the rice salty is that sushi is dipped in soy sauce which is very salty indeed.
Use the sushi rice at room temperature. If the rice is still warm, cover it with a damp cloth (so it doesn't dry out) and leave it be until it reaches room temperature. Sushi tastes best when made from freshly cooked, unrefrigerated rice.

, If you are using sushi rice or Dongbei rice (which does not harden like other types), slight heating is enough. If refrigeration was light, returning it to room temperature may be adequate.

To save yourself time and effort, ask the butcher to slice the beef very thinly before packaging it.
If the butcher does not slice the beef, freeze it for 1 hour before slicing it yourself. Partially frozen meat is easier to cut than fully thawed meat.
The slices of beef should be just a little thicker than cold cut lunchmeat is. This thinness is key. Beef that is too thick will not cook quickly enough.
The slices of onion and mushroom should both be approximately 1/3 inch (1 cm) thick.;
, Place the butter in a medium saucepan and set it on the stove. Heat over medium for a few minutes, just until the butter is completely melted.

, Add the sliced onions and sliced shiitake mushrooms to the melted butter. Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 to 5 minutes.The onion should become translucent and the shiitake mushrooms should feel notably tender.

, Add both alcohols to the saucepan. Cook for another 2 minutes.


During this time, most of the actual alcohol should burn away, leaving only the flavor behind.

, Add the water, Dashi powder, soy sauce, sugar, grated ginger, and minced garlic to the contents of the saucepan. Stir to combine.


Allow the contents of the pan to reach a steady simmer before continuing.

, Place the thin slices of raw beef in the saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and cook gently for 3 to 5 minutes.


Use cooking chopsticks or tongs to carefully separate the beef slices as they cook. Doing so can help prevent the beef from sticking together.
This may seem like an abnormally short cooking time, but if the beef has been sliced to an adequately thin size, it should be plenty. Do not overcook the beef since it can easily become dry.

, Fill two serving bowls with freshly steamed white rice. Divide the gyudon evenly and spread it over the rice in both bowls.


For an even more authentic experience, prepare Asian-style sticky rice or sushi rice instead of relying on instant rice.

, Top each serving of gyudon with an organic raw egg. Crack the egg directly over the beef, allowing the yolk to remain intact in the center of the bowl when you serve the dish.


Please exercise caution when consuming raw eggs. Organic eggs from a clean, reliable source might be safe to eat, but the USDA discourages the consumption of raw eggs altogether due to the risk of salmonella.
If you feel squeamish about consuming raw eggs, you may skip this step.
If you do opt to include the raw egg, mix it into the beef and rice as you eat the gyudon. Doing so can give the taste of the dish a rich, creamy undertone., Gyudon is frequently topped with a bit of shichimi togarashi and beni shoga. Pair it with sides like miso soup and steamed vegetables.A combination of broccoli, cauliflower, and sliced carrots will pair especially well with this dish, but you can serve it with any vegetables you prefer. Consider steaming the vegetables for a few minutes, allowing them to become tender-crisp without turning into mush.

Add any desired garnishes or accompaniments.",How to Make Gyudon2," Using a sharp knife, cut each boneless beef rib into smaller strips. Each of these strips should be roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.


The strips should also be about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) long. Cut them on a diagonal for the best texture and appearance.
Note that these strips of beef are slightly thicker than the slices called for in traditional gyudon, so they will need to be cooked for a slightly longer period of time.
Boneless short rib beef works well for this version because it is tender, flavorful, and more affordable than comparable cuts of beef., Pour the oil into a large skillet with deep sides. Heat it over medium-high for 1 to 2 minutes.


The oil should be hot but not yet smoking. Test the oil by dropping a small splash of water in it. If the water sizzles when it reaches the pan, both the pan and oil should be sufficiently hot.

, Place the strips of beef in the hot oil and cook until browned on all four sides. Remove the beef from the pan and set it aside.


If the oil and the pan are hot enough, you should only need to sear each side of the beef strips for 30 to 60 seconds. The exact amount of time can vary, though, so your best bet is to turn the pieces every 30 seconds or so to continually check on their progress.
Transfer the browned beef to a plate. Cover the plate and keep it close to the stove so that it remains fairly warn.

, Temporarily remove the skillet from the heat when adding the remaining oil. Once the oil is in the pan, return it to the heat source and warm it up for approximately 30 seconds.


It is strongly recommended that you allow the pan to cook for a minute or so before adding more oil. Adding cool or room temperature oil to a searing hot pan can cause the oil to splash and splatter, which may result in burns.

, Place the sliced onion in the hot oil and stir-fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it becomes fragrant and translucent.

, Carefully pour the teriyaki sauce over the onions. Stir until the onions are thoroughly coated.


Wait another minute or so before continuing. Doing so gives the teriyaki sauce a chance to warm up and blend with the onion flavor.

, Return the strips of beef to the hot pan. Pour the beef broth into the pan, as well. Bring the contents to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.


It may take 8 to 12 minutes before the beef is fully cooked. Check frequently to prevent it from overcooking and drying out.

, Reduce the heat to low and evenly pour the gently beaten eggs over the beef and onions. Cover the skillet and cook for another 2 minutes, or until the egg has set.


Adding the egg before removing the gyudon from the heat will cook it. Even though this is a non-traditional way to serve egg in gyudon, it is a safer way to prepare the dish since it reduces the risk of spreading salmonella and food poisoning., Prepare two bowls and place 1 cup (250 ml) of hot, cooked rice in each one. Evenly divide the finished gyudon and serve it over the rice in both bowls.


You can take the time to prepare traditional Japanese-style rice, but for this altered version of gyudon, instant rice or standard rice prepared in a microwave, on the stove, or in a rice cooker will work just as well and may save some time and effort.

, If desired, you can garnish the gyudon with pickled red ginger or Japanese seven spice powder. Steamed vegetables and miso soup can be great sides, too.


Consider pairing this dish with freshly steamed carrots, broccoli florets, cauliflower florets, or a combination of the three.

Smear a pea-sized dab of wasabi on one side of the fish slice.,
Gently shape the rice and salmon together.",How to Make Salmon Nigiri," Since salmon spend part of their lives in freshwater, they often carry tapeworms. For the larvae to be killed, the fish must be cooked or frozen at minus−31 °F (−35 °C) or colder for 15 hours. ""Sushi grade"" is a marketing term, not enforced by the FDA in the US(although the FDA does recommend that fish should be frozen before it's eaten raw). Make sure that the salmon you are buying has been frozen properly and recently. Tell the person from whom you are buying the fish that you intend to eat it raw. If there is a Japanese market in your area, try going there. Buy the fish on the same day you are preparing the nigiri.;
, You cannot just use any rice; the rice needs to stick together so it can be picked up with chopsticks. Plus, sushi rice is seasoned with vinegar (the ""su"" in ""sushi"" actually means vinegar), sugar, and salt.

, The pieces should be approximately 5cm (2"") long, 3 centimeter (1.2 in) (1"") wide, and 1⁄2 or 1 centimeter (0.2 or 0.4 in) (less than 1/2"") thick. If the fillet isn't thick enough to get the width you're looking for, slice diagonally. A very sharp knife is recommended here.

, Take a small amount of rice (about 3/4 the size of your palm). Roll and squeeze it together until it rolls into a firm ""log"" sized rectangle.

, The wasabi is optional, but it helps the salmon stick to the rice, and adds a touch of extra flavor. Place the fish on the rice ""log"", with the wasabi side on the rice.

, Serve.

It's important to let the fishmonger know that you'll be eating it raw. Ask for a fish that has been previously frozen, since the freezing process will have killed any parasites in the fish.The fishmonger may sell you previously frozen fish or frozen fish that you'll need to thaw at home right before using.;
, If you're unsure if you're getting fish from a reputable source, as if they fillet their own fish or if they purchase them pre-filleted. Try to buy from a fishmonger that fillets their own fish since this reduces the chance of improper handling. You should also watch how the fishmonger handles the fish. They should change gloves frequently and disinfect their knives and cutting boards.If the fishmonger advertises sushi-grade fish, ensure that it's not stored with non-sushi grade fish. The fishmonger should also change gloves before handling the sushi-grade fish.

, Ask the fishmonger to show you several fish to choose from. You shouldn't be able to smell a fishy smell from any of the fish or this could signal that the fish is no longer fresh. If the fish still has eyes, they should look clear and bright, not dull and cloudy.The fishmonger may hold up the fish for your inspection. If the fish stays straight like a rule, it is extremely fresh. If it flops, the fish is older.

, Once you've bought your fish, try to use it as soon as you can. The longer you store it in the refrigerator before using it, the more bacteria it may grow. Place the fish in the refrigerator and use it within 24 hours. You could also freeze the fish and thaw it in the refrigerator before making sushi.To safely thaw the fish, remove it from the freezer and place it in the refrigerator. Ensure that there's plenty of space around the fish so the cool air can circulate.
Only freeze the fish if it hasn't been frozen before. Ask the fishmonger about this before you buy the fish since many seafood counters freeze their fish before selling them.

, Take a sharp sushi knife and carefully cut the triangular tip off of your fish. If you're using Yellowfin tuna, you should have a triangular piece that measures about 1-inch by 3-inches.








The triangular piece is tender and free of tendons, so it shouldn't be difficult to slice this piece off the end.

, Measure about 1 inch below where you sliced the triangle tip off of the fish. Carefully use your sushi knife to cut a horizontal layer of the fish evenly across the piece. You should end up with a layer of fish that's about 1-inch by 4 or 5-inches long (depending on the size of your fish).








You can use this piece for making sashimi or nigiri since it doesn't contain tendons which could make the bites chewy.

, You should be able to see a white tendon. The tendon looks like a line running diagonally from the top of your tuna down towards the skin. To remove it, slice the piece of fish in half lengthwise, cutting down near the skin. Avoid cutting into the skin since it also contains tendons. Instead, pull the fish to one side and use your knife to separate it from the tendon near the bottom.








You should also remove the other half of the fish piece from the skin by holding your knife parallel to the skin. Slide the knife between the skin/tendon and the meat of the fish.

, Place the skin on a cutting board so that the side that still has some fish meat is facing up. Take a teaspoon and scrape it against the skin so the bits of fish are removed. You'll end up with small bits of tender fish that are good to use in sushi rolls.








If any large clumps of fish come off, ensure that there aren't any small bits of tendon by scraping the clumps with your teaspoon.

, Take the triangular first piece of fish that you cut. Set it on your cutting board so the tip of it is pointing up. Use a sharp sushi knife to cut it in half. You'll want to cut down directly through the triangular tip so you end up with two even pieces. Slice each of these pieces into three more pieces. This will make a total of 6 sashimi.









If your piece of fish is large, you may want to cut the sashimi into 9 pieces. The pieces will be thin chunks of fish that you can serve immediately., Find the second piece of fish you cut which should be a layer about 1-inch by 4-inches. If the piece doesn't already have a slant at the end, take your knife and carefully slice the end of the piece so it's at a 45-degree angle. Place your knife 1








Each slice of nigiri should be about 1 to 1.5 ounces in weight. They should be thin and uniform.

, Use the two pieces of fish that were closest to the skin and cut them into small chunks or cubes. These pieces work best if you'll be using them to make sushi (rolled along with rice). Cut the fish into small even pieces that will be easy to eat.








You may want to cut the bites of fish very small if you'll be making a sushi roll that has several ingredients. This will make it easier to roll and to eat.

Take a sharp knife and trim off the ends of the cucumber. You can discard the ends.Always use caution when handling sharp knives. Work on a stable surface, like a cutting board to prevent the food from slipping as you prepare the cucumber.;
, Insert a sharp wet sushi knife just 1








The layer of cucumber should always be 1/4 of a centimeter thick (so you can just barely see the sushi knife through it).
Keep a bowl of water on the counter so you can keep the knife wet as you cut. This will help it slide through the cucumber easier and make the slicing neater.

, Take a small piece of fresh tuna and slice it thinly. You should insert the heel of the knife into the fish and slice down towards you in one fluid movement so the tip of the knife ends up on the board as you finish the slice. Continue slicing the entire piece of tuna.








Each slice should be about 1/4 to 1/2 of a centimeter thick.

, Lay your sliced cucumber so that it's completely open on your cutting board. Place your sliced tuna on one end of the cucumber. Lay the tuna next to each other so they don't overlap. Lay 2 slices of avocado on the middle of tuna and smear a dab of wasabi on a piece of tuna next to the avocado.








The tuna should take up about 1/3 of the total cucumber wrapper.

, Start at the end of the cucumber wrapper that has the tuna and avocado. Fold the cucumber wrapper over the tuna and avocado using the fingertips of both of your hands. Continue rolling and compressing the roll.

If you don't have Pink Himalayan rice, you can also substitute plain cooked sushi rice.
Avoid pushing down on the rice. Instead, just ensure that the rice is evenly distributed.

, Cut an avocado into thin slices. Lay 4 or 5 slices of the avocado on top of your rice. The avocado should be spread across the length of the wrap so that each bite of sushi gets a little avocado.








You could also substitute any of your favorite sushi fillings like seafood, cucumber, tamago, or crispy seafood skin.

, Hold the side of the bamboo sushi mat that's closest to you with your fingertips. Lift the bamboo mat up and over the avocado roll. The avocado roll will now be cylindrical inside the bamboo mat. Press the mat down firmly so the roll is compressed and lift back the bamboo mat. The sushi roll with the soy wrapper will now be in the middle of the mat.








Soy paper doesn't seal as well as seaweed (nori) wrappers do.

, You should see the end of the soy wrapper sticking out from under the roll. Dip your fingertips in water and spread them across this end of the soy wrapper. Roll the sushi to the end of the roll so that the moistened end of the wrap seals to the roll.








You can lift the sushi roll away from the mat at this point and set it back onto your cutting board.

, Take a sharp sushi knife and carefully trim off the ends. You can discard them. Cut the sushi roll into 8 even slices. It may help to slice the roll in half and continue slicing the halves in half until you get 8 pieces.








Be careful when cutting the soy wrappers. Soy wrappers tear more easily than seaweed wrappers.

",How to Make Sushi Rice in a Rice Cooker," Sushi is made with short-grained rice because it sticks together better than long-grain rice. When you’re shopping for rice be sure to get one of the kinds that is not long-grain.Although it’s not impossible to use long-grain, it will not work as well as the shorter ones.;
, Use a colander style sieve with holes that are small enough that the rice won’t fall through. Follow the instructions on the package of rice to measure out the amount you want to cook.If you use a rice cooker measuring cup, remember it is probably not a standard U.S. cup (237 ml).
The package of rice and the rice cooker are likely to have different instructions for measuring the rice. Since the rice cooker is designed specifically, follow its directions over the rice package.
Remember that rice expands as it cooks, so one uncooked cup of rice might be close to two cooked cups of rice.

, Grab a regular bowl, or basin of any kind, and set it under your faucet in the sink. As water strains through the rice and falls into the bowl, you’ll be able to gauge when the rice is completely rinsed.

, Turn the faucet on cold and begin to rinse the rice. This is necessary because packaged rice has lots of powdery starch in it. The rice needs to be washed completely so that it cooks up properly and doesn’t become too gooey.Cold water works best so that the rice doesn’t start cooking while you wash it.
If you want to conserve water, just fill the bowl and set the sieve down into it. The rice won’t get as clean this way, but it will still rinse off most of the powder.

, Use your hands to gently massage and stir the rice so that each grain gets rinsed completely. Don’t press or squeeze the rice, as this will break the grains. As you rinse the rice, watch how the water in the bowl turns hazy from the powder.As you stir, look for any foreign objects that may have ended up in the rice. Most rice won’t have an excessive amount of non-rice, but it’s always good to check.

, When the water in the bowl is clear and not hazy, the rice is completely rinsed. Turn the water off and empty the bowl of rinse water., Set out a cookie sheet or some wax paper and pour the rice out on it. Spread it around with your hand so it forms a single layer and is not piled up. Leave the rice sitting to dry for about 15 minutes.If you are in a hurry, it’s not absolutely necessary to dry the rice, but it helps it cook better.

, Scoop the rice into a pile and begin transferring it from the drying surface into the rice cooker. Be sure you haven’t measured out more rice than your rice cooker can handle at one time. If any rice sticks to the sides, brush it down with the rest., If you used a standard U.S. measuring cup to measure the rice, rice preparation instructions typically call for an equal amount of water. If you used a cup that came with the rice cooker, follow the rice cooker directions for how much water to use.Rice cookers often have water fill lines, so if you used one rice cooker cup of rice, you’d fill to the line marked “1.”
Never guess how much water the rice needs. Either follow the rice package instructions or follow the rice cooker instructions.

, Each rice cooker is different, but it is best to fill it with the rice and water before you plug it in. Otherwise it might start cooking before you are ready. If your rice cooker has multiple settings, consult the user manual. It may even have a setting for cooking sushi rice.


Be sure to set the rice cooker on a sturdy surface. Keep other objects away as heating elements always present a potential hazard.

, Close the lid on the rice cooker and leave it to cook the rice. You don’t need to stir the rice while it cooks, but pay attention to how long it needs to cook. This is determined more by the model of rice cooker you have than by anything else.


Your rice cooker may have a timer or an automatic shut-off, but if not, be sure to set a timer as directed by the rice package or the rice cooker instructions. Rice will overcook if you leave it in for too long.

, In a small bowl, combine ½ cup (118 ml) of rice vinegar (not any other kind of vinegar), two tablespoons (30 ml) of sugar, and two teaspoons (9.9 ml) of salt. Stir until the dry ingredients dissolve.These proportions are for three uncooked cups (710 ml) of rice. Adjust the proportions as needed for smaller or larger batches of rice. Seasoning comes down to preference, so you may want a stronger or weaker taste.
If you don’t want to mix it yourself, look for bottled “Sushi Vinegar” at the grocery store.

, Scoop the rice out of the rice cooker into a large bowl. Pour the seasoning evenly over the rice. You may even want to add just a little of the seasoning at a time, mix it thoroughly, and taste it. Add more seasoning to your preference.

, Using a rice paddle or wide spatula, stir the rice gently so that the vinegar mixture coats every grain as evenly as possible. Mix for a few minutes to distribute it. As you mix the sushi rice, don’t smash the rice and try not to break the grains.,"

Repeat the process for the top and bottom corners.Wrap tightly enough so that the nori is snug around the rice, but not so tightly that it rips.

, If you want to, you can add a julienned carrot (or a carrot matchstick) on top of the sandwich first. Make sure that it runs perpendicular to the ingredients inside. This way, the layers will look nicer when you cut the sandwich., You can also refrigerate it overnight. Some chefs recommend placing a cutting board, can, or box on top to help weigh the sandwich down.If you used raw fish inside the sandwich, it would be better if you ate it the same day that you made it.

, If you placed a julienned carrot on top of the sandwich, cut alongside the carrot, then remove the carrot."

For a slightly different effect, use butter, lard, or shortening. These options are a little less healthy, but they will give the dish a richer flavor.;
, Place the chopped onions in the hot oil and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 to 2 minutes or until the onion gets soft and turn slightly translucent.


Since the onions will continue cooking alongside the other vegetables, you should not allow them to brown yet. If the onions start to look brown before the designated amount of time has passed, quickly move onto the next step.

, Place these vegetables into the pan next. Continue cooking on medium, stirring frequently, for another 2 to 3 minutes. The vegetables should begin to soften during this time.


If you want to add salt, sprinkle it in after your vegetables have begun to soften.

, Add 1 cup (250 ml) warm water to the contents of the pan. Place a lid on on the pan and allow the mixture to reach a boil. Cook, still covered, for 5 more minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp.


Alternatively, if you prefer your vegetables to be a little more tender, you can cook the dish for a longer period of time. Test the vegetables every few minutes for tenderness by piercing them with a fork.
If you do decide to cook the vegetables for more than 5 minutes, stir the contents of the pan after the first 5 minutes and whenever you check on the vegetables.

, Remove the lid from you pan and stir the sprouts into the rest of the dish. Cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, just long enough to heat the sprouts through.


Bean sprouts do not take long to cook, and if you leave them in for too long, they can become mushy and unappetizing. As such, it is better to add them to the pan after the other vegetables are just about fully cooked.

, Combine the white vinegar, sugar, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) cold water, cornstarch, soy sauce, and ketchup in a small bowl, whisking until evenly blended.

, Pour the sauce into the skillet, stirring the contents of the pot thoroughly to coat all of the vegetables. Let the sauce boil and thicken.


It should take 1 to 2 minutes for the sauce to thicken. Once it thickens, cook the dish for another 1 minute to ensure that the cornstarch has fully broken down. Uncooked cornstarch can leave an aftertaste, but the extra cooking time can help prevent this.

, The vegetable chop suey is now finished. Serve it while still hot with a cooked rice or boiled noodles. If desired, sprinkle each portion with crispy fried noodles before enjoying.

Serve.",How to Make Chop Suey2," Whisk together the dry sherry, oyster sauce, and a pinch of white pepper in a non-reactive dish. Place the pork in the marinate and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.


A non-reactive dish can be made of glass or plastic. Do not use a metal dish.
Alternatively, you could combine the ingredients in a large resealable plastic bag. Add the pork to the marinade inside the bag, then seal the bag and toss gently to coat the pork. Let the bag of marinating pork sit in your refrigerator for a full 1 hour.

, In a separate bowl, whisk together the two ingredients until smooth. Set aside.


Wait until the pork is nearly finished marinating before preparing this slurry.
Keep an eye on this cornstarch slurry as the rest of your dish cooks. If the cornstarch appears to start separating and settling on the bottom of the dish, give it another quick mix to recombine the liquid and starch.

, Place the shortening in a deep, heavy skillet and heat on medium-high until melted.


You could substitute butter for the shortening if you want a richer taste, or substitute oil if you want a healthier alternative.

, Drain the marinade from the pork before tossing the meat into the hot shortening. Stir-fry for a few minutes, just until the pork starts to brown on all sides.

, Add the onion to the skillet. Cook the onion and pork simultaneously for another 5 minutes, or until the onion becomes more aromatic and starts turning translucent.


Do not allow the onion to start browning just yet.

, Mix these ingredients into the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until the color becomes brighter and the vegetables feel tender-crisp.


You could cook the vegetables for a longer period of time if you prefer them to be softer.
If the pan seems dry before you add the vegetables, you could add a bit more shortening or oil before tossing the vegetables into the pan.

, Toss the snow peas and bean sprouts into the pan and immediately pour the stock and cornstarch slurry in afterward. Cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the sauce has boiled and thickened.


Bean sprouts cook quickly, so you should only add them to the pan once the rest of the ingredients are just about fully cooked. Otherwise, the sprouts may become soggy and unappealing.
Make sure that the cornstarch slurry is still well-combined before adding it to the pan.
You must allow the liquid to thicken. The thickened liquid is a necessary attribute of the dish, but in addition to that, thickening liquid is a sign that the cornstarch has fully broken down into the sauce. If the cornstarch does not break down, it could leave a bad aftertaste.

, The chop suey is now done and ready to eat. Serve it over rice or chow mein noodles and enjoy it while the dish is still hot.

Toss in the remaining vegetables.,
Combine the cornstarch and remaining water.,
Serve.",How to Make Chop Suey3," Pour the oil into a heavy, deep skillet and heat it on the stove over a medium-high setting. Place the chopped onion and minced garlic in the hot oil and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly toasted.


You need to monitor garlic closely as you toast it in oil. If you overcook the garlic or do not stir it enough as it browns, it can burn quickly. Burnt garlic has a bitter taste and should be discarded. Moreover, if the garlic burns, you should dump the entire contents of the dish, quickly rinse it out, and start over again from the start.

, Add the cubed chicken to the skillet. Stir-fry in the oil and aromatics for 2 minutes, or until the chicken turns white on all sides.

, Place the sliced chicken liver in the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 3 minutes.


As you cook the chicken liver, you should notice the chicken meat begin to brown.

, In a separate bowl, combine the shrimp bouillon cube with the hot water. Stir gently until the bouillon is dissolved.


You may want to do this step simultaneously with the previously mentioned steps to avoid accidentally overcooking any of the ingredients already in the pan.

, Pour the diluted shrimp bouillon into the hot skillet. Mix gently to coat the rest of the contents, and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan, and simmer for 5 minutes.

, Remove the lid and add the deveined shrimp, along with a sprinkle of salt and a sprinkle of ground black pepper. Stir in the oyster sauce, then let the entire thing simmer, uncovered, for another 2 minutes.


Shrimp cooks quickly, so you should add it toward the end of the cooking process instead of cooking it alongside the chicken at the start. Overcooked shrimp tends to have a rubbery texture.

, Place the cauliflower florets, cabbage wedges, carrots, snow peas, and bell peppers in the pan. Stir well to distribute the vegetables evenly, then cover the pot with its lid and allow the dish to simmer for another 5 minutes, or until the hardiest vegetables are tender-crisp.


You can cook the dish for a bit longer if you prefer your vegetables to be more tender, but watch the shrimp, chicken, and chicken liver carefully if you decide to do so. If these pieces of food appear fully cooked, remove them before you continue cooking the vegetables for additional time. Add them back into the pan along with the cornstarch mix.

, In a separate bowl, mix together the remaining 1/4 cup (60 ml) cool water with the cornstarch until a slurry forms. Pour this slurry into the liquid in your dish and mix well. Let the liquid reach a boil.


As the liquid boils, it should also thicken, thanks to the addition of the cornstarch. The thickening is crucial to the quality and taste of the dish.

, Once the liquid has thickened, the chop suey is ready to enjoy. Serve it with cooked rice or cooked noodles.

Cook the remaining dumplings.,
Serve.",How to Make Chinese Dumplings," Mix the ingredients together until you make a nice, smooth dough. Use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients together until they are fully incorporated. This recipe should make about 20 wrappers., This can help the ingredients settle together. As you wait for the dough to rest, you can cover the bowl with cling wrap. You can start to make the filling for the dumplings while you wait.

, A cutting board will work here. Then, cut the dough into about 20 or more equal pieces for the dumplings.

, Simply use your hand to pick up each piece of dough and pound it into the board to make a small circular disc. Then, use a rolling pin to smooth out each disc until it's about 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter. They don't have to all be exactly the same size, but it can help to get them as close to the same size as possible.


You can add some flour to the rolling pin to keep the wrappers from sticking.

, You should either fill the wrappers immediately, or you can store them in the fridge to keep them fresh while you make the filling. You can store them for a few days in the fridge, or you can even freeze them to store them long-term. Just make sure to coat them with flour so they don't stick to each other.

, If you don't have the time or energy to make your own wrappers, then you should know that two types of wrappers are readily available in supermarkets and Asian food stores. Wonton wrappers (also called skins) are delicate and paper-thin, usually about a thirty-second of an inch thick. They typically come in three-inch squares and are made from flour, eggs, and salt.


These wrappers, which are Chinese in origin, are suitable for boiling, steaming, deep-frying, and pan-frying.

, If you'd like to be extra thorough, then you can add a dash of salt to the cabbage and let it sit in a bowl for 10 minutes; this will allow the salt to soak up the excess moisture in the dumplings.

, Ground meat is meat finely chopped by a meat grinder. The process of mincing is usually done manually. Continue mixing the cabbage and meat together until they are thoroughly blended.


Pork and lamb are generally preferred for Chinese dumplings, but beef, chicken, and turkey may be used as well. In South Asia, both lamb (mutton) and goat meat are popular.

, Repeat the process until you've thoroughly mixed in the remaining ingredients. If you'd rather use mixing spoons instead of your hands, that will work too, but you have to be really thorough.

, This will help dry out the mixture a bit. While you massage the mixture, if you feel that there is not enough vegetable oil, then you should add more.

, Just use a spoon to scoop out 1-2 tablespoons of the mixture in the center of every wrapper. You don't have to use the exact same amount in every wrapper; just make sure you have enough to use for all 20 or so of the wrappers.

, You should wet the edge of each wrapper with a damp finger and then fold the sides together, crimping (pressing together) the dough with your fingers to seal the contents inside. To do this, first fold it in half and press together the top of the edge. Then press each side together, while crimping it. Simple mechanical ""dumpling presses"" are also available to simplify this process.

, This will keep them from sticking to the surface and will make your dumplings ready to either boil or fry—it's your choice!

, To make sure that they are thoroughly cooked, one method used in China is the ""3 boil"" method. To do this, add the dumplings to boiling water, and return the water to a boil. Then, add 1 or 2 cups of water (it can be cold or at room temperature). Wait for it to boil the second time, then add water again. After the water boils the third time, your dumplings should be good to go.


Alternately, you can boil the water, place the dumplings in it, wait for the water to return to a boil, and cook the dumplings for 10 more minutes at a simmer.

, You can use a slotted spoon to take out the dumplings or close the lid over the pot and pour out the water before removing the dumplings.


Though they are done at this point, you can go for a boiling/frying combo if you'd like to transfer them to a skillet with hot oil and fry them for just a minute or two, until they're a bit crispy, for an added touch.

, Serve these tasty dumplings while they're warm. You can enjoy them with a dipping sauce of your choice.

, You should cook about 8 dumplings at a time, if the size of the pan allows it. Once the oil heats up, you should place the first 8 dumplings on the pan while trying to move them apart enough so that they don't stick together.,, Cover the skillet and let it steam until the water has completely evaporated. Then, turn the heat back to medium to continue frying the dumplings.

, Once you've finished frying these dumplings, remove them from the pan and place them on a plate with a paper towel on it to absorb the excess oil. You can also remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and shake the extra oil back into the pan.

, Then, cook the remaining 12 or so dumplings in two batches. Do exactly what you did with the previous batch of dumplings, adding more oil when necessary.

, Serve the dumplings while they're warm with your favorite dipping sauce.

Finished.

",How to Make Beef and Oyster Sauce," Take the 1 pound of beef tenderloin and put it in the freezer for a few minutes to make it firmer and therefore easier to slice. When slicing, cut against the grain of the meat. You can either make thin or thick slices, depending on your tastes. Place the beef slices in a large bowl and mix in 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon rice wine, 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Thoroughly mix with the beef and set aside for one hour to fully marinate. Do not let it marinate for over two hours as the baking soda will damage the meat.;
, While the meat marinates, take a 12 ounce bundle of raw spinach (2 cups), cut it in half, and place in a large bowl. Now crush and mince some garlic cloves to make 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. Cut off the ends of the 3 to 5 green onions and finely slice. Finally, grate a ginger root to make 1 teaspoon of ginger.

, In a large wok or skillet, heat two to three inches of water to a boil and then add in 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. Add the raw, cut spinach into the boiling water, pushing it down in the water. It should only take about thirty seconds to fully blanch the spinach. Now remove the spinach to a strainer and then drain well. This cooked spinach will provide a bed for the beef to come.

, Pre-heat about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet. The oil should be between 325o - 350o (163o- 177o C). You will know when the oil is hot enough when you start to see smoke or little squiggly lines in the oil. For 1 pound of beef, deep fry in two to three batches so as not to overcrowd the pot. Stir continuously. Once the meat floats to the top or changes color, strain and drain on a paper towel. Continue the process with the rest of the beef slices.

, After first pre-heating your wok until it starts to smoke, add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil around the sides of the wok. Let the oil get hot and then add in the garlic, ginger, and green onions. Stir this around and then add the beef. Stir continuously for a minute or so and then add in the sauce ingredients: 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, and a slurry made from 2 tablespoons water mixed with 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch. Make sure the slurry is fully mixed before you stir it into the beef mix. Stir continuously for about a minute or two, remove from heat, and pour the beef mix on top of the blanched spinach.

, Enjoy!

",How to Make Chicken with Ginger and Spring Onion," First take 3 spring onions (or green onions) and coarsely chop them. Next, cut off 5 slices of a ginger root. It is ok to leave the skin on the ginger as it will add to the flavor in the marinade. Add these ingredients along with 1 tablespoon of salt an 2 tablespoons of rice wine into a food processor. Finely chop and mix the onions, garlic, ginger, rice wine and salt. You can use a food processor or a mortar and pestle. Take the finished marinade and spread it evenly over both sides of the 1 1/2 pounds of chicken. Bone in chicken is recommended as it has more flavor and cook with the skin on. Now set the chicken aside for 1 hour at room temperature and let it marinate.;
, While the chicken is marinating, prepare the garnish. Start by peeling the skin off a ginger root with a spoon. Then thinly slice and finely chop the ginger to make a 1/3 of a cup. Remove the both the tops and ends of the green onions. Slice the green onion in half lengthwise and then line up all the green onion halves. Thinly slice them at a diagonal. Mix the chopped green onions and the prepared ginger in a small bowl.

, Put about 1 1/2 cups of water in the bottom of a large wok or skillet and heat to a low boil. Place a large steam basket in the wok and put the chicken into it. Cover the wok and steam for about 15 to 20 minutes to cook.

, Remove the chicken from the steam basket to a serving dish. Take a large skillet and pour in 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat. While the oil heats, take the green onion and ginger mix and spread it evenly on top of the green onions. Once the oil starts to crackle, remove from the heat and pour on top of the chicken. This dish will serve four people.

, Leave the eggs covered in the hot water for about ten minutes to finish hard cooking. Continue on to the next step while you wait.


This method of making hard boiled eggs helps prevent tough egg whites.Large eggs typically take 12 minutes to finish hard boiling, but these eggs are going to get a little more cooking later.
Small eggs require less cooking time.

, Bring about 2 cups (about 0.5 L) water to a boil in a second saucepan, then turn off the heat.

, For the strongest flavor, choose a smoky black tea such as Lapsang Souchong, or another strong black tea such as Assam. Put in 2 tbsp (30 mL) of loose leaf tea, or two tea bags.A tea that brews to a deep red color is best for a beautifully marbled egg., Tea eggs get their flavor and color from soy sauce and Chinese spices. Mix these into the saucepan of hot tea:soy sauce


2 tbsp (30 mL) dark soy sauce
2 whole star anise or 1 tsp (5mL) ground star anise
1 small cinnamon stick or ½ tsp (2.5mL) ground cinnamon
1 tsp (5 mL) Sichuan peppercorn

, Once the eggs are finished cooking, pick them up and tap the shell with the back of a metal spoon. Crack the shell in a few places on the egg. The goal is a spiderweb pattern with a couple long cracks to help the marinade seep in.Losing a small piece of shell isn't a disaster, but tap gently to try to avoid this., The salt in the marinade can make the egg whites tough, so it's important to keep the temperature low to counteract this.It's best to cook the eggs around 190ºF (88ºC). If you're near sea level, this temperature is a light simmer: bubbles are visible, but do not rise to the surface in ""ropes."".

, Check on the eggs occasionally. If the marinade drops below the level of the eggs, add a little more water.


If this is too finicky for you, cover the pot to prevent water loss. Cooking in a covered pot may make the eggs softer and less flavored., By now the eggs are lightly infused with flavor, and have a brown or red spider web pattern imprinted onto the egg whites. For a more striking color and flavor, turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the marinade for at least another hour.Some cooks let the eggs marinate for at least another six hours, but move the container to the fridge within two hours of cooking., Let people peel the eggs themselves to discover the web of lines on the egg white and the darker pattern on the inside of the shell. The longer the eggs were marinated, the stronger this pattern will be.

Cut up your shrimp and carrot.,
Assemble all your ingredients.,
Wet the rice paper wrappers.,
Fill your spring rolls.,
Wrap the roll.,
Roll until the wrapper is completely used.",How to Make Spring Rolls1," Completely peel your each shrimp ensuring that there are no pieces of tail or legs left behind. Peel them from the middle of their torso, where the legs are located, out. Once peeled, carefully cut them in half lengthwise. For the carrot, slice off each end and peel the outer layer. Chop the carrot into smaller pieces about two-inch each. Julienne each two inch piece into smaller matchstick-sized pieces.


If you love cucumber, feel free to add to the recipe. Not only will the cucumber add to the taste but it will also add crunch to the rolls. Remember to peel the cucumber and julienne into matchstick sized pieces.;
, Gather your ingredients together to speed up the wrapping process. Keep your carrots, shrimp, noodles, mint, lettuce and bean sprouts together as a wrapping station.


Having a wrapping station is especially helpfully if cooking a large amount of spring rolls or working with your kids to create a fun assembly line.

, Upon opening the rice paper wrappers, you’ll find they are similar to a hard piece of paper. In order to soften them, you want to fill a large pot or deep plate with a small amount of warm water.Lay a singular paper in the pot and count to five slowly.Gently remove the wrapper from the water once you find that it is soft and pliable and place it on porous cloth. A cotton pillowcase or tablecloth should work well.









Don’t soak a wrapper too long and only soak wrappers one at a time. Soaking more than one wrapper at once will cause the wrappers to stick together. Soaking a wrapper too long will make it too soggy and it will easily fall apart.

, Lay down your filling across the middle approximately two thirds into the wrap. Start by laying down the mint. Mint can be overpowering so try using three to four leaves per wrapper depending on your taste.Next, lay four to five pieces of shrimp over the mint.Add a small amount of carrot or any other vegetables. Lastly, cover this layer of vegetables with noodles and lettuce.









Keep in mind that the mint and shrimp will act as decorative colors through the paper. Try alternating where you place them to keep your rolls looking fresh and beautiful.
Always keep your vegetables in the middle of the roll. Rice wrapper paper is very fragile and will tear easily. By sandwiching the vegetables, you prevent the hard carrots from poking through the wrap.You want the filling to take up approximately 60% of the roll’s length. When laying the filling across the roll, ensure you have left enough room on each side of the filling for the wrapper to be lifted and tucked around the filling., Lift the sides over the filling. To prevent your rolls from falling apart, you need to keep it tight. Don’t pull too hard or allow the sides to become sloppy. After the ends are folded over the filling, tuck the shorter remaining end over the pile of filling.Now you should have a roll that has three edges of the wrapper tucked around the filling. Using care, roll the paper and stuffing towards the last remaining edge.








Always use two hands to roll your spring rolls. It may take some getting used to, and your first few rolls might not be the prettiest, but you’ll find that each successive roll becomes easier., When storing your spring rolls, keep them laid on the side with the exposed wrapper. This will prevent the wrapping from lifting or the spring roll from becoming undone. As Vietnamese spring rolls are eaten uncooked, your rolls are now ready to be devoured.


Try serving these spring rolls with peanut sauce. This can be made by mixing hoisin sauce with peanut butter, and a sprinkle of water.Adding sriracha for some heat.

Fill your wrapper.,
Heat up the frying oil.",How to Make Spring Rolls2," After heating cooking oil, pan fry garlic and ginger on high setting for thirty seconds.Add onions and green peppers and cook for two minutes.Stir in carrots, cooked noodles, cabbage and saute for another three minutes. Stir the pan often to prevent your ingredients from burning. Once done, remove the pan from the burner.Cut the noodles before adding them to your pan. Cutting your noodles avoids long, stringy pieces from falling out of the roll. Quickly cut your noodles into pieces 2 inches (4 cm) long for most spring rolls., After turning off the heat, add ketchup, salt, and szechuan sauce.Mix the pan well until the liquids have evenly coated the vegetables then set aside the filling until needed.


If you wish to add meat, such as cooked ground pork or roasted shredded chicken, add your precooked meat along with the liquid ingredients.

, Lay out the wrappers in a diamond shape in front of you. Scoop up a spoonful of filling and place it 3/4 of a single wrapper. Take the horizontal ends of the wrapper cover the filling.Using your fingers, tightly tuck the exposed, shorter end over the filling. Roll the filling up in the rest of the wrapper.If you’re having trouble getting your wrapper to seal, mix up a little bit of flour and water. Dip your fingers in the mixture and tap it along the seal of the roll. This will help keep the paper sealed., In a wok or deep pan, heat up a thin layer of oil on medium. Once the oil is crackling, add the spring rolls in. Cook for approximately 2 minutes or until golden roll. Remember to flip the spring roll constantly to ensure it is evenly fried. Once all sides are a beautiful brown color, they are ready.Before and after cooking, store the spring rolls on absorbent paper, such as paper towel. This will help remove any water before cooking. Use a paper towel to remove any excess oil after cooking as well.Try serving your Chinese spring rolls with a side of soya sauce.

Reuse hardened rice paper.",How to Make Rice Paper," Place the rice flour, potato starch, water, and salt in a bowl. Whisk them together until they become glue-like paste., Choose a large, microwavable plate and plastic wrap. Stretch the plastic wrap across the top of the plate until the plastic wrap is tight over the plate., Tip the bowl over so the mixture rests on the plastic wrap. As long as the wrapping is tight, the rice paper paste will sit upon it. Tilt the plate so that the paste spreads into a smooth, even coating about about seven inches (17.78 cm) across.A spoon can be used to help spread the paper paste.

, Place the entire plate and wrapping in a microwave. Heat the paste on a high heat setting for 45 seconds. The amount of time you need may vary depending on your microwave, but this approximates to 40-50 seconds for a 500 W microwave., Undo the plastic wrapping from the plate, leaving the wrap itself intact with the rice paper on it. You may instead hold the plate upside down, but the plate will be hot and wearing oven mitts can make removing the rice paper too difficult., Attempt to lift up the edges of the rice paper. As the paper cools, the edges may lift a little by themselves. Move slowly, continuing to lift one edge of the paper even if it starts to tear. Flip the rice paper upside down before you add filling., To make a spring roll, place your choice of fillings, including raw vegetables, tofu, pork, and chicken, on the bottom third of the paper. Place the bottom of the rice paper over the filling, then continue to wrap the roll upwards as you keep the filling tight inside the paper.Fried spring rolls can be made by dropping the rolls into boiling oil until golden brown.

, Place the rice paper in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Once they are made and exposed to the air, they will absorb moisture. Store paper that will be used soon, such as premade spring rolls, by wrapping them in a damp towel and then plastic wrap before refrigeration to keep them soft., When fresh rice paper has been sealed properly and refrigerated, it can last a few days. Refrigeration will cause the paper to harden, so before using leftover rice paper, dip it in lukewarm water and let it set on a plate. Paper that doesn’t soften to your liking can be thrown out or chopped up into noodles."

Steam the sake.,
Remove and serve.",How to Heat Sake," Nowadays, premium sake is usually served chilled instead of warm. If you have a less expensive type of sake or simply want to draw out a different dimension of flavor, though, you can try heating it before serving it. This can be an especially good option for a cold winter day.


Heat causes the alcohol to vaporize. Aroma-producing ingredients with low boiling points also vaporize, making these flavors stand out more. This has very little effect on bitter acidic tastes, but sweet tastes get pronounced more effectively. As such, sake with a high level of acidity is often heated since the process can balance the acidic flavor with the sweet undertones more evenly.Warm sake also tends to have a ""dry"" taste when compared to chilled sake. The effect of the alcohol is increased as the vapors begin coming off.;
, There is a full range of temperatures you can heat sake to, from lukewarm to hot. The right temperature to use depends partially on personal preference, but there are a few standard approaches to take that you might want to consider.


The average temperature of kan sake, or ""warm sake,"" is between 107.6 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit (42 and 45 degrees Celsius). The full range of possible warmth varies slightly beyond this, though, and each range of warmth has its own traditional term associated with it.

At 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius), sake is referred to hinata-kan, or ""warmed in the sunshine.""
At 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), sake is referred to as hitohada-kan, or ""heated to body temperature.""
At 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), sake is referred to as nuru-kan, or ""heated to tepid temperature.""
At 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius), sake is referred to as jo-kan, or ""heated fairly warm.""
At 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius), sake is referred to as atsu-kan, or ""heated hot.""


As a general rule, warm sake is ideal as an accompaniment for cold or plain dishes, like sushi, as well as dishes that have soy sauce in them. Hot sake, on the other hand, is ideal to serve alongside warmer dishes, like hot pot, or foods made with a large amount of oil or fat.Two types of sake that are often heated include junmai and honjozo. Junmai sake is often served fairly warm to hot. Honjozo sake is typically served warm at room to body temperature.

, Pour the sake you want to serve into a bottle with a narrow, tall neck and open mouth.


You should not fill the container to the brim. Sake expands as it heats, and if you fill the container too high, it could burst out of the top.

, Fill a small saucepan with enough water to cover roughly three-quarters of the height of the decanter you are using for the sake. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it over medium-high until the water begins to boil.


If you want to be more traditional, there is a special utensil known as a ""kan-tokkuri"" you should use. If you decide to use it, heat the water in the stove with a saucepan or kettle and pour the water into the kan-tokkuri after it starts to boil.

, Turn off the heat and slowly submerge the sake in the hot water. Lower it carefully to prevent any water from getting inside the container. Let it sit, uncovered, for one to three minutes.


Place the sake as close to the center of the saucepan as possible. Do not allow it to tip or tilt as it sits in the water.
For a more precise way of heating sake, you can measure the temperature of the drink using a thermometer to determine if it has reached your desired temperature.
If you want to check the temperature of sake without the use of a thermometer, you can gauge it by looking. If small bubbles begin to rise, the sake is considered to be warm. If bubbles quickly and immediately rise to the surface, then the sake is hot.

, Carefully lift the decanter of sake out of the water and serve the hot drink immediately.


If the container feels too hot to touch with your bare hands, wear oven mitts as you remove it from the hot water. You might also want to consider wiping the bottom dry with a towel before serving sake from the container.

, Pour enough sake into a microwave-safe tumbler or mug. Generally, you will need to pour about 3 oz (90 ml) of sake into the mug for each intended serving.


While a tokkuri might be safe to use in the microwave depending on which materials it is made from, the traditional shape of the jar can cause the sake inside to heat unevenly. As a result, some parts can become far too hot while others would remain cold. For this reason, it is recommended that you heat the sake in a separate mug first.

, Place the mug of sake in the microwave. Heat it on high power for 30 to 60 seconds, varying the temperature based on how hot you want the sake to become.


While the sake should heat more evenly inside a standard mug or tumbler, it is still a good idea to pause the microwave at the 30 second mark and give the drink a quick stir with a spoon or plastic stirring rod. Doing this can allow you to gauge the current temperature and can also help the sake heat more evenly.
If you want to check the temperature of sake without the use of a thermometer, you can gauge it by looking. If small bubbles begin to rise, the sake is considered to be warm. If bubbles quickly and immediately rise to the surface, then the sake is hot.

, Once heated, pour the sake from your tumbler or mug and into a traditional tokkuri. From there, you can serve the sake as usual. Do so immediately to avoid losing flavor or heat.


You might need to handle the mug or tumbler with an oven mitt, but you should probably be able to touch the sides of the tokkuri without a mitt after you make the transfer.

, Add enough water to the bowl of a slow cooker so that the level of water is about three-quarters the height of the sake bottle you wish to heat.

, Cover the slow cooker and set the temperature to low. Allow the water to heat up until it reaches a temperature of 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius)., Open the lid of the bottle. Uncover the slow cooker and carefully submerge the bottle of sake into the hot water


Make sure that no water gets into the sake from the open top of the bottle.

, Turn off the slow cooker. Allow the bottle of sake to sit in the hot water for a full 30 minutes.


Gauge the temperature of the sake by looking at it. If small bubbles begin to rise, the sake is considered to be warm. If bubbles quickly and immediately rise to the surface, then the sake is hot.

, By now, the bottle itself might be fairly hot. Use an oven mitt to carefully grasp the bottle and remove it from the water. Serve immediately.


Continue to wear the oven mitt as you pour and serve the sake, as well. If you wait for the bottle to cool down enough to touch with your bare hands, the sake will end up cooling down too much.

, Fill the espresso machine's metal or ceramic pitcher with enough sake to serve.


Note that you should prepare about 3 oz (90 ml) per intended serving.

, Fill the upper reservoir with water and set the temperature of the espresso machine to low. Allow the water to heat up for about 30 to 60 minutes, or until the temperature reaches 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius).

, Open the lid of the upper reservoir and submerge the pitcher of sake in the water. Turn off the heat and allow the sake to sit in the warm water for 30 minutes.


Position the pitcher carefully so that none of the water gets inside the mouth and into the sake.

, Remove the pitcher of sake. Place the steam wand of the espresso machine into the pitcher and turn on the steam to the wand. Let the sake continue heating up until it reaches a temperature of 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius).


The steam wand should sit at a 45 degree angle to the surface of the sake. Do not allow it to dip into the sake; it must rest above the liquid in order to provide steam. The tip of the wand should also be just a bit off-center.
If you want to check the temperature of sake without the use of a thermometer, you can gauge it by looking. If small bubbles begin to rise, the sake is considered to be warm. If bubbles quickly and immediately rise to the surface, then the sake is hot.

, Remove the steam wand from the sake and serve immediately.


You should be able to handle the pitcher without the use of an oven mitt.
If you want to serve the sake in a more traditional way, pour it out of the pitcher and into a tokkuri before serving it to guests.

",How to Cook Edamame," There are many different options out there, from frozen, cooked and frozen, and fresh. If you are lucky enough to find fresh edamame at your local market, opt for those! All other varieties are fine to use also.;
, Some edamame experts will tell you that the only way to cook them is with salted water. Depending on your taste and dietary needs, you may choose to not salt the water. A recommended amount of salt for about a pound of edamame would be 1/2 tablespoon for salt lovers, 1 teaspoon for less of a salty taste. Add the salt to a large pot, 3/4 of the way filled with water.

, Bring your pot of water to a rolling boil, making sure that it does not boil over.

, When the water is at a rolling boil, add the edamame in small handfuls. If you dump all the beans it at once, you risk burns from splashing created by the beans.

, For frozen beans, boil time is around 4-5 minutes. For fresh beans, test an individual edamame at around 5-6 minutes and gauge the firmness of the bean. Young fresh beans will be done in 3 minutes. Edamame beans should be firm, yet give to the teeth. Mushy beans means that they are over cooked.

, Dump the entire contents of the pot through a colander. There will be a lot of steam from the pot, so don't put your face directly over the colander.

, Some like to add an additional pinch of salt over the hot beans at the end though this is entirely optional.

, While not a necessary part of the preparation, most people enjoy edamame cold rather than hot. 1-2 hours of refrigeration is recommended.

Then use your whisk to stir the ingredients well so the mixture is consistent throughout., You can also marinate your chicken in a bowl, though for longer marinating times, a sealable container will help prevent potential spills. Put the marinate in your container and insert the chicken, tossing the chicken so it’s well coated in marinade.

Sealable plastic bags make an excellent marinating receptacle. When using these, there will be less cleanup, and the shape of the bag will promote an even distribution of the marinade., To ensure the maximum flavor, marinade your chicken for 2 hours or overnight.

Generally, poultry can safely marinate in a refrigerator for up to two days. However, high acid marinades could actually make the meat tougher. Due to this, 2 hours or overnight marinating is recommended., Warm your pan over medium-high heat on your stove top. Place the chicken breasts in the pan, and pour the remainder of your marinade into the pan so the chicken bastes in it. Cook the chicken for about 8 to 10 minutes per side.

If any broth is leftover, reserve it and serve udon noodles with it the next day.",How to Make Sukiyaki," As soon as the noodles have come to a boil, turn off the heat and strain the noodles. Submerge shirataki in a bowl of cool water.


The shirataki shouldn’t need much cooking. Rather, the par-boiling is designed to remove some of the odor from the noodles. Then the shirataki can absorb the full flavor of the sukiyaki sauce.
If using other kinds of noodles, look at instructions and par boil until they are only a couple minutes away from being al dente.;
, Sukiyaki calls for very thin beef. Choose a marbled sirloin (or similar) cut for very good results.


Place the beef in the freezer for a couple of hours if you want to slice the beef yourself. When hard but not completely frozen through, beef is much easier to slice very thin., The stalks of the cabbage are a little more fibrous and take longer to cook. Therefore, cut right around the stalks of the cabbage until the stalks can be separated from the leaves. Cut the stalks into 1-inch (or smaller) pieces. Coarsely chop the leaves into larger pieces.

, If you weren't able to get shiitake mushrooms, cut whatever mushrooms you have into bite-size pieces. If you were able to get the shiitake, here's how to traditionally prepare them:


Remove the stem from the shiitake with a knife. Score a small star or cross into the cap of the mushroom with a knife. Imagine a straight line going through the middle of the cap. Take a knife and make a 30° angled cut along this straight line, digging only a small amount of flesh from the mushroom, enough to show the whites. Angle the knife in the opposite direction and make another 30° cut along the other side of the line. Repeat this process at the perpendicular to make a cross, and once more to make a star.
For enoki mushrooms, simply wash and cut off the root bulb to prepare.

,, If substituting spinach or watercress, rinse thoroughly and separate the leaves from the stalks. Discard the stalks.

, In a pot, bring 1/2 cup sake, 1/2 cup mirin, 1/3 cup soy sauce, and 1/4 cup sugar to a boil over medium heat. As soon as boil is reached, remove the sukiyaki sauce from the heat. The goal is to burn off the alcohol from the sake, not reduce the sauce.

, The traditional way of cooking sukiyaki involves an earthenware or cast iron hot pot with a kerosene burner underneath. This way the chef can cook at the table where he intends to serve. Alternately, an electric pan can be put to great use to cook at the table as well.


If you have neither a hot pot or an electric pan to cook with, you can of course cook the sukiyaki on the burner away from the table. Just make sure to choose a large pot with an accompanying lid.

, Beef suet is traditional, but lard or even vegetable oil can be used if the aim is a healthier meal.

, You will keep the beef in the pot while the other ingredients cook, so be careful not to overcook it. Once the beef loses its pinkness, move it over to the side of the pan so it doesn't cook at quickly.


Some cooks introduce a little bit of the sukiyaki sauce to the pan while they are cooking the beef.The sukiyaki sauce will bubble and reduce quickly because of the soy sauce.
Other cooks prefer sweetening the beef a little with plain sugar while it’s frying in the pan with the fat. There's no reason you can't do both.

, Keep all ingredients separate; each separate ingredient should be bunched together on the pan.

, Since shirataki contains a compound that makes beef tough, segregate it from the beef while all the ingredients are cooking.

, Introduce the cabbage leaves, chrysanthemum, and onions into the remaining spots of the pot.

,,, Traditionally, a dipping sauce of raw eggs is served alongside sukiyaki.The combination may not sound especially appetizing to westerners, but it is a surprisingly good combination, even if you aren’t predisposed to liking it.


If you are worried about uncooked eggs carrying salmonella or don’t like the flavor, omit them. For what it’s worth, salmonella is very rare in raw eggs., Simply grab whatever looks appetizing out of the hot pot and dip it into the egg.


If you are not eating with family or close friends, use the thicker ends of your chopsticks to grab food out communal pots. This is considered polite.

, If there are leftovers that didn’t find into the first generation of the meal, cook them now in the remaining broth. Meat and leafy greens will take less time to cook than vegetables will.

, In Japan, it is traditional to use the leftover broth as the broth for udon noodles. If you don't have enough broth but wish to make more, use the recipe for sukiyaki sauce above and combine it with the remaining sauce. Heat the broth back up to boiling, then reduce the heat to a simmer. If the broth tastes too overpowering, cut the broth with 1/3 cup of water and taste again.

Poached, no wrap: This is the more ""mess-free"" method because there is no wrapping or tying, but it results in a less textured torihamu. After bringing a pot of water to a boil, cook the chicken for 5 minutes, turn the heat off, and leave the chicken covered for an hour.
Oven: Pre-heat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Wipe off any excess liquid from the chicken. Roll each breast into a tight roll and secure it with kitchen twine or string. Place the breasts on a lightly greased baking sheet or line it with parchment paper. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until lightly brown on the outside. The internal temperature should be 165 degrees F (73 degrees C). Remove and let the chicken cool.

Meats such as chicken breast, lean pork, shrimp, fish and some lean cuts of beef are all great choices for a stir fry. Cooking these meats at a high temperature for a short cooking time will prevent them from drying out. Tofu is a vegetarian option, just be sure to choose firm tofu so that it will stand up to the rigors of stir frying. Cut the proteins into bite size pieces so that they cook quickly and evenly. Allow 4 to 6 oz. (113 to 170 g) of meat per person.;
,


Fresh vegetables work best in a stir fry because they retain the liquid that is otherwise lost when defrosting frozen vegetables. Choose colorful vegetables such as red bell peppers, carrots, celery, broccoli or whatever vegetables you like best. Cut the vegetables into uniform sizes so that they cook evenly. Allow about 1 cup of chopped vegetables per person.

,


Onions, garlic and ginger work well in any stir fry. They impart authentic flavors without overwhelming the dish. 1 tsp. (5 ml) of grated ginger and 1 small minced clove of garlic per person is enough to add flavor to your stir fry. Feel free to add more if you like ginger and garlic.

,


Choose an oil that can withstand higher temperatures before smoking. Oils such as peanut, canola and extra light olive oil are all good options. 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of oil per person is sufficient.

,


A slurry is a mixture of water and a thickening agent. For a stir fry, a slurry should be a combination of water and cornstarch. For each person, combine 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water with 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of cornstarch. Stir well until combined. Set aside until the last step of cooking.

,


Traditional stir fry pans are woks. These are deep pans with narrow rounded bottoms. The opening is wide and the sides are sloped.

There are also certain types of noodles frequently used in Chinese cooking. These noodles are typically rice-based.

You can use white or brown rice. The exact variety does not matter too much, but you should generally avoid wild rice blends or rice blends containing other grains if you want to maintain a more authentic flavor.



 


As for noodles, you should primarily stock up on rice noodles, glass noodles, and tofu noodles. Rice noodles have a soft texture and are made from rice flour. Glass noodles, also called bean threads or bean vermicelli, are made from mung bean starch. Tofu noodles, also called soybean curd noodles, are made from pressed tofu and have an al dente texture.;
, Many cooking techniques used when preparing Chinese food require some form of cooking oil. You need to make sure that the oil you choose can withstand the heat you plan on using with it. Also keep in mind that some oils have stronger tastes than others.

You should keep a bottle of sesame oil, but note that this oil is usually used for its flavor and not used as a cooking oil. More specifically, you can expect to drizzle it into a dish at the last minute to maximize the effect of its flavor and aroma. Use a fragrant version that is 100 percent pure rather than one mixed with vegetable oil.Polyunsaturated oils are usually used for cooking purposes. Go with peanut oil if you want something with a little extra flavor. For a cleaner taste, try corn, safflower, or soya oil. Vegetable oil can also be used in a pinch, but stay away from butter, margarine, and olive oil.







, As you cook more Chinese cuisine, you will likely run across a range of sauces, pastes, and other liquid seasoning ingredients. Soy sauce is one ingredient that even beginning cooks will recognize, but there are a few others worth knowing about, as well.


Soy sauce is used in marinades and sauces, and some even use it as a condiment. It has a salty, savory taste, and the best varieties taste fresh. Look for brands that are naturally brewed.
Dark soy sauce is fermented longer than the standard type and has a sweeter, less salty taste as a result.
Tamari is similar to soy sauce in that it is made with more soy beans.It is thicker and has a smoother, more complex taste. You can also get a gluten-free version if your dietary needs demand it.
Rice vinegar is light in color and has a very mild taste. It is used to provide acid in Chinese cooking, but its acidic content is often lower than that found in American vinegars. Chinese black vinegar, on the other hand, is similar to balsamic vinegar and has a richer taste.
Fish sauce and oyster sauce are made from seafood extracts and various seasonings. They can have a sweet yet savory flavor and are usually found in seafood and vegetable dishes.
Chili sauce is a quick way to add more heat and flavor to a dish, but the amounts you use should vary depending on how spicy you want the final dish to taste.
Hoisin sauce is another sauce with a sweet, smoky flavor. You will usually end up using this paste-like sauce in stir-fries or with spare ribs.
Rice wine adds a bit more dimension to the flavor of sauces and marinades. It is more common to Japanese cooking than Chinese cooking, but there are a few Chinese recipes that call for a bit of rice wine. If you do not have any and cannot find it in your local grocery store, you should substitute it with a dry sherry.

, Dried herbs and spices are not quite as essential as many of the liquid seasonings you will end up using, but there are a few of these that you will use frequently in your dishes, so it can help to know about them in advance.

Five spice powder is made from peppercorns, star anise, cloves, fennel, and cinnamon. Occasionally, it may include coriander seeds. This blend gives dishes a complex taste combining hot, salty, and sweet flavors.






You will need white sugar to help balance out sour and spicy flavors.






Cinnamon is used to help minimize fishy tastes or greasy textures in certain dishes.






Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a white, crystalline seasoning that dissolves in liquid., While some of the produce you find in Chinese cuisine may seem familiar, others might be new territory for you. Use fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible, and when it is not possible to do so, buy high-quality canned goods.

Garlic and ginger should be kept on hand at all times. These ingredients are used for flavor in many different dishes. You can use dried versions, but fresh versions give a stronger aroma and taste.






Mushrooms are fairly common ingredients, but look for types specifically labeled as ""Chinese mushrooms."" These tend to be fairly intense in flavor. Note, though, that you will usually need to buy them in dried form.






Fresh vegetables worth checking out include bell peppers, chili peppers, cucumbers, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, snow peas, carrots, white onions, green onions, and eggplant. Fresh fruit you might need include tomatoes and pineapples.







, Eggs are a common source of protein in Chinese dishes.Tofu is another popular choice. Note, however, that Chinese food can include a variety of meats, poultry, and seafood.

Eggs are included in Chinese soups, stir-fries, and other dishes, so you should have some stocked.






Chicken, duck, pork, and beef are among the most common forms of meat used, while shrimp and crab to be among the most common forms of seafood used.







, A wok is a specific type of bowl-shaped pan used for stovetop cooking. With its high sides and and sturdy base, it is suitable for most cooking techniques that involve hot oil or other hot liquids. The shape itself is designed to spread heat evenly.

A traditional round-bottom wok works well if you have a gas stove. With these types, you can toss food around inside the pan more easily while containing most grease splatters.






A flat-bottom wok works better if you have an electric stove since it can balance on the stove more effectively. These woks usually have long handles that enable you to shift food around in the pan by tilting it, but the heat is spread a little less evenly than in round wok.







, Chopsticks are essential eating tools if you want to eat Chinese food in a traditional manner, but they also make excellent cooking utensils. Make sure that you actually use chopsticks made for cooking, though, since these are usually longer an may be joined at the end with a string to help hold them together.Use chopsticks when you need to turn and lift fried foods, mix stir-fried foods, or stir soups.
If you do not have chopsticks, though, you could perform most of the same tasks with a standard set of tongs, mixing spoon, or spatula, depending on the task at hand.

, A Chinese cleaver is essentially a large knife you use for cutting vegetables and meat. It has a heavy, smooth blade and is very sharp, making it capable of cutting through even the woodiest of vegetables.


When holding the cleaver, place your index finger over the top of the blade and your thumb and middle finger knuckle on either side of the blade.Form a ""cat's paw"" with your other hand to protect your fingertips as you hold the food you cut in place on the cutting board.







, While a rice cooker is not absolutely essential, having one will definitely make your life easier if you plan on making Chinese food frequently. These appliances come in a range of sizes, so make sure that you choose one based on the number of people you will usually end up serving when you cook.


If you do not have a rice cooker, though, you could make rice on the stove with a standard saucepan and lid. It can be more difficult to cook the rice evenly this way, but it is certainly doable.

, If you plan on making a lot of steamed Chinese food, invest in a traditional bamboo steamer. These steamers come in stackable layers, so you can cook up to four or five dishes at once. Dishes that require more cooking are placed on the bottom layer, while those needing less are placed in a higher layer.


You can use other types of steamers if you do not have a bamboo one, though. A standard metal steamer works well. In a pinch, you could also place a wire mesh strainer inside a stockpot with a little boiling water and a lid.

, You will heat a little oil in a wok or similar pan and cook food quickly over high heat.


You will usually need to slice the food or shred it into small pieces. Small pieces cook faster and more evenly, which is why they are suitable for this technique.
The oil is added to the preheated wok. Fragrant ingredients are cooked after that, followed by the main ingredients. Add the sauce and spices immediately before the meat browns, then remove the meat and cook any vegetables.

, Even though stir-frying is the cooking technique most commonly associated with Chinese foods, if you want to master Chinese cuisine, you should also learn a few other frying techniques.


Quick stir-frying is similar to standard stir-frying, but you use a basic sauce to cook the ingredients instead of an oil.
Flash-frying is also similar to stir-frying, but you use even higher heat to cook the food almost instantaneously. Meat is usually coated in eggs and starches to help contain the juices.
Deep-frying is done in a heavy pot with a large amount of oil. This oil needs to be kept close to the smoke point throughout the cooking process, and the foods must be dry when submerged in the oil. The foods should also be cooked a little at a time and completely submerged.
Paper wrapped deep-frying is similar to standard deep-frying, but small pieces of fish or meat are wrapped in cellophane before being submerged in the hot oil.
Pan-frying or shallow frying is done with a small amount of oil and a low to moderate heat.

, Steaming is a fairly common technique and is often used when preparing lighter dishes without oil or sauce. For instance, you might prepare filled dumplings with a steamer.


During the cooking process, the food must never come into direct contact with the boiling water below the steaming rack.

, Red cooking is fairly exclusive to Chinese cuisine. You would usually use it with large cuts of meat or poultry.


During this method, you add dark soy sauce to the meat as it cooks, giving it a dark red tint. Usually, the dark soy sauce is added right after you add any water or stock to the wok.

, There are a handful of different cooking techniques used in Chinese cuisine that involve some form of boiling or simmering liquid.


Stews are fairly common, but most Chinese stews only have meat in them instead of meat and vegetables. Traditionally, these stews would be cooked in an earthenware pot over a slow charcoal fire, and the result is a thick stew with meat that is nearly like jelly in terms of tenderness.
You may blanch or poach food. During this process, food is quickly cooked in boiling water or boiling stock. Blanched foods are only in the liquid for a few brief moments, while poached foods are cooked until done.
Boiled foods are cooked in boiling water, as would be expected. Multiple-item boils involve several different ingredients being boiled together.
Quick-stewing is a cross between stewing and boiling. Foods are quickly cooked in boiling water or stock. A thickener is then mixed in and the contents of the pot are brought to a boil until thickened.

, Roasting is rarely used in Chinese cooking since most Chinese kitchens do not have an oven. If you plan on making certain restaurant-style dishes like Peking Duck, though, you will still need to know how to oven-roast food.

, In addition to the actual cooking techniques used when preparing Chinese food, you should also be aware of various pre-cooking practices you might expect to run across.Marinating is the most important to know. Standard marinating is used for fruits and vegetables in Chinese cuisine, and involves soaking these ingredients in wine, soy sauce, vinegar, and various seasonings. Wine-steeping is a specific type of marinating that uses some form of wine.






Dry-marinating is usually done with meats. Dry spices and seasonings are rubbed onto the ingredients and left to bleed into the food before cooking.






Marinate-in-mash is a special type of marinating that involves placing the ingredients into a fermented grain mash leftover from the wine-making process.






Pounding refers to the process of pounding meat with the flat side of a cleaver or with the end of the cleaver. This tenderizes the meat before you cook it.

Grab the corner nearest to the filling and fold it over the filling. Keep rolling and when you reach around the middle, tuck in both sides. Continue to wrap, but be sure to roll tight to keep everything in. When you reach the end, use a little water to seal the edge and then wrap it to create your roll. Use Saran Wrap or any plastic wrap to wrap each roll as you do the rest of the rolls. This is to keep the moisture in the roll.

, Heat the oil for about 5 minutes. Use the sides of the skillet to ""slide"" the rolls into the oil. When you use the sides, you're preventing oil from splattering when each piece hits it.

However, if you want to add more flavor to your sauce, you can substitute bacon fat for the oil.;
, Once the oil is hot, add 1 small onion that’s been finely chopped and 3 cloves of minced garlic to the pan. Cook the onion and garlic until they are soft and limp, which should take 1 to 3 minutes.You can also tell that the onion and garlic are ready when they start to give off a strong aroma.

, When the onion and garlic are soft, mix a 9-ounce can of liver pate into the pan. Stir well to ensure that it’s fully incorporated, and allow it to cook for 5 minutes on medium heat.If you don’t want to buy liver spread, you can cook your own chicken or pork liver, and create a paste by processing it in a food processor.

, When the liver has cooked with the onion and garlic for several minutes, add ¾ cup (177 ml) of vinegar and ¾ cup (150 g) of brown sugar to the pan. Stir the mixture and cook until the sugar dissolves, which should take approximately 2 to 5 minutes.You can use white or apple cider vinegar in the sauce.  

, Once the sugar has dissolved, mix 3 cups (709 ml) of water, 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt, and ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of pepper into the pan. Leave the pan uncovered, and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, which should take 3 to 5 minutes., After the pan comes to a boil, add ⅔ cup (84 g) of breadcrumbs to the mixture. Allow the mixture to cook for 2 minutes, or until it thickens up.Use plain, unseasoned breadcrumbs for the recipe. Seasoned breadcrumbs will change the flavor of the sauce.

, When the sauce has thickened, turn off the burner and remove the pan from the heat. Set aside and allow it to cool until the pork belly is finished cooking.If the sauce isn’t as smooth as you’d like, you can process it in a blender after it’s cooled.

, Take a 2 pound (907 g) whole boneless, skin on pork belly that’s been cut in half, and place it in a large pot with the skin side facing down.

Turn the heat to medium-high, and bring the pot to a boil.You can also mix a medium onion that’s been chopped into the water for extra flavor.

, Once the pot comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium. Allow the mixture to simmer until you can push a knife through the pork belly skin without any resistance, which should take approximately 1 to 1 ½ hours.After the pork belly comes to a boil, a film may form on the top of the water. Use a spoon to skim it away before simmering the mixture.

, After the pork belly has cooked for an hour or so, allow it cool until you can handle it. Transfer it to a wire rack that’s been fitted over a rimmed baking sheet. Season the pork liberally with Kosher salt, making sure to cover both sides. Place the pork belly in the refrigerator for 6 hours to overnight, or until the skin is completely dried.Wipe the pork belly dry before seasoning it with the salt.

, After the pork belly has dried, remove it from the refrigerator. Use a sharp knife to cut it into ¾-inch (1.9-cm) slices. Place the slices on a plate near the stove, so they’re nearby when you start frying., Place a Dutch oven or wok on the stove, and add 4-inches (10-cm) of canola or peanut oil. Turn the heat to medium-high, and heat the oil until it reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).Use a deep frying thermometer to monitor the oil so you know when it’s reached the right temperature.

, Add the sliced pork belly to the hot oil in batches, frying the pieces until they turn a dark brown and the skin becomes crispy. It should take approximately 7 to 10 minutes.Make sure to flip the pork belly slices halfway through the cooking to ensure that both sides are crispy.

, When the pork belly is fried to a golden brown, use tongs to remove the pieces from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Season the pork with salt and pepper to taste while it’s still hot., When the pork has cooled slightly, use a knife to cut it into ½-inch (1.3-cm) pieces.

",How to Make Hinava," First cut down the middle of the chili, holding it by the stem or sides to split it. Then remove the seeds by spreading apart the chili and peeling them out with your nail or a spoon. Hold the split and seeded chilies by one end and cut into small pieces. Keep the pieces in a small bowl, these will be added later.;
, You can keep the taste of ginger fresh by freezing it. This also makes it easier to shred. First place it on a cutting board, peel your ginger root with a peeler or knife, slicing off the outer skin till it is completely clean of it. Hold the skinned ginger root over a plate or bowl and slide it against the grooves of a cheese grater. Collect any clinging bits on the underside and keep in a pile on the plate. This will be added later.

, To do this you first cut your onion in half and place the half on the cutting board flat side down. Cut off the top and bottom root ends and pinch to peel off the top layer of each half. Run the halves under cold water to wash off the peel residue. This residue is what causes your eyes to water. Follow by cutting horizontal cuts along each half, making small squares. Set these aside to be used for later.

, Start by separating the bulbs of the shallot with your fingers or a knife. Place the shallot halves on a cutting board and cut away the root ends, then peel lengthwise till the skin is completely removed. You can peel with your fingers or a knife. To get the long strips hold the shallot in place lengthwise and slice along it with a knife, making close thin cuts along the entire length. Set these cuts aside for later.

, Hold the gourd firmly and make thin cuts along the length. Remove the seeds in the middle of the pieces. Cut the circles of each cut of gourd in halves. You can stack them to cut multiple or individually.

, Lay them flat in a pan or any container and sprinkle the salt on top, mix with your hands or any utensil till the salt soaks in, add more if necessary. After 15 minutes have passed, wash the salted bitter gourd twice with water to remove the bitterness and some of the salt. With your hand or utensil move all the pieces of gourd to one end of the container and run water over it, hold the pieces down as you drain it then repeat.

, Slowly thaw if frozen. You can do this by placing it in the refrigerator, keeping the meat in its original package on a plate. If you need to quicken the process, run the meat under cold water or place in a bowl of water to soak till it's thawed. Use the opposite end of your cutting board that you used to but the other ingredients. Hold lengthwise and cut small pieces off the meat , not too thick or thin. Put these in a bowl big enough to hold all the meat and added lime juice for the next step. More or less meat can be added depending on how many people are being served the dish.

, Cut into halves and collect the juice into a medium sized bowl. Place the pieces of meat into this bowl. Make sure they're completely covered in the juice.

, The lime will cook the raw fish with acidity. This is why the recipe requires no cooking, while the meat is still considered cooked.

, Start with the red onion, shallot, chilies, ginger root and bitter gourd, then lay down the meat on top. This can be taken out of the lime juice. Save the rest of the juice for additional taste if it is needed.

, It is recommended to use your hands so the fish won’t break.

, Mix again to spread throughout the bowl. Use vinegar if you run out of lime juice.

Ready the shrimp by running them under cold water at the sink. Rub them between your hands to ensure that they’re well rinsed.You can find dried shrimp at Asian markets and online retailers.;
, After you’ve rinsed the shrimp, dump it into a colander. Shake it well to drain all the excess water from the shrimp.It’s a good idea to let the shrimp sit in the colander for a moment to allow some of the excess water to drip out. You can then shake the colander to get rid of the remaining moisture.

, Once the shrimp are drained, add them to a food processor. Pulse the shrimp until they reach as fine or as coarse a texture as you prefer, and set them aside for the moment.If you have a small food processor, you may want to grind the shrimp in two batches.
The shrimp in hae bee hiam traditionally has a fairly coarse texture, but you can customize the texture to suit your preferences.

, For the spice paste, you’ll need 8 fresh red chillies. Use a pair of kitchen shears to cut the chillies in half lengthwise. Next, use a spoon or knife to scrape out the seeds inside and discard. Set the chillies aside for the moment.Avoid touching the interior or seeds of the chillies with your hands. If you touch your fingers to your eyes afterward, it can cause severe burning.

, Carefully remove the papery outer skin from 5 large shallots. Next, use a sharp knife to roughly chop the shallots into chunks.Because the shallots will be processed with the rest of the spice paste ingredients, there’s no need to finely chop or dice them.

, The spice paste requires 6 lemongrass stalks. Use a knife to cut away the root ends, and then peel away the first layer of the stalks with your fingers. Next, cut the stalks crosswise into thin rounds.You can usually find lemongrass at Asian markets and natural grocery stores.

, Add the chillies, shallots, lemongrass rounds, 4 cloves of garlic, 3 candlenuts, and ¾ ounce (20 g) of belacan to a food processor. Pulse the mixture until it forms a fine paste, and then transfer it to a separate bowl.Candlenuts are similar in appearance and texture to macadamia nuts. You can often find them at Asian markets, spice markets, and online retailers.
Belacan is a shrimp paste that comes in block form and is often used in Southeast Asian cooking. You can usually find it Asian markets and online retailers.

, Add ½ cup (125 ml) of cooking oil to a large wok. Place the wok on the stove, and allow the oil to heat on medium until smoke begins to rise from it, which should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes.Peanut, canola, corn, soybean, coconut, or olive oil work well for stir frying the dish.

, Once the oil begins to smoke, add the spice paste to the wok. Reduce the heat to medium low and stir the paste well. Allow it to cook for 30 minutes, or until the oil separates from the paste. Be sure to stir it constantly.It’s important to keep the paste moving as you stir fry it or it won’t cook evenly.

, For the hae bee hiam, you’ll need 12 to 14 kaffir lime leaves. Use clean hands to carefully tear the leaves from the edge to the stem.Adding the lime leaves is optional.

, After you’ve torn the kaffir lime leaves, add them and the ground shrimp to the wok with the spice paste. Mix well so all of the ingredients are fully combined., Once all of the ingredients are well mixed, allow the mixture to cook on medium low for another half hour. Just as before, make sure to keep the ingredients moving the entire time., When the mixture is finished cooking, fish the kaffir lime leaves out of the wok with a fork and discard. Next, add 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar and stir it in so it’s fully incorporated.If you prefer, you can finely chop the kaffir lime leaves before adding them to the mixture and leave them in the hae bee hiam.

, Once the sugar is fully mixed into the hae bee hiam, let it cook for another 10 minutes. Stir the mixture the entire time so it cooks evenly.The mixture should have a dry, crumbly texture when it’s finished stir frying.

, When the hae bee hiam is finished cooking, transfer it from the wok to a large bowl. Let the mixture sit for 15 to 20 minutes so it cools completely., After the hae bee hiam has cooled, use a spoon to add it to an airtight jar. Store the hae bee hiam in the refrigerator, and use it with 2 weeks.You can serve hae bee hiam with steamed rice or plain porridge. You can also spread it on toast or a sandwich for extra flavor.

Divide the meal proportionally.,
Obtain a bento box which is divided into compartments reflecting the proper bento ratio.,
Choose brightly colored food items.,
Pack the foods tightly in order, especially if your bento box does not have built-in compartments.,
Create striking patterns and shapes with the food items and/or seasonings by using stencils.",How to Make Bento," When preparing bento, there are two ways to divide the food. You can stick to a 4:3:2:1 ratio (4 parts of rice, 3 parts of the side dish, 2 parts of vegetables, and 1 part of a serving of pickled vegetables or a dessert) or you can make a 1:1 ratio (1 part rice, 1 part side dishes, where the side dishes themselves contain a 1:2 ratio of meat to vegetables). You can follow one of these traditional layouts, or you can vary the ratio and substitute more familiar ingredients. The objective is to have a nutritionally diverse yet balanced meal.


Alternatives to rice include, but are not limited to, sushi rolls, inari sushi, or onigiri (rice ball). You can also experiment with different kinds of rice (such as Spanish rice) or pasta.
The side dish should be the main source of protein, either beef, chicken, pork, or fish. This can be grilled, fried, breaded, and so on. For vegetarian bento, try beans or tofu.
Shredded cabbage with a light dressing is a popular choice for the vegetables. Sliced vegetables or even potato salad are used as well.;
, You may be able to find a bento box in an Asian food store or online. Keep in mind that in Japan, food portions are smaller than in the West. (This might be a good thing if you're trying to control your portion sizes, or it might be an inconvenience). If you can't find a bento box anywhere, you can improvise by using a square container and dividing the food creatively (e.g. with a dividing wall of baby carrots or saltine crackers). Muffin and cupcake cups also make great compartments.

, The bolder and more solid the color, the greater the visual impact of your bento, and the more nutritional benefits are conferred (at least when it comes to brightly colored vegetables; see the citations below). White rice, whole hard-boiled eggs, and cheese can add a nice contrast to your bento, especially when paired with bright orange, green, and red foods.

, This will prevent the food from shifting within the box.



Rice (or other starch) is nearly half the meal.
Food items that are awkward in terms of shape or arrangement (e.g. a piece of chicken or a large dumpling) might have to go in first.
Food items that are flexible, such as potato salad or cut vegetables go in any large remaining spaces.
Small and sturdy items, like cherry tomatoes or small pudding containers, should fill in the gaps and accent the bento.

, You can also decorate your bento according to a theme. You can also paint using food colouring mixed with Cream Cheese, Butter, Sour Cream, or frosting.


Keep the edges neatly defined. Contrasting colors, textures and shapes should be placed next to each other, but similar ones should be separated. Don't let clashing flavors mingle (e.g. don't put fried rice next to a pastry).
Make animal faces or other shapes with the food. Two slices from a hard-boiled egg with a dot of paprika in the middle of the yolk can make a great pair of eyes.
Sprinkle seasonings and add garnish to emphasize the center of a section of food.
Cut fruit, vegetables, cheese and kamaboko (pureed white fish shaped into a loaf) into shapes like stars, hearts, and diamonds with cookie cutters.
Put sauces or loose snacks into quirky containers. Small refillable sauce bottles made especially for bento can be purchased online.

",How to Fry Pot Stickers," Making Chinese dumplings can be a fun dinner party activity. For how to make your own handmade pot stickers, clicker , Traditionally, pot stickers are served with a delicious dipping sauce. The sauce is usually made up of a mixture of 2/3 soy sauce, 1/3 Chinese rice vinegar, fresh grated or chopped bottled or pickled ginger, and sesame oil, often with a garnish of chopped chives. If you like it spicy, add Chinese chili paste to taste.

, Make sure that the pan is very hot. To do this, flick a small amount of water onto the pan. If it evaporates immediately with a loud hiss, your pan is ready to go.

, The type of oil you use is up to you. For a more authentic Chinese recipe, use sesame or peanut oil. You can also use vegetable or olive oil if you prefer. For the healthiest option, use olive oil (it has the highest amount of heart-healthy fat--monounsaturated fat--of any oil.) Heat the oil for about a minute (bubbles might begin to form.), You must make sure that there is enough space between each pot sticker and that they are not overlapping at all. If they overlap while cooking, it will be nearly impossible to separate them without ripping them (and having all the delicious filling fall out.)

, You should fry the dumplings for roughly two to five minutes, or until the bottoms of the pot stickers begin to turn a golden-brown color.

, Immediately after pouring the water in, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. The steam created by the water will cook the dumplings all the way through. Using a lid that doesn’t let any air out is important--if steam escapes, the pot stickers will take longer to cook or may overcook and become gooey., You'll start to hear crackling sounds, and the pot stickers will again begin to turn a golden-brown color. Traditionally it is advised not to rotate the dumplings, instead only allowing the bottom to brown.If you like them well browned, gently lift and turn them with a spatula to brown the sides.
If you want them to be even crunchier, take the lid off and cook the dumplings on medium-high.

, Transfer them to a serving platter and serve immediately (they are best served piping hot.)

Examples of broths include: plain pork bone, pork bone with coconut milk, spicy mala (with varying degrees of spiciness), tomato, curry, and miso. You can also consider purchasing pre-made broth from some Chinese restaurants or pre-packaged ingredients of popular hot pot restaurants in Asian grocery stores.


A simple broth can be made by boiling water with the addition of meat bones or fish heads and a combination of herbs (ginger, goji berries, red dates, bay leaf, cloves, star anise, whole dried red chilies, cinnamon bark, fennel), seasonings (white pepper, sichuan peppercorn), and vegetables (scallions, garlic, napa cabbage, mushrooms). You will want to boil the ingredients until the water has been reduced and becomes infused with the flavor of the ingredients; then, strain the broth.
Traditional combinations include:

1) Plain: Chicken and/or pork bone, ginger, goji berries, red dates, white pepper, scallions, and optional napa cabbage and/or mushrooms;
2) Spicy Mala: Beef bone, ginger, garlic, chili oil, whole dried red chilies, bay leaf, star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, and fried tofu puffs.
In both recipes you can substitute the meat broth with vegetable broth for vegetarians or vegans.

;
, Slicing thinly will ensure that the ingredients will cook quickly and fully.


Choose any proteins (meat, variety of fish, or tofu) that you enjoy. Some common choices for Chinese hot pot include thinly sliced beef, pork, lamb (which you can marinate in red wine), chicken, thin fish fillets, squid, shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, fish cake, fish balls (sometimes stuffed with meat or fish eggs), shrimp balls, cuttlefish balls, shrimp or fish paste, beef balls, plain tofu, fried tofu, ice tofu, tofu sheets, tofu puffs, and quail eggs. You can make your hot pot using the more traditional method of using the meats and seafood that are local to you.

,


Wash and prepare some leafy greens. Popular options include: watercress, bok choy, tong ho, spinach, napa cabbage, cabbage, lettuce, snow pea leaves, daikon, taro, lotus root, winter melon, kabocha squash, tomato, and quarter cobs of corn. Mushrooms of all varieties are also common to Chinese hot pot preparations: king oyster mushroom, shiitake, enoki, and shimeji.

, The noodles will be infused with the flavors of all of the ingredients that everyone has cooked in it.


You can use any type of noodle, and there are many options: knife-cut, rice noodles, egg noodles, ramen, udon, and glass noodles. Feel free to offer a variety, but note that several people will be full before you even get to the noodles at the end or want to skip them altogether.
You can also provide rice to complement the meal, though not everyone may want it.

, For more variety, consider incorporating dumplings, rice cakes, and tangyuan (sweet dumplings - with various fillings such as taro, sweet or salty egg, red bean, or no filling).

, Typical condiments to prepare a sauce include satay sauce, chive flower sauce, sesame paste, hot mustard, soy sauce, black vinegar, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, chili oil, and sweet chili sauce. You can also include chopped garlic, scallions, and raw egg. Give each guest a separate small dish to mix their sauce.


A common sacha sauce recipe includes: Chinese BBQ sauce, soy sauce, black vinegar, chopped garlic, chopped scallions, and a raw egg on top. Some people will even separate the yolk from the egg white, adding only the yolk to the sauce and simply spreading the extra egg white across some raw meat to be cooked together.

, Place an electric heating plate on the table where you will be eating and place the broth on top of it to keep it hot.


You can also use a gas cooktop as an additional option.

, Eating a Chinese hot pot is a very communal experience. People gather around the pot, dipping their food, waiting for it to cook, mixing their own sauces and enjoying each other's company. Chinese hot pot meals commonly last a couple of hours because you are cooking and eating in small portions at the same time.


Multiple hot pots can also be used, or individual hot pots. At home, a single hot pot would work well up to 4-8 people depending on the size of the pot.
Oftentimes there are communal chopsticks, strainers, and ladles to be shared for moving items into your own bowl. As a courtesy to others, be sure to acknowledge and use these utensils.

If desired, you could also separate the palm of the foot from the connecting leg bone by cutting them apart at the joint.Both parts can then be prepared and cooked in the same manner. Doing this can make it easier to fry the chicken feet, but it will also change their distinctive appearance.;
, Stir 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt into 1 qt (1 L) of cold water. Dunk the chicken feet in the salt water and scrub them clean using your fingers.


Rub the feet together while submerged to help scrub off any dirt or debris.
Peel away any scaly, yellow outer skin. If you cannot pick away these spots, you can use kitchen shears to cut them away.

, Remove the chicken feet from the salt water and rinse well under cool, running water. Drain and dry the feet completely using clean paper towels.


It's very important to completely dry the feet after rinsing them. If excess water remains, you may encounter more splattering when you start frying the feet.
After drying the feet, set them aside on a clean plate while you prepare the frying oil.

, Pour 1 qt (1 L) of vegetable or peanut oil into a large Dutch oven. Set it on the stove and bring the oil to a heat of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).


If you don't have a Dutch oven, use a large wok, heavy-bottomed saucepan, or deep fryer.
It's best to check the heat of the oil with a fryer thermometer or candy thermometer, but if you don't have one, check by dropping a cube of white bread into the oil. When the oil is hot enough to use, the bread should turn golden in approximately 10 seconds.

, Carefully drop several chicken feet into the hot oil using long tongs or cooking chopsticks. Fry the feet for 3 to 7 minutes, or until they appear golden brown in color.The oil will likely splatter, so it's best to work carefully. Shield yourself with the lid of the pot while placing each chicken foot directly into the oil. Do not drop the feet from a height.
While the feet cook, rest the lid on top of the pan, angling it so that a small gap remains open.

, Carefully remove each finished chicken foot from the hot oil and transfer it to a plate or bowl lined with clean paper towels.


Note that you could also drain the chicken feet on brown paper bag material as long as it's clean prior to use.

, Fry and drain the remaining chicken feet in this manner, working in small batches.


You should only work with three to four feet at a time. When you add the feet to the oil, the temperature of the oil drops. As long as the pan is not overcrowded, the temperature drop shouldn't be too severe, but the oil a packed pot will cool and may not fry the legs correctly.

, In a large bowl, combine the boiling water, star anise, ginger, cinnamon stick, dried bay leaves, cloves, and salt. Stir the brine together until the salt fully dissolves.You can prepare the brine before or after frying the chicken, depending on whichever you find easier. If you prepare it beforehand, however, loosely cover it and let it sit aside at room temperature until you're ready to use it.

, Dunk the fried chicken feet in the bowl of chicken brine. Make sure that the brine evenly covers all the feet.

, Pour the rice wine and cold water into the same bowl as the brine and chicken feet, then stir gently to combine the ingredients.


The cold water should be nearly as cold as ice water. The low temperature will quickly drop the temperature of the brine and the chicken feet, thereby halting the cooking process.

, Loosely cover the bowl and place it in your refrigerator. Allow the brine to marinate the chicken feet for at least 2 hours.


After 2 hours pass, don't be alarmed if the chicken feet look puffy. This is normal and can actually improve the final texture of the dish.

, Pour the contents of the bowl through a colander. Set the chicken feet aside and discard the excess brine.

, Place the water, rice wine, star anise, spring onions, and ginger in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the broth to a steady boil., Carefully place the chicken feet into the boiling broth, lowering them directly into the water instead of dropping them from a height.


After adding the chicken feet to the braising broth, allow the liquid to reach a full boil again.
Once the braising broth reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low, dropping the broth to a gentle simmer.

, Partially cover the pan and allow the chicken feet to cook until they feet tender. This should take 1-1/2 to 2 hours.


Periodically check and stir the chicken feet as they cook in the braising broth.
When ready, you should be able to easily pierce through the fleshy side and straight to the bone using a standard fork.

, Strain the contents of the pan through a colander. Collect 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the cooking liquid and all of the chicken feet.


After reserving the 1/2 cup (125 ml) of liquid, discard the remaining broth.

, Place the 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved braising broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, black bean sauce, sugar, rice wine, white pepper, chile peppers, and garlic in a large wok. Place the pan on the stove over medium-high heat.


Stir and heat the sauce until it reaches a full boil, then reduce the heat to medium. Allow the sauce to continue simmering.

, While the sauce simmers, whisk together to 1 tsp (5 ml) of cornstarch and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of cold water until a thin slurry forms.


Immediately pour and whisk this slurry into the sauce. Continue whisking and simmering the sauce until the slurry is fully incorporated.

, Toss the chicken feet into the simmering sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the chicken feet are warm throughout.


Note that the sauce should also thicken during this time. When ready, it should be thick and sticky enough to cling to the feet.

, Transfer the sauce-covered chicken feet to serving platters and enjoy them immediately, if desired.

, If you want to give the flavors more time to blend together, you can refrigerate the chicken feet and reheat them the following day before serving.


Transfer the sauce-covered chicken feet to a steam-proof plate. As soon as they cool to room temperature, cover the plate and chill the chicken feet in your refrigerator.
The next day, set a steamer basket over a stockpot of boiling water and place the plate of chicken feet inside. Heat the chicken feet through for 10 to 15 minutes.
Serve the reheated chicken feet while they're still hot.

",How to Make Crispy Cream Cheese Wontons," Take ½ cup of cream cheese and let it sit out in room temperature for around thirty minutes to soften it a bit. Remove the end and top part off one green onion. If the green onion is a thick one, slice the thick stem in two. Now, finely mince the green onion and add ¼ cup of the minced green onion to the cream cheese. Add a few grinds of black pepper and salt and mix together thoroughly.

Alternatively, you can also opt for a sweet tasting filling using white onions and sugar.;
, Take a wonton wrapper and lay it in front of you and spread thinly about ½ to 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture in the middle of the wonton sheet. Take a little water (or egg paste) and coat the edges of the sheet with your finger. Fold over into a triangle, sealing all the edges securely. Continue filling and folding until you finish your cream cheese mixture.

, Heat your frying oil to 325-350ºF (160-175ºC). You will know when the oil is hot enough when you start to see smoke rising from the oil surface or little squiggly lines in the oil. Drop your wontons slowly into the hot oil. Since you can eat the cream cheese filling uncooked, you only need to fry the wontons until they turn golden brown. This might take about thirty to fifty seconds or up to two full minutes, depending on your oil temperature.

, Carefully remove the golden wontons and place on a paper towel to let the oil drain off. The wontons will still be cooking a few moments even after removing them from the oil. Once they dry off a bit, they are ready to eat and enjoy.

Prepare the pan before roasting the edamame. Liberally coat with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of olive oil to keep the edamame from burning. Since edamame has a slippery exterior, choose a pan that has sides. If the edamame slips toward the sides, this means the beans won’t end up in the oven.;
, Rinse the defrosted edamame in a colander under cold water. Drain all the water off the soybeans completely to ensure that they will crisp well in the oven.

, Ensure that the edamame is spread evenly throughout the pan, in a single layer. The beans should not be lumped on top of each other.

Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to drizzle over the top of the edamame. You may need more olive oil depending on the coverage. Coat each bean well in the oil so that the cheese, salt and pepper adheres evenly.






Sprinkle cheese over the top of the edamame. Be sure to hit every soybean with the Parmesan.






Add a dash of salt and pepper to taste. You may want to pull back on adding too much salt as the Parmesan cheese is already fairly salty.

If you cannot find teff (the main ingredient in injera), consider substituting barley or millet.,
If you cannot find a sourdough starter, either order one online, or make one yourself.,
If you don't have a mitad, use a plain old frying pan.,
Fix a mess of an injera.,
If the injera rips as you take it off, or wrinkles and turns into a blob of gunky mess, this probably has a lot to do with your still-burgeoning expertise at removing the injera.,
If your injera is burned on the bottom, but still gummy on top, this probably means that you have the pan too hot.,
If your injera aren't stretchy or absolutely won't come off the pan in one piece.,
If your injera has no bubbles, this suggests that kneading the dough affects the bubble content, and the baking powder has a lot to do with it.,
If your injera tastes funny.,
If your injera has deep grooves, tears, or cracks in it, this might be because you're using a wholewheat flour.,
If your injera is a complete disaster, turn it into something else and hide it.",How to Remedy Common Problems With Making Injera,"


If you can't find teff at your grocery store, first see if your city has a Whole Foods or a natural/health food store.
If even that is not available, then you can easily order teff online.;
, It's really not hard, and any sourdough starter will do for injera.

, But keep in mind, if you are using a pan that has edges that curve upwards, this might make it extra hard to get the injera off the pan. Remedy this by only making smaller, pancake sized injeras on frying pans, so that you have room to easily slip a pancake flipper underneath to get them off the pan.


If you'd like to buy a mitad, go to Target's webpage and get the Lefse grill. This is the exact grill seen in countless Ethiopian restaurants and videos. It might also be possible to buy a lid for this pan from the manufacturer, but you can make one by simply screwing a wood drawer nob onto a pizza pan. Cheap and it works!

, If it turns into a gummy blob when you try to take it off the pan, there are a couple things that might have gone wrong.


First, you might not be cooking the injera well enough. Make sure that the entire injera has darkened and the edges are slightly turning upwards and even a little crisp before you remove the injera. You might think you are overcooking them, but they actually do soften as they cool, so don't worry if your bottoms are a little crisp.
The second reason for gummy messiness is that your batter might be too watery. Simply add a little more wheat flour, and mix until the batter is smooth and evenly combined.

,


First, make sure you are using tools that will work for this. You need something wide and flat to quickly slip under the injera as you're taking them off. You can use a plastic cutting board or a wooden pizza tray for this, though most of the time, any old plate will do.
If you are still having problems, the best thing to do is to try making smaller injera until you get more skilled at them. Try making injera just the size of a pancake, so you can easily lift them off with a pancake flipper. You might also have more luck by either getting a proper mitad or using a pancake grill, since these won't have a side on the pan that will get in your way.

, Turn it down a couple degrees. Keep in mind also, that injera tends to be very gummy while it is still warm. Try letting it cool completely, and see if you like the texture better.

,


Are you sure you're using the right ingredients? It's very difficult to make injera out of 100% teff. Add equal parts white flour. Also, wholewheat flour will greatly affect the texture of your injera. If made with wholewheat and a little bit of vital wheat gluten, they will not have the same springy, stretchy texture that way.
Another reason that your injera might be in a death grip with your pan might have to do with the coating on your pan. A teflon pan works great. But keep in mind that you shouldn't be oiling the pan at all. Salt the pan first.
Injera acts very much like tortillas. If you have a nonstick pan, then nothing else should be necessary.

, Try adding a bit of baking powder to your batter and see if that improves things. If not, you might need to try kneading your dough more next time around.

, Injera is just a flat sourdough made out of teff. Just like sourdough, a lot of different factors can affect the taste of your bread. If the injera is not sour enough, then there could be something wrong with your starter. Smell it to see if it has a yeasty smell. If not, you might need to try again. If it does, you can easily make your injera more sour by giving your sourdough fewer regular feedings and increasing the amount of starter that you add to your recipe. Also, try putting a little less water in your starter during feedings, since this is generally known to result in a more sour sourdough. Finally, you can leave the injera batter out longer, to increase the sour taste.


If your injera has an odd taste, this also might be attributable to your starter. A super acidic starter might need to be kept at a colder temperature, and a starter containing yogurt might need to be kept a little warmer. Smell your starter, and start to teach yourself what it is supposed to smell like.
If the injera just tastes too sour overall, the best thing to do is to put less starter into your batter to begin with or to not let the batter sit out as long.

, Also, deep grooves can be the result of not properly covering the injera while it cooks. Try using a cover, and notice the difference in the surface texture. Finally, it could be that your batter is too thick or that you are pouring too much of it into the pan. Water it down a little or try using less, and see if this doesn't give a better texture.

, Why do you think timatim fitfit was invented? Just tear it into little pieces, and add some tomatoes, maybe some avocado, vinegar, salt, pepper, and oil. That's a little too delicious to be a complete disaster, wouldn't you say?


It's too bad this is a cuisine that we don't have a lot of access to. Making injera is not any harder than making bread or crepes, but more people make those, so we have more access to information and help. You'll get it in time though, and once you do, you'll be so happy you persevered! So put it away for a couple weeks, and try starting over from scratch the next time around. There is probably something you just missed in the steps or didn't think about the first time around, and when you start over, you'll figure out what it was that you did wrong. You will get it right eventually, and you'll probably learn a lot in the process. And trust me, once you've mastered injera, you can cook anything!

Allow your pot to warm up as you prepare the rest of the pap.If you have a gas stove, turn the heat down to medium, mid-low. A gas stove will heat up much faster than an electric stove.
You can use other types of pots as well such as steel or copper. However, aluminum pots will transfer heat more equitable throughout your dish.;
, You can use tap water or purified water. Pour in about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of water (500-600 mL). Allow the water to sit in the pot until it comes to boil. Add one teaspoon of salt to the water.Do not let the water boil over. If you have a low-standing pot, turn the heat down slightly or pour some of the water off into your sink.

, Maize meal is basically a South African version of grits and cornmeal. Add in about 2-3 cups of maize meal to the boiling water. Place the lid on the pot. Turn the heat down to medium.If you are using a gas stove, keep the heat at medium, mid-low.
You can use either rice or grits as a substitute for Maize meal.

, After you have let the maize meal simmer for five minutes, remove the lid. Stir the mixture so that the heat is distributed equally. You can add in a little butter for extra flavor. Replace the lid, and reduce the heat to low.You can use margarine as a substitute for butter.
The goal is to have the ingredients mixed well, without being either too thick or too thin. Take some maize meal in a spoon and drop back into the pot. If it slowly slides off your spoon, that is a good consistency.

, Only remove the lid once or twice to stir. Immediately replace the lid when you are done stirring. It might not take the full half hour to cook. Make sure to keep an eye on the pot so that your maize meal does not burn. If you feel as if the pot is getting too hot, you can slant the lid so that a small section allows hot air to go free. Let the lid stay slanted for a minute before you replace it.
You can also add some more butter here if you feel as if the consistency is too thin.

, Take the pot off of the burner and let it sit somewhere safe so that it can cool down. Do not remove the lid until you are ready to serve. Dish out the pap with a large spoon, and serve with meat and a vegetable.When you take the dish to the table, make sure to lay down a pot holder first, as the pot will be very hot.
It is best to let the contents of your pot to sit for a while. You want the ingredients to be very moist when you eat them. Removing the lid right away can cause your pap to dry out.

, Place them in a pan with two tablespoons of olive oil. Put the pan on the stovetop and turn the heat to medium, mid-high. Heat the onions until they are translucent. Continue to stir the onions so that the heat is distributed equally.You can use sweet white onions as a substitute for the red onions.
If you have a gas stove, turn the heat down to medium to mid-low as you stir the onions. Gas stoves heat much quicker than electric stoves.

, While the onions are frying, prepare a mixture in a bowl. The mixture includes: 20-30 halved baby rose tomatoes, 1/2 cup dry white wine, 2 teaspoons Worcester sauce, 3 tablespoons chopped herbs, 2 teaspoons brown sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and a tad bit of ground pepper. Mix together with your hands or a spoon.Be careful as to not crush the tomatoes. You will want the appearance of the tomatoes on your final dish.
The chopped herbs could include parsley, rosemary, basil, or thyme. Feel free to mix and match depending on your personal taste preferences.

, Once the onions are translucent, add the mixture. Stir with a spoon so that the onions mix together with the rest of the ingredients. Place a lid on the frying pan. Reduce the heat to low, mid-low.As you are stirring the mixture, feel free to add more olive oil if the ingredients start sticking to the pan.

, Do this for about one hour. Continue to stir the ingredients every 10 minutes or so, and immediately replace the lid. After the hour is up, turn the heat off.The most important thing is to not burn the ingredients, particularly the tomatoes. If at any time you feel as if the ingredients are done cooking, turn the heat off.

, Let it sit somewhere safe so that it can cool down. Take a spoon and pour it directly over, or next to, the pap. Garnish the dish with fresh herbs, like parsley, oregano, or basil., Peel an apple with a sharp knife, then grate it with a cheese grater. Finely chop an onion and crush a few garlic cloves. Mix the apple, onion, and garlic together in a bowl. Make sure all of the ingredients are equally distributed.The key here is to keep the ingredients from becoming ""mush."" As an example, you will want the consistency to be more like chunky tomato sauce, rather than ketchup.

, Place a pan on the stove, and pour in about two tablespoons of olive oil. Dump the ingredients into the pan once it is hot. Begin to stir them with a spoon so that all of the ingredients receive some heat.As you are stirring, feel free to add more olive oil if you feel as if the ingredients start to stick to the pan.
If you are using a gas stove, keep the heat at medium.

, Once the mixture starts to cook, add 1 tablespoon of sugar, a small jar of tomato sauce, and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Flavor the dish with pinches of salt and pepper. Continue to mix the ingredients together as you add them.Use a tomato sauce that is chunky as an added dimension to your dish.
If you are not a fan of soy sauce, you can use Worcestershire as a substitute.

, Turn your pan to low, mid-low. Let the ingredients heat up, as you continue to stir them every few minutes. Once the ten minutes is up, turn the stove off. Place the pan somewhere safe to cool down.As your ingredients are simmering, feel free to add olive oil if your ingredients start sticking.

Serve hot.",How to Make Dim Sum1," Fill a saucepan with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water and set it on your stove over medium to medium-high heat. Position your bamboo steamer over the pan.


There must be enough water to create steam, but the water level must not be high enough to touch the bottom of the steamer.
Use a bamboo steamer for the most traditional experience and taste. If you do not have a bamboo steamer, however, an ordinary steamer basket will also work.;
, Place the peeled, de-veined shrimp in a food processor and blend them into a puree or thick paste.


If you do not have a food processor, you can puree the shrimp using a blender or cut the shrimp into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) segments using a sharp knife. Note that the shrimp should still be uncooked.

, Transfer the shrimp to a large mixing bowl and add the water chestnuts, sesame oil, sake, mirin, soy sauce, salt, and white pepper. Mix thoroughly until evenly combined.


The water chestnuts should be minced into small pieces before you add them. Minced bamboo shoots can be used instead of the water chestnuts, or you could use a combination of the two if you'd prefer both flavors.
Other substitutions you can make include dry sherry instead of sake, sugar instead of mirin, and black bean garlic sauce instead of soy sauce.

, Separate the wrappers and spread them out over a clean counter or table. You should need 16 wrappers for this recipe.


Ready-made dumpling wrappers work best for this recipe, but you can use wonton skins of you cannot find dumpling wrappers. Since wonton skins are square instead of circular, however, you'll need to round off the corners before filling them., Spoon a small dollop of shrimp filling into the center of each dumpling wrapper.


You should only use approximately 1 tsp (5 ml) of filling for each wrapper. If you use too much, the ends won't be able to seal correctly and the dumpling will open as it cooks.

, Fold the wrappers over the filling to create half-circles. Firmly press the edges together to seal the wrappers.


If the ends won't stick together, wet your fingers with clean water and lighten dampen the edges before trying again.
You should also crimp the edges using a fork or similar utensil to help hold the seal.

, Place the dumplings into the steamer in a single layer. Cover the basket and steam for 4 to 7 minutes.


You should be able to see the shrimp filling through the thin wrapper. Wait for the shrimp to change in color from translucent gray to opaque pink and white.

, Remove the finished dumplings from the steam and let them rest for 3 minutes. Serve while still hot.

, Dice both ingredients into fine pieces. Combine the pork with the soy sauce and ginger in a small bowl. Toss the shrimp with half the salt in another dry bowl.


Before dicing the shrimp, it should be peeled and de-veined. You should also rinse it in clean water and dry it on clean paper towels.

, Whisk together the cornstarch, sesame oil, rice wine, water, pepper, and remaining salt in a small bowl until thoroughly and evenly combined.


Rice wine will produce the most traditional flavor, but sherry can be used if rice wine is unavailable.

, Pour the canola oil into a small skillet and set the pan on your stove over medium heat.

, Add the pork and shrimp to the hot oil and stir-fry until both ingredients are fully cooked.


Use your spatula to further break up the pork into crumbles as it cooks.
Both the pork and shrimp must be completely cooked before you continue.

, Pour the sauce into the pan and sprinkle in the diced green onions. Continue to cook the mixture for another few minutes, stirring frequently.


Wait until the sauce thickens before you continue. It may need to reach a simmer before adequate thickening occurs.

, Pour the filling into a small bowl. Let it cool slightly at room temperature, then cover the bowl and refrigerate the filling for at least 2 hours.


Meanwhile, prepare the dough as the filling chills.

, Peel the taro root and use a sharp knife to cut it into 1-inch to 2-inch (2.5-cm to 5-cm) square pieces.


Note that you should remove the tough outer layer of flesh along with the skin as you peel the taro.
Also note that thinner pieces of taro will cook faster than thicker pieces.

, Place the taro root in a steamer basket set over simmering water. Cover and cook until the pieces become soft.


Fill the bottom saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water before placing the steamer on top. You need enough water to create steam, but the water should not be high enough to reach through the steamer.

, Place the wheat starch in a medium bowl and gradually pour the boiling water into it, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to combine the two ingredients into a paste.


Stop adding water as soon as the mixture matches the appearance and texture of frosting. Loosely cover the bowl and set it aside.
You really should use wheat starch for this dough if at all possible. Use tapioca flour in a pinch, but know that the final appearance and consistency will vary slightly if you do.

, Let the taro cool for about 5 minutes, then transfer it to a separate bowl. Use your fingers or a fork to mash the taro into a thick puree.


Discard any pieces that still feel hard.

, Place 1 cup (250 ml) of mashed taro into the wheat starch mixture. Add the salt and sugar, as well, and mix with your fingers until evenly blended. Add the lard or shortening after that.


Work the lard into the dough using your fingers. You'll need to knead the dough for several minutes, or until it takes on the consistency of mashed potatoes.

, Gather the dough into a ball and cover it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 to 2 hours.

, Roll the dough into a 12-inch (30.5-cm) log and cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.


If the dough seems warm and soft after you finish rolling out the pieces, chill the dough balls for another 10 to 15 minutes before continuing.

, Flatten each dough ball into an oblong circle and use your fingers to form it into the shape of a bowl, with a shallow indentation in the center.


It might be easiest to form and fill each dumpling one at a time instead of trying to shape the wrappers all at once.

, Place 1 tsp (5 ml) of filling in the center of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper around the filling and pinch the edges in place.


Each dumpling should be shaped like an egg or almond.
Use excess dough to patch any holes that develop as you form the dumplings.

, Pour 2 inches (5 cm) of canola oil or peanut oil into a heavy saucepan with deep sides. Heat over medium-high until the oil reaches a temperature between 360 and 370 degrees Fahrenheit (182 to 188 degrees Celsius).


Test the temperature using a cooking thermometer. The oil must be hot enough before you add the dumplings; otherwise, the dough will fall apart as it cooks.

, Add the dumplings to the hot oil and fry until they turn golden-brown.


Avoid crowding the pan by only cooking two or three dumplings at a time.
Once the dumplings begin to float, reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking them.
After 2 or 3 minutes, the dumplings should be done.

, Remove the dumplings from the hot oil and let them drain on clean paper towels for several minutes. Serve them while they're still hot.

",How to Make Asian Style Coconut Sago,"






;
, If the water is all absorbed (unlikely) add extra.








, This is VITAL for a chilled sago dessert! If you did not rinse it earlier - rinse it now.








, The coconut milk should be almost twice the volume of the sago. The ratio of liquid to sago should be 2:1 or similar to that when cooking rice. You can add a little water if you need to.








, Stir every 3 -4 minutes. If the sago has absorbed all the coconut milk but is not yet completely transparent, add more (or water, but you do not want to add very much water since the creaminess of this dessert comes from the coconut). Extra liquid can be drained off, but too little will result in a gluey (but still delicious!) dessert. The picture shows how your sago will look when done - transparent with a small white core. If you are unsure, taste the sago!









Microwaving your sago is not only quicker - it means you CANNOT burn your dessert. Nothing is more annoying then burning your sago after 30 mins of simmering on the stove!

, You should still have a liquid when the sago pearls are done.








, Palm sugar is the traditional sort, but any sugar or even artificial sweetener will work. You will need less then you think, since the creaminess of the coconut milk will add some sweetness. For this reason this recipe can make a really delicious honest low fat / calorie dessert.

, First, cut the tortillas in 8 wedges. They should look like slices of pie. Fry them in batches and turn them over with a skimmer or a slotted spoon to keep them from sticking. Keep going until they're golden brown, for about 2-3 minutes. Then remove the chips and place them on a paper towel to let them cool.

, Raise the heat of the salsa verde to medium and stir in the eggs you've beaten once the sauce starts to bubble. After about five seconds, once the eggs feather into the sauce, add the tortilla chips. Toss them gently until they've absorbed enough sauce to become soft. Sprinkle Jack cheese over the tops of the chilaquiles and let it melt.

, Sprinkle the chilaquiles with queso fresco, cilantro, and chopped onion. Drizzle them with crema fresca and serve them immediately.
